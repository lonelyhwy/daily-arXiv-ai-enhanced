### [1] [Non-Markov Multi-Round Conversational Image Generation with History-Conditioned MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20911)
*Haochen Zhang,Animesh Sinha,Felix Juefei-Xu,Haoyu Ma,Kunpeng Li,Zhipeng Fan,Meng Dong,Xiaoliang Dai,Tingbo Hou,Peizhao Zhang,Zecheng He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper targets non-Markov conversational image generation, proposing strategies for data construction, training methods, and improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of non-Markov interactions in conversational image generation, where users may reference earlier states or undo changes, current MLLMs fall short due to reliance on recent history.

Method: The authors introduce non-Markov multi-round data construction (rollback-style editing and name-based personalization), a history-conditioned training framework with token-level caching, and enhancements like a DiT detokenizer and fine-tuning curriculum.

Result: Explicit training for non-Markov interactions improves multi-round consistency and instruction compliance while preserving single-round capabilities like editing and personalization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the non-Markov challenge, enhancing multi-round conversational image generation.

Abstract: Conversational image generation requires a model to follow user instructions across multiple rounds of interaction, grounded in interleaved text and images that accumulate as chat history. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can generate and edit images, most existing multi-turn benchmarks and training recipes are effectively Markov: the next output depends primarily on the most recent image, enabling shortcut solutions that ignore long-range history. In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum. We demonstrate that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization.

*Xuehua Ye,Hongxu Yang,Adam J. Schwarz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel text-guided denoising method using CLIP and U-Net improves PET image quality by reducing noise across various count levels, showing potential for broader applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET images often suffer from noise that obscures diagnostic information due to factors like scanner hardware and acquisition time, necessitating effective denoising solutions.

Method: Combines features from a pretrained CLIP model with a U-Net based denoising model for PET image enhancement.

Result: Significant improvements in qualitative and quantitative assessments, with flexibility for varied denoising needs or reduced acquisition time.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively enhances PET images and shows promise for addressing complex denoising challenges.

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging is a vital tool in medical diagnostics, offering detailed insights into molecular processes within the human body. However, PET images often suffer from complicated noise, which can obscure critical diagnostic information. The quality of the PET image is impacted by various factors including scanner hardware, image reconstruction, tracer properties, dose/count level, and acquisition time. In this study, we propose a novel text-guided denoising method capable of enhancing PET images across a wide range of count levels within a single model. The model utilized the features from a pretrained CLIP model with a U-Net based denoising model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model leads significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative assessments. The flexibility of the model shows the potential for helping more complicated denoising demands or reducing the acquisition time.

### [3] [Low performing pixel correction in computed tomography with unrolled network and synthetic data training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20995)
*Hongxu Yang,Levente Lippenszky,Edina Timko,Lehel Ferenczi,Gopal Avinash*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an unrolled dual-domain method using synthetic data to correct low performance pixel artifacts in CT images, outperforming existing methods without needing real clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low performance pixels cause artifacts in CT images, and existing solutions require costly real datasets or focus only on one domain.

Method: Uses synthetic data from natural images to train a model correcting artifacts in both sinogram and image domains, leveraging CT geometry correlations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in simulated scenarios with 1-2% detector defects, especially near the isocenter.

Conclusion: The solution effectively corrects artifacts without real data costs and adapts to various scanner settings.

Abstract: Low performance pixels (LPP) in Computed Tomography (CT) detectors would lead to ring and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, making them clinically unusable. In recent years, several solutions have been proposed to correct LPP artifacts, either in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, which are expensive to collect. Moreover, existing approaches focus solely either on image-space or sinogram-space correction, ignoring the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. In this work, we propose an unrolled dual-domain method based on synthetic data to correct LPP artifacts. Specifically, the intrinsic correlations of LPP between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data generated from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring any real-world clinical data. In experiments simulating 1-2% detectors defect near the isocenter, the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. The results indicate that our solution can correct LPP artifacts without the cost of data collection for model training, and it is adaptable to different scanner settings for software-based applications.

### [4] [AI-based Prediction of Biochemical Recurrence from Biopsy and Prostatectomy Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21022)
*Andrea Camilloni,Chiara Micoli,Nita Mulliqi,Erik Everett Palm,Thorgerdur Palsdottir,Kelvin Szolnoky,Xiaoyi Ji,Sol Erika Boman,Andrea Discacciati,Henrik Grönberg,Lars Egevad,Tobias Nordström,Kimmo Kartasalo,Martin Eklund*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An AI model trained on prostate biopsy slides predicts biochemical recurrence risk post-radical prostatectomy, showing generalizability across cohorts and incremental improvement over existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prognostic tools for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy are imprecise, necessitating better predictive methods.

Method: AI-based model using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning, trained on biopsy slides and validated across external cohorts.

Result: Achieved 5-year AUCs of 0.64-0.70 across cohorts. Integration with clinical variables improved risk stratification.

Conclusion: Biopsy-trained AI can generalize and aid decision-making, but further studies are needed to evaluate its added value over simpler models.

Abstract: Biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP) is a surrogate marker for aggressive prostate cancer with adverse outcomes, yet current prognostic tools remain imprecise. We trained an AI-based model on diagnostic prostate biopsy slides from the STHLM3 cohort (n = 676) to predict patient-specific risk of BCR, using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning. Generalizability was assessed across three external RP cohorts: LEOPARD (n = 508), CHIMERA (n = 95), and TCGA-PRAD (n = 379). The image-based approach achieved 5-year time-dependent AUCs of 0.64, 0.70, and 0.70, respectively. Integrating clinical variables added complementary prognostic value and enabled statistically significant risk stratification. Compared with guideline-based CAPRA-S, AI incrementally improved postoperative prognostication. These findings suggest biopsy-trained histopathology AI can generalize across specimen types to support preoperative and postoperative decision making, but the added value of AI-based multimodal approaches over simpler predictive models should be critically scrutinized in further studies.

### [5] [BadDet+: Robust Backdoor Attacks for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21066)
*Kealan Dunnett,Reza Arablouei,Dimity Miller,Volkan Dedeoglu,Raja Jurdak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BadDet+ is a penalty-based framework addressing weaknesses in existing backdoor attacks for object detection, ensuring robustness and invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks lack realistic assumptions and physical validation in object detection, prompting the need for BadDet+.

Method: BadDet+ uses a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, enabling position/scale invariance and physical robustness.

Result: BadDet+ outperforms baselines in synthetic-to-physical transfer and maintains clean performance.

Conclusion: The study reveals vulnerabilities in object detection and emphasizes the need for specialized defenses.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a severe threat to deep learning, yet their impact on object detection remains poorly understood compared to image classification. While attacks have been proposed, we identify critical weaknesses in existing detection-based methods, specifically their reliance on unrealistic assumptions and a lack of physical validation. To bridge this gap, we introduce BadDet+, a penalty-based framework that unifies Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA). The core mechanism utilizes a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, resulting in (i) position and scale invariance, and (ii) enhanced physical robustness. On real-world benchmarks, BadDet+ achieves superior synthetic-to-physical transfer compared to existing RMA and ODA baselines while preserving clean performance. Theoretical analysis confirms the proposed penalty acts within a trigger-specific feature subspace, reliably inducing attacks without degrading standard inference. These results highlight significant vulnerabilities in object detection and the necessity for specialized defenses.

### [6] [Towards Mitigating Modality Bias in Vision-Language Models for Temporal Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21078)
*Jiaqi Li,Guangming Wang,Shuntian Zheng,Minzhe Ni,Xiaoman Lu,Guanghui Ye,Yu Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ActionVLM is a vision-language framework for Temporal Action Localization that balances visual and linguistic inputs to reduce modality bias, outperforming existing methods by up to 3.2% mAP on THUMOS14.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TAL approaches overly rely on linguistic priors, causing modality bias and weakening visual performance. ActionVLM aims to correct this imbalance.

Method: The framework includes a debiasing reweighting module to dynamically adjust language contributions and a residual aggregation strategy to treat language as a refinement rather than the main signal.

Result: ActionVLM achieves superior performance, surpassing state-of-the-art models by up to 3.2% mAP on THUMOS14.

Conclusion: ActionVLM effectively mitigates modality bias by prioritizing visual signals and adaptively using language, leading to improved temporal reasoning and accuracy in TAL.

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) requires identifying both the boundaries and categories of actions in untrimmed videos. While vision-language models (VLMs) offer rich semantics to complement visual evidence, existing approaches tend to overemphasize linguistic priors at the expense of visual performance, leading to a pronounced modality bias. We propose ActionVLM, a vision-language aggregation framework that systematically mitigates modality bias in TAL. Our key insight is to preserve vision as the dominant signal while adaptively exploiting language only when beneficial. To this end, we introduce (i) a debiasing reweighting module that estimates the language advantage-the incremental benefit of language over vision-only predictions-and dynamically reweights language modality accordingly, and (ii) a residual aggregation strategy that treats language as a complementary refinement rather than the primary driver. This combination alleviates modality bias, reduces overconfidence from linguistic priors, and strengthens temporal reasoning. Experiments on THUMOS14 show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art by up to 3.2% mAP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Shape-of-Thought (SoT), a visual Chain-of-Thought framework for improving compositional text-to-image generation by enabling progressive shape assembly through coherent 2D projections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing brittleness in multimodal models for text-to-image generation under compositional constraints like generative numeracy, attribute binding, and part-level relations.

Method: SoT trains a unified multimodal autoregressive model to generate interleaved textual plans and rendered intermediate states, avoiding explicit geometric representations.

Result: Fine-tuning on the SoT-26K dataset achieves 88.4% on component numeracy and 84.8% on structural topology, outperforming text-only baselines by ~20%.

Conclusion: SoT establishes a new paradigm for transparent, process-supervised compositional generation, supported by the SoT-26K dataset and T2S-CompBench benchmark.

Abstract: Multimodal models for text-to-image generation have achieved strong visual fidelity, yet they remain brittle under compositional structural constraints-notably generative numeracy, attribute binding, and part-level relations. To address these challenges, we propose Shape-of-Thought (SoT), a visual CoT framework that enables progressive shape assembly via coherent 2D projections without external engines at inference time. SoT trains a unified multimodal autoregressive model to generate interleaved textual plans and rendered intermediate states, helping the model capture shape-assembly logic without producing explicit geometric representations. To support this paradigm, we introduce SoT-26K, a large-scale dataset of grounded assembly traces derived from part-based CAD hierarchies, and T2S-CompBench, a benchmark for evaluating structural integrity and trace faithfulness. Fine-tuning on SoT-26K achieves 88.4% on component numeracy and 84.8% on structural topology, outperforming text-only baselines by around 20%. SoT establishes a new paradigm for transparent, process-supervised compositional generation. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/16FE/. The SoT-26K dataset will be released upon acceptance.

### [8] [An AI Framework for Microanastomosis Motion Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21120)
*Yan Meng,Eduardo J. Torres-Rodríguez,Marcelle Altshuler,Nishanth Gowda,Arhum Naeem,Recai Yilmaz,Omar Arnaout,Daniel A. Donoho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an AI framework for automated, objective assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling skills, addressing limitations of traditional subjective evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for standardized, objective assessment methods in microsurgery due to the limitations of subjective expert evaluations, such as variability and bias.

Method: The proposed AI framework includes instrument detection (YOLO), tracking (DeepSORT), tip localization (shape descriptors), and a supervised classification module trained on expert-labeled data.

Result: The system achieves high precision (97%) and mean Average Precision (96%) in instrument detection, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reliable, scalable solution for assessing microsurgical skills, overcoming the drawbacks of traditional methods.

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a fundamental competency across multiple microsurgical disciplines. These procedures demand exceptional precision and refined technical skills, making effective, standardized assessment methods essential. Traditionally, the evaluation of microsurgical techniques has relied heavily on the subjective judgment of expert raters. They are inherently constrained by limitations such as inter-rater variability, lack of standardized evaluation criteria, susceptibility to cognitive bias, and the time-intensive nature of manual review. These shortcomings underscore the urgent need for an objective, reliable, and automated system capable of assessing microsurgical performance with consistency and scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AI framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling skills. The system integrates four core components: (1) an instrument detection module based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture; (2) an instrument tracking module developed from Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (DeepSORT); (3) an instrument tip localization module employing shape descriptors; and (4) a supervised classification module trained on expert-labeled data to evaluate instrument handling proficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, achieving an instrument detection precision of 97%, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96%, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 50% to 95% (mAP50-95).

### [9] [Bidirectional Cross-Perception for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21159)
*Jianzheng Wang,Huan Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDCI introduces a dual-branch framework with cross-model attention fusion and bidirectional cross-graph diffusion to improve training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation in high-resolution remote sensing imagery, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution remote sensing imagery's dense and complex objects challenge existing training-free OVSS methods, prompting the need for better geometric and semantic prediction.

Method: SDCI uses cross-model attention fusion (CAF), bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR), and superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) for enhanced segmentation.

Result: SDCI outperforms existing methods on remote sensing benchmarks and confirms superpixel structures' effectiveness in deep learning frameworks.

Conclusion: SDCI's collaborative inference framework effectively addresses challenges in high-resolution remote sensing imagery, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing imagery is characterized by densely distributed land-cover objects and complex boundaries, which places higher demands on both geometric localization and semantic prediction. Existing training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) methods typically fuse CLIP and vision foundation models (VFMs) using "one-way injection" and "shallow post-processing" strategies, making it difficult to satisfy these requirements. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-regularization-aware dual-branch collaborative inference framework for training-free OVSS, termed SDCI. First, during feature encoding, SDCI introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, which guides collaborative inference by injecting self-attention maps into each other. Second, we propose a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances the reliability of dual-branch segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion. Finally, we incorporate low-level superpixel structures and develop a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to further refine object boundaries. Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing approaches. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm that traditional object-based remote sensing image analysis methods leveraging superpixel structures remain effective within deep learning frameworks.

*Yuji Lin,Qian Zhao,Zongsheng Yue,Junhui Hou,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoDiff-LF, a diffusion-based framework, enhances underwater 4-D light field imaging by integrating spatial-angular structure, achieving superior visual and quantitative results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of acquiring high-quality underwater images using 4-D light field imaging, which often suffers from color distortion and structural irregularities.

Method: The framework includes a modified U-Net with adapters, a geometry-guided loss function, and an optimized sampling strategy to leverage diffusion priors and light field geometry.

Result: GeoDiff-LF outperforms existing methods in visual fidelity and quantitative metrics, effectively mitigating color distortion in underwater scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework sets a new benchmark for underwater imaging enhancement, with plans to make the code publicly available for further research.

Abstract: This work studies the challenging problem of acquiring high-quality underwater images via 4-D light field (LF) imaging. To this end, we propose GeoDiff-LF, a novel diffusion-based framework built upon SD-Turbo to enhance underwater 4-D LF imaging by leveraging its spatial-angular structure. GeoDiff-LF consists of three key adaptations: (1) a modified U-Net architecture with convolutional and attention adapters to model geometric cues, (2) a geometry-guided loss function using tensor decomposition and progressive weighting to regularize global structure, and (3) an optimized sampling strategy with noise prediction to improve efficiency. By integrating diffusion priors and LF geometry, GeoDiff-LF effectively mitigates color distortion in underwater scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods across both visual fidelity and quantitative performance, advancing the state-of-the-art in enhancing underwater imaging. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/linlos1234/GeoDiff-LF.

### [11] [Generative Recall, Dense Reranking: Learning Multi-View Semantic IDs for Efficient Text-to-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21193)
*Zecheng Zhao,Zhi Chen,Zi Huang,Shazia Sadiq,Tong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRDR improves recall quality in two-stage text-to-video retrieval by assigning multiple semantic IDs to videos and aligning them with text queries, achieving high accuracy with reduced storage and faster retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of generative retrieval (GR) as a recall model in two-stage TVR, specifically semantic ambiguity and cross-modal misalignment, to enhance candidate quality without sacrificing efficiency.

Method: GRDR introduces a query-guided multi-view tokenizer to assign multiple semantic IDs to each video, enabling diverse semantic access paths. It jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever using a shared codebook to align IDs with text and video semantics.

Result: Experiments show GRDR matches dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing storage by an order of magnitude and speeding up retrieval by up to 300x.

Conclusion: GRDR successfully improves recall quality in two-stage TVR, balancing accuracy, storage efficiency, and retrieval speed.

Abstract: Text-to-Video Retrieval (TVR) is essential in video platforms. Dense retrieval with dual-modality encoders leads in accuracy, but its computation and storage scale poorly with corpus size. Thus, real-time large-scale applications adopt two-stage retrieval, where a fast recall model gathers a small candidate pool, which is reranked by an advanced dense retriever. Due to hugely reduced candidates, the reranking model can use any off-the-shelf dense retriever without hurting efficiency, meaning the recall model bounds two-stage TVR performance. Recently, generative retrieval (GR) replaces dense video embeddings with discrete semantic IDs and retrieves by decoding text queries into ID tokens. GR offers near-constant inference and storage complexity, and its semantic IDs capture high-level video features via quantization, making it ideal for quickly eliminating irrelevant candidates during recall. However, as a recall model in two-stage TVR, GR suffers from (i) semantic ambiguity, where each video satisfies diverse queries but is forced into one semantic ID; and (ii) cross-modal misalignment, as semantic IDs are solely derived from visual features without text supervision. We propose Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), designing a novel GR method to uplift recalled candidate quality. GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs to each video using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer exposing diverse semantic access paths, and jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever via a shared codebook to cast semantic IDs as the semantic bridge between texts and videos. At inference, trie-constrained decoding generates a compact candidate set reranked by a dense model for fine-grained matching. Experiments on TVR benchmarks show GRDR matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and accelerating up to 300$\times$ in full-corpus retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Thinker, a vision-language model, addresses robotics challenges like perspective confusion and video-end oversight by leveraging a specialized dataset and a key-frame input approach, achieving top benchmark results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve common errors in large vision-language models applied to robotics, such as perspective confusion and temporal reasoning gaps.

Method: Builds a robotic-focused dataset and uses key frames alongside full videos for enhanced comprehension.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for task planning.

Conclusion: Thinker effectively bridges gaps in robotics applications by improving video and perspective understanding.

Abstract: When large vision-language models are applied to the field of robotics, they encounter problems that are simple for humans yet error-prone for models. Such issues include confusion between third-person and first-person perspectives and a tendency to overlook information in video endings during temporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Thinker, a large vision-language foundation model designed for embodied intelligence. We tackle the aforementioned issues from two perspectives. Firstly, we construct a large-scale dataset tailored for robotic perception and reasoning, encompassing ego-view videos, visual grounding, spatial understanding, and chain-of-thought data. Secondly, we introduce a simple yet effective approach that substantially enhances the model's capacity for video comprehension by jointly incorporating key frames and full video sequences as inputs. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on two of the most commonly used benchmark datasets in the field of task planning.

### [13] [LAMP: Learning Universal Adversarial Perturbations for Multi-Image Tasks via Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21220)
*Alvi Md Ishmam,Najibul Haque Sarker,Zaber Ibn Abdul Hakim,Chris Thomas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAMP is a black-box adversarial attack method targeting multi-image MLLMs, using attention-based and cross-image constraints to disrupt model performance without requiring all inputs to be modified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While MLLMs excel in vision-language tasks, their vulnerabilities in multi-image settings remain unexplored. Existing attacks are limited to single-image scenarios and impractical white-box models.

Method: LAMP employs attention-based constraints, a cross-image contagious constraint, and an index-attention suppression loss to create Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs).

Result: LAMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high attack success rates across various tasks and models.

Conclusion: LAMP effectively exposes vulnerabilities in multi-image MLLMs, demonstrating the need for robust defenses against such black-box adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across vision-language tasks. Recent advancements allow these models to process multiple images as inputs. However, the vulnerabilities of multi-image MLLMs remain unexplored. Existing adversarial attacks focus on single-image settings and often assume a white-box threat model, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper introduces LAMP, a black-box method for learning Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) targeting multi-image MLLMs. LAMP applies an attention-based constraint that prevents the model from effectively aggregating information across images. LAMP also introduces a novel cross-image contagious constraint that forces perturbed tokens to influence clean tokens, spreading adversarial effects without requiring all inputs to be modified. Additionally, an index-attention suppression loss enables a robust position-invariant attack. Experimental results show that LAMP outperforms SOTA baselines and achieves the highest attack success rates across multiple vision-language tasks and models.

### [14] [PTQ4ARVG: Post-Training Quantization for AutoRegressive Visual Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21238)
*Xuewen Liu,Zhikai Li,Jing Zhang,Mengjuan Chen,Qingyi Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PTQ4ARVG proposes a training-free quantization framework addressing channel-wise outliers, token-wise variance, and sample-wise distribution mismatch in ARVG models, achieving efficient 8-bit and 6-bit quantization with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to AutoRegressive Visual Generation (ARVG) models due to challenges like channel-wise outliers, token-wise variance, and sample-wise distribution mismatch. Addressing these issues can enhance ARVG model efficiency.

Method: PTQ4ARVG includes Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) for channel-wise outliers, Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) for token-wise variance, and Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) for sample-wise mismatch—all without requiring additional training.

Result: PTQ4ARVG successfully quantizes ARVG models to 8-bit and 6-bit, maintaining competitive performance in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed PTQ4ARVG framework effectively addresses quantization challenges for ARVG models, enabling efficient deployment without compromising performance.

Abstract: AutoRegressive Visual Generation (ARVG) models retain an architecture compatible with language models, while achieving performance comparable to diffusion-based models. Quantization is commonly employed in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to ARVG remains largely underexplored, and existing quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to ARVG models. In this paper, we explore this issue and identify three key challenges: (1) severe outliers at channel-wise level, (2) highly dynamic activations at token-wise level, and (3) mismatched distribution information at sample-wise level. To these ends, we propose PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates the channel-wise outliers, which expands the quantization loss via a Taylor series to quantify the gain of scaling for activation-weight quantization, and derives the optimal scaling factor through differentiation.(2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages the inherent properties of ARVG, fixed token length and position-invariant distribution across samples, to address token-wise variance without incurring dynamic calibration overhead.(3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples that contribute most to distributional entropy, eliminating the sample-wise distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments show that PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize the ARVG family models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance.

*Zhen Wang,Hongyi Liu,Jianing Li,Zhihui Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NFCDS improves diffusion sampling-based Plug-and-Play methods by controlling noise frequency, enhancing fidelity without sacrificing perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion sampling-based PnP methods often introduce noise during reverse diffusion, reducing data fidelity. This paper aims to address the fidelity-perception trade-off.

Method: Proposes Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a spectral modulation mechanism that suppresses low-frequency noise and preserves high-frequency content using a Fourier-domain filter.

Result: NFCDS enables fast convergence to high-fidelity and perceptually convincing results without additional training, integrating seamlessly into existing frameworks.

Conclusion: NFCDS effectively balances fidelity and perception across diverse zero-shot tasks, mitigating the drawbacks of traditional diffusion sampling.

Abstract: Diffusion sampling-based Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods produce images with high perceptual quality but often suffer from reduced data fidelity, primarily due to the noise introduced during reverse diffusion. To address this trade-off, we propose Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a spectral modulation mechanism for reverse diffusion noise. We show that the fidelity-perception conflict can be fundamentally understood through noise frequency: low-frequency components induce blur and degrade fidelity, while high-frequency components drive detail generation. Based on this insight, we design a Fourier-domain filter that progressively suppresses low-frequency noise and preserves high-frequency content. This controlled refinement injects a data-consistency prior directly into sampling, enabling fast convergence to results that are both high-fidelity and perceptually convincing--without additional training. As a PnP module, NFCDS seamlessly integrates into existing diffusion-based restoration frameworks and improves the fidelity-perception balance across diverse zero-shot tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised learning methods rely on global regularization to prevent representation collapse, but Hypersolid offers a novel approach.

Method: Hypersolid treats representation learning as a discrete packing problem, using short-range hard-ball repulsion to maintain injectivity and prevent local collisions.

Result: Hypersolid achieves high-separation geometric regimes, preserving augmentation diversity and excelling in fine-grained and low-resolution classification tasks.

Conclusion: Hypersolid's innovative approach to representation learning outperforms traditional global regularization methods.

Abstract: A recurring challenge in self-supervised learning is preventing representation collapse. Existing solutions typically rely on global regularization, such as maximizing distances, decorrelating dimensions or enforcing certain distributions. We instead reinterpret representation learning as a discrete packing problem, where preserving information simplifies to maintaining injectivity. We operationalize this in Hypersolid, a method using short-range hard-ball repulsion to prevent local collisions. This constraint results in a high-separation geometric regime that preserves augmentation diversity, excelling on fine-grained and low-resolution classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of achieving high-fidelity 3D talking face representation at low bitrates, where traditional 2D compression and implicit neural rendering methods fall short.

Method: Integrates FLAME-based parametric modeling with 3DGS neural rendering, transmitting only essential facial metadata and employing Gaussian attribute compression and MLP optimization for efficiency.

Result: Achieves superior rate-distortion performance, enabling high-quality facial rendering at extremely low bitrates.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for real-time 3D video conferencing, balancing fidelity and bitrate efficiency.

Abstract: The demand for immersive and interactive communication has driven advancements in 3D video conferencing, yet achieving high-fidelity 3D talking face representation at low bitrates remains a challenge. Traditional 2D video compression techniques fail to preserve fine-grained geometric and appearance details, while implicit neural rendering methods like NeRF suffer from prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight, high-fidelity, low-bitrate 3D talking face compression framework that integrates FLAME-based parametric modeling with 3DGS neural rendering. Our approach transmits only essential facial metadata in real time, enabling efficient reconstruction with a Gaussian-based head model. Additionally, we introduce a compact representation and compression scheme, including Gaussian attribute compression and MLP optimization, to enhance transmission efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior rate-distortion performance, delivering high-quality facial rendering at extremely low bitrates, making it well-suited for real-time 3D video conferencing applications.

### [18] [GeoRC: A Benchmark for Geolocation Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21278)
*Mohit Talreja,Joshua Diao,Jim Thannikary James,Radu Casapu,Tejas Santanam,Ethan Mendes,Alan Ritter,Wei Xu,James Hays*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains in Vision Language Models (VLMs), highlighting their poor performance in explaining predictions compared to human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs excel at geolocation prediction but often fail to provide accurate explanations (reasoning chains) for their predictions, sometimes hallucinating details. This gap motivated the creation of a benchmark to evaluate and improve VLM reasoning.

Method: The authors created a benchmark using 500 query scenes from Google Street View (via GeoGuessr), collaborating with expert players to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains. They evaluated VLMs and LLMs as judges to score reasoning chains.

Result: Large, closed-source VLMs (e.g., Gemini, GPT 5) match human experts in prediction but lag in reasoning chain quality. Open-weight VLMs (e.g., Llama, Qwen) perform poorly. Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlated best with human scoring.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals VLMs' limitations in extracting fine-grained visual attributes for reasoning, showing a significant gap between human experts and current models.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are good at recognizing the global location of a photograph -- their geolocation prediction accuracy rivals the best human experts. But many VLMs are startlingly bad at explaining which image evidence led to their prediction, even when their location prediction is correct. The reasoning chains produced by VLMs frequently hallucinate scene attributes to support their location prediction (e.g. phantom writing, imagined infrastructure, misidentified flora). In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes. These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains. Open weights VLMs such as Llama and Qwen catastrophically fail on our benchmark -- they perform only slightly better than a baseline in which an LLM hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle knowledge of the photo location but no visual information at all. We believe the gap between human experts and VLMs on this task points to VLM limitations at extracting fine-grained visual attributes from high resolution images.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-modal framework combining video, geometric features, and PCI signals for accurate antenna affiliation identification, introducing Token Entropy Regularization to improve alignment and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manual tower inspections are cumbersome and error-prone, necessitating a more efficient and accurate solution for antenna affiliation identification.

Method: The approach integrates video footage, antenna geometric features, and PCI signals into multi-modal classification and matching tasks, using a novel Token Entropy Regularization module for better cross-modal alignment.

Result: Experiments show TER accelerates convergence and improves performance, with the first token's entropy being modality-dependent.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges of multi-modal alignment in antenna identification, offering significant performance gains.

Abstract: Accurate antenna affiliation identification is crucial for optimizing and maintaining communication networks. Current practice, however, relies on the cumbersome and error-prone process of manual tower inspections. We propose a novel paradigm shift that fuses video footage of base stations, antenna geometric features, and Physical Cell Identity (PCI) signals, transforming antenna affiliation identification into multi-modal classification and matching tasks. Publicly available pretrained transformers struggle with this unique task due to a lack of analogous data in the communications domain, which hampers cross-modal alignment. To address this, we introduce a dedicated training framework that aligns antenna images with corresponding PCI signals. To tackle the representation alignment challenge, we propose a novel Token Entropy Regularization module in the pretraining stage. Our experiments demonstrate that TER accelerates convergence and yields significant performance gains. Further analysis reveals that the entropy of the first token is modality-dependent. Code will be made available upon publication.

*Rishi Upadhyay,Howard Zhang,Jim Solomon,Ayush Agrawal,Pranay Boreddy,Shruti Satya Narayana,Yunhao Ba,Alex Wong,Celso M de Melo,Achuta Kadambi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldBench is a new benchmark designed for evaluating video-based world models by isolating single physical concepts, identifying gaps in current models' physical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate multiple physical laws simultaneously, limiting diagnostic capability. WorldBench aims to provide concept-specific evaluation for better analysis.

Method: WorldBench offers two levels of evaluation: intuitive physical understanding (e.g., object permanence) and low-level physical constants (e.g., friction).

Result: Current world models show consistent failures in specific physics concepts, lacking the physical fidelity needed for reliable real-world interactions.

Conclusion: WorldBench provides a scalable framework to rigorously assess physical reasoning in world models, advancing their robustness and generalizability.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative foundational models, often termed "world models," have propelled interest in applying them to critical tasks like robotic planning and autonomous system training. For reliable deployment, these models must exhibit high physical fidelity, accurately simulating real-world dynamics. Existing physics-based video benchmarks, however, suffer from entanglement, where a single test simultaneously evaluates multiple physical laws and concepts, fundamentally limiting their diagnostic capability. We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions. Through its concept-specific evaluation, WorldBench offers a more nuanced and scalable framework for rigorously evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning.

TL;DR: GBPN integrates deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for depth completion, achieving state-of-the-art performance by dynamically constructing and inferring MRFs via Gaussian Belief Propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in handling sparse, irregular depth data in deep networks, which limits performance under high sparsity. The paper aims to overcome this by combining deep learning with probabilistic graphical models.

Method: Introduces Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), leveraging Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN) to dynamically build MRFs with adaptive edges. Uses Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) with serial & parallel message passing.

Result: GBPN achieves SOTA performance on NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks, showing robustness across varying sparsity levels and patterns, and strong generalization.

Conclusion: GBPN effectively combines deep learning and probabilistic graphical models, offering superior depth completion performance and robustness.

Abstract: Depth completion aims to predict a dense depth map from a color image with sparse depth measurements. Although deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA), effectively handling the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data in deep networks remains a significant challenge, often limiting performance, especially under high sparsity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a novel hybrid framework synergistically integrating deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for end-to-end depth completion. Specifically, a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) is dynamically constructed by the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN), and then inferred via Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to yield the dense depth distribution. Crucially, the GMCN learns to construct not only the data-dependent potentials of MRF but also its structure by predicting adaptive non-local edges, enabling the capture of complex, long-range spatial dependencies. Furthermore, we enhance GBP with a serial \& parallel message passing scheme, designed for effective information propagation, particularly from sparse measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GBPN achieves SOTA performance on the NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks. Evaluations across varying sparsity levels, sparsity patterns, and datasets highlight GBPN's superior performance, notable robustness, and generalizable capability.

*Md Nadim Mahamood,Md Imran Hasan,Md Rasheduzzaman,Ausrukona Ray,Md Shafi Ud Doula,Kamrul Hasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Mam-App, a lightweight Mamba-based model for efficient apple leaf disease classification, achieving high accuracy with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for efficient food production by reducing crop losses from diseases, leveraging lightweight deep learning models for resource-constrained applications.

Method: Uses a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model (Mam-App) for feature extraction and disease classification on leaf datasets.

Result: Achieves 99.58% accuracy on apple leaf disease dataset and performs well on corn and potato datasets, with only 0.051M parameters.

Conclusion: Mam-App balances efficiency and performance, making it suitable for low-resource platforms like drones and mobile devices.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the global population, alongside exponential technological advancement, has intensified the demand for food production. Meeting this demand depends not only on increasing agricultural yield but also on minimizing food loss caused by crop diseases. Diseases account for a substantial portion of apple production losses, despite apples being among the most widely produced and nutritionally valuable fruits worldwide. Previous studies have employed machine learning techniques for feature extraction and early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases, and more recently, deep learning-based models have shown remarkable performance in disease recognition. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models are highly parameter-intensive, resulting in increased training and inference time. Although lightweight models are more suitable for user-friendly and resource-constrained applications, they often suffer from performance degradation. To address the trade-off between efficiency and performance, we propose Mam-App, a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for feature extraction and leaf disease classification. The proposed approach achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on the PlantVillage Apple Leaf Disease dataset, attaining 99.58% accuracy, 99.30% precision, 99.14% recall, and a 99.22% F1-score, while using only 0.051M parameters. This extremely low parameter count makes the model suitable for deployment on drones, mobile devices, and other low-resource platforms. To demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model, we further evaluate it on the PlantVillage Corn Leaf Disease and Potato Leaf Disease datasets. The model achieves 99.48%, 99.20%, 99.34%, and 99.27% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the corn dataset and 98.46%, 98.91%, 95.39%, and 97.01% on the potato dataset, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LANE improves 3D mesh generation by enhancing sequence length and speed with compact autoregressive dependencies and AdaGraph strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive methods for 3D mesh generation inefficiently use resources, limiting sequence length and detail.

Method: LANE integrates compact autoregressive dependencies and AdaGraph for spatiotemporal decoupling.

Result: LANE achieves 6x longer sequences, faster inference, and better geometric consistency than prior methods.

Conclusion: LANE offers a robust solution for high-quality 3D mesh generation with improved speed and detail.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D meshes can be tokenized into one-dimension (1D) sequences and directly modeled using autoregressive approaches for faces and vertices. However, existing methods suffer from insufficient resource utilization, resulting in slow inference and the ability to handle only small-scale sequences, which severely constrains the expressible structural details. We introduce the Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE), which incorporates compact autoregressive dependencies in the generation process, achieving a $6\times$ improvement in maximum generatable sequence length compared to existing methods. To further accelerate inference, we propose the Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) strategy, which effectively overcomes the efficiency bottleneck of traditional serial inference through spatiotemporal decoupling in the generation process. Experimental validation demonstrates that LANE achieves superior performance across generation speed, structural detail, and geometric consistency, providing an effective solution for high-quality 3D mesh generation.

*Keke Tang,Ziyong Du,Xiaofei Wang,Weilong Peng,Peican Zhu,Zhihong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework leveraging optimal transport geometry to mitigate overconfidence in DNNs for out-of-distribution inputs is proposed, showing improved calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs often exhibit overconfidence in predictions for out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, reducing reliability. Singularities in semi-discrete optimal transport highlight ambiguous regions where classifiers make unwarranted high-confidence predictions.

Method: The approach formulates an optimal transport problem between a continuous base distribution and latent embeddings of training data to identify singular boundaries. Sampling near these boundaries creates geometrically grounded OOD inputs (OTIS). A confidence suppression loss is applied to OTIS during training.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the method effectively reduces OOD overconfidence and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed framework, grounded in optimal transport geometry, successfully mitigates OOD overconfidence and improves model calibration.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often produce overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, undermining their reliability in open-world environments. Singularities in semi-discrete optimal transport (OT) mark regions of semantic ambiguity, where classifiers are particularly prone to unwarranted high-confidence predictions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled framework to mitigate OOD overconfidence by leveraging the geometry of OT-induced singular boundaries. Specifically, we formulate an OT problem between a continuous base distribution and the latent embeddings of training data, and identify the resulting singular boundaries. By sampling near these boundaries, we construct a class of OOD inputs, termed optimal transport-induced OOD samples (OTIS), which are geometrically grounded and inherently semantically ambiguous. During training, a confidence suppression loss is applied to OTIS to guide the model toward more calibrated predictions in structurally uncertain regions. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly alleviates OOD overconfidence and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision foundation models implicitly capture continuous disease progression, with trajectory fidelity predicting downstream performance and revealing biological insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if vision foundation models encode continuous disease progression, which could better reflect biology and improve generalization in computational pathology.

Method: Probe models using diffusion pseudotime to infer disease trajectories in representation space, evaluating on four cancer progressions and six models.

Result: Pathology-specific models outperform baselines, with vision-only models achieving high fidelity. Trajectory fidelity strongly predicts few-shot classification performance.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models can represent continuous processes from static observations, and trajectory fidelity serves as a complementary quality measure beyond downstream tasks.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained on discretely sampled images achieve strong performance on classification benchmarks, yet whether their representations encode the continuous processes underlying their training data remains unclear. This question is especially pertinent in computational pathology, where we posit that models whose latent representations implicitly capture continuous disease progression may better reflect underlying biology, support more robust generalization, and enable quantitative analyses of features associated with disease transitions. Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(τ> 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated). Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases ($ρ= 0.92$), and exploratory analysis shows cell-type composition varies smoothly along inferred trajectories in patterns consistent with known stromal remodeling. Together, these results demonstrate that vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and that trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance. While demonstrated in pathology, this framework could be applied to other domains where continuous processes are observed through static snapshots.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SR²-Net, a plug-and-play rectifier for HSI-SR models, enhancing spectral consistency without altering architectures, and improves reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HSI-SR methods neglect spectral consistency, causing artifacts. A flexible solution is needed.

Method: SR²-Net uses H-S³A for cross-band interactions and MCR for spectral manifold consistency, plus a degradation-consistency loss.

Result: Demonstrates improved spectral fidelity and reconstruction quality across benchmarks with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: SR²-Net effectively addresses spectral inconsistencies in HSI-SR, offering a versatile and lightweight solution.

Abstract: HSI-SR aims to enhance spatial resolution while preserving spectrally faithful and physically plausible characteristics. Recent methods have achieved great progress by leveraging spatial correlations to enhance spatial resolution. However, these methods often neglect spectral consistency across bands, leading to spurious oscillations and physically implausible artifacts. While spectral consistency can be addressed by designing the network architecture, it results in a loss of generality and flexibility. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight plug-and-play rectifier, physically priors Spectral Rectification Super-Resolution Network (SR$^{2}$-Net), which can be attached to a wide range of HSI-SR models without modifying their architectures. SR$^{2}$-Net follows an enhance-then-rectify pipeline consisting of (i) Hierarchical Spectral-Spatial Synergy Attention (H-S$^{3}$A) to reinforce cross-band interactions and (ii) Manifold Consistency Rectification (MCR) to constrain the reconstructed spectra to a compact, physically plausible spectral manifold. In addition, we introduce a degradation-consistency loss to enforce data fidelity by encouraging the degraded SR output to match the observed low resolution input. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and diverse backbones demonstrate consistent improvements in spectral fidelity and overall reconstruction quality with negligible computational overhead. Our code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: DAF proposes a single global adapter for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), using PAC-Bayes theorem and Taylor expansion to dynamically balance stability and plasticity, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIL methods suffer from issues like destructive interference, catastrophic forgetting, and high retrieval costs due to task-specific parameters.

Method: DAF uses PAC-Bayes theorem and Taylor expansion to fuse task-specific, previous global, and initialization parameters into a single robust global adapter.

Result: DAF outperforms existing methods on multiple CIL benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: DAF effectively addresses CIL challenges by dynamically balancing stability and plasticity through a robust fusion mechanism.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously acquire new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. A dominant paradigm involves freezing a pre-trained model and training lightweight, task-specific adapters. However, maintaining task-specific parameters hinders knowledge transfer and incurs high retrieval costs, while naive parameter fusion often leads to destructive interference and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to construct a single robust global adapter. Grounded in the PAC-Bayes theorem, we derive a fusion mechanism that explicitly integrates three components: the optimized task-specific adapter parameters, the previous global adapter parameters, and the initialization parameters. We utilize the Taylor expansion of the loss function to derive the optimal fusion coefficients, dynamically achieving the best balance between stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we propose a Robust Initialization strategy to effectively capture global knowledge patterns. Experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrate that DAF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

TL;DR: SGDS improves Class-Incremental Learning by dynamically sparsifying activation spaces to balance knowledge transfer and interference avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods constrain parameters orthogonally, harming plasticity. SGDS addresses this by guiding activation subspaces.

Method: SGDS uses semantic-guided dynamic sparsification to manage subspace orientation and rank, promoting shared subspaces for similar classes and non-overlapping ones for dissimilar classes.

Result: SGDS achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, effectively mitigating interference without rigid parameter constraints.

Conclusion: SGDS offers a superior approach to CIL by sculpting sparse subspaces in activation space, enhancing performance without sacrificing plasticity.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a model to continually learn new classes without forgetting old ones. A common and efficient solution freezes a pre-trained model and employs lightweight adapters, whose parameters are often forced to be orthogonal to prevent inter-task interference. However, we argue that this parameter-constraining method is detrimental to plasticity. To this end, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS), a novel method that proactively guides the activation space by governing the orientation and rank of its subspaces through targeted sparsification. Specifically, SGDS promotes knowledge transfer by encouraging similar classes to share a compact activation subspace, while simultaneously preventing interference by assigning non-overlapping activation subspaces to dissimilar classes. By sculpting class-specific sparse subspaces in the activation space, SGDS effectively mitigates interference without imposing rigid constraints on the parameter space. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SGDS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Aerial-ground person re-identification faces challenges due to extreme viewpoint and distance discrepancies. The proposed GIQT method rectifies the similarity space by adapting query-key interactions to camera geometry, improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme viewpoint and distance discrepancies distort the similarity space in aerial-ground person re-identification, degrading attention-based matching. Existing methods assume reliable similarity under large variations, which is invalid.

Method: Introduces Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a low-rank module rectifying the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry. Also includes a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks show improved robustness under extreme geometric conditions with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: GIQT effectively addresses geometric distortions in aerial-ground re-identification, enhancing robustness without significant computational cost.

Abstract: Aerial-ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is fundamentally challenged by extreme viewpoint and distance discrepancies between aerial and ground cameras, which induce severe geometric distortions and invalidate the assumption of a shared similarity space across views. Existing methods primarily rely on geometry-aware feature learning or appearance-conditioned prompting, while implicitly assuming that the geometry-invariant dot-product similarity used in attention mechanisms remains reliable under large viewpoint and scale variations. We argue that this assumption does not hold. Extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching, even when feature representations are partially aligned.
  To address this issue, we introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry. Rather than modifying feature representations or the attention formulation itself, GIQT adapts the similarity computation to compensate for dominant geometry-induced anisotropic distortions. Building on this local similarity rectification, we further incorporate a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism that provides global, view-adaptive representation priors derived directly from camera geometry.
  Experiments on four aerial-ground person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under extreme and previously unseen geometric conditions, while introducing minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to create a cycle where understanding and generation reinforce each other, leveraging generation tasks to enhance understanding—direction under explored in current methods.

Method: Proposes UniMRG, an architecture-agnostic post-training method that trains UMMs to generate intrinsic representations (pixel, depth, segmentation) alongside standard understanding tasks.

Result: Improves fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, enhances spatial understanding, and boosts generation capabilities across diverse UMM architectures.

Conclusion: UniMRG successfully integrates generation tasks to deepen UMMs' visual understanding, demonstrating mutual reinforcement between understanding and generation.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate both visual understanding and generation within a single framework. Their ultimate aspiration is to create a cycle where understanding and generation mutually reinforce each other. While recent post-training methods have successfully leveraged understanding to enhance generation, the reverse direction of utilizing generation to improve understanding remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs. Extensive experiments across diverse UMM architectures demonstrate that our method notably enhances fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, and improves spatial understanding, while simultaneously boosting generation capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of distinguishing high-fidelity AI-generated videos from real ones by introducing 'Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF) and proposing a dual-path framework for detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite improvements in video generation models, AI-generated videos exhibit unique structured and homogeneous pixel composition logic, termed MPF, which can be leveraged to detect synthetic content.

Method: A hierarchical dual-path framework is proposed: the Static Manifold Deviation Branch detects spatial anomalies, while the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch analyzes MPF for fine-grained detection.

Result: The framework effectively identifies AI-generated videos by capturing deviations from natural real-world manifolds and subtle computational fingerprints.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that AI-generated videos can be detected through structured MPF, providing a robust method for exposing synthetic content.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Veo and Wan, the visual quality of synthetic content has reached a level where macro-level semantic errors and temporal inconsistencies are no longer prominent. However, this does not imply that the distinction between real and cutting-edge high-fidelity fake is untraceable. We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter. By analyzing the structured MPF that persists even in visually perfect sequences, our framework ensures that forgeries are exposed regardless of whether they manifest as global real-world manifold deviations or subtle computational fingerprints.

### [32] [From Implicit Ambiguity to Explicit Solidity: Diagnosing Interior Geometric Degradation in Neural Radiance Fields for Dense 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21421)
*Jiangsan Zhao,Jakob Geipel,Kryzysztof Kusnierek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRFs struggle with dense, self-occluding scenes due to Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD), leading to hollow structures. Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster) improves recovery rates by enforcing geometric separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the limitations of NeRFs in dense scenes and develop a solution for better quantitative 3D analysis.

Method: Introduce SVRaster, an explicit geometric pipeline using SfM feature geometry and recursive splitting to maintain solidity.

Result: SVRaster achieves a 95.8% instance recovery rate vs. NeRFs' 89%, showing robustness with degraded masks.

Conclusion: Explicit geometric priors are essential for reliable 3D analysis in highly occluded scenes.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for multi-view reconstruction, complementing classical photogrammetric pipelines based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS). However, their reliability for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a fundamental failure mode of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion, which we term Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD). We show that transmittance-based volumetric optimization satisfies photometric supervision by reconstructing hollow or fragmented structures rather than solid interiors, leading to systematic instance undercounting. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing occlusion, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs saturate at approximately 89% instance recovery in dense scenes, despite improved surface coherence and mask quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster), initialized from SfM feature geometry. By projecting 2D instance masks onto an explicit voxel grid and enforcing geometric separation via recursive splitting, our approach preserves physical solidity and achieves a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters. A sensitivity analysis using degraded segmentation masks further shows that explicit SfM-based geometry is substantially more robust to supervision failure, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines. These results demonstrate that explicit geometric priors are a prerequisite for reliable quantitative analysis in highly self-occluding 3D scenes.

*Shohei Enomoto,Shin'ya Yamaguchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bridges gap between multimodal pre-training and unimodal fine-tuning by generating synthetic captions via MLLMs, enhancing fine-tuning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage rich multimodal pre-trained representations in fine-tuning, which traditionally remains unimodal, limiting performance benefits.

Method: Uses MLLMs to convert unimodal datasets into multimodal ones with synthetic captions, employs supervised contrastive loss, and class-averaged text embeddings for inference.

Result: Outperforms baselines on 13 benchmarks, especially in few-shot learning.

Conclusion: Establishes a new dataset enhancement paradigm for aligning multimodal pre-training with fine-tuning.

Abstract: In this paper, we address a fundamental gap between pre-training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks: while pre-training has shifted from unimodal to multimodal learning with enhanced visual understanding, fine-tuning predominantly remains unimodal, limiting the benefits of rich pre-trained representations. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that transforms unimodal datasets into multimodal ones using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate synthetic image captions for fine-tuning models with a multimodal objective. Our method employs carefully designed prompts incorporating class labels and domain context to produce high-quality captions tailored for classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss function that explicitly encourages clustering of same-class representations during fine-tuning, along with a new inference technique that leverages class-averaged text embeddings from multiple synthetic captions per image. Extensive experiments across 13 image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods, with particularly significant improvements in few-shot learning scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for dataset enhancement that effectively bridges the gap between multimodal pre-training and fine-tuning. Our code is available at https://github.com/s-enmt/MMFT.

*Yuxiang Huang,Mingye Li,Xu Han,Chaojun Xiao,Weilin Zhao,Ao Sun,Ziqi Yuan,Hao Zhou,Fandong Meng,Zhiyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spava accelerates long-video inference in Large Multimodal Models by distributing approximate attention across multiple GPUs, achieving significant speedups without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for long-video inference suffer from limited acceleration or degraded performance due to dense computation in the prefill stage of LMMs.

Method: Proposes Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention, distributing approximate attention across multiple GPUs and incorporating system-level optimizations like load balancing and fused forward passes.

Result: Spava delivers speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, respectively, without notable performance loss.

Conclusion: Spava effectively addresses the bottleneck of long-video inference, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings and improving task performance.

Abstract: The efficiency of long-video inference remains a critical bottleneck, mainly due to the dense computation in the prefill stage of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Existing methods either compress visual embeddings or apply sparse attention on a single GPU, yielding limited acceleration or degraded performance and restricting LMMs from handling longer, more complex videos. To overcome these issues, we propose Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. By distributing approximate attention, Spava reduces computation and increases parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression and thereby improving task performance. System-level optimizations, such as load balancing and fused forward passes, further unleash the potential of Spava, delivering speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without notable performance loss.

*Donghuo Zeng,Hao Niu,Zhi Li,Masato Taya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes seven metric learning losses (Contrastive, Triplet, N-pair, InfoNCE, ArcFace, SCL, CCL) using VARIANCE and GREEDINESS metrics, revealing trade-offs between efficiency and granularity in retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how metric learning losses affect embedding geometry and optimization dynamics is crucial for improving retrieval performance.

Method: A diagnostic framework (VARIANCE and GREEDINESS) is used to compare seven losses across five image-retrieval datasets.

Result: Triplet and SCL preserve within-class variance and inter-class margins, enhancing fine-grained retrieval. Contrastive and InfoNCE compact embeddings quickly but may oversimplify structures. N-pair achieves uneven spacing.

Conclusion: Trade-offs exist: Triplet/SCL are better for diversity and hard-sample discrimination, while Contrastive/InfoNCE suit fast compaction.

Abstract: Metric learning is central to retrieval, yet its effects on embedding geometry and optimization dynamics are not well understood. We introduce a diagnostic framework, VARIANCE (intra-/inter-class variance) and GREEDINESS (active ratio and gradient norms), to compare seven representative losses, i.e., Contrastive, Triplet, N-pair, InfoNCE, ArcFace, SCL, and CCL, across five image-retrieval datasets. Our analysis reveals that Triplet and SCL preserve higher within-class variance and clearer inter-class margins, leading to stronger top-1 retrieval in fine-grained settings. In contrast, Contrastive and InfoNCE compact embeddings are achieved quickly through many small updates, accelerating convergence but potentially oversimplifying class structures. N-pair achieves a large mean separation but with uneven spacing. These insights reveal a form of efficiency-granularity trade-off and provide practical guidance: prefer Triplet/SCL when diversity preservation and hard-sample discrimination are critical, and Contrastive/InfoNCE when faster embedding compaction is desired.

*Midou Guo,Qilin Yin,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo,Rui Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RT-DeepLoc is a weakly supervised framework for detecting deepfake manipulations using reconstruction errors from a Masked Autoencoder trained on authentic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes now involve localized and intermittent manipulations, making fine-grained temporal localization necessary. Frame-level annotation is costly, so weakly supervised methods with video-level labels are needed.

Method: RT-DeepLoc uses a Masked Autoencoder trained on authentic data to learn spatiotemporal patterns, revealing reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments. A novel Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL) enhances local discrimination.

Result: Experiments on large-scale datasets like LAV-DF show RT-DeepLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly supervised temporal forgery localization.

Conclusion: RT-DeepLoc effectively addresses the challenge of fine-grained temporal localization of deepfakes using weakly supervised methods and novel loss functions.

Abstract: Modern deepfakes have evolved into localized and intermittent manipulations that require fine-grained temporal localization. The prohibitive cost of frame-level annotation makes weakly supervised methods a practical necessity, which rely only on video-level labels. To this end, we propose Reconstruction-based Temporal Deepfake Localization (RT-DeepLoc), a weakly supervised temporal forgery localization framework that identifies forgeries via reconstruction errors. Our framework uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained exclusively on authentic data to learn its intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns; this allows the model to produce significant reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments, effectively providing the missing fine-grained cues for localization. To robustly leverage these indicators, we introduce a novel Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL). By focusing on the compactness of authentic features guided by these reconstruction cues, AICL establishes a stable decision boundary that enhances local discrimination while preserving generalization to unseen forgeries. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including LAV-DF, demonstrate that RT-DeepLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The necessity of debulking coronary artery calcifications is estimated for the first time, addressing variability in physician decisions based on patient conditions.

Method: A hypernetwork-based adaptive aggregation transformer (HyperAdAgFormer) is proposed to modify feature aggregation per patient using tabular data.

Result: Experiments on a clinical dataset confirm HyperAdAgFormer's effectiveness.

Conclusion: HyperAdAgFormer successfully adapts to patient-specific conditions for debulking calcifications, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first attempt to estimate the necessity of debulking coronary artery calcifications from computed tomography (CT) images. We formulate this task as a Multiple-instance Learning (MIL) problem. The difficulty of this task lies in that physicians adjust their focus and decision criteria for device usage according to tabular data representing each patient's condition. To address this issue, we propose a hypernetwork-based adaptive aggregation transformer (HyperAdAgFormer), which adaptively modifies the feature aggregation strategy for each patient based on tabular data through a hypernetwork. The experiments using the clinical dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of HyperAdAgFormer. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Shiku-Kaito/HyperAdAgFormer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimGraph is a unified framework using scene graphs for both image generation and editing, improving consistency and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GenAI methods treat image generation and editing separately, causing inefficiencies and issues with spatial coherence and semantic consistency.

Method: SimGraph integrates scene graph-based representation for objects and relationships, combining token-based generation and diffusion-based editing in one model.

Result: Extensive experiments show SimGraph outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SimGraph provides a unified solution for efficient, high-quality image generation and editing with better spatial and semantic control.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of both image generation and editing. However, current approaches often treat these tasks separately, leading to inefficiencies and challenges in maintaining spatial consistency and semantic coherence between generated content and edits. Moreover, a major obstacle is the lack of structured control over object relationships and spatial arrangements. Scene graph-based methods, which represent objects and their interrelationships in a structured format, offer a solution by providing greater control over composition and interactions in both image generation and editing. To address this, we introduce SimGraph, a unified framework that integrates scene graph-based image generation and editing, enabling precise control over object interactions, layouts, and spatial coherence. In particular, our framework integrates token-based generation and diffusion-based editing within a single scene graph-driven model, ensuring high-quality and consistent results. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERS improves diffusion-generated vehicle damage images for insurance workflows, enhancing fidelity and controllability while mitigating misuse risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about synthetic vehicle damage images in insurance workflows, focusing on fraud and claim manipulation risks.

Method: HERS fine-tunes a diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation using self-supervised image-text pairs, modeling each damage category separately.

Result: Improvements of 5.5% in text faithfulness and 2.3% in human preference ratings across four diffusion backbones.

Conclusion: HERS balances specialization and generalization in synthetic damage generation, emphasizing trustworthy use in high-stakes domains like insurance.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled increasingly realistic synthesis of vehicle damage, raising concerns about their reliability in automated insurance workflows. The ability to generate crash-like imagery challenges the boundary between authentic and synthetic data, introducing new risks of misuse in fraud or claim manipulation. To address these issues, we propose HERS (Hidden-Pattern Expert Learning for Risk-Specific Damage Adaptation), a framework designed to improve fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment of diffusion-generated damage images. HERS fine-tunes a base diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation without requiring manual annotation. Using self-supervised image-text pairs automatically generated by a large language model and T2I pipeline, HERS models each damage category, such as dents, scratches, broken lights, or cracked paint, as a separate expert. These experts are later integrated into a unified multi-damage model that balances specialization with generalization. We evaluate HERS across four diffusion backbones and observe consistent improvements: plus 5.5 percent in text faithfulness and plus 2.3 percent in human preference ratings compared to baselines. Beyond image fidelity, we discuss implications for fraud detection, auditability, and safe deployment of generative models in high-stakes domains. Our findings highlight both the opportunities and risks of domain-specific diffusion, underscoring the importance of trustworthy generation in safety-critical applications such as auto insurance.

*Zhuoqin Yang,Jiansong Zhang,Xiaoling Luo,Xu Wu,Zheng Lu,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision KAN (ViK) is an attention-free backbone using MultiPatch-RBFKAN for efficient token mixing, achieving competitive accuracy on ImageNet-1K with linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the quadratic complexity and interpretability issues of attention mechanisms in vision backbones, the paper explores attention-free alternatives inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks.

Method: Introduces ViK, leveraging MultiPatch-RBFKAN for token mixing, combining patch-wise nonlinear transforms, axis-wise separable mixing, and low-rank global mapping.

Result: ViK achieves competitive accuracy on ImageNet-1K with linear complexity, showing promise as an efficient alternative to attention-based methods.

Conclusion: KAN-based token mixing offers a scalable and theoretically grounded solution for vision backbones, avoiding the drawbacks of attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a key module in modern vision backbones due to their ability to model long-range dependencies. However, their quadratic complexity in sequence length and the difficulty of interpreting attention weights limit both scalability and clarity. Recent attention-free architectures demonstrate that strong performance can be achieved without pairwise attention, motivating the search for alternatives. In this work, we introduce Vision KAN (ViK), an attention-free backbone inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. At its core lies MultiPatch-RBFKAN, a unified token mixer that combines (a) patch-wise nonlinear transform with Radial Basis Function-based KANs, (b) axis-wise separable mixing for efficient local propagation, and (c) low-rank global mapping for long-range interaction. Employing as a drop-in replacement for attention modules, this formulation tackles the prohibitive cost of full KANs on high-resolution features by adopting a patch-wise grouping strategy with lightweight operators to restore cross-patch dependencies. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that ViK achieves competitive accuracy with linear complexity, demonstrating the potential of KAN-based token mixing as an efficient and theoretically grounded alternative to attention.

TL;DR: BA-solver addresses the latency bottleneck in Flow Matching models by introducing a lightweight SideNet for efficient velocity approximation, achieving high-fidelity synthesis with fewer evaluations and minimal training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance on iterative ODE solving in Flow Matching models causes latency issues. Existing solutions either degrade performance at low NFEs or require costly training. BA-solver aims to bridge this gap without heavy retraining.

Method: BA-solver combines Bidirectional Temporal Perception and Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration. A lightweight SideNet approximates velocities alongside a frozen backbone, enabling large interval sizes with minimal error.

Result: BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains fidelity in 5 NFEs on ImageNet-256^2, with negligible training costs.

Conclusion: BA-solver offers a versatile, efficient solution for Flow Matching models, enabling high-fidelity synthesis with reduced latency and seamless integration into existing pipelines.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) models have emerged as a leading paradigm for high-fidelity synthesis. However, their reliance on iterative Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solving creates a significant latency bottleneck. Existing solutions face a dichotomy: training-free solvers suffer from significant performance degradation at low Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), while training-based one- or few-steps generation methods incur prohibitive training costs and lack plug-and-play versatility. To bridge this gap, we propose the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver). BA-solver retains the versatility of standard training-free solvers while achieving significant acceleration by introducing a lightweight SideNet (1-2% backbone size) alongside the frozen backbone. Specifically, our method is founded on two synergistic components: \textbf{1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception}, where the SideNet learns to approximate both future and historical velocities without retraining the heavy backbone; and 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, which utilizes the SideNet with two anchor velocities to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities for batched high-order integration. By utilizing the backbone to establish high-precision ``anchors'' and the SideNet to densify the trajectory, BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error. Empirical results on ImageNet-256^2 demonstrate that BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs, incurring negligible training costs. Furthermore, BA-solver ensures seamless integration with existing generative pipelines, facilitating downstream tasks such as image editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with coarse-grained control or fixed schedules, leading to suboptimal adaptation in handling heterogeneous degradations.

Method: UDBM uses a relaxed diffusion bridge formulation to model degradation uncertainty and resolves drift singularity. It employs a dual modulation strategy (noise and path schedules) to align degradations and regulate transport trajectories.

Result: UDBM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse restoration tasks in a single inference step.

Conclusion: The proposed UDBM effectively addresses conflicting objectives in AiOIR by leveraging uncertainty-aware stochastic transport and adaptive modulation.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) faces the fundamental challenge in reconciling conflicting optimization objectives across heterogeneous degradations. Existing methods are often constrained by coarse-grained control mechanisms or fixed mapping schedules, yielding suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Bridge Model (UDBM), which innovatively reformulates AiOIR as a stochastic transport problem steered by pixel-wise uncertainty. By introducing a relaxed diffusion bridge formulation which replaces the strict terminal constraint with a relaxed constraint, we model the uncertainty of degradations while theoretically resolving the drift singularity inherent in standard diffusion bridges. Furthermore, we devise a dual modulation strategy: the noise schedule aligns diverse degradations into a shared high-entropy latent space, while the path schedule adaptively regulates the transport trajectory motivated by the viscous dynamics of entropy regularization. By effectively rectifying the transport geometry and dynamics, UDBM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse restoration tasks within a single inference step.

Result: Demonstrated high accuracy in pH, DO, and TDS measurements, with 99.8% cloud data transmission reliability and an 85% cost reduction.

Conclusion: HydroSense sets a new standard for accessible environmental monitoring through intelligent design and cost-effective components.

Abstract: The global water crisis necessitates affordable, accurate, and real-time water quality monitoring solutions. Traditional approaches relying on manual sampling or expensive commercial systems fail to address accessibility challenges in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents HydroSense, an innovative Internet of Things framework that integrates six critical water quality parameters including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), estimated nitrogen, and water level into a unified monitoring system. HydroSense employs a novel dual-microcontroller architecture, utilizing Arduino Uno for precision analog measurements with five-point calibration algorithms and ESP32 for wireless connectivity, edge processing, and cloud integration. The system implements advanced signal processing techniques including median filtering for TDS measurement, temperature compensation algorithms, and robust error handling. Experimental validation over 90 days demonstrates exceptional performance metrics: pH accuracy of plus or minus 0.08 units across the 0 to 14 range, DO measurement stability within plus or minus 0.2 mg/L, TDS accuracy of plus or minus 1.9 percent across 0 to 1000 ppm, and 99.8 percent cloud data transmission reliability. With a total implementation cost of 32,983 BDT (approximately 300 USD), HydroSense achieves an 85 percent cost reduction compared to commercial systems while providing enhanced connectivity through the Firebase real-time database. This research establishes a new paradigm for accessible environmental monitoring, demonstrating that professional-grade water quality assessment can be achieved through intelligent system architecture and cost-effective component selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermark evaluation methods lack unification, interpretability, and comprehensive security considerations, motivating the need for a better framework.

Method: WMVLM uses VLMs to evaluate residual and semantic watermarks differently, introduces new metrics, and employs a three-stage training strategy for improved functionality.

Result: WMVLM outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs, showing strong generalization across datasets, models, and watermarking techniques.

Conclusion: WMVLM successfully addresses gaps in watermark evaluation, offering a unified, interpretable solution with superior performance.

Abstract: Digital watermarking is essential for securing generated images from diffusion models. Accurate watermark evaluation is critical for algorithm development, yet existing methods have significant limitations: they lack a unified framework for both residual and semantic watermarks, provide results without interpretability, neglect comprehensive security considerations, and often use inappropriate metrics for semantic watermarks. To address these gaps, we propose WMVLM, the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking via vision-language models (VLMs). We redefine quality and security metrics for each watermark type: residual watermarks are evaluated by artifact strength and erasure resistance, while semantic watermarks are assessed through latent distribution shifts. Moreover, we introduce a three-stage training strategy to progressively enable the model to achieve classification, scoring, and interpretable text generation. Experiments show WMVLM outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs with strong generalization across datasets, diffusion models, and watermarking methods.

TL;DR: PathReasoner-R1 enhances pathology models with transparent reasoning by leveraging a knowledge-guided dataset and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack verifiable reasoning in pathology, limiting clinical trust. PathReasoner addresses this gap.

Method: Developed PathReasoner dataset using medical knowledge graphs, then trained PathReasoner-R1 with trajectory-masked fine-tuning and reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PathReasoner and public benchmarks, improving logical consistency.

Conclusion: PathReasoner-R1 provides transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities for pathology models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing computational pathology with superior visual understanding capabilities. However, current systems often reduce diagnosis to directly output conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, which severely limits clinical trust and hinders expert error rectification. To address these barriers, we construct PathReasoner, the first large-scale dataset of whole-slide image (WSI) reasoning. Unlike previous work reliant on unverified distillation, we develop a rigorous knowledge-guided generation pipeline. By leveraging medical knowledge graphs, we explicitly align structured pathological findings and clinical reasoning with diagnoses, generating over 20K high-quality instructional samples. Based on the database, we propose PathReasoner-R1, which synergizes trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning to instill structured chain-of-thought capabilities. To ensure medical rigor, we engineer a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function incorporating an Entity Reward mechanism strictly aligned with knowledge graphs. This effectively guides the model to optimize for logical consistency rather than mere outcome matching, thereby enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner and public benchmarks across various image scales, equipping pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities.

*Matéo Mahaut,Marco Baroni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores whether vision models converge to similar intermediate steps and operations despite different architectures or training. It analyzes distances between model representations at various stages, revealing differences in behavior, especially in how classifiers discard low-level information and how transformers smooth layer transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the processes leading to convergent representations in vision models, particularly whether they share intermediate steps and operations despite differences in training or architecture.

Method: Quantified distances between model representations at different stages, tracked evolution of these distances, and identified processing steps with the most differences between models.

Result: Found that layers at similar positions have similar representations but differ significantly otherwise. Classifiers discard low-level image statistics, while transformers apply smoother layer-to-layer changes compared to CNNs.

Conclusion: The study clarifies the level and nature of convergence in model representations, providing insights into the underlying processes of image models.

Abstract: Recent literature suggests that the bigger the model, the more likely it is to converge to similar, ``universal'' representations, despite different training objectives, datasets, or modalities. While this literature shows that there is an area where model representations are similar, we study here how vision models might get to those representations--in particular, do they also converge to the same intermediate steps and operations? We therefore study the processes that lead to convergent representations in different models. First, we quantify distance between different model representations at different stages. We follow the evolution of distances between models throughout processing, identifying the processing steps which are most different between models. We find that while layers at similar positions in different models have the most similar representations, strong differences remain. Classifier models, unlike the others, will discard information about low-level image statistics in their final layers. CNN- and transformer-based models also behave differently, with transformer models applying smoother changes to representations from one layer to the next. These distinctions clarify the level and nature of convergence between model representations, and enables a more qualitative account of the underlying processes in image models.

*Pu Cao,Yiyang Ma,Feng Zhou,Xuedan Yin,Qing Song,Lu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper highlights a bias in latent diffusion models favoring generative metrics over reconstruction fidelity, which risks controllability in scalable diffusion tasks. Reconstruction metrics better indicate controllability, validated through empirical studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the imbalance in evaluating autoencoders (AEs) in latent diffusion models, where generative metrics (like gFID) dominate over reconstruction fidelity, potentially harming controllability in tasks like controllable diffusion.

Method: The authors analyze the theoretical reasons behind this bias and empirically validate their findings by studying recent ImageNet AEs. They introduce a condition-drift evaluation protocol to assess controllability.

Result: Empirical results show that gFID is weakly predictive of condition preservation, while reconstruction metrics better align with controllability. ControlNet experiments confirm this link.

Conclusion: The paper exposes a gap in AE evaluation focused on ImageNet generation and provides guidance for benchmarking and model selection to enhance controllability in scalable diffusion tasks.

Abstract: In latent diffusion models, the autoencoder (AE) is typically expected to balance two capabilities: faithful reconstruction and a generation-friendly latent space (e.g., low gFID). In recent ImageNet-scale AE studies, we observe a systematic bias toward generative metrics in handling this trade-off: reconstruction metrics are increasingly under-reported, and ablation-based AE selection often favors the best-gFID configuration even when reconstruction fidelity degrades. We theoretically analyze why this gFID-dominant preference can appear unproblematic for ImageNet generation, yet becomes risky when scaling to controllable diffusion: AEs can induce condition drift, which limits achievable condition alignment. Meanwhile, we find that reconstruction fidelity, especially instance-level measures, better indicates controllability. We empirically validate the impact of tilted autoencoder evaluation on controllability by studying several recent ImageNet AEs. Using a multi-dimensional condition-drift evaluation protocol reflecting controllable generation tasks, we find that gFID is only weakly predictive of condition preservation, whereas reconstruction-oriented metrics are substantially more aligned. ControlNet experiments further confirm that controllability tracks condition preservation rather than gFID. Overall, our results expose a gap between ImageNet-centric AE evaluation and the requirements of scalable controllable diffusion, offering practical guidance for more reliable benchmarking and model selection.

*Shiqi Huang,Shuting He,Bihan Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSGround-R1 enhances spatial reasoning in remote sensing by combining Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with positional rewards and spatial consistency optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing scenes have vast spatial scales and high semantic ambiguity, making language descriptions rely heavily on positional cues. This challenges Multimodal Large Language Models in spatial reasoning.

Method: The paper proposes RSGround-R1, a framework with CoT-SFT for explicit position awareness and RFT with positional rewards. It also includes spatial consistency optimization for stable convergence.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance and generalization on RSVG benchmarks.

Conclusion: RSGround-R1 effectively improves spatial understanding and localization accuracy in remote sensing visual grounding tasks.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Visual Grounding (RSVG) aims to localize target objects in large-scale aerial imagery based on natural language descriptions. Owing to the vast spatial scale and high semantic ambiguity of remote sensing scenes, these descriptions often rely heavily on positional cues, posing unique challenges for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in spatial reasoning. To leverage this unique feature, we propose a reasoning-guided, position-aware post-training framework, dubbed \textbf{RSGround-R1}, to progressively enhance spatial understanding. Specifically, we first introduce Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) using synthetically generated RSVG reasoning data to establish explicit position awareness. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) is then applied, augmented by our newly designed positional reward that provides continuous and distance-aware guidance toward accurate localization. Moreover, to mitigate incoherent localization behaviors across rollouts, we introduce a spatial consistency guided optimization scheme that dynamically adjusts policy updates based on their spatial coherence, ensuring stable and robust convergence. Extensive experiments on RSVG benchmarks demonstrate superior performance and generalization of our model.

*Yufeng Zhong,Lei Chen,Xuanle Zhao,Wenkang Han,Liming Zheng,Jing Huang,Deyang Jiang,Yilin Cao,Lin Ma,Zhixiong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OCRVerse is an end-to-end OCR method unifying text-centric and vision-centric OCR, addressing gaps in existing methods by handling diverse multimodal data types like charts and web pages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OCR methods focus on text extraction, neglecting visual elements in complex images. OCRVerse aims to bridge this gap for broader applications like data visualization.

Method: OCRVerse uses a two-stage SFT-RL training method: SFT mixes cross-domain data for initial learning, while RL tailors reward strategies per domain for better fusion.

Result: OCRVerse achieves competitive performance across text-centric and vision-centric data, rivaling large-scale open/closed-source models.

Conclusion: OCRVerse successfully unifies text and vision OCR, demonstrating effectiveness in handling diverse multimodal data.

Abstract: The development of large vision language models drives the demand for managing, and applying massive amounts of multimodal data, making OCR technology, which extracts information from visual images, increasingly popular. However, existing OCR methods primarily focus on recognizing text elements from images or scanned documents (\textbf{Text-centric OCR}), neglecting the identification of visual elements from visually information-dense image sources (\textbf{Vision-centric OCR}), such as charts, web pages and science plots. In reality, these visually information-dense images are widespread on the internet and have significant real-world application value, such as data visualization and web page analysis. In this technical report, we propose \textbf{OCRVerse}, the first holistic OCR method in end-to-end manner that enables unified text-centric OCR and vision-centric OCR. To this end, we constructe comprehensive data engineering to cover a wide range of text-centric documents, such as newspapers, magazines and books, as well as vision-centric rendered composites, including charts, web pages and scientific plots. Moreover, we propose a two-stage SFT-RL multi-domain training method for OCRVerse. SFT directly mixes cross-domain data to train and establish initial domain knowledge, while RL focuses on designing personalized reward strategies for the characteristics of each domain. Specifically, since different domains require various output formats and expected outputs, we provide sufficient flexibility in the RL stage to customize flexible reward signals for each domain, thereby improving cross-domain fusion and avoiding data conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of OCRVerse, achieving competitive results across text-centric and vision-centric data types, even comparable to large-scale open-source and closed-source models.

*Bowen Zhou,Marc-André Fiedler,Ayoub Al-Hamadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAF-Mamba, a Mamba-based cross-modal adaptive attention fusion framework, outperforms existing methods in depression detection by dynamically adjusting modality contributions and capturing cross-modal interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depression severely impacts daily life, and current deep learning approaches lack effective multimodal feature integration and dynamic modality weighting.

Method: Proposes CAF-Mamba, leveraging cross-modal adaptive attention fusion to explicitly and implicitly capture interactions and dynamically adjust modality contributions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LMVD and D-Vlog datasets, consistently surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: CAF-Mamba effectively addresses limitations in current depression detection methods, demonstrating superior multimodal fusion capabilities.

Abstract: Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that severely impairs daily functioning and quality of life. While recent deep learning approaches for depression detection have shown promise, most rely on limited feature types, overlook explicit cross-modal interactions, and employ simple concatenation or static weighting for fusion. To overcome these limitations, we propose CAF-Mamba, a novel Mamba-based cross-modal adaptive attention fusion framework. CAF-Mamba not only captures cross-modal interactions explicitly and implicitly, but also dynamically adjusts modality contributions through a modality-wise attention mechanism, enabling more effective multimodal fusion. Experiments on two in-the-wild benchmark datasets, LMVD and D-Vlog, demonstrate that CAF-Mamba consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Marcel Dreier,Nora Gourmelon,Dakota Pyles,Thorsten Seehaus,Matthias H. Braun,Andreas Maier,Vincent Christlein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper highlights the gap between benchmark performance and real-world accuracy of a glacier calving front model, proposes adaptations to improve accuracy, and demonstrates successful results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The initial model performed well in benchmarks but failed in real-world novel settings, necessitating improvements for practical scientific use.

Method: The authors used few-shot domain adaptation, spatial static prior knowledge, and summer reference images to refine the model without changing its architecture.

Result: The delineation error significantly decreased from 1131.6 m to 68.7 m after applying the proposed adaptations.

Conclusion: The advancements enable global-scale glacier calving front monitoring by adapting deep learning models to novel sites effectively.

Abstract: During benchmarking, the state-of-the-art model for glacier calving front delineation achieves near-human performance. However, when applied in a real-world setting at a novel study site, its delineation accuracy is insufficient for calving front products intended for further scientific analyses. This site represents an out-of-distribution domain for a model trained solely on the benchmark dataset. By employing a few-shot domain adaptation strategy, incorporating spatial static prior knowledge, and including summer reference images in the input time series, the delineation error is reduced from 1131.6 m to 68.7 m without any architectural modifications. These methodological advancements establish a framework for applying deep learning-based calving front segmentation to novel study sites, enabling calving front monitoring on a global scale.

*Zixuan Xia,Hao Wang,Pengcheng Weng,Yanyu Qian,Yangxin Xu,William Dan,Fei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces \regName, a geometry-aware regularization framework addressing geometric pathologies in multimodal learning to improve representation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models often suffer from geometric issues like intra-modal collapse and cross-modal inconsistency, degrading performance despite balanced training. Representational geometry is identified as an overlooked control axis.

Method: \regName imposes two constraints: intra-modal dispersive regularization for diversity and inter-modal anchoring regularization to limit cross-modal drift. It's lightweight, plug-and-play, and architecture-agnostic.

Result: Tests on multimodal benchmarks show consistent improvements in both multimodal and unimodal performance, proving effective mitigation of modality trade-offs.

Conclusion: Explicitly regulating representation geometry with \regName enhances multimodal learning outcomes by addressing geometric pathologies.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to integrate complementary information from heterogeneous modalities, yet strong optimization alone does not guaranty well-structured representations. Even under carefully balanced training schemes, multimodal models often exhibit geometric pathologies, including intra-modal representation collapse and sample-level cross-modal inconsistency, which degrade both unimodal robustness and multimodal fusion.
  We identify representation geometry as a missing control axis in multimodal learning and propose \regName, a lightweight geometry-aware regularization framework. \regName enforces two complementary constraints on intermediate embeddings: an intra-modal dispersive regularization that promotes representation diversity, and an inter-modal anchoring regularization that bounds sample-level cross-modal drift without rigid alignment. The proposed regularizer is plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with various training paradigms.
  Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both multimodal and unimodal performance, showing that explicitly regulating representation geometry effectively mitigates modality trade-offs.

*Dexuan Ding,Ciyuan Peng,Endrowednes Kuantama,Jingcai Guo,Jia Wu,Jian Yang,Amin Beheshti,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yuankai Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVSC compresses 3D sMRI volumes into 2D features for better alignment with 2D foundation models, improving Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for sMRI representation learning face issues like high computational cost, loss of cross-slice relations, and limited discriminative feature extraction.

Method: Proposes Multimodal Visual Surrogate Compression (MVSC), featuring a Volume Context Encoder for global context and an Adaptive Slice Fusion module for text-enhanced, patch-wise aggregation.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale Alzheimer's disease benchmarks show MVSC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in binary and multi-class classification.

Conclusion: MVSC addresses limitations of existing paradigms, offering a more efficient and effective solution for AD diagnosis using sMRI.

Abstract: High-dimensional structural MRI (sMRI) images are widely used for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis. Most existing methods for sMRI representation learning rely on 3D architectures (e.g., 3D CNNs), slice-wise feature extraction with late aggregation, or apply training-free feature extractions using 2D foundation models (e.g., DINO). However, these three paradigms suffer from high computational cost, loss of cross-slice relations, and limited ability to extract discriminative features, respectively. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Visual Surrogate Compression (MVSC). It learns to compress and adapt large 3D sMRI volumes into compact 2D features, termed as visual surrogates, which are better aligned with frozen 2D foundation models to extract powerful representations for final AD classification. MVSC has two key components: a Volume Context Encoder that captures global cross-slice context under textual guidance, and an Adaptive Slice Fusion module that aggregates slice-level information in a text-enhanced, patch-wise manner. Extensive experiments on three large-scale Alzheimer's disease benchmarks demonstrate our MVSC performs favourably on both binary and multi-class classification tasks compared against state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChartE³ is an end-to-end chart editing benchmark evaluating models without relying on intermediate representations. It focuses on local and global edits, revealing gaps in current capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of enabling faithful, end-to-end chart editing without intermediate natural language or code, which limits complex edits.

Method: ChartE³ introduces a benchmark with 1,200 samples (chart image, code, editing instruction) for evaluating models on local (fine-grained) and global (holistic) editing tasks.

Result: Benchmarking shows significant performance gaps, especially in global editing tasks, exposing limitations in current end-to-end editing models.

Conclusion: ChartE³ highlights the need for improved models capable of handling both fine-grained and holistic chart edits directly.

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format for structured data analysis. Enabling end-to-end chart editing according to user intent is of great practical value, yet remains challenging due to the need for both fine-grained control and global structural consistency. Most existing approaches adopt pipeline-based designs, where natural language or code serves as an intermediate representation, limiting their ability to faithfully execute complex edits. We introduce ChartE$^{3}$, an End-to-End Chart Editing benchmark that directly evaluates models without relying on intermediate natural language programs or code-level supervision. ChartE$^{3}$ focuses on two complementary editing dimensions: local editing, which involves fine-grained appearance changes such as font or color adjustments, and global editing, which requires holistic, data-centric transformations including data filtering and trend line addition. ChartE$^{3}$ contains over 1,200 high-quality samples constructed via a well-designed data pipeline with human curation. Each sample is provided as a triplet of a chart image, its underlying code, and a multimodal editing instruction, enabling evaluation from both objective and subjective perspectives. Extensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly on global editing tasks, highlighting critical limitations in current end-to-end chart editing capabilities.

TL;DR: DreamActor-M2 addresses motion injection and pose prior challenges in character animation using a two-stage framework and self-bootstrapped data synthesis, achieving superior fidelity and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with motion-identity trade-offs and reliance on pose priors, limiting generalization and fidelity.

Method: DreamActor-M2 uses a two-stage approach: (1) fusing appearance and motion cues in latent space, and (2) a self-bootstrapped pipeline for RGB-driven animation.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods, offering high visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: DreamActor-M2 advances universal animation by overcoming key challenges and introducing a versatile benchmark.

Abstract: Character image animation aims to synthesize high-fidelity videos by transferring motion from a driving sequence to a static reference image. Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a "see-saw", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we further introduce AW Bench, a versatile benchmark encompassing a wide spectrum of characters types and motion scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GMC, a new metric for Image Quality Assessment (IQA) that offers fine-grained analysis beyond traditional global metrics like PLCC and SRCC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing global metrics (PLCC, SRCC) fail to capture local performance variations in IQA models and are sensitive to test-sample quality distributions.

Method: Proposes Granularity-Modulated Correlation (GMC), which includes a Granularity Modulator for local performance analysis and a Distribution Regulator to mitigate biases.

Result: GMC provides a 3D correlation surface mapping performance across MOS and MOS differences, revealing hidden model behaviors.

Conclusion: GMC offers a more informative and reliable approach for evaluating IQA models, outperforming traditional scalar metrics.

Abstract: Evaluation of Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models has long been dominated by global correlation metrics, such as Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman Rank-Order Correlation Coefficient (SRCC). While widely adopted, these metrics reduce performance to a single scalar, failing to capture how ranking consistency varies across the local quality spectrum. For example, two IQA models may achieve identical SRCC values, yet one ranks high-quality images (related to high Mean Opinion Score, MOS) more reliably, while the other better discriminates image pairs with small quality/MOS differences (related to $|Δ$MOS$|$). Such complementary behaviors are invisible under global metrics. Moreover, SRCC and PLCC are sensitive to test-sample quality distributions, yielding unstable comparisons across test sets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Granularity-Modulated Correlation (GMC)}, which provides a structured, fine-grained analysis of IQA performance. GMC includes: (1) a \textbf{Granularity Modulator} that applies Gaussian-weighted correlations conditioned on absolute MOS values and pairwise MOS differences ($|Δ$MOS$|$) to examine local performance variations, and (2) a \textbf{Distribution Regulator} that regularizes correlations to mitigate biases from non-uniform quality distributions. The resulting \textbf{correlation surface} maps correlation values as a joint function of MOS and $|Δ$MOS$|$, providing a 3D representation of IQA performance. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that GMC reveals performance characteristics invisible to scalar metrics, offering a more informative and reliable paradigm for analyzing, comparing, and deploying IQA models.

TL;DR: DGNav addresses 'Granularity Rigidity' in VLN-CE by dynamically adjusting topological map density and connectivity using context-aware mechanisms, improving navigation efficiency and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing topological planning methods struggle with fixed thresholds, leading to inefficiencies in simple areas and risks in complex ones. DGNav aims to solve this mismatch.

Method: DGNav introduces a Scene-Aware Adaptive Strategy for dynamic node sampling and a Dynamic Graph Transformer to adjust connectivity using multimodal cues.

Result: Experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks show superior performance and generalization, balancing efficiency and safety.

Conclusion: DGNav effectively addresses Granularity Rigidity, enhancing navigation precision and adaptability in continuous environments.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) presents a core challenge: grounding high-level linguistic instructions into precise, safe, and long-horizon spatial actions. Explicit topological maps have proven to be a vital solution for providing robust spatial memory in such tasks. However, existing topological planning methods suffer from a "Granularity Rigidity" problem. Specifically, these methods typically rely on fixed geometric thresholds to sample nodes, which fails to adapt to varying environmental complexities. This rigidity leads to a critical mismatch: the model tends to over-sample in simple areas, causing computational redundancy, while under-sampling in high-uncertainty regions, increasing collision risks and compromising precision. To address this, we propose DGNav, a framework for Dynamic Topological Navigation, introducing a context-aware mechanism to modulate map density and connectivity on-the-fly. Our approach comprises two core innovations: (1) A Scene-Aware Adaptive Strategy that dynamically modulates graph construction thresholds based on the dispersion of predicted waypoints, enabling "densification on demand" in challenging environments; (2) A Dynamic Graph Transformer that reconstructs graph connectivity by fusing visual, linguistic, and geometric cues into dynamic edge weights, enabling the agent to filter out topological noise and enhancing instruction adherence. Extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate DGNav exhibits superior navigation performance and strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that our framework achieves an optimal trade-off between navigation efficiency and safe exploration.

TL;DR: Efficient single-view 3D reconstruction of ships using synthetic data and Splatter Image network, achieving practical maritime monitoring without real-world 3D annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D reconstruction methods for ships are impractical for real-time maritime use due to multi-view requirements, annotated 3D ground truth, or high computational costs.

Method: The approach uses Splatter Image network with synthetic data for training, integrating YOLOv8 segmentation and custom preprocessing. Postprocessing includes real-world scaling, centering, and georeferenced placement.

Result: Strong reconstruction fidelity on synthetic validation data and promising qualitative results on real maritime imagery demonstrate practical transferability.

Conclusion: The pipeline offers an efficient, scalable solution for maritime monitoring, enabling interactive 3D inspection of ships without real-world 3D annotations.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of ships is an important part of maritime monitoring, allowing improved visualization, inspection, and decision-making in real-world monitoring environments. However, most state-ofthe-art 3D reconstruction methods require multi-view supervision, annotated 3D ground truth, or are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time maritime deployment. In this work, we present an efficient pipeline for single-view 3D reconstruction of real ships by training entirely on synthetic data and requiring only a single view at inference. Our approach uses the Splatter Image network, which represents objects as sparse sets of 3D Gaussians for rapid and accurate reconstruction from single images. The model is first fine-tuned on synthetic ShapeNet vessels and further refined with a diverse custom dataset of 3D ships, bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery. We integrate a state-of-the-art segmentation module based on YOLOv8 and custom preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the reconstruction network. Postprocessing steps include real-world scaling, centering, and orientation alignment, followed by georeferenced placement on an interactive web map using AIS metadata and homography-based mapping. Quantitative evaluation on synthetic validation data demonstrates strong reconstruction fidelity, while qualitative results on real maritime images from the ShipSG dataset confirm the potential for transfer to operational maritime settings. The final system provides interactive 3D inspection of real ships without requiring real-world 3D annotations. This pipeline provides an efficient, scalable solution for maritime monitoring and highlights a path toward real-time 3D ship visualization in practical applications.

TL;DR: CG-MLLM is a novel Multi-modal Large Language Model that excels in 3D content generation, combining captioning and high-resolution 3D generation in a single framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underexplored capabilities of LLMs in 3D content generation, overcoming limitations of existing methods that produce low-resolution or coarse structures.

Method: CG-MLLM uses a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with TokenAR and BlockAR Transformers, integrating a pre-trained vision-language backbone and a 3D VAE latent space for long-context interactions.

Result: CG-MLLM outperforms existing MLLMs, generating high-fidelity 3D objects and advancing high-resolution 3D content creation.

Conclusion: The model successfully integrates 3D generation into the LLM paradigm, offering a robust solution for high-resolution 3D content.

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have revolutionized text generation and multimodal perception, but their capabilities in 3D content generation remain underexplored. Existing methods compromise by producing either low-resolution meshes or coarse structural proxies, failing to capture fine-grained geometry natively. In this paper, we propose CG-MLLM, a novel Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) capable of 3D captioning and high-resolution 3D generation in a single framework. Leveraging the Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, CG-MLLM decouples disparate modeling needs, where the Token-level Autoregressive (TokenAR) Transformer handles token-level content, and the Block-level Autoregressive (BlockAR) Transformer handles block-level content. By integrating a pre-trained vision-language backbone with a specialized 3D VAE latent space, CG-MLLM facilitates long-context interactions between standard tokens and spatial blocks within a single integrated architecture. Experimental results show that CG-MLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs in generating high-fidelity 3D objects, effectively bringing high-resolution 3D content creation into the mainstream LLM paradigm.

TL;DR: MMFineReason introduces a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset to enhance open-source VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art results with efficient parameter use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source VLMs lack high-quality reasoning data, especially in challenging domains like STEM diagrams and visual puzzles.

Method: A three-stage pipeline collects and annotates 1.8M samples with CoT rationales, followed by fine-tuning Qwen3-VL-Instruct models.

Result: MMFineReason models outperform larger proprietary systems, showing efficiency with a 'less is more' effect from difficulty-aware filtering.

Conclusion: The dataset and models significantly advance visual reasoning capabilities, demonstrating the value of high-quality reasoning data.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have driven significant progress in visual reasoning. However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a "less is more" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7\% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset. Notably, we reveal a synergistic effect where reasoning-oriented data composition simultaneously boosts general capabilities.

*Taewon Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diffusion-based framework for document background generation that preserves foreground content and ensures style consistency across pages by leveraging latent-space design instead of explicit constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in document-centric background generation, such as preserving foreground readability and maintaining stylistic consistency across multiple pages, without relying on auxiliary mechanisms or repeated style specifications.

Method: The method reinterprets diffusion as stochastic trajectory evolution in a structured latent space. It shapes initial noise and aligns it geometrically to avoid foreground regions and uses cached style directions to ensure multi-page consistency.

Result: The framework produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents without requiring training or modifications to existing diffusion backbones.

Conclusion: By reframing diffusion as latent-space trajectory design, the paper offers a principled and efficient solution for consistent and structured generative modeling in document backgrounds.

Abstract: We present a diffusion-based framework for document-centric background generation that achieves foreground preservation and multi-page stylistic consistency through latent-space design rather than explicit constraints. Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, we offer a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling.

*Jian-Feng Cai,Haixia Liu,Zhengyi Su,Chao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is reinterpreted through optimization, revealing its heuristic nature and proposing a refined sampling method with improved fidelity and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG's empirical success lacks theoretical grounding, and its sensitivity to guidance scale motivates a principled interpretation and improvement.

Method: Reformulates CFG as homotopy optimization with manifold constraints, using incremental gradient descent and Anderson Acceleration for efficiency.

Result: Enhanced generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness across benchmarks like DiT-XL-2-256, Flux, and Stable Diffusion 3.5.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free methods offer a robust and efficient alternative to standard CFG, validated by significant improvements in performance.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for controllable generation in diffusion and flow-based models. Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling. To improve computational efficiency and stability, we further enhance this iterative process with Anderson Acceleration without requiring additional model evaluations. Our proposed methods are training-free and consistently refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale. We validate their effectiveness across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements on large-scale models such as DiT-XL-2-256, Flux, and Stable Diffusion 3.5.

*Hanmo Chen,Chenghao Xu,Xu Yang,Xuan Chen,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PaFu-KV, a novel KV Cache Policy for autoregressive video generation, addressing inefficiencies by estimating token salience to improve quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV Cache policies overlook token importance differences, leading to spatiotemporal information loss and redundant cache, degrading video generation.

Method: Proposes PaFu-KV, using a Salience Estimation Head to score token importance, optimizing KV cache retention for better efficiency.

Result: PaFu-KV maintains high-fidelity video quality while reducing memory footprint, enabling faster inference for long-horizon generation.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances quality and efficiency, advancing long-term autoregressive video generation.

Abstract: Video generation is pivotal to digital media creation, and recent advances in autoregressive video generation have markedly enhanced the efficiency of real-time video synthesis. However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation. Our code will be released upon paper acceptance.

*Chuancheng Shi,Shangze Li,Wenjun Lu,Wenhua Wu,Cong Wang,Zifeng Cheng,Fei Shen,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TraceRouter is a path-level framework designed to combat adversarial manipulation in LFMs by tracing and disrupting harmful semantic circuits without harming utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current defenses focus on localized interventions, which fail against distributed harmful semantics. TraceRouter aims to address this limitation.

Method: TraceRouter identifies sensitive layers, isolates malicious features using SAEs and activation analysis, and suppresses harmful causal pathways via FIS.

Result: TraceRouter outperforms existing methods, balancing adversarial robustness and utility effectively.

Conclusion: The framework successfully disrupts harmful semantics while preserving useful computations, offering a robust defense solution.

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, large foundation models (LFMs) remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Current defenses predominantly rely on the "locality hypothesis", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility. Our code will be publicly released. WARNING: This paper contains unsafe model responses.

*Hanmo Chen,Guangtao Lyu,Chenghao Xu,Jiexi Yan,Xu Yang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval, improving alignment between local motion segments, body joints, and text tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion-language retrieval methods focus on global alignment, ignoring fine-grained interactions between local motion segments, body joints, and text tokens, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The PST framework decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, learning cross-modal correspondences through joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets, achieving precise alignment between motion segments, body joints, and their corresponding text tokens.

Conclusion: The PST framework effectively captures local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships, significantly improving motion-language retrieval performance.

Abstract: As a foundational task in human-centric cross-modal intelligence, motion-language retrieval aims to bridge the semantic gap between natural language and human motion, enabling intuitive motion analysis, yet existing approaches predominantly focus on aligning entire motion sequences with global textual representations. This global-centric paradigm overlooks fine-grained interactions between local motion segments and individual body joints and text tokens, inevitably leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the pyramidal process of human motion perception (from joint dynamics to segment coherence, and finally to holistic comprehension) and propose a novel Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval. Specifically, the framework decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, and learns cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion, effectively capturing both local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving precise alignment between motion segments and body joints and their corresponding text tokens. The code of this work will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored capability of LMMs in video aesthetic quality assessment, a fundamental human ability.

Method: Introduce VideoAesBench with diverse content, multiple question formats, and holistic aesthetics dimensions to evaluate 23 LMMs.

Result: Current LMMs show basic but incomplete and imprecise video aesthetics perception.

Conclusion: VideoAesBench serves as a testbed for improving explainable video aesthetics assessment in LMMs.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated outstanding capabilities in various visual perception tasks, which has in turn made the evaluation of LMMs significant. However, the capability of video aesthetic quality assessment, which is a fundamental ability for human, remains underexplored for LMMs. To address this, we introduce VideoAesBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LMMs' understanding of video aesthetic quality. VideoAesBench has several significant characteristics: (1) Diverse content including 1,804 videos from multiple video sources including user-generated (UGC), AI-generated (AIGC), compressed, robotic-generated (RGC), and game videos. (2) Multiple question formats containing traditional single-choice questions, multi-choice questions, True or False questions, and a novel open-ended questions for video aesthetics description. (3) Holistic video aesthetics dimensions including visual form related questions from 5 aspects, visual style related questions from 4 aspects, and visual affectiveness questions from 3 aspects. Based on VideoAesBench, we benchmark 23 open-source and commercial large multimodal models. Our findings show that current LMMs only contain basic video aesthetics perception ability, their performance remains incomplete and imprecise. We hope our VideoAesBench can be served as a strong testbed and offer insights for explainable video aesthetics assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the temporal flickering problem in diffusion-based video restoration by leveraging video diffusion models for better consistency.

Method: Uses homologous and heterogenous latents fusion with a COT-based strategy and temporal-strengthening post-processing via image-to-video diffusion.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in maintaining temporal consistency without additional training.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves temporal coherence in video restoration and is adaptable to existing image-based methods.

Abstract: Although diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration and enhancement methods have achieved great success, applying them to video restoration or enhancement will lead to severe temporal flickering. In this paper, we propose the first framework that utilizes the rapidly-developed video diffusion model to assist the image-based method in maintaining more temporal consistency for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement. We propose homologous latents fusion, heterogenous latents fusion, and a COT-based fusion ratio strategy to utilize both homologous and heterogenous text-to-video diffusion models to complement the image method. Moreover, we propose temporal-strengthening post-processing to utilize the image-to-video diffusion model to further improve temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and can be applied to any diffusion-based image restoration and enhancement methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

TL;DR: FeatJND introduces a task-aligned Just Noticeable Difference (JND) formulation for deep visual features, predicting maximum tolerable perturbations while maintaining task performance, validated across multiple vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep visual features are widely used, but controlling their quality and understanding their characteristics is essential for machine perception. FeatJND addresses this by defining task-aligned tolerance boundaries in feature space.

Method: The paper proposes FeatJND, a method predicting per-feature perturbation maps preserving task performance. It validates FeatJND estimators for image classification, detection, and segmentation, comparing them to unstructured perturbations.

Result: FeatJND-based distortions outperform Gaussian perturbations in preserving task performance under matched distortion. FeatJND also suppresses non-critical feature regions and improves token-wise dynamic quantization.

Conclusion: FeatJND provides a practical tool for controlling feature quality in vision systems, demonstrating effectiveness across tasks and applications like dynamic quantization.

Abstract: Deep visual features are increasingly used as the interface in vision systems, motivating the need to describe feature characteristics and control feature quality for machine perception. Just noticeable difference (JND) characterizes the maximum imperceptible distortion for images under human or machine vision. Extending it to deep visual features naturally meets the above demand by providing a task-aligned tolerance boundary in feature space, offering a practical reference for controlling feature quality under constrained resources. We propose FeatJND, a task-aligned JND formulation that predicts the maximum tolerable per-feature perturbation map while preserving downstream task performance. We propose a FeatJND estimator at standardized split points and validate it across image classification, detection, and instance segmentation. Under matched distortion strength, FeatJND-based distortions consistently preserve higher task performance than unstructured Gaussian perturbations, and attribution visualizations suggest FeatJND can suppress non-critical feature regions. As an application, we further apply FeatJND to token-wise dynamic quantization and show that FeatJND-guided step-size allocation yields clear gains over random step-size permutation and global uniform step size under the same noise budget. Our code will be released after publication.

TL;DR: BookNet is a new deep learning framework for dual-page book image rectification, using cross-page attention and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-page methods fail to address asymmetric curvature patterns in book spreads, necessitating a dual-page approach.

Method: BookNet uses a dual-branch architecture with cross-page attention to estimate warping flows for both individual pages and book spreads. It leverages synthetic (Book3D) and real-world (Book100) datasets.

Result: BookNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in book image rectification.

Conclusion: BookNet effectively models coupled geometric relationships in book spreads, advancing document image rectification.

Abstract: Book image rectification presents unique challenges in document image processing due to complex geometric distortions from binding constraints, where left and right pages exhibit distinctly asymmetric curvature patterns. However, existing single-page document image rectification methods fail to capture the coupled geometric relationships between adjacent pages in books. In this work, we introduce BookNet, the first end-to-end deep learning framework specifically designed for dual-page book image rectification. BookNet adopts a dual-branch architecture with cross-page attention mechanisms, enabling it to estimate warping flows for both individual pages and the complete book spread, explicitly modeling how left and right pages influence each other. Moreover, to address the absence of specialized datasets, we present Book3D, a large-scale synthetic dataset for training, and Book100, a comprehensive real-world benchmark for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BookNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on book image rectification. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: Shallow Alignment improves neural visual decoding by aligning neural signals with intermediate encoder representations, balancing low-level textures and high-level semantics, outperforming final-layer alignment by 22%-58%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook the granularity mismatch between human and machine vision, where deep models suppress local textures while neural signals retain mixed low- and high-level attributes.

Method: Proposes Shallow Alignment, a contrastive learning strategy aligning neural signals with intermediate visual encoder representations for better balance.

Result: Outperforms final-layer alignment by 22%-58% across benchmarks and enables predictable scaling with backbone capacity.

Conclusion: Shallow Alignment effectively addresses the mismatch and improves neural visual decoding performance and scalability.

Abstract: Neural visual decoding is a central problem in brain computer interface research, aiming to reconstruct human visual perception and to elucidate the structure of neural representations. However, existing approaches overlook a fundamental granularity mismatch between human and machine vision, where deep vision models emphasize semantic invariance by suppressing local texture information, whereas neural signals preserve an intricate mixture of low-level visual attributes and high-level semantic content. To address this mismatch, we propose Shallow Alignment, a novel contrastive learning strategy that aligns neural signals with intermediate representations of visual encoders rather than their final outputs, thereby striking a better balance between low-level texture details and high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Shallow Alignment significantly outperforms standard final-layer alignment, with performance gains ranging from 22% to 58% across diverse vision backbones. Notably, our approach effectively unlocks the scaling law in neural visual decoding, enabling decoding performance to scale predictably with the capacity of pre-trained vision backbones. We further conduct systematic empirical analyses to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the observed performance gains.

Conclusion: LingBot-VA advances robot learning by integrating video modeling and vision-language pre-training, demonstrating practical benefits and open-sourcing resources for the community.

Abstract: This work highlights that video world modeling, alongside vision-language pre-training, establishes a fresh and independent foundation for robot learning. Intuitively, video world models provide the ability to imagine the near future by understanding the causality between actions and visual dynamics. Inspired by this, we introduce LingBot-VA, an autoregressive diffusion framework that learns frame prediction and policy execution simultaneously. Our model features three carefully crafted designs: (1) a shared latent space, integrating vision and action tokens, driven by a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, (2) a closed-loop rollout mechanism, allowing for ongoing acquisition of environmental feedback with ground-truth observations, (3) an asynchronous inference pipeline, parallelizing action prediction and motor execution to support efficient control. We evaluate our model on both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios, where it shows significant promise in long-horizon manipulation, data efficiency in post-training, and strong generalizability to novel configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised video pretraining lacks effectiveness for driving due to single human trajectories and limited multimodal behavior learning.

Method: Adapts V-JEPA for driving with a ViT encoder and introduces a proposal-centric planner for diverse trajectory distillation.

Result: Outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in perception-free settings and achieves 93.3 PDMS (v1) and 87.8 EPDMS (v2).

Conclusion: Drive-JEPA sets a new state-of-the-art by integrating predictive representations with multimodal trajectory learning.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving increasingly leverages self-supervised video pretraining to learn transferable planning representations. However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Motivation: Existing NSR methods struggle with geometric ambiguity and instability in sparse-view settings, which is a significant challenge in large-scale urban remote sensing due to limited aerial image acquisition.

Method: The proposed framework integrates 3D SAR point clouds, which efficiently capture large-scale geometry, into an SDF-based NSR backbone. It uses radar-derived spatial constraints to guide structure-aware ray selection and adaptive sampling for stable optimization.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that incorporating 3D SAR significantly enhances reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and robustness under sparse and oblique-view conditions compared to single-modality baselines.

Conclusion: The framework presents a viable solution for scalable high-fidelity urban reconstruction by leveraging advanced airborne and spaceborne optical-SAR sensing.

Abstract: Neural surface reconstruction (NSR) has recently shown strong potential for urban 3D reconstruction from multi-view aerial imagery. However, existing NSR methods often suffer from geometric ambiguity and instability, particularly under sparse-view conditions. This issue is critical in large-scale urban remote sensing, where aerial image acquisition is limited by flight paths, terrain, and cost. To address this challenge, we present the first urban NSR framework that fuses 3D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) point clouds with aerial imagery for high-fidelity reconstruction under constrained, sparse-view settings. 3D SAR can efficiently capture large-scale geometry even from a single side-looking flight path, providing robust priors that complement photometric cues from images. Our framework integrates radar-derived spatial constraints into an SDF-based NSR backbone, guiding structure-aware ray selection and adaptive sampling for stable and efficient optimization. We also construct the first benchmark dataset with co-registered 3D SAR point clouds and aerial imagery, facilitating systematic evaluation of cross-modal 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that incorporating 3D SAR markedly enhances reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and robustness compared with single-modality baselines under highly sparse and oblique-view conditions, highlighting a viable route toward scalable high-fidelity urban reconstruction with advanced airborne and spaceborne optical-SAR sensing.

Conclusion: PLANING's decoupled approach yields stable, efficient reconstruction with high-quality geometry and appearance, making it suitable for large-scale scene modeling and embodied AI applications.

Abstract: Streaming reconstruction from monocular image sequences remains challenging, as existing methods typically favor either high-quality rendering or accurate geometry, but rarely both. We present PLANING, an efficient on-the-fly reconstruction framework built on a hybrid representation that loosely couples explicit geometric primitives with neural Gaussians, enabling geometry and appearance to be modeled in a decoupled manner. This decoupling supports an online initialization and optimization strategy that separates geometry and appearance updates, yielding stable streaming reconstruction with substantially reduced structural redundancy. PLANING improves dense mesh Chamfer-L2 by 18.52% over PGSR, surpasses ARTDECO by 1.31 dB PSNR, and reconstructs ScanNetV2 scenes in under 100 seconds, over 5x faster than 2D Gaussian Splatting, while matching the quality of offline per-scene optimization. Beyond reconstruction quality, the structural clarity and computational efficiency of \modelname~make it well suited for a broad range of downstream applications, such as enabling large-scale scene modeling and simulation-ready environments for embodied AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending scaling paradigms to metric depth estimation is difficult due to sensor noise, camera biases, and metric ambiguity in 3D data.

Method: Introduces Sparse Metric Prompts to decouple spatial reasoning from biases, pretraining on 20M image-depth pairs from diverse sources.

Result: Demonstrates scaling trends in metric depth, excels in prompt-driven tasks, and improves multimodal LLM spatial intelligence.

Conclusion: Metric depth estimation can leverage scaling laws like other foundation models, enabling scalable real-world perception.

Abstract: Scaling has powered recent advances in vision foundation models, yet extending this paradigm to metric depth estimation remains challenging due to heterogeneous sensor noise, camera-dependent biases, and metric ambiguity in noisy cross-source 3D data. We introduce Metric Anything, a simple and scalable pretraining framework that learns metric depth from noisy, diverse 3D sources without manually engineered prompts, camera-specific modeling, or task-specific architectures. Central to our approach is the Sparse Metric Prompt, created by randomly masking depth maps, which serves as a universal interface that decouples spatial reasoning from sensor and camera biases. Using about 20M image-depth pairs spanning reconstructed, captured, and rendered 3D data across 10000 camera models, we demonstrate-for the first time-a clear scaling trend in the metric depth track. The pretrained model excels at prompt-driven tasks such as depth completion, super-resolution and Radar-camera fusion, while its distilled prompt-free student achieves state-of-the-art results on monocular depth estimation, camera intrinsics recovery, single/multi-view metric 3D reconstruction, and VLA planning. We also show that using pretrained ViT of Metric Anything as a visual encoder significantly boosts Multimodal Large Language Model capabilities in spatial intelligence. These results show that metric depth estimation can benefit from the same scaling laws that drive modern foundation models, establishing a new path toward scalable and efficient real-world metric perception. We open-source MetricAnything at http://metric-anything.github.io/metric-anything-io/ to support community research.

Result: The method outperforms prior baselines on multiple datasets (CelebA-HQ, Virtual KITTI, CLEVR, Falcor3D) with lower FID scores and better disentanglement metrics (MIG, MCC). It also improves robotic video trajectory generation.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances factor discovery and compositional generation, demonstrating novel applications in robotic video trajectories for increased state-space coverage.

Abstract: Decomposing complex data into factorized representations can reveal reusable components and enable synthesizing new samples via component recombination. We investigate this in the context of diffusion-based models that learn factorized latent spaces without factor-level supervision. In images, factors can capture background, illumination, and object attributes; in robotic videos, they can capture reusable motion components. To improve both latent factor discovery and quality of compositional generation, we introduce an adversarial training signal via a discriminator trained to distinguish between single-source samples and those generated by recombining factors across sources. By optimizing the generator to fool this discriminator, we encourage physical and semantic consistency in the resulting recombinations. Our method outperforms implementations of prior baselines on CelebA-HQ, Virtual KITTI, CLEVR, and Falcor3D, achieving lower FID scores and better disentanglement as measured by MIG and MCC. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel application to robotic video trajectories: by recombining learned action components, we generate diverse sequences that significantly increase state-space coverage for exploration on the LIBERO benchmark.

TL;DR: Vision-DeepResearch introduces a multimodal deep-research paradigm for MLLMs, enabling multi-turn, multi-entity, and multi-scale visual and textual searches to handle real-world noise and complex questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior MLLM approaches struggle with naive multimodal search assumptions, limited reasoning depth, and search breadth, failing in real-world scenarios with visual noise and complex queries.

Method: Proposes Vision-DeepResearch, a framework for multi-turn, multi-entity, and multi-scale searches, trained via cold-start supervision and RL to enhance MLLMs' deep-research capabilities.

Result: Outperforms existing MLLMs and workflows based on strong closed-source models like GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet.

Conclusion: Vision-DeepResearch significantly advances MLLMs' ability to handle complex, noisy multimodal searches.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a broad range of vision tasks. However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM. It substantially outperforming existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs, and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation model such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-4-Sonnet. The code will be released in https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-DeepResearch.

### [79] [BLO-Inst: Bi-Level Optimization Based Alignment of YOLO and SAM for Robust Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22061)
*Li Zhang,Pengtao Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLO-Inst bridges the gap between object detection and segmentation by aligning their objectives through bi-level optimization, enabling better automated prompting for SAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pipelines for automating SAM's prompts suffer from objective mismatch and alignment overfitting, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: BLO-Inst uses bi-level optimization: fine-tuning SAM on one data subset while updating the detector on another to generate segmentation-aware prompts.

Result: BLO-Inst outperforms standard baselines in general and biomedical tasks, achieving superior segmentation performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully aligns detection and segmentation objectives, improving automated prompting for SAM.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model has revolutionized image segmentation with its zero-shot capabilities, yet its reliance on manual prompts hinders fully automated deployment. While integrating object detectors as prompt generators offers a pathway to automation, existing pipelines suffer from two fundamental limitations: objective mismatch, where detectors optimized for geometric localization do not correspond to the optimal prompting context required by SAM, and alignment overfitting in standard joint training, where the detector simply memorizes specific prompt adjustments for training samples rather than learning a generalizable policy. To bridge this gap, we introduce BLO-Inst, a unified framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives by bi-level optimization. We formulate the alignment as a nested optimization problem over disjoint data splits. In the lower level, the SAM is fine-tuned to maximize segmentation fidelity given the current detection proposals on a subset ($D_1$). In the upper level, the detector is updated to generate bounding boxes that explicitly minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM on a separate subset ($D_2$). This effectively transforms the detector into a segmentation-aware prompt generator, optimizing the bounding boxes not just for localization accuracy, but for downstream mask quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BLO-Inst achieves superior performance, outperforming standard baselines on tasks in general and biomedical domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a 3D asset-referenced diffusion model integrating multi-view RGB images and point maps for consistent image generation with 3D references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use single-image references, lacking versatility with 3D assets. This work aims to integrate 3D assets for more practical applications.

Method: Uses a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception to jointly model colors and canonical-space coordinates of 3D assets.

Result: Achieves precise consistency between generated images and 3D references, linking 2D image attributes with 3D asset attributes.

Conclusion: Opens new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation by effectively leveraging 3D assets.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a 3D asset-referenced diffusion model for image generation, exploring how to integrate 3D assets into image diffusion models. Existing reference-based image generation methods leverage large-scale pretrained diffusion models and demonstrate strong capability in generating diverse images conditioned on a single reference image. However, these methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility. To address this gap, we present a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that leverages multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model their colors and canonical-space coordinates, achieving precise consistency between generated images and the 3D references. Our spatially aligned dual-branch generation architecture and domain-decoupled generation mechanism ensure the simultaneous generation of two spatially aligned but content-disentangled outputs, RGB images and point maps, linking 2D image attributes with 3D asset attributes. Experiments show that our approach effectively uses 3D assets as references to produce images consistent with the given assets, opening new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to produce novel, high-quality images that push imaginative boundaries drives this research.

Result: The method effectively generates unique, novel, and visually captivating images, as demonstrated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: This work offers a principled approach to enhance creativity in generative models, providing innovative solutions for visual content synthesis.

Abstract: Creative image generation has emerged as a compelling area of research, driven by the need to produce novel and high-quality images that expand the boundaries of imagination. In this work, we propose a novel framework for creative generation using diffusion models, where creativity is associated with the inverse probability of an image's existence in the CLIP embedding space. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a manual blending of concepts or exclusion of subcategories, our method calculates the probability distribution of generated images and drives it towards low-probability regions to produce rare, imaginative, and visually captivating outputs. We also introduce pullback mechanisms, achieving high creativity without sacrificing visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our creative generation framework, showcasing its ability to produce unique, novel, and thought-provoking images. This work provides a new perspective on creativity in generative models, offering a principled method to foster innovation in visual content synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative video models lack the ability to edit pre-recorded videos while maintaining critical elements like motion and lip synchronization.

Method: EditYourself augments a general-purpose video diffusion model with audio conditioning and region-aware training extensions for precise edits and lip sync.

Result: The framework achieves accurate lip synchronization, temporal coherence, and realistic motion synthesis in edited videos, maintaining visual fidelity and identity consistency.

Conclusion: EditYourself advances generative video models as practical tools for professional post-production.

Abstract: Current generative video models excel at producing novel content from text and image prompts, but leave a critical gap in editing existing pre-recorded videos, where minor alterations to the spoken script require preserving motion, temporal coherence, speaker identity, and accurate lip synchronization. We introduce EditYourself, a DiT-based framework for audio-driven video-to-video (V2V) editing that enables transcript-based modification of talking head videos, including the seamless addition, removal, and retiming of visually spoken content. Building on a general-purpose video diffusion model, EditYourself augments its V2V capabilities with audio conditioning and region-aware, edit-focused training extensions. This enables precise lip synchronization and temporally coherent restructuring of existing performances via spatiotemporal inpainting, including the synthesis of realistic human motion in newly added segments, while maintaining visual fidelity and identity consistency over long durations. This work represents a foundational step toward generative video models as practical tools for professional video post-production.

TL;DR: ePAI, an AI system, improves early detection of pancreatic cancer with high sensitivity and specificity, outperforming radiologists in identifying small tumors on prediagnostic CT scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is often diagnosed late, leading to poor outcomes. Early detection could improve survival rates.

Method: The AI system ePAI was trained on 1,598 patient scans from one center and tested internally (1,009 patients) and externally (7,158 patients across 6 centers).

Result: ePAI achieved high AUC (0.918-0.999), sensitivity (91.5-95.3%), and specificity (88.0-98.7%), detecting tumors as small as 2 mm. It identified overlooked tumors up to 36 months before clinical diagnosis.

Conclusion: ePAI outperformed radiologists and shows promise as an assistive tool for early PDAC detection, potentially improving patient outcomes.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the deadliest solid malignancies, is often detected at a late and inoperable stage. Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists. It successfully detected and localized PDACs in 75 of 159 patients, with a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis. Our multi-reader study showed that ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists by 50.3% (P < 0.05) in sensitivity while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4% in detecting PDACs early and prediagnostic. These findings suggest its potential of ePAI as an assistive tool to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer.

TL;DR: PI-Light is a two-stage framework using physics-inspired diffusion models to improve full-image relighting, addressing challenges like data scarcity and physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in the difficulty of collecting paired data, maintaining physical plausibility, and improving generalizability in full-image relighting.

Method: PI-Light incorporates batch-aware attention, physics-guided neural rendering, physics-inspired losses, and a curated dataset for training diffusion models.

Result: The framework achieves superior generalization to real-world scenes, synthesizing specular highlights and diffuse reflections effectively.

Conclusion: PI-Light sets a solid benchmark for full-image relighting, outperforming prior approaches in real-world applications.

Abstract: Full-image relighting remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of collecting large-scale structured paired data, the difficulty of maintaining physical plausibility, and the limited generalizability imposed by data-driven priors. Existing attempts to bridge the synthetic-to-real gap for full-scene relighting remain suboptimal. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Physics-Inspired diffusion for full-image reLight ($π$-Light, or PI-Light), a two-stage framework that leverages physics-inspired diffusion models. Our design incorporates (i) batch-aware attention, which improves the consistency of intrinsic predictions across a collection of images, (ii) a physics-guided neural rendering module that enforces physically plausible light transport, (iii) physics-inspired losses that regularize training dynamics toward a physically meaningful landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability to real-world image editing, and (iv) a carefully curated dataset of diverse objects and scenes captured under controlled lighting conditions. Together, these components enable efficient finetuning of pretrained diffusion models while also providing a solid benchmark for downstream evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that $π$-Light synthesizes specular highlights and diffuse reflections across a wide variety of materials, achieving superior generalization to real-world scenes compared with prior approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VI-Probe framework analyzes VLMs' responses to visual illusions, revealing varied causes for response persistence and emphasizing the need for probing-based evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why VLMs persistently answer visual illusions incorrectly despite obvious changes, moving beyond observations to systematic analysis.

Method: Introduces VI-Probe, a framework with graded perturbations and matched controls to disentangle perception from recall, using metrics like Polarity-Flip Consistency.

Result: VLMs exhibit response persistence due to varied mechanisms (e.g., memory override, perception-memory competition), challenging single-cause explanations.

Conclusion: Probing-based evaluation is crucial to assess both knowledge and sensitivity to visual changes, as VLMs' behavior is complex and heterogeneous.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often answer classic visual illusions "correctly" on original images, yet persist with the same responses when illusion factors are inverted, even though the visual change is obvious to humans. This raises a fundamental question: do VLMs perceive visual changes or merely recall memorized patterns? While several studies have noted this phenomenon, the underlying causes remain unclear. To move from observations to systematic understanding, this paper introduces VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls (without illusion inducer) that disentangles visually grounded perception from language-driven recall. Unlike prior work that focuses on averaged accuracy, we measure stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized against matched controls. Experiments across different families reveal that response persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism. For instance, GPT-5 exhibits memory override, Claude-Opus-4.1 shows perception-memory competition, while Qwen variants suggest visual-processing limits. Our findings challenge single-cause views and motivate probing-based evaluation that measures both knowledge and sensitivity to controlled visual change.

TL;DR: UEval is a benchmark evaluating unified models capable of generating both images and text, using expert-curated questions and a rubric-based scoring system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating open-ended multimodal generation accurately, moving beyond simple LLM-as-a-judge methods.

Method: UEval uses 1,000 curated questions requiring multimodal outputs, sourced from 8 real-world tasks, and employs a rubric-based scoring system refined by human experts.

Result: Current unified models perform moderately (GPT-5-Thinking: 66.4/100; best open-source model: 49.1/100), with reasoning models outperforming non-reasoning ones.

Conclusion: Reasoning capabilities are crucial for complex multimodal understanding and generation tasks.

Abstract: We introduce UEval, a benchmark to evaluate unified models, i.e., models capable of generating both images and text. UEval comprises 1,000 expert-curated questions that require both images and text in the model output, sourced from 8 real-world tasks. Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations. Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is non-trivial, as simple LLM-as-a-judge methods can miss the subtleties. Different from previous works that rely on multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rate image quality or text accuracy, we design a rubric-based scoring system in UEval. For each question, reference images and text answers are provided to a MLLM to generate an initial rubric, consisting of multiple evaluation criteria, and human experts then refine and validate these rubrics. In total, UEval contains 10,417 validated rubric criteria, enabling scalable and fine-grained automatic scoring. UEval is challenging for current unified models: GPT-5-Thinking scores only 66.4 out of 100, while the best open-source model reaches merely 49.1. We observe that reasoning models often outperform non-reasoning ones, and transferring reasoning traces from a reasoning model to a non-reasoning model significantly narrows the gap. This suggests that reasoning may be important for tasks requiring complex multimodal understanding and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes 'pixel MeanFlow' (pMF) for one-step latent-free image generation, achieving strong results on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance diffusion/flow models by addressing the challenges of multi-step sampling and latent space operation, aiming for efficient one-step generation without latents.

Method: Formulates the network output space and loss space separately, with network targets on a low-dimensional image manifold and losses defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space.

Result: Achieves 2.22 FID at 256x256 and 2.48 FID at 512x512 resolution on ImageNet.

Conclusion: pMF fills a key gap in one-step latent-free generation and advances diffusion/flow model boundaries.

Abstract: Modern diffusion/flow-based models for image generation typically exhibit two core characteristics: (i) using multi-step sampling, and (ii) operating in a latent space. Recent advances have made encouraging progress on each aspect individually, paving the way toward one-step diffusion/flow without latents. In this work, we take a further step towards this goal and propose "pixel MeanFlow" (pMF). Our core guideline is to formulate the network output space and the loss space separately. The network target is designed to be on a presumed low-dimensional image manifold (i.e., x-prediction), while the loss is defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space. We introduce a simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field. In experiments, pMF achieves strong results for one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution (2.22 FID) and 512x512 resolution (2.48 FID), filling a key missing piece in this regime. We hope that our study will further advance the boundaries of diffusion/flow-based generative models.

TL;DR: DeepSearchQA is a 900-prompt benchmark evaluating agents on complex multi-step information-seeking tasks across 17 fields, testing capabilities like fragmented information collation, de-duplication, and stopping criteria reasoning. It reveals significant limitations in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional benchmarks focus on single answer retrieval or broad factuality, lacking evaluation of complex search planning and exhaustive answer generation. DeepSearchQA addresses this gap.

Method: DeepSearchQA features handcrafted tasks structured as causal chains, requiring multi-step search plans and context retention. Tasks are grounded in the open web with verifiable answers.

Result: State-of-the-art agents struggle with balancing recall and precision, showing failure modes like premature stopping or low-confidence answers.

Conclusion: DeepSearchQA highlights critical gaps in agent designs and serves as a diagnostic tool for advancing robust deep-research capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce DeepSearchQA, a 900-prompt benchmark for evaluating agents on difficult multi-step information-seeking tasks across 17 different fields. Unlike traditional benchmarks that target single answer retrieval or broad-spectrum factuality, DeepSearchQA features a dataset of challenging, handcrafted tasks designed to evaluate an agent's ability to execute complex search plans to generate exhaustive answer lists. This shift in design explicitly tests three critical, yet under-evaluated capabilities: 1) systematic collation of fragmented information from disparate sources, 2) de-duplication and entity resolution to ensure precision, and 3) the ability to reason about stopping criteria within an open-ended search space. Each task is structured as a causal chain, where discovering information for one step is dependent on the successful completion of the previous one, stressing long-horizon planning and context retention. All tasks are grounded in the open web with objectively verifiable answer sets. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art agent architectures reveals significant performance limitations: even the most advanced models struggle to balance high recall with precision. We observe distinct failure modes ranging from premature stopping (under-retrieval) to hedging behaviors, where agents cast an overly wide net of low-confidence answers to artificially boost recall. These findings highlight critical headroom in current agent designs and position DeepSearchQA as an essential diagnostic tool for driving future research toward more robust, deep-research capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces improvements in speech recognition evaluation, including a new alignment algorithm for multi-reference labeling and better word alignment, focusing on non-Latin languages. It also presents DiverseSpeech-Ru, a new Russian speech dataset, and highlights potential pitfalls of dataset-specific labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance speech recognition evaluation by addressing challenges in multi-reference labeling, word alignment, and dataset-specific biases, especially for non-Latin languages.

Method: Proposes a string alignment algorithm, collects DiverseSpeech-Ru dataset, performs multi-reference relabeling, and develops tools for streaming evaluation and transcription comparison.

Result: Demonstrates that models may adopt dataset-specific labeling, creating misleading metric improvements. Tools for streaming evaluation and visual comparison are developed.

Conclusion: The improvements and tools provide better evaluation frameworks for speech recognition, particularly benefiting non-Latin languages.

Abstract: We propose several improvements to the speech recognition evaluation. First, we propose a string alignment algorithm that supports both multi-reference labeling, arbitrary-length insertions and better word alignment. This is especially useful for non-Latin languages, those with rich word formation, to label cluttered or longform speech. Secondly, we collect a novel test set DiverseSpeech-Ru of longform in-the-wild Russian speech with careful multi-reference labeling. We also perform multi-reference relabeling of popular Russian tests set and study fine-tuning dynamics on its corresponding train set. We demonstrate that the model often adopts to dataset-specific labeling, causing an illusion of metric improvement. Based on the improved word alignment, we develop tools to evaluate streaming speech recognition and to align multiple transcriptions to compare them visually. Additionally, we provide uniform wrappers for many offline and streaming speech recognition models. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: This paper explores limitations of using MSE loss for fine-tuning SE models with SSL representations, proposing position-invariant fine-tuning strategies like zero-padding and soft-DTW loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MSE loss in fine-tuning SE models with SSL representations exploits positional embeddings, reducing reliance on content-related information.

Method: Two strategies are tested: zero-padding during fine-tuning and speed perturbations with soft-DTW loss.

Result: The soft-DTW approach shows faster convergence and better downstream performance.

Conclusion: Position-invariant fine-tuning is crucial for effective SSL-based speech modeling.

Abstract: Integrating front-end speech enhancement (SE) models with self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech models is effective for downstream tasks in noisy conditions. SE models are commonly fine-tuned using SSL representations with mean squared error (MSE) loss between enhanced and clean speech. However, MSE is prone to exploiting positional embeddings in SSL models, allowing the objective to be minimised through positional correlations instead of content-related information. This work frames the problem as a general limitation of self-supervised representation fine-tuning and investigates it through representation-guided SE. Two strategies are considered: (1) zero-padding, previously explored in SSL pre-training but here examined in the fine-tuning setting, and (2) speed perturbations with a soft-DTW loss. Experiments show that the soft-DTW-based approach achieves faster convergence and improved downstream performance, underscoring the importance of position-invariant fine-tuning in SSL-based speech modelling.

Conclusion: ChunkWise LoRA is a compatible, efficient solution for deploying parameter-efficient LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have enabled efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) with minimal additional parameters. However, existing LoRA methods apply static rank configurations uniformly across all input tokens, ignoring variation in token complexity and computational requirements. In this work, we propose ChunkWise LoRA, a dynamic and adaptive approach that partitions sequences into variable-length chunks based on token complexity and assigns each chunk a tailored low-rank configuration. Our system introduces a runtime scheduler that estimates token difficulty, performs adaptive chunking, and selects per-chunk LoRA rank and scaling using a rank-ladder mechanism. To preserve output consistency, we further introduce a boundary-safe composition module and integrate policy-driven KV-cache strategies. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Wikitext-103 and SQuAD demonstrate that ChunkWise LoRA achieves up to 34\% lower latency and 38% memory reduction compared to baseline LoRA, while maintaining or improving task performance metrics like BLEU, EM, and perplexity. The proposed framework remains fully compatible with existing transformer architectures and inference frameworks, providing a practical solution for real-world deployment of parameter-efficient LLMs.

### [93] [Multi-task Code LLMs: Data Mix or Model Merge?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21115)
*Mingzhi Zhu,Boris Sobolev,Rahul Krishna,Raju Pavuluri,Stacy Patterson,Michele Merler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparing data mixing and model merging for multi-task code LLMs, merging excels at larger scales while data mixing is better for smaller models. Merged models can outperform task-specific ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interest in efficient multi-task learning strategies for small, specialized code LLMs to balance performance, constraints, and costs.

Method: Experiments with Qwen Coder and DeepSeek Coder models (2B and 7B parameters) for code generation and summarization, evaluating on HumanEval, MBPP, and CodeXGlue benchmarks.

Result: Model merging retains 96% of specialized model performance on code generation and can surpass individually fine-tuned models. Data mixing is better for smaller scales.

Conclusion: Careful merging and mixing strategies effectively combine task-specific capabilities without significant performance loss, ideal for resource-constrained deployments.

Abstract: Recent research advocates deploying smaller, specialized code LLMs in agentic frameworks alongside frontier models, sparking interest in efficient strategies for multi-task learning that balance performance, constraints, and costs. We compare two approaches for creating small, multi-task code LLMs: data mixing versus model merging. We conduct extensive experiments across two model families (Qwen Coder and DeepSeek Coder) at two scales (2B and 7B parameters), fine-tuning them for code generation and code summarization tasks. Our evaluation on HumanEval, MBPP, and CodeXGlue benchmarks reveals that model merging achieves the best overall performance at larger scale across model families, retaining 96% of specialized model performance on code generation tasks while maintaining summarization capabilities. Notably, merged models can even surpass individually fine-tuned models, with our best configuration of Qwen Coder 2.5 7B model achieving 92.7% Pass@1 on HumanEval compared to 90.9% for its task-specific fine-tuned equivalent. At a smaller scale we find instead data mixing to be a preferred strategy. We further introduce a weight analysis technique to understand how different tasks affect model parameters and their implications for merging strategies. The results suggest that careful merging and mixing strategies can effectively combine task-specific capabilities without significant performance degradation, making them ideal for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

*Noah Dasanaike*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) can accurately infer ethnicity from names without additional training, outperforming BISG, especially outside the US, and reducing income bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve ethnicity inference from names beyond BISG's limitations, enabling broader applicability and fairness.

Method: Evaluated six LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, DeepSeek v3.2) on stratified voter samples, validating with diverse datasets including Indian MPs and Lebanese voter registrations.

Result: LLMs achieved up to 84.7% accuracy, outperforming BISG (68.2%), and reduced income bias. Extended reasoning and metadata improved results further.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a scalable, accurate alternative to BISG for ethnicity inference, with potential for global deployment via fine-tuned small models.

Abstract: I demonstrate that large language models can infer ethnicity from names with accuracy exceeding that of Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) without additional training data, enabling inference outside the United States and to contextually appropriate classification categories. Using stratified samples from Florida and North Carolina voter files with self-reported race, LLM-based classification achieves up to 84.7% accuracy, outperforming BISG (68.2%) on balanced samples. I test six models including Gemini 3 Flash, GPT-4o, and open-source alternatives such as DeepSeek v3.2 and GLM-4.7. Enabling extended reasoning can improve accuracy by 1-3 percentage points, though effects vary across contexts; including metadata such as party registration reaches 86.7%. LLM classification also reduces the income bias inherent in BISG, where minorities in wealthier neighborhoods are systematically misclassified as White. I further validate using Lebanese voter registration with religious sect (64.3% accuracy), Indian MPs from reserved constituencies (99.2%), and Indian land records with caste classification (74.0%). Aggregate validation across India, Uganda, Nepal, Armenia, Chile, and Costa Rica using original full-count voter rolls demonstrates that the method recovers known population distributions where naming conventions are distinctive. For large-scale applications, small transformer models fine-tuned on LLM labels exceed BISG accuracy while enabling local deployment at no cost.

### [95] [EnsembleLink: Accurate Record Linkage Without Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21138)
*Noah Dasanaike*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EnsembleLink is a high-accuracy record linkage method using pre-trained language models, requiring no labeled training data and completing tasks quickly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Record linkage is crucial for social science but lacks methodological rigor, often introducing errors without quantifying uncertainty. Existing methods are either inaccurate or require extensive labeled data.

Method: EnsembleLink leverages pre-trained language models to understand semantic relationships between entities (e.g., locations, names, organizations) without labeled data.

Result: EnsembleLink matches or outperforms methods needing extensive labeling across benchmarks (city names, person names, organizations, multilingual parties, bibliographic records). It runs locally on open-source models, completing tasks in minutes.

Conclusion: EnsembleLink addresses the limitations of traditional record linkage methods by achieving high accuracy without labeled data, making it practical and efficient for social science research.

Abstract: Record linkage, the process of matching records that refer to the same entity across datasets, is essential to empirical social science but remains methodologically underdeveloped. Researchers treat it as a preprocessing step, applying ad hoc rules without quantifying the uncertainty that linkage errors introduce into downstream analyses. Existing methods either achieve low accuracy or require substantial labeled training data. I present EnsembleLink, a method that achieves high accuracy without any training labels. EnsembleLink leverages pre-trained language models that have learned semantic relationships (e.g., that "South Ozone Park" is a neighborhood in "New York City" or that "Lutte ouvriere" refers to the Trotskyist "Workers' Struggle" party) from large text corpora. On benchmarks spanning city names, person names, organizations, multilingual political parties, and bibliographic records, EnsembleLink matches or exceeds methods requiring extensive labeling. The method runs locally on open-source models, requiring no external API calls, and completes typical linkage tasks in minutes.

*Tobias Materzok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OS-Search transforms LLM generation into endpoint search by targeting points in a frozen output space, enabling parallel sweeps and black-box optimization, improving diversity and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the diversity and effectiveness of LLM outputs without relying on path-dependent token or program search.

Method: Uses an outer loop to select targets in a 3D output space, with a retrieval-grounded policy trained via sequence-level RL to generate outputs near the target under autoregressive decoding.

Result: Achieves 3.1x higher diversity in stories and improves code optimization under matched inference budgets while maintaining validity.

Conclusion: OS-Search provides a scalable and efficient approach to improving LLM outputs by leveraging output-space targeting.

Abstract: We introduce Output-Space Search (OS-Search), which turns LLM generation into endpoint search. An outer loop selects a target z* in a frozen encoder-defined 3D output space Z, and a retrieval-grounded policy trained with sequence-level RL generates outputs whose coordinates land near z* under standard autoregressive decoding. This enables parallel sweeps and black-box optimization in Z without path-dependent token/program search. On stories, sweeping Z (text) yields 3.1x higher LLM-scored diversity than prompt-chaining. On code, Bayesian optimization over Z (code) improves an objective withheld from the controller under matched inference budgets while preserving validity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OG-MAR improves cultural alignment in LLMs by using an ontology-guided multi-agent framework grounded in demographic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often misalign culturally due to biased pretraining data and lack structured value representations.

Method: OG-MAR summarizes values from WVS, builds a cultural ontology, and uses multi-agent reasoning with demographic grounding.

Result: OG-MAR outperforms baselines in cultural alignment and robustness while providing transparent reasoning.

Conclusion: OG-MAR offers a promising approach to culturally sensitive decision-making in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly support culturally sensitive decision making, yet often exhibit misalignment due to skewed pretraining data and the absence of structured value representations. Existing methods can steer outputs, but often lack demographic grounding and treat values as independent, unstructured signals, reducing consistency and interpretability. We propose OG-MAR, an Ontology-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning framework. OG-MAR summarizes respondent-specific values from the World Values Survey (WVS) and constructs a global cultural ontology by eliciting relations over a fixed taxonomy via competency questions. At inference time, it retrieves ontology-consistent relations and demographically similar profiles to instantiate multiple value-persona agents, whose outputs are synthesized by a judgment agent that enforces ontology consistency and demographic proximity. Experiments on regional social-survey benchmarks across four LLM backbones show that OG-MAR improves cultural alignment and robustness over competitive baselines, while producing more transparent reasoning traces.

*Xiulin Yang,Heidi Getz,Ethan Gotlieb Wilcox*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the statistical conditions aiding hierarchical structure learning from linear input, focusing on function words' roles across languages and their impact on neural learners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how function words' statistical properties (frequency, syntactic association, boundary alignment) support language acquisition and hierarchical learning.

Method: Cross-linguistic corpus analysis of 186 languages, counterfactual language modeling, and ablation experiments to evaluate property contributions.

Result: Languages with all three properties are easier for neural learners; frequency and structural association matter more than boundary alignment. Learning conditions influence reliance on function words.

Conclusion: Function words' statistical properties are crucial for hierarchical learning, but their impact varies, highlighting diverse internal learning mechanisms.

Abstract: What statistical conditions support learning hierarchical structure from linear input? In this paper, we address this question by focusing on the statistical distribution of function words. Function words have long been argued to play a crucial role in language acquisition due to their distinctive distributional properties, including high frequency, reliable association with syntactic structure, and alignment with phrase boundaries. We use cross-linguistic corpus analysis to first establish that all three properties are present across 186 studied languages. Next, we use a combination of counterfactual language modeling and ablation experiments to show that language variants preserving all three properties are more easily acquired by neural learners, with frequency and structural association contributing more strongly than boundary alignment. Follow-up probing and ablation analyses further reveal that different learning conditions lead to systematically different reliance on function words, indicating that similar performance can arise from distinct internal mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores embedding scaling as an alternative to MoE architectures for sparsity scaling in large language models, demonstrating superior performance in specific regimes and introducing LongCat-Flash-Lite, a competitive 68.5B parameter model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address diminishing returns and system bottlenecks in MoE architectures by investigating embedding scaling as an orthogonal approach for sparsity scaling.

Method: Comprehensive analysis and experiments to identify regimes where embedding scaling outperforms expert scaling, including architectural factors like parameter budgeting and model dimensions. System optimizations and speculative decoding are used to convert sparsity into inference speedups.

Result: LongCat-Flash-Lite, a 68.5B parameter model with ~3B activated parameters, surpasses MoE baselines and performs competitively in agentic and coding tasks.

Conclusion: Embedding scaling offers a viable and effective alternative to MoE for sparsity scaling, with practical benefits demonstrated through LongCat-Flash-Lite.

Abstract: While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become the standard for sparsity scaling in large language models, they increasingly face diminishing returns and system-level bottlenecks. In this work, we explore embedding scaling as a potent, orthogonal dimension for scaling sparsity. Through a comprehensive analysis and experiments, we identify specific regimes where embedding scaling achieves a superior Pareto frontier compared to expert scaling. We systematically characterize the critical architectural factors governing this efficacy -- ranging from parameter budgeting to the interplay with model width and depth. Moreover, by integrating tailored system optimizations and speculative decoding, we effectively convert this sparsity into tangible inference speedups. Guided by these insights, we introduce LongCat-Flash-Lite, a 68.5B parameter model with ~3B activated trained from scratch. Despite allocating over 30B parameters to embeddings, LongCat-Flash-Lite not only surpasses parameter-equivalent MoE baselines but also exhibits exceptional competitiveness against existing models of comparable scale, particularly in agentic and coding domains.

*Eunjung Yeo,Julie M. Liss,Visar Berisha,David R. Mortensen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multilingual phoneme-production assessment framework is proposed for dysarthric speech, combining universal phone recognition with language-specific phoneme interpretation. It introduces three metrics: PER, PFER, and PhonCov, showing effectiveness in capturing intelligibility degradation across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in neurological disorders causing dysarthria necessitates automated intelligibility assessment methods applicable across languages, addressing the limitations of existing single-language approaches.

Method: The framework integrates universal phone recognition with language-specific phoneme interpretation, using contrastive phonological feature distances for mapping and sequence alignment, yielding PER, PFER, and PhonCov metrics.

Result: Analysis on English, Spanish, Italian, and Tamil reveals PER benefits from mapping and alignment, PFER from alignment, and PhonCov from mapping. The framework captures clinically meaningful dysarthria patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed multilingual framework effectively assesses dysarthric speech intelligibility by combining universal and language-specific methods, demonstrating its clinical relevance across diverse languages.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of neurological disorders associated with dysarthria motivates the need for automated intelligibility assessment methods that are applicalbe across languages. However, most existing approaches are either limited to a single language or fail to capture language-specific factors shaping intelligibility. We present a multilingual phoneme-production assessment framework that integrates universal phone recognition with language-specific phoneme interpretation using contrastive phonological feature distances for phone-to-phoneme mapping and sequence alignment. The framework yields three metrics: phoneme error rate (PER), phonological feature error rate (PFER), and a newly proposed alignment-free measure, phoneme coverage (PhonCov). Analysis on English, Spanish, Italian, and Tamil show that PER benefits from the combination of mapping and alignment, PFER from alignment alone, and PhonCov from mapping. Further analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework captures clinically meaningful patterns of intelligibility degradation consistent with established observations of dysarthric speech.

*Zhaoyi Li,Jiatong Li,Gangwei Jiang,Linqi Song,Defu Lian,Ying Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoT reasoning in LLMs shows performance drops in hop generalization due to erroneous attention heads, which can be dynamically corrected.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs fail in reasoning hop generalization and develop a method to mitigate it.

Method: Identify and deactivate erroneous attention heads (ep heads) during inference to correct reasoning errors.

Result: Dynamic correction improves reasoning hop generalization across tasks and LLMs.

Conclusion: Test-time correction is an effective, lightweight solution for improving CoT reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has become the standard paradigm for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex problems. However, recent studies reveal a sharp performance drop in reasoning hop generalization scenarios, where the required number of reasoning steps exceeds training distributions while the underlying algorithm remains unchanged. The internal mechanisms driving this failure remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on tasks from multiple domains, and find that errors concentrate at token positions of a few critical error types, rather than being uniformly distributed. Closer inspection reveals that these token-level erroneous predictions stem from internal competition mechanisms: certain attention heads, termed erroneous processing heads (ep heads), tip the balance by amplifying incorrect reasoning trajectories while suppressing correct ones. Notably, removing individual ep heads during inference can often restore the correct predictions. Motivated by these insights, we propose test-time correction of reasoning, a lightweight intervention method that dynamically identifies and deactivates ep heads in the reasoning process. Extensive experiments across different tasks and LLMs show that it consistently improves reasoning hop generalization, highlighting both its effectiveness and potential.

*Christopher Adrian Kusuma,Muhammad Reza Qorib,Hwee Tou Ng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses LLMs' tendency to hallucinate when unsure and proposes a robust evaluation benchmark using Pythia's open pretraining data, along with a method to enhance honesty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate incorrect responses due to unawareness of their knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for honesty ('I don't know') when uncertain. Existing evaluations lack robustness by ignoring pretraining knowledge.

Method: The authors utilize Pythia, an open LLM with available pretraining data, to create a benchmark for evaluating honesty. They also propose leveraging pretraining data to improve LLM honesty.

Result: The proposed benchmark provides a robust evaluation of LLM honesty, and the novel method aims to reduce hallucination by making LLMs more aware of their knowledge limits.

Conclusion: The study advances LLM honesty by introducing a robust evaluation framework and a data-driven approach to mitigate hallucination.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly capable of answering questions, but they are often unaware of their own knowledge boundary, i.e., knowing what they know and what they don't know. As a result, they can generate factually incorrect responses on topics they do not have enough knowledge of, commonly known as hallucination. Rather than hallucinating, a language model should be more honest and respond with "I don't know" when it does not have enough knowledge about a topic. Many methods have been proposed to improve LLM honesty, but their evaluations lack robustness, as they do not take into account the knowledge that the LLM has ingested during its pretraining. In this paper, we propose a more robust evaluation benchmark dataset for LLM honesty by utilizing Pythia, a truly open LLM with publicly available pretraining data. In addition, we also propose a novel method for harnessing the pretraining data to build a more honest LLM.

*Alok Abhishek,Tushar Bandopadhyay,Lisa Erickson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SHARP framework evaluates social harm in LLMs using multidimensional, distribution-aware metrics, revealing significant variations in worst-case behaviors that average scores miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks oversimplify social risk by relying on mean-centered scores, failing to capture complex, worst-case harms in LLMs.

Method: SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable, decomposing it into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability. It uses CVaR95 for tail-risk analysis and evaluates 11 LLMs on 901 sensitive prompts.

Result: Models with similar average risks showed over twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Bias had the strongest tail severities, while ethical misalignment was consistently lower.

Conclusion: LLM evaluation must adopt multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling to responsibly address social harm beyond scalar averages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, where rare but severe failures can result in irreversible harm. However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling.

Motivation: To consolidate disparate research on model collaboration and establish it as a unified field.

Method: Developed MoCo, a toolkit integrating 26 collaboration methods (e.g., routing, text exchange) and 25 evaluation datasets for benchmarking.

Result: Collaboration strategies outperformed non-collaborative models in 61% of (model, data) settings, with gains up to 25.8%.

Conclusion: MoCo enables scalable, efficient model collaboration and addresses challenges where single models fail, paving the way for decentralized AI.

Abstract: Advancing beyond single monolithic language models (LMs), recent research increasingly recognizes the importance of model collaboration, where multiple LMs collaborate, compose, and complement each other. Existing research on this topic has mostly been disparate and disconnected, from different research communities, and lacks rigorous comparison. To consolidate existing research and establish model collaboration as a school of thought, we present MoCo: a one-stop Python library of executing, benchmarking, and comparing model collaboration algorithms at scale. MoCo features 26 model collaboration methods, spanning diverse levels of cross-model information exchange such as routing, text, logit, and model parameters. MoCo integrates 25 evaluation datasets spanning reasoning, QA, code, safety, and more, while users could flexibly bring their own data. Extensive experiments with MoCo demonstrate that most collaboration strategies outperform models without collaboration in 61.0% of (model, data) settings on average, with the most effective methods outperforming by up to 25.8%. We further analyze the scaling of model collaboration strategies, the training/inference efficiency of diverse methods, highlight that the collaborative system solves problems where single LMs struggle, and discuss future work in model collaboration, all made possible by MoCo. We envision MoCo as a valuable toolkit to facilitate and turbocharge the quest for an open, modular, decentralized, and collaborative AI future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high storage overhead from thousands of visual tokens in MLLMs limits their practicality in Visual Document Retrieval (VDR).

Method: Proposes CausalEmbed, an auto-regressive generation approach with iterative margin loss during contrastive training to learn compact embeddings.

Result: Achieves a 30-155x reduction in token count while maintaining competitive performance across backbones and benchmarks.

Conclusion: CausalEmbed offers efficient VDR with scalable multi-vector representations, highlighting generative paradigms in multimodal retrieval.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) through generating high-quality multi-vector embeddings, the substantial storage overhead caused by representing a page with thousands of visual tokens limits their practicality in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose an auto-regressive generation approach, CausalEmbed, for constructing multi-vector embeddings. By incorporating iterative margin loss during contrastive training, CausalEmbed encourages the embedding models to learn compact and well-structured representations. Our method enables efficient VDR tasks using only dozens of visual tokens, achieving a 30-155x reduction in token count while maintaining highly competitive performance across various backbones and benchmarks. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate the unique advantages of auto-regressive embedding generation in terms of training efficiency and scalability at test time. As a result, CausalEmbed introduces a flexible test-time scaling strategy for multi-vector VDR representations and sheds light on the generative paradigm within multimodal document retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance speech recognition and alignment by leveraging large-scale data and strong audio understanding capabilities.

Method: Utilizes Qwen3-Omni foundation model and conducts comprehensive evaluations beyond open-sourced benchmarks.

Result: Qwen3-ASR-1.7B achieves SOTA performance; Qwen3-ASR-0.6B offers best accuracy-efficiency balance; Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B outperforms competitors.

Conclusion: The models are released under Apache 2.0 to accelerate ASR and audio understanding research.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Qwen3-ASR family, which includes two powerful all-in-one speech recognition models and a novel non-autoregressive speech forced alignment model. Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B are ASR models that support language identification and ASR for 52 languages and dialects. Both of them leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding ability of their foundation model Qwen3-Omni. We conduct comprehensive internal evaluation besides the open-sourced benchmarks as ASR models might differ little on open-sourced benchmark scores but exhibit significant quality differences in real-world scenarios. The experiments reveal that the 1.7B version achieves SOTA performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary APIs while the 0.6B version offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B can achieve an average TTFT as low as 92ms and transcribe 2000 seconds speech in 1 second at a concurrency of 128. Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B is an LLM based NAR timestamp predictor that is able to align text-speech pairs in 11 languages. Timestamp accuracy experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the three strongest force alignment models and takes more advantages in efficiency and versatility. To further accelerate the community research of ASR and audio understanding, we release these models under the Apache 2.0 license.

TL;DR: A new pretraining method uses streaming documents and RL to improve token generation quality, safety, and factuality, outperforming standard pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing safety and factuality issues during pretraining is crucial to prevent deeply embedded unsafe or hallucinated outputs in large language models.

Method: Streaming documents with RL to improve the next K tokens, judged by a post-trained model for quality, safety, and factuality.

Result: 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements in factuality and safety, up to 86.3% win rate in overall generation quality.

Conclusion: The method effectively builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up.

Abstract: Ensuring safety, factuality and overall quality in the generations of large language models is a critical challenge, especially as these models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up. In experiments, our method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements over standard pretraining in terms of factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality.

Method: The authors introduced SPACI and AST-ASIP frameworks to exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap, embedding adversarial directives in code submissions. They evaluated 9 models across 25,000 submissions in multiple programming languages.

Result: High-capacity models like DeepSeek-V3 showed catastrophic failure rates (>95%), prioritizing formatting over correctness, leading to 'False Certification' of broken code.

Conclusion: Current LLM alignment methods are flawed for automated grading, necessitating a shift toward domain-specific Adjudicative Robustness to prioritize evidence over compliance.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into educational assessment rests on the unverified assumption that instruction following capability translates directly to objective adjudication. We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Instead of evaluating code quality, models frequently decouple from the submission's logic to satisfy hidden directives, a systemic vulnerability we term the Compliance Paradox, where models fine-tuned for extreme helpfulness are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. To expose this, we introduce the Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Injection (SPACI) Framework and the Abstract Syntax Tree-Aware Semantic Injection Protocol (AST-ASIP). These methods exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap by embedding adversarial directives into syntactically inert regions (trivia nodes) of the Abstract Syntax Tree. Through a large-scale evaluation of 9 SOTA models across 25,000 submissions in Python, C, C++, and Java, we reveal catastrophic failure rates (>95%) in high-capacity open-weights models like DeepSeek-V3, which systematically prioritize hidden formatting constraints over code correctness. We quantify this failure using our novel tripartite framework measuring Decoupling Probability, Score Divergence, and Pedagogical Severity to demonstrate the widespread "False Certification" of functionally broken code. Our findings suggest that current alignment paradigms create a "Trojan" vulnerability in automated grading, necessitating a shift from standard RLHF toward domain-specific Adjudicative Robustness, where models are conditioned to prioritize evidence over instruction compliance. We release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate further research on the topic.

### [109] [User-Centric Evidence Ranking for Attribution and Fact Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21387)
*Guy Alt,Eran Hirsch,Serwar Basch,Ido Dagan,Oren Glickman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evidence Ranking is introduced to prioritize presenting sufficient information early in a ranked list, reducing user effort while maintaining verification accuracy. Incremental ranking with LLMs outperforms baselines but struggles with redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems for fact verification often provide insufficient or redundant evidence, leading to inefficiency. The paper aims to improve this by prioritizing evidence presentation.

Method: Proposes Evidence Ranking with two approaches: one-shot and incremental ranking. Uses an evaluation framework inspired by IR metrics and aggregates existing datasets for benchmarking.

Result: Incremental ranking with LLMs performs better, capturing complementary evidence more effectively, though balancing sufficiency and redundancy remains challenging.

Conclusion: Evidence Ranking reduces reading effort and improves verification, offering a foundation for more efficient and user-aligned verification systems.

Abstract: Attribution and fact verification are critical challenges in natural language processing for assessing information reliability. While automated systems and Large Language Models (LLMs) aim to retrieve and select concise evidence to support or refute claims, they often present users with either insufficient or overly redundant information, leading to inefficient and error-prone verification. To address this, we propose Evidence Ranking, a novel task that prioritizes presenting sufficient information as early as possible in a ranked list. This minimizes user reading effort while still making all available evidence accessible for sequential verification. We compare two approaches for the new ranking task: one-shot ranking and incremental ranking. We introduce a new evaluation framework, inspired by information retrieval metrics, and construct a unified benchmark by aggregating existing fact verification datasets. Extensive experiments with diverse models show that incremental ranking strategies better capture complementary evidence and that LLM-based methods outperform shallower baselines, while still facing challenges in balancing sufficiency and redundancy. Compared to evidence selection, we conduct a controlled user study and demonstrate that evidence ranking both reduces reading effort and improves verification. This work provides a foundational step toward more interpretable, efficient, and user-aligned information verification systems.

### [110] [Conversation for Non-verifiable Learning: Self-Evolving LLMs through Meta-Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21464)
*Yuan Sui,Bryan Hooi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoNL introduces a multi-agent self-play framework to unify generation, evaluation, and meta-evaluation for improving LLMs in non-verifiable tasks, addressing evaluator limitations and biases without external judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in training LLMs for non-verifiable tasks due to the lack of ground-truth labels and evaluator constraints. Existing LLM-as-Judge approaches are limited by the evaluator's quality and biases.

Method: CoNL employs multi-agent self-play where agents propose, critique, and revise solutions. Critique quality is measured by its impact on improving solutions, enabling joint optimization of generation and judging.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate CoNL's consistent improvements over baselines, with stable training and no reliance on external judges or ground truth.

Conclusion: CoNL effectively meta-evaluates and improves evaluators within LLMs, addressing biases and enhancing performance in non-verifiable tasks through self-play.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for non-verifiable tasks, such as creative writing, dialogue, and ethical reasoning, remains challenging due to the absence of ground-truth labels. While LLM-as-Judge approaches offer a scalable alternative to human feedback, they face a fundamental limitation: performance is constrained by the evaluator's own quality. If the judge cannot recognize good solutions, it cannot provide useful training signals, and evaluation biases (e.g., favoring verbosity over quality) remain unaddressed. This motivates meta-evaluation: the ability to evaluate and improve the evaluator itself. We introduce CoNL, a framework that unifies generation, evaluation, and meta-evaluation through multi-agent self-play. Our key insight: critique quality can be measured by whether it helps others improve their solutions. In CoNL, multiple agents sharing the same policy engage in structured conversations to propose, critique, and revise solutions. Critiques that enable solution improvements earn a diagnostic reward, creating explicit supervision for meta-evaluation and enabling joint optimization of generation and judging capabilities through self-play, without external judges or ground truth. Experiments on five benchmarks show that CoNL achieves consistent improvements over self-rewarding baselines while maintaining stable training.

*Lei Yang,Wei Bi,Chenxi Sun,Renren Jin,Deyi Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SOUP is a token-level framework unifying off- and on-policy RL for language models, improving exploration and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of on-policy RL (low sampling diversity) and policy mismatch from mixing entire off-policy trajectories.

Method: Introduces SOUP, a framework confining off-policy influence to sequence prefixes while generating continuations on-policy, using token-level importance ratios.

Result: Outperforms standard on-policy training and existing off-policy extensions, enhancing exploration and final performance.

Conclusion: SOUP's fine-grained, single-sample mix-policy training effectively balances stability and exploration in RL for language models.

Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL) methods widely used for language model post-training, like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often suffer from limited exploration and early saturation due to low sampling diversity. While off-policy data can help, current approaches that mix entire trajectories cause significant policy mismatch and instability. In this work, we propose the $\textbf{S}$ingle-sample Mix-p$\textbf{O}$licy $\textbf{U}$nified $\textbf{P}$aradigm (SOUP), a framework that unifies off- and on-policy learning within individual samples at the token level. It confines off-policy influence to the prefix of a generated sequence sampled from historical policies, while the continuation is generated on-policy. Through token-level importance ratios, SOUP effectively leverages off-policy information while preserving training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOUP consistently outperforms standard on-policy training and existing off-policy extensions. Our further analysis clarifies how our fine-grained, single-sample mix-policy training can improve both exploration and final performance in LLM RL.

TL;DR: DimStance introduces a dimensional stance resource with valence-arousal annotations, enabling fine-grained stance analysis across languages and domains, and benchmarks pretrained models for VA prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture nuanced affective states underlying stance expressions beyond categorical labels by leveraging valence and arousal dimensions.

Method: Developed DimStance, a resource with VA annotations for 11,746 target aspects in five languages and two domains, and benchmarked pretrained and large language models under regression and prompting settings.

Result: Fine-tuned LLM regressors showed competitive performance, but challenges persisted in low-resource languages, and token-based generation had limitations.

Conclusion: DimStance provides a foundation for multilingual, emotion-aware stance analysis and benchmarking, despite challenges in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Stance detection is an established task that classifies an author's attitude toward a specific target into categories such as Favor, Neutral, and Against. Beyond categorical stance labels, we leverage a long-established affective science framework to model stance along real-valued dimensions of valence (negative-positive) and arousal (calm-active). This dimensional approach captures nuanced affective states underlying stance expressions, enabling fine-grained stance analysis. To this end, we introduce DimStance, the first dimensional stance resource with valence-arousal (VA) annotations. This resource comprises 11,746 target aspects in 7,365 texts across five languages (English, German, Chinese, Nigerian Pidgin, and Swahili) and two domains (politics and environmental protection). To facilitate the evaluation of stance VA prediction, we formulate the dimensional stance regression task, analyze cross-lingual VA patterns, and benchmark pretrained and large language models under regression and prompting settings. Results show competitive performance of fine-tuned LLM regressors, persistent challenges in low-resource languages, and limitations of token-based generation. DimStance provides a foundation for multilingual, emotion-aware, stance analysis and benchmarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited large-scale lexical datasets for Arabic prompted the creation of MURAD to support computational linguistics and lexicographic research.

Method: A hybrid pipeline combining direct text parsing, OCR, and automated reconstruction was used to extract and standardize data from trusted sources.

Result: MURAD includes standardized definitions and metadata for terms across multiple domains, facilitating NLP and educational applications.

Conclusion: The dataset aims to advance Arabic NLP and promote reproducible research in Arabic lexical semantics.

Abstract: Arabic is a linguistically and culturally rich language with a vast vocabulary that spans scientific, religious, and literary domains.

We present MURAD (Multi-domain Unified Reverse Arabic Dictionary), an open lexical dataset with 96,243 word-definition pairs. The data come from trusted reference works and educational sources. Extraction used a hybrid pipeline integrating direct text parsing, optical character recognition, and automated reconstruction. This ensures accuracy and clarity. Each record aligns a target word with its standardized Arabic definition and metadata that identifies the source domain. The dataset covers terms from linguistics, Islamic studies, mathematics, physics, psychology, and engineering. It supports computational linguistics and lexicographic research. Applications include reverse dictionary modeling, semantic retrieval, and educational tools. By releasing this resource, we aim to advance Arabic natural language processing and promote reproducible research on Arabic lexical semantics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LMK pooling improves sequence representation by partitioning sequences into chunks with landmarks, balancing local and long-context performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifies weaknesses in standard pooling methods ([CLS] and mean pooling), which either concentrate information or dilute salient signals.

Method: Introduces Landmark (LMK) pooling: partitions sequences into chunks, inserts landmark tokens, and mean-pools their embeddings.

Result: LMK pooling matches existing methods on short-context tasks and improves long-context performance.

Conclusion: LMK pooling is a practical and scalable alternative to traditional pooling strategies.

Abstract: Representation learning is central to many downstream tasks such as search, clustering, classification, and reranking. State-of-the-art sequence encoders typically collapse a variable-length token sequence to a single vector using a pooling operator, most commonly a special [CLS] token or mean pooling over token embeddings. In this paper, we identify systematic weaknesses of these pooling strategies: [CLS] tends to concentrate information toward the initial positions of the sequence and can under-represent distributed evidence, while mean pooling can dilute salient local signals, sometimes leading to worse short-context performance. To address these issues, we introduce Landmark (LMK) pooling, which partitions a sequence into chunks, inserts landmark tokens between chunks, and forms the final representation by mean-pooling the landmark token embeddings. This simple mechanism improves long-context extrapolation without sacrificing local salient features, at the cost of introducing a small number of special tokens. We empirically demonstrate that LMK pooling matches existing methods on short-context retrieval tasks and yields substantial improvements on long-context tasks, making it a practical and scalable alternative to existing pooling methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: inversedMixup combines Mixup's controllability and LLM-based generation's interpretability by aligning task-specific embeddings with LLM embeddings, enabling human-readable augmented sentences and addressing manifold intrusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mixup lacks interpretability, while LLM-based augmentation lacks control. inversedMixup bridges this gap by leveraging LLM inversion.

Method: inversedMixup uses a three-stage training process to align task-specific embeddings with LLM embeddings, reconstructing mixed embeddings into readable sentences.

Result: The framework improves augmentation performance and provides the first evidence of manifold intrusion in text Mixup, introducing a mitigation strategy.

Conclusion: inversedMixup is effective and generalizable in few-shot and fully supervised scenarios.

Abstract: Mixup generates augmented samples by linearly interpolating inputs and labels with a controllable ratio. However, since it operates in the latent embedding level, the resulting samples are not human-interpretable. In contrast, LLM-based augmentation methods produce sentences via prompts at the token level, yielding readable outputs but offering limited control over the generation process. Inspired by recent advances in LLM inversion, which reconstructs natural language from embeddings and helps bridge the gap between latent embedding space and discrete token space, we propose inversedMixup, a unified framework that combines the controllability of Mixup with the interpretability of LLM-based generation. Specifically, inversedMixup adopts a three-stage training procedure to align the output embedding space of a task-specific model with the input embedding space of an LLM. Upon successful alignment, inversedMixup can reconstruct mixed embeddings with a controllable mixing ratio into human-interpretable augmented sentences, thereby improving the augmentation performance. Additionally, inversedMixup provides the first empirical evidence of the manifold intrusion phenomenon in text Mixup and introduces a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate it. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in both few-shot and fully supervised scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces \method{}, a framework using medical notes to train LLMs for structured clinical history taking and diagnosis, outperforming GPT-4o by +16.9 F1 and +21.0 Top-1 accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in LLMs' performance in dynamic, multi-turn diagnostic settings by leveraging medical notes instead of scarce dialogue data.

Method: Proposes a note-driven framework converting medical notes into dialogues via a decision tree-guided pipeline, followed by a three-stage fine-tuning strategy (supervised learning, simulated data augmentation, preference learning) and a single-turn reasoning paradigm.

Result: Achieves significant improvements over GPT-4o (+16.9 F1, +21.0 Top-1 accuracy).

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances LLMs' clinical reasoning capabilities by leveraging medical notes and innovative training strategies.

Abstract: Effective clinical history taking is a foundational yet underexplored component of clinical reasoning. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on static benchmarks, they often fall short in dynamic, multi-turn diagnostic settings that require iterative questioning and hypothesis refinement. To address this gap, we propose \method{}, a note-driven framework that trains LLMs to conduct structured history taking and diagnosis by learning from widely available medical notes. Instead of relying on scarce and sensitive dialogue data, we convert real-world medical notes into high-quality doctor-patient dialogues using a decision tree-guided generation and refinement pipeline. We then propose a three-stage fine-tuning strategy combining supervised learning, simulated data augmentation, and preference learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel single-turn reasoning paradigm that reframes history taking as a sequence of single-turn reasoning problems. This design enhances interpretability and enables local supervision, dynamic adaptation, and greater sample efficiency. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves clinical reasoning, achieving gains of +16.9 F1 and +21.0 Top-1 diagnostic accuracy over GPT-4o.

TL;DR: ASTRA is an automated framework for training tool-augmented LLMs, combining scalable data synthesis and verifiable reinforcement learning to address challenges in robustness and multi-step decision making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for training tool-using LLMs suffer from manual intervention, reliance on simulations, and unstable long-horizon learning. ASTRA aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: ASTRA integrates two components: a tool-call graph pipeline for synthesizing diverse trajectories and an environment synthesis framework for deterministic RL. It combines SFT and RL with trajectory-level rewards.

Result: ASTRA-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance on tool-use benchmarks, competing with closed-source systems while maintaining reasoning ability.

Conclusion: ASTRA provides a scalable, automated solution for training robust tool-augmented LLMs, advancing multi-step decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as tool-augmented agents for multi-step decision making, yet training robust tool-using agents remains challenging. Existing methods still require manual intervention, depend on non-verifiable simulated environments, rely exclusively on either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), and struggle with stable long-horizon, multi-turn learning. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRA, a fully automated end-to-end framework for training tool-augmented language model agents via scalable data synthesis and verifiable reinforcement learning. ASTRA integrates two complementary components. First, a pipeline that leverages the static topology of tool-call graphs synthesizes diverse, structurally grounded trajectories, instilling broad and transferable tool-use competence. Second, an environment synthesis framework that captures the rich, compositional topology of human semantic reasoning converts decomposed question-answer traces into independent, code-executable, and rule-verifiable environments, enabling deterministic multi-turn RL. Based on this method, we develop a unified training methodology that integrates SFT with online RL using trajectory-level rewards to balance task completion and interaction efficiency. Experiments on multiple agentic tool-use benchmarks demonstrate that ASTRA-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales, approaching closed-source systems while preserving core reasoning ability.

TL;DR: KromHC addresses the challenges of Hyper-Connections (HC) in neural networks by using Kronecker products of smaller doubly stochastic matrices, ensuring exact double stochasticity and reducing parameter complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The issues with HC and mHC include training instability, restricted scalability, inexact doubly stochastic residual matrices, and high parameter complexity. KromHC aims to solve these problems while maintaining performance.

Method: KromHC parametrizes the residual matrix using Kronecker products of smaller doubly stochastic matrices, enforcing manifold constraints across factor residual matrices in a tensorized residual stream.

Result: KromHC guarantees exact double stochasticity of residual matrices, reduces parameter complexity to O(n²C), and matches or outperforms SOTA mHC variants with fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: KromHC effectively addresses the limitations of HC and mHC, offering a scalable and efficient solution for neural network architectures.

Abstract: The success of Hyper-Connections (HC) in neural networks (NN) has also highlighted issues related to its training instability and restricted scalability. The Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) mitigate these challenges by projecting the residual connection space onto a Birkhoff polytope, however, it faces two issues: 1) its iterative Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) algorithm does not always yield exact doubly stochastic residual matrices; 2) mHC incurs a prohibitive $\mathcal{O}(n^3C)$ parameter complexity with $n$ as the width of the residual stream and $C$ as the feature dimension. The recently proposed mHC-lite reparametrizes the residual matrix via the Birkhoff-von-Neumann theorem to guarantee double stochasticity, but also faces a factorial explosion in its parameter complexity, $\mathcal{O} \left( nC \cdot n! \right)$. To address both challenges, we propose \textbf{KromHC}, which uses the \underline{Kro}necker products of smaller doubly stochastic matrices to parametrize the residual matrix in \underline{mHC}. By enforcing manifold constraints across the factor residual matrices along each mode of the tensorized residual stream, KromHC guarantees exact double stochasticity of the residual matrices while reducing parameter complexity to $\mathcal{O}(n^2C)$. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that KromHC matches or even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) mHC variants, while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters.

TL;DR: Using language models to simulate crosslinguistic influence (CLI), this study isolates drivers like language dominance and proficiency, confirming their impact and revealing mechanistic insights into CLI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies in human studies of CLI by leveraging controlled simulations with language models.

Method: Manipulated L1 dominance, L2 proficiency (via age of exposure), and syntactic distance in pretraining. Analyzed CLI using cross-linguistic priming.

Result: Confirmed dominance and proficiency as CLI predictors; bidirectional priming for grammatical structures but dominance-sensitive priming for ungrammatical ones. Demonstrated L1 co-activation during L2 processing.

Conclusion: Language models provide a computational framework to study CLI, aligning with psycholinguistic findings and offering mechanistic insights.

Abstract: Despite the centrality of crosslinguistic influence (CLI) to bilingualism research, human studies often yield conflicting results due to inherent experimental variance. We address these inconsistencies by using language models (LMs) as controlled statistical learners to systematically simulate CLI and isolate its underlying drivers. Specifically, we study the effect of varying the L1 language dominance and the L2 language proficiency, which we manipulate by controlling the L2 age of exposure -- defined as the training step at which the L2 is introduced. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of pretraining on L1 languages with varying syntactic distance from the L2. Using cross-linguistic priming, we analyze how activating L1 structures impacts L2 processing. Our results align with evidence from psycholinguistic studies, confirming that language dominance and proficiency are strong predictors of CLI. We further find that while priming of grammatical structures is bidirectional, the priming of ungrammatical structures is sensitive to language dominance. Finally, we provide mechanistic evidence of CLI in LMs, demonstrating that the L1 is co-activated during L2 processing and directly influences the neural circuitry recruited for the L2. More broadly, our work demonstrates that LMs can serve as a computational framework to inform theories of human CLI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective mechanisms for inference-time control in DLMs are underexplored, prompting the need for a flexible and efficient steering method.

Method: ILRR dynamically aligns internal activations with a reference sequence during denoising, introducing Spatially Modulated Steering for longer texts.

Result: ILRR improves attribute accuracy by 10% to 60% over baselines, maintaining generation quality with minor computational overhead.

Conclusion: ILRR offers a promising, scalable solution for controlled text generation in DLMs.

Abstract: Discrete Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive alternative for text generation, yet effective mechanisms for inference-time control remain relatively underexplored. Existing approaches include sampling-level guidance procedures or trajectory optimization mechanisms. In this work, we introduce Iterative Latent Representation Refinement (ILRR), a learning-free framework for steering DLMs using a single reference sequence. ILRR guides generation by dynamically aligning the internal activations of the generated sequence with those of a given reference throughout the denoising process. This approach captures and transfers high-level semantic properties, with a tunable steering scale enabling flexible control over attributes such as sentiment. We further introduce Spatially Modulated Steering, an extension that enables steering long texts using shorter references by regulating guidance intensity across the sequence. Empirically, we demonstrate that ILRR achieves effective attribute steering on LLaDA and MDLM architectures with a minor computational overhead, requiring only one additional parallel forward pass per denoising step. Under the same compute budget, ILRR improves attribute accuracy over comparable baselines by 10$\%$ to 60$\%$ points, while maintaining high generation quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Subword tokenization adaptation improves efficiency for specific domains/languages by replacing less useful tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard tokenizers are inefficient for specific domains/languages, prompting a need for adaptable solutions.

Method: Proposes post-training adaptation to replace low-utility tokens with relevant ones based on adaptation corpus frequency.

Result: Adapted tokenizers compress test corpora better than baselines with the same vocabulary size.

Conclusion: The method offers lightweight vocabulary fine-tuning for optimized tokenization in specific contexts.

Abstract: Subword tokenization methods, such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), significantly impact the performance and efficiency of large language models (LLMs). The standard approach involves training a general-purpose tokenizer that uniformly processes all textual data during both training and inference. However, the use of a generic set of tokens can incur inefficiencies when applying the model to specific domains or languages. To address this limitation, we propose a post-training adaptation strategy that selectively replaces low-utility tokens with more relevant ones based on their frequency in an adaptation corpus. Our algorithm identifies the token inventory that most effectively encodes the adaptation corpus for a given target vocabulary size. Extensive experiments on generation and classification tasks across multiple languages demonstrate that our adapted tokenizers compress test corpora more effectively than baselines using the same vocabulary size. This method serves as a lightweight adaptation mechanism, akin to a vocabulary fine-tuning process, enabling optimized tokenization for specific domains or tasks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/vijini/Adapt-BPE.git.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes semantic progression in written text as stochastic trajectories using Allan deviation, revealing two dynamical regimes and differences between human and AI-generated text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying dynamics of semantic progression in written text and differentiate human cognition from algorithmic patterns.

Method: Uses Allan deviation on ordered sentence embeddings to analyze stability and coherence of meaning.

Result: Identifies short-time power-law scaling and long-time stability-limited noise floor, showing differences between human and AI text.

Conclusion: Semantic coherence is measurable, providing a framework to distinguish human cognition dynamics from algorithmic models.

Abstract: While language progresses through a sequence of semantic states, the underlying dynamics of this progression remain elusive. Here, we treat the semantic progression of written text as a stochastic trajectory in a high-dimensional state space. We utilize Allan deviation, a tool from precision metrology, to analyze the stability of meaning by treating ordered sentence embeddings as a displacement signal. Our analysis reveals two distinct dynamical regimes: short-time power-law scaling, which differentiates creative literature from technical texts, and a long-time crossover to a stability-limited noise floor. We find that while large language models successfully mimic the local scaling statistics of human text, they exhibit a systematic reduction in their stability horizon. These results establish semantic coherence as a measurable physical property, offering a framework to differentiate the nuanced dynamics of human cognition from the patterns generated by algorithmic models.

TL;DR: RSE enhances LLM reasoning by recycling intermediate insights during test-time search, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing search strategies discard valuable intermediate insights, causing computational redundancy and inefficiency.

Method: Introduces Recycling Search Experience (RSE), a self-guided strategy that distills trajectories into a shared bank for positive and negative recycling.

Result: Theoretically validates efficiency gains; empirically outperforms baselines on benchmarks HMMT24, HMMT25, IMO-Bench, and HLE.

Conclusion: RSE achieves state-of-the-art scaling efficiency by transforming isolated trials into a cumulative process.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling enhances the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models by allocating additional inference compute to broaden the exploration of the solution space. However, existing search strategies typically treat rollouts as disposable samples, where valuable intermediate insights are effectively discarded after each trial. This systemic memorylessness leads to massive computational redundancy, as models repeatedly re-derive discovered conclusions and revisit known dead ends across extensive attempts. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Recycling Search Experience (RSE)}, a self-guided, training-free strategy that turns test-time search from a series of isolated trials into a cumulative process. By actively distilling raw trajectories into a shared experience bank, RSE enables positive recycling of intermediate conclusions to shortcut redundant derivations and negative recycling of failure patterns to prune encountered dead ends. Theoretically, we provide an analysis that formalizes the efficiency gains of RSE, validating its advantage over independent sampling in solving complex reasoning tasks. Empirically, extensive experiments on HMMT24, HMMT25, IMO-Bench, and HLE show that RSE consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost, achieving state-of-the-art scaling efficiency.

*Hojae Han,Heeyun Jung,Jongyoon Kim,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DAVID-GRPO is a budget-efficient RL framework enabling small language models to achieve strong multi-hop reasoning under resource constraints, outperforming prior RL methods designed for large-scale settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL successes rely on high-cost, high-accuracy regimes, but under realistic resource constraints, small language models face sparse exploration and unstable training. The work challenges this trade-off.

Method: DAVID-GRPO stabilizes early learning with minimal supervision, assigns retrieval credit based on evidence recall, and improves exploration by resampling truncated near-miss trajectories.

Result: Evaluated on agents up to 1.5B parameters trained on only four RTX 3090 GPUs, DAVID-GRPO outperforms prior RL methods on six multi-hop QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: With proper inductive biases, small agents can achieve low training cost with high accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of DAVID-GRPO.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has empowered multi-turn reasoning agents with retrieval and tools, existing successes largely depend on extensive on-policy rollouts in high-cost, high-accuracy regimes. Under realistic resource constraints that cannot support large models or dense explorations, however, small language model agents fall into a low-cost, low-accuracy regime, where limited rollout budgets lead to sparse exploration, sparse credit assignment, and unstable training. In this work, we challenge this trade-off and show that small language models can achieve strong multi-hop reasoning under resource constraints. We introduce DAVID-GRPO, a budget-efficient RL framework that (i) stabilizes early learning with minimal supervision, (ii) assigns retrieval credit based on evidence recall, and (iii) improves exploration by resampling truncated near-miss trajectories. Evaluated on agents up to 1.5B parameters trained on only four RTX 3090 GPUs, DAVID-GRPO consistently outperforms prior RL methods designed for large-scale settings on six multi-hop QA benchmarks. These results show that with the right inductive biases, small agents can achieve low training cost with high accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAPPA, a framework unifying diverse attention patterns in LLMs by analyzing their predictability and regularities, validated through KV cache compression and pruning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unifying explanation for fragmented observations of attention patterns in LLMs, enhancing understanding and guiding practical applications like inference acceleration.

Method: Proposes TAPPA, analyzing attention patterns' predictability via query self-similarity and mathematical formulations, validated through KV cache compression and pruning.

Result: TAPPA improves performance in KV cache compression and pruning tasks, demonstrating its practical utility.

Conclusion: TAPPA offers a unified framework for understanding attention patterns, benefiting both theoretical insights and practical applications in LLMs.

Abstract: Attention patterns play a crucial role in both training and inference of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have identified individual patterns such as retrieval heads, sink heads, and diagonal traces, yet these observations remain fragmented and lack a unifying explanation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Temporal Attention Pattern Predictability Analysis (TAPPA), a unifying framework that explains diverse attention patterns by analyzing their underlying mathematical formulations} from a temporally continuous perspective. TAPPA both deepens the understanding of attention behavior and guides inference acceleration approaches. Specifically, TAPPA characterizes attention patterns as predictable patterns with clear regularities and unpredictable patterns that appear effectively random. Our analysis further reveals that this distinction can be explained by the degree of query self-similarity along the temporal dimension. Focusing on the predictable patterns, we further provide a detailed mathematical analysis of three representative cases through the joint effect of queries, keys, and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We validate TAPPA by applying its insights to KV cache compression and LLM pruning tasks. Across these tasks, a simple metric motivated by TAPPA consistently improves performance over baseline methods. The code is available at https://github.com/MIRALab-USTC/LLM-TAPPA.

*Huiyuan Lai,Malvina Nissim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TACLer is a curriculum RL framework that improves LLM reasoning efficiency and performance by tailoring task complexity and balancing Thinking/NoThinking modes, reducing compute costs and boosting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs with long CoT reasoning require extensive RL training and often suffer from redundancy. TACLer aims to enhance efficiency and performance.

Method: TACLer uses tailored curriculum learning and a hybrid Thinking/NoThinking paradigm to progressively train models and optimize reasoning.

Result: TACLer reduces training compute by 50%, inference tokens by 42%, and improves accuracy by 9% over baselines on complex math tasks.

Conclusion: TACLer effectively balances efficiency and performance in LLM reasoning, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, especially when equipped with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, eliciting long CoT typically requires large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) training, while often leading to overthinking with redundant intermediate steps. To improve learning and reasoning efficiency, while preserving or even enhancing performance, we propose TACLer, a model-tailored curriculum reinforcement learning framework that gradually increases the complexity of the data based on the model's proficiency in multi-stage RL training. TACLer features two core components: (i) tailored curriculum learning that determines what knowledge the model lacks and needs to learn in progressive stages; (ii) a hybrid Thinking/NoThinking reasoning paradigm that balances accuracy and efficiency by enabling or disabling the Thinking mode. Our experiments show that TACLer yields a twofold advantage in learning and reasoning: (i) it reduces computational cost, cutting training compute by over 50% compared to long thinking models and reducing inference token usage by over 42% relative to the base model; and (ii) it improves accuracy by over 9% on the base model, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art Nothinking and Thinking baselines across four math datasets with complex problems.

TL;DR: A parameter-efficient framework combining contrastive learning and ordinal ranking improves ESG report reliability by distinguishing concrete actions from vague claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sustainability reports are often unreliable due to greenwashing and vague claims, and current NLP models lack robustness to these issues.

Method: Uses contrastive learning with an ordinal ranking objective, gated feature modulation to filter noise, and MetaGradNorm for stable multi-objective optimization.

Result: Shows superior robustness in cross-category settings but reveals a trade-off between rigidity and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances the reliability of ESG assessments despite inherent trade-offs.

Abstract: Sustainability reports are critical for ESG assessment, yet greenwashing and vague claims often undermine their reliability. Existing NLP models lack robustness to these practices, typically relying on surface-level patterns that generalize poorly. We propose a parameter-efficient framework that structures LLM latent spaces by combining contrastive learning with an ordinal ranking objective to capture graded distinctions between concrete actions and ambiguous claims. Our approach incorporates gated feature modulation to filter disclosure noise and utilizes MetaGradNorm to stabilize multi-objective optimization. Experiments in cross-category settings demonstrate superior robustness over standard baselines while revealing a trade-off between representational rigidity and generalization.

*Liangze Jiang,Zachary Shinnick,Anton van den Hengel,Hemanth Saratchandran,Damien Teney*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pretraining on procedural data (e.g., Dyck sequences) significantly improves language models' algorithmic skills and efficiency, outperforming standard pretraining with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore if exposing models to abstract structured data (like humans learning logic first) can ease semantic knowledge acquisition and improve pretraining efficiency.

Method: Pretrain models on procedural data (e.g., formal languages) before natural language/code. Evaluate gains in algorithmic tasks, scalability (up to 1.3B models), and analyze attention/MLP layers.

Result: Procedural pretraining boosts accuracy (e.g., 10% → 98% on context recall) and reduces data needs (55-86% of original). Attention layers benefit structured tasks; MLP layers aid language.

Conclusion: Procedural pretraining is a lightweight, effective way to enhance model performance and efficiency, suggesting disentangling knowledge acquisition from reasoning.

Abstract: Pretraining directly on web-scale corpora is the de facto paradigm for building language models. We study an alternative setting where the model is initially exposed to abstract structured data, as a means to ease the subsequent acquisition of rich semantic knowledge, much like humans learn simple logic and mathematics before higher reasoning. We specifically focus on procedural data, generated by formal languages and other simple algorithms, as such abstract data.
  We first diagnose the algorithmic skills that different forms of procedural data can improve, often significantly. For example, on context recall (Needle-in-a-haystack), the accuracy jumps from 10 to 98% when pretraining on Dyck sequences (balanced brackets). Second, we study how these gains are reflected in pretraining larger models (up to 1.3B). We find that front-loading as little as 0.1% procedural data significantly outperforms standard pretraining on natural language, code, and informal mathematics (C4, CodeParrot, and DeepMind-Math datasets). Notably, this procedural pretraining enables the models to reach the same loss value with only 55, 67, 86% of the original data. Third, we explore the mechanisms behind and find that procedural pretraining instils non-trivial structure in both attention and MLP layers. The former is particularly important for structured domains (e.g. code), and the latter for language. Finally, we lay a path for combining multiple forms of procedural data. Our results show that procedural pretraining is a simple, lightweight means to improving performance and accelerating language model pretraining, ultimately suggesting the promise of disentangling knowledge acquisition from reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CE-GOCD enhances LLMs' scientific question answering by modeling semantic substructures in knowledge graphs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval methods for LLMs overlook deep semantic connections in scientific papers, limiting response quality.

Method: CE-GOCD uses paper titles as central entities, prunes/completes subgraphs, and applies community detection to group related papers.

Result: Evaluated on NLP datasets, CE-GOCD outperforms baseline methods in scientific question answering.

Conclusion: CE-GOCD effectively improves LLMs' comprehension of scientific literature by leveraging semantic substructures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for question answering over scientific research papers. Existing retrieval augmentation methods often rely on isolated text chunks or concepts, but overlook deeper semantic connections between papers. This impairs the LLM's comprehension of scientific literature, hindering the comprehensiveness and specificity of its responses. To address this, we propose Central Entity-Guided Graph Optimization for Community Detection (CE-GOCD), a method that augments LLMs' scientific question answering by explicitly modeling and leveraging semantic substructures within academic knowledge graphs. Our approach operates by: (1) leveraging paper titles as central entities for targeted subgraph retrieval, (2) enhancing implicit semantic discovery via subgraph pruning and completion, and (3) applying community detection to distill coherent paper groups with shared themes. We evaluated the proposed method on three NLP literature-based question-answering datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority over other retrieval-augmented baseline approaches, confirming the effectiveness of our framework.

### [130] [Temporal Guidance for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21744)
*Hong-Kai Zheng,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temporal Guidance (TeGu), a contrastive decoding method leveraging Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) to enhance LLM generation quality with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive decoding methods incur high computational costs and are unstable in small-scale models. TeGu addresses these issues by exploiting temporal preferences and MTP.

Method: Proposes TeGu, using MTP to create amateur predictions for self-contrast, and introduces cMTPP to standardize implementation without requiring multiple networks.

Result: TeGu improves performance across various models and benchmarks while keeping memory usage and computational overhead low.

Conclusion: TeGu is an efficient and effective contrastive guidance strategy for LLMs, outperforming existing methods without significant resource costs.

Abstract: Contrastive Decoding (CD) enhances the generation quality of large language models (LLMs) but incurs significant additional computational overhead due to the need for an auxiliary model. Existing internal self-contrastive decoding methods, such as Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), focus on discrepancies across different layers, which are notably unstable on small-scale models. In this work, based on the observation that LLMs exhibit local preferences, we propose a novel contrastive guidance strategy along the temporal dimension, namely Temporal Guidance (TeGu). Our method ingeniously leverages Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) to construct weaker amateur predictions for model self-contrast. To standardize the implementation of this mechanism, we further introduce a lightweight Conditional MTP Projector (cMTPP), which avoids maintaining multiple independent networks as required by other MTP modules. Across various model series and benchmarks, TeGu achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining low additional memory consumption and computational overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoFrGeNets introduce a new function class for generative modeling inspired by continued fractions, offering competitive performance with fewer parameters and shorter pre-training than Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers dominate language generation but require many parameters and long pre-training. CoFrGeNets aim to address these inefficiencies with novel architectural components inspired by continued fractions.

Method: CoFrGeNets replace Multi-head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks in Transformer blocks, using custom gradient formulations for efficient optimization. The approach is plug-in compatible with existing Transformer workflows.

Result: Experiments on GPT2-xl and Llama3 show CoFrGeNets achieve competitive or superior performance on downstream tasks with 1/2 to 2/3 the parameters and shorter pre-training.

Conclusion: CoFrGeNets offer a promising alternative to Transformers, with potential for further optimization in hardware-specific implementations.

Abstract: Transformers are arguably the preferred architecture for language generation. In this paper, inspired by continued fractions, we introduce a new function class for generative modeling. The architecture family implementing this function class is named CoFrGeNets - Continued Fraction Generative Networks. We design novel architectural components based on this function class that can replace Multi-head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks in Transformer blocks while requiring much fewer parameters. We derive custom gradient formulations to optimize the proposed components more accurately and efficiently than using standard PyTorch-based gradients. Our components are a plug-in replacement requiring little change in training or inference procedures that have already been put in place for Transformer-based models thus making our approach easy to incorporate in large industrial workflows. We experiment on two very different transformer architectures GPT2-xl (1.5B) and Llama3 (3.2B), where the former we pre-train on OpenWebText and GneissWeb, while the latter we pre-train on the docling data mix which consists of nine different datasets. Results show that the performance on downstream classification, Q\& A, reasoning and text understanding tasks of our models is competitive and sometimes even superior to the original models with $\frac{2}{3}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$ the parameters and shorter pre-training time. We believe that future implementations customized to hardware will further bring out the true potential of our architectures.

TL;DR: Zonkey is a hierarchical diffusion model introducing a differentiable tokenizer (Segment Splitter) with Probabilistic Attention, enabling adaptive splits and stable denoising for coherent, variable-length text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models (LLMs) are limited by fixed, non-differentiable tokenizers (e.g., BPE), restricting end-to-end optimization and adaptability to noisy or domain-specific data.

Method: Zonkey uses a differentiable tokenizer (Segment Splitter) with Probabilistic Attention, hierarchical compression (e.g., characters to words to sentences), and Denoising Diffusion Mixed Model (DDMM) for stable latent space denoising. A Stitcher ensures overlap invariance.

Result: Zonkey generates coherent, variable-length text from noise, showing emergent hierarchies and alignment to data distributions. It outperforms entropy-based learnable tokenizers.

Conclusion: Zonkey advances gradient-based LLMs, offering better domain adaptation and scalable generation. Its source code is released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet they remain constrained by fixed, non-differentiable tokenizers like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which hinder end-to-end optimization and adaptability to noisy or domain-specific data. We introduce Zonkey, a hierarchical diffusion model that addresses these limitations through a fully trainable pipeline from raw characters to document-level representations. At its core is a differentiable tokenizer (Segment Splitter) that learns probabilistic beginning-of-sequence (BOS) decisions, enabling adaptive splits that emerge as linguistically meaningful (e.g., word boundaries at spaces, sentence starts at periods) without explicit supervision. This differentiability is enabled by our novel Probabilistic Attention mechanism, which incorporates position-specific existence probabilities to simulate soft masking over theoretically infinite sequences while preserving gradients. Sequences decay probabilistically rather than relying on end-of-sequence tokens, supporting variable-length outputs. Hierarchical levels compress sequences into higher abstractions (e.g., character n-grams to word-like vectors, then sentence-like), with reconstruction via our Denoising Diffusion Mixed Model (DDMM) for stable and efficient denoising in latent space. A Stitcher ensures overlap invariance across segments. Trained end-to-end on Wikipedia, Zonkey generates coherent, variable-length text from noise, demonstrating emergent hierarchies and promising qualitative alignment to data distributions compared to entropy-based learnable tokenizers. Our approach advances toward fully gradient-based LLMs, with potential for better domain adaptation and scalable generation. We release the source code for training and reproducing our experiments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KID is a Knowledge-Injected Dual-Head Learning framework for detecting harmful memes by integrating background knowledge and structured reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing meme moderation tools struggle with implicit toxicity due to reliance on metaphors and sociocultural context, requiring background knowledge.

Method: KID uses label-constrained distillation to decompose meme understanding into reasoning chains and a dual-head architecture for joint semantic generation and classification.

Result: KID outperforms previous methods by 2.1%--19.7% on multilingual datasets (English, Chinese, Bengali) for harmful meme detection.

Conclusion: Knowledge injection and dual-head learning enhance meme understanding, making KID robust and generalizable. Code and data are publicly available.

Abstract: Internet memes have become pervasive carriers of digital culture on social platforms. However, their heavy reliance on metaphors and sociocultural context also makes them subtle vehicles for harmful content, posing significant challenges for automated content moderation. Existing approaches primarily focus on intra-modal and inter-modal signal analysis, while the understanding of implicit toxicity often depends on background knowledge that is not explicitly present in the meme itself. To address this challenge, we propose KID, a Knowledge-Injected Dual-Head Learning framework for knowledge-grounded harmful meme detection. KID adopts a label-constrained distillation paradigm to decompose complex meme understanding into structured reasoning chains that explicitly link visual evidence, background knowledge, and classification labels. These chains guide the learning process by grounding external knowledge in meme-specific contexts. In addition, KID employs a dual-head architecture that jointly optimizes semantic generation and classification objectives, enabling aligned linguistic reasoning while maintaining stable decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, and low-resource Bengali demonstrate that KID achieves SOTA performance on both binary and multi-label harmful meme detection tasks, improving over previous best methods by 2.1%--19.7% across primary evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of knowledge injection and dual-head joint learning, highlighting their complementary contributions to robust and generalizable meme understanding.

TL;DR: AMA improves memory systems for conversational agents by aligning offline memory preparation with task objectives through adversarial simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory systems misalign offline preparation with task requirements, harming downstream performance. AMA addresses this by introducing task-aware supervision during offline phases.

Method: AMA uses adversarial simulation: a challenger generates QA pairs, memory answers them, an evaluator assesses responses, and an adapter updates construction and content based on errors.

Result: AMA enhances adaptability to downstream tasks and is validated on the LoCoMo benchmark, showing effectiveness.

Conclusion: AMA bridges the gap between offline memory preparation and task needs, improving conversational agent performance with minimal integration effort.

Abstract: Conversational agents struggle to handle long conversations due to context window limitations. Therefore, memory systems are developed to leverage essential historical information. Existing memory systems typically follow a pipeline of offline memory construction and update, and online retrieval. Despite the flexible online phase, the offline phase remains fixed and task-independent. In this phase, memory construction operates under a predefined workflow and fails to emphasize task relevant information. Meanwhile, memory updates are guided by generic metrics rather than task specific supervision. This leads to a misalignment between offline memory preparation and task requirements, which undermines downstream task performance. To this end, we propose an Adversarial Memory Adaptation mechanism (AMA) that aligns memory construction and update with task objectives by simulating task execution. Specifically, first, a challenger agent generates question answer pairs based on the original dialogues. The constructed memory is then used to answer these questions, simulating downstream inference. Subsequently, an evaluator agent assesses the responses and performs error analysis. Finally, an adapter agent analyzes the error cases and performs dual level updates on both the construction strategy and the content. Through this process, the memory system receives task aware supervision signals in advance during the offline phase, enhancing its adaptability to downstream tasks. AMA can be integrated into various existing memory systems, and extensive experiments on long dialogue benchmark LoCoMo demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: RAG-E is an explainability framework for RAG systems, revealing misalignments between retrievers and generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the opacity in RAG systems' component interaction, critical for high-stakes applications.

Method: Uses Integrated Gradients for retrievers, PMCSHAP for generators, and introduces WARG metric.

Result: Finds significant misalignments: generators often ignore top-ranked documents or rely on less relevant ones.

Conclusion: RAG output quality hinges on component interplay, auditable via RAG-E.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine dense retrievers and language models to ground LLM outputs in retrieved documents. However, the opacity of how these components interact creates challenges for deployment in high-stakes domains. We present RAG-E, an end-to-end explainability framework that quantifies retriever-generator alignment through mathematically grounded attribution methods. Our approach adapts Integrated Gradients for retriever analysis, introduces PMCSHAP, a Monte Carlo-stabilized Shapley Value approximation, for generator attribution, and introduces the Weighted Attribution-Relevance Gap (WARG) metric to measure how well a generator's document usage aligns with a retriever's ranking. Empirical analysis on TREC CAsT and FoodSafeSum reveals critical misalignments: for 47.4% to 66.7% of queries, generators ignore the retriever's top-ranked documents, while 48.1% to 65.9% rely on documents ranked as less relevant. These failure modes demonstrate that RAG output quality depends not solely on individual component performance but on their interplay, which can be audited via RAG-E.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DARE improves TTRL by using full empirical rollout distributions for reward estimation, outperforming methods relying on majority voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTRL methods depend on majority voting for deterministic rewards, which discards valuable information and introduces bias.

Method: DARE proposes distribution-aware reward estimation, incorporating exploration bonuses and pruning mechanisms.

Result: DARE achieves relative improvements of 25.3% on AIME 2024 and 5.3% on AMC.

Conclusion: DARE enhances optimization stability and performance by leveraging full rollout distributions.

Abstract: Test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) enables large language models (LLMs) to self-improve on unlabeled inputs, but its effectiveness critically depends on how reward signals are estimated without ground-truth supervision. Most existing TTRL methods rely on majority voting (MV) over rollouts to produce deterministic rewards, implicitly assuming that the majority rollout provides a reliable learning signal. We show that this assumption is fragile: MV reduces the rollout distribution into a single outcome, discarding information about non-majority but correct actions candidates, and yields systematically biased reward estimates. To address this, we propose Distribution-AwareReward Estimation (DARE), which shifts reward estimation from a single majority outcome to the full empirical rollout distribution. DARE further augments this distribution-based reward with an exploration bonus and a distribution pruning mechanism for non-majority rollout exploration and reward denoise, yielding a more informative and robust reward estimation. Extensive experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that DARE improves optimization stability and final performance over recent baselines, achieving relative improvements of 25.3% on challenging AIME 2024 and 5.3% on AMC.

TL;DR: MilSCORE is introduced as the first expert-authored dataset for evaluating LLMs' long-context reasoning in military planning scenarios, highlighting current models' limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need arises from applying LLMs to complex, long-context tasks like military planning, which require integrating diverse, multi-modal information sources.

Method: MilSCORE comprises multi-hop questions grounded in simulated military scenarios, evaluating LLMs' tactical and spatial reasoning across seven question categories.

Result: Baseline results show significant gaps in current models' ability to handle realistic, long-context planning tasks.

Conclusion: MilSCORE serves as a challenging benchmark for advancing LLMs' capabilities in scenario-level reasoning and high-stakes decision-making.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are applied to increasingly longer and more complex tasks, there is a growing need for realistic long-context benchmarks that require selective reading and integration of heterogeneous, multi-modal information sources. This need is especially acute for geospatial planning problems, such as those found in planning for large-scale military operations, which demand fast and accurate reasoning over maps, orders, intelligence reports, and other distributed data. To address this gap, we present MilSCORE (Military Scenario Contextual Reasoning), to our knowledge the first scenario-level dataset of expert-authored, multi-hop questions grounded in a complex, simulated military planning scenario used for training. MilSCORE is designed to evaluate high-stakes decision-making and planning, probing LLMs' ability to combine tactical and spatial reasoning across multiple sources and to reason over long-horizon, geospatially rich context. The benchmark includes a diverse set of question types across seven categories targeting both factual recall and multi-step reasoning about constraints, strategy, and spatial analysis. We provide an evaluation protocol and report baseline results for a range of contemporary vision-language models. Our findings highlight substantial headroom on MilSCORE, indicating that current systems struggle with realistic, scenario-level long-context planning, and positioning MilSCORE as a challenging testbed for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long-horizon planning as embodied agents due to context window limitations and hallucinated transitions violating constraints.

Method: GiG employs a GNN to encode environmental states into embeddings, organizes them into action-connected execution trace graphs, and uses clustering for retrieval of structure-aware priors. It includes a bounded lookahead module for grounded action projection.

Result: GiG achieves Pass@1 performance gains of up to 22% on Robotouille Synchronous, 37% on Asynchronous, and 15% on ALFWorld.

Conclusion: The GiG framework effectively improves embodied agents' planning coherence and performance, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot reasoning capabilities, their deployment as embodied agents still faces fundamental challenges in long-horizon planning. Unlike open-ended text generation, embodied agents must decompose high-level intent into actionable sub-goals while strictly adhering to the logic of a dynamic, observed environment. Standard LLM planners frequently fail to maintain strategy coherence over extended horizons due to context window limitation or hallucinate transitions that violate constraints. We propose GiG, a novel planning framework that structures embodied agents' memory using a Graph-in-Graph architecture. Our approach employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode environmental states into embeddings, organizing these embeddings into action-connected execution trace graphs within an experience memory bank. By clustering these graph embeddings, the framework enables retrieval of structure-aware priors, allowing agents to ground current decisions in relevant past structural patterns. Furthermore, we introduce a novel bounded lookahead module that leverages symbolic transition logic to enhance the agents' planning capabilities through the grounded action projection. We evaluate our framework on three embodied planning benchmarks-Robotouille Synchronous, Robotouille Asynchronous, and ALFWorld. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving Pass@1 performance gains of up to 22% on Robotouille Synchronous, 37% on Asynchronous, and 15% on ALFWorld with comparable or lower computational cost.

*Hongyi Zhou,Jin Zhu,Erhan Xu,Kai Ye,Ying Yang,Chengchun Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel rewrite-based algorithm to detect LLM-generated text, using adaptive distance learning for improved accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about misinformation and academic integrity due to human-like text from LLMs like GPT, Claude, and Gemini necessitate reliable detection methods.

Method: A geometric approach demystifies rewrite-based detection algorithms, leading to an adaptive distance-learning algorithm for detecting LLM-generated content.

Result: Experiments with 100+ settings show the algorithm outperforms baselines, achieving relative improvements of 57.8% to 80.6% across LLMs.

Conclusion: Adaptive learning of distance functions proves more effective than fixed distances for detecting LLM-generated text.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, and Gemini have transformed the way we learn, work, and communicate. Yet, their ability to produce highly human-like text raises serious concerns about misinformation and academic integrity, making it an urgent need for reliable algorithms to detect LLM-generated content. In this paper, we start by presenting a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms, revealing their underlying rationale and demonstrating their generalization ability. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text. Theoretically, we demonstrate that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with over 100 settings, and find that our approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in the majority of scenarios. In particular, it achieves relative improvements from 57.8\% to 80.6\% over the strongest baseline across different target LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, and Gemini).

*Hong Chen,Xiang Liu,Bo Wang,Yuxuan Fan,Yuanlin Chu,Zongluo Li,Xiaowen Chu,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SONIC is a learning-based framework compressing KV cache into Nexus tokens for efficient multi-turn LLM dialogues, outperforming baselines with significant improvements in performance and inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The linear growth of KV cache hampers multi-turn LLM deployment, and existing compression methods lack adaptability to dialogue structure, risking loss of critical context.

Method: SONIC uses dynamic budget training to compress historical dialogue segments into compact Nexus tokens, enabling flexible memory adaptation without retraining.

Result: At 80% and 50% compression ratios, SONIC outperforms baselines like H2O and StreamingLLM, achieving a 35.55% score improvement on MTBench101 and accelerating inference by 50.1%.

Conclusion: SONIC effectively addresses KV cache growth challenges, enhancing multi-turn dialogue coherence and deployment efficiency.

Abstract: The linear growth of Key-Value (KV) cache remains a bottleneck for multi-turn LLM deployment. Existing KV cache compression methods often fail to account for the structural properties of multi-turn dialogues, relying on heuristic eviction that risks losing critical context. We propose \textbf{SONIC}, a learning-based framework that compresses historical segments into compact and semantically rich \textbf{Nexus} tokens. By integrating dynamic budget training, SONIC allows flexible adaptation to varying memory constraints without retraining. Experiments show that at compression ratios of 80\% and 50\%, SONIC consistently outperforms baselines such as H2O and StreamingLLM on four diverse multi-turn benchmarks. Specifically, on the widely used MTBench101 benchmark, SONIC achieves an average score improvement of 35.55\% over state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness in sustaining coherent multi-turn dialogues. Furthermore, SONIC enhances deployment efficiency, accelerating the overall inference process by 50.1\% compared to full-context generation.

### [142] [From Generative Modeling to Clinical Classification: A GPT-Based Architecture for EHR Notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21955)
*Fariba Afrin Irany*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A GPT-based architecture for clinical text classification is proposed, using selective fine-tuning to reduce trainable parameters while maintaining performance, evaluated on radiology reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to efficiently model clinical narratives in EHRs despite challenges like limited labeled data, class imbalance, and high computational costs.

Method: Selective fine-tuning of a pretrained GPT-2 model, freezing most parameters and training only the final Transformer block, layer normalization, and a classification head.

Result: The method shows stable convergence and strong performance, especially for non-mention and negated findings, across various problem formulations.

Conclusion: Selective fine-tuning offers an efficient and effective approach for clinical text classification, reducing computational complexity while adapting to EHR data.

Abstract: The increasing availability of unstructured clinical narratives in electronic health records (EHRs) has created new opportunities for automated disease characterization, cohort identification, and clinical decision support. However, modeling long, domain-specific clinical text remains challenging due to limited labeled data, severe class imbalance, and the high computational cost of adapting large pretrained language models.
  This study presents a GPT-based architecture for clinical text classification that adapts a pretrained decoder-only Transformer using a selective fine-tuning strategy. Rather than updating all model parameters, the majority of the GPT-2 backbone is frozen, and training is restricted to the final Transformer block, the final layer normalization, and a lightweight classification head. This approach substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving the representational capacity required to model complex clinical language.
  The proposed method is evaluated on radiology reports from the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset using uncertainty-aware CheXpert-style labels derived directly from report text. Experiments cover multiple problem formulations, including multi-label classification of radiographic findings, binary per-label classification under different uncertainty assumptions, and aggregate disease outcome prediction. Across varying dataset sizes, the model exhibits stable convergence behavior and strong classification performance, particularly in settings dominated by non-mention and negated findings.
  Overall, the results indicate that selective fine-tuning of pretrained generative language models provides an efficient and effective pathway for clinical text classification, enabling scalable adaptation to real-world EHR data while significantly reducing computational complexity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OVD is a memory-efficient framework for distilling reasoning capabilities from teacher to student models, replacing token-level alignment with trajectory matching using verbal scores. It outperforms existing methods significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token-level distillation methods hinder exploration, restrict feedback use, and face memory issues. OVD aims to address these limitations.

Method: OVD uses trajectory matching with discrete verbal scores (0--9) from teachers, avoiding token-level alignment and reducing memory use.

Result: OVD achieves up to +12.9% EM on Web Q&A and +25.7% gain on math tasks, with superior efficiency.

Conclusion: OVD effectively improves distillation by enabling exploration and reducing memory bottlenecks, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation offers a promising path to transfer reasoning capabilities from large teacher models to efficient student models; however, existing token-level on-policy distillation methods require token-level alignment between the student and teacher models, which restricts the student model's exploration ability, prevent effective use of interactive environment feedback, and suffer from severe memory bottlenecks in reinforcement learning. We introduce On-policy Verbal Distillation (OVD), a memory-efficient framework that replaces token-level probability matching with trajectory matching using discrete verbal scores (0--9) from teacher models. OVD dramatically reduces memory consumption while enabling on-policy distillation from teacher models with verbal feedback, and avoids token-level alignment, allowing the student model to freely explore the output space. Extensive experiments on Web question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks show that OVD substantially outperforms existing methods, delivering up to +12.9% absolute improvement in average EM on Web Q&A tasks and a up to +25.7% gain on math benchmarks (when trained with only one random samples), while also exhibiting superior training efficiency.

*Yifan Zhu,Huiqiang Rong,Haoran Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Token-Guard is a token-level hallucination control method for LLMs that uses self-checking decoding and explicit risk scoring to reduce hallucinations without resource-intensive retrieval or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate hallucinated content inconsistent with input, and existing solutions like RAG and RLHF are resource-heavy, while lightweight decoding methods lack explicit control.

Method: Token-Guard employs internal verification at each reasoning step, evaluates candidate fragments in latent space with hallucination risk scoring, and uses iterative pruning and regeneration to correct errors.

Result: Experiments on HALU datasets show Token-Guard significantly reduces hallucinations and improves generation accuracy.

Conclusion: Token-Guard provides a scalable, modular solution for reliable LLM outputs without requiring heavy resources.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate, generating content inconsistent with the input. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can mitigate hallucinations but require resource-intensive retrieval or large-scale fine-tuning. Decoding-based methods are lighter yet lack explicit hallucination control. To address this, we present Token-Guard, a token-level hallucination control method based on self-checking decoding. Token-Guard performs internal verification at each reasoning step to detect hallucinated tokens before they propagate. Candidate fragments are further evaluated in a latent space with explicit hallucination risk scoring, while iterative pruning and regeneration dynamically correct detected errors. Experiments on HALU datasets show Token-Guard substantially reduces hallucinations and improves generation accuracy, offering a scalable, modular solution for reliable LLM outputs. Our code is publicly available.

*Jianhui Chen,Yuzhang Luo,Liangming Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MDA traces interpretable circuits in LLMs to specific training data using Influence Functions, showing causal links between high-influence samples and interpretable heads, particularly in repetitive structural data. It also connects induction heads to in-context learning and proposes a data augmentation pipeline for faster circuit convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the causal origins of interpretable circuits in LLMs by linking them to specific training samples.

Method: Mechanistic Data Attribution (MDA) uses Influence Functions to identify high-influence training samples and validates causality through targeted interventions (removing/augmenting samples) on the Pythia family of models.

Result: Targeted interventions significantly affect interpretable heads, while random ones do not. Repetitive structural data (e.g., LaTeX, XML) catalyzes mechanistic effects. Induction head interventions alter in-context learning capability.

Conclusion: MDA provides causal evidence linking training data to interpretable circuits, proposes mechanistic data augmentation for faster LLM development, and supports the functional link between induction heads and in-context learning.

Abstract: While Mechanistic Interpretability has identified interpretable circuits in LLMs, their causal origins in training data remain elusive. We introduce Mechanistic Data Attribution (MDA), a scalable framework that employs Influence Functions to trace interpretable units back to specific training samples. Through extensive experiments on the Pythia family, we causally validate that targeted intervention--removing or augmenting a small fraction of high-influence samples--significantly modulates the emergence of interpretable heads, whereas random interventions show no effect. Our analysis reveals that repetitive structural data (e.g., LaTeX, XML) acts as a mechanistic catalyst. Furthermore, we observe that interventions targeting induction head formation induce a concurrent change in the model's in-context learning (ICL) capability. This provides direct causal evidence for the long-standing hypothesis regarding the functional link between induction heads and ICL. Finally, we propose a mechanistic data augmentation pipeline that consistently accelerates circuit convergence across model scales, providing a principled methodology for steering the developmental trajectories of LLMs.

### [146] [When "Better" Prompts Hurt: Evaluation-Driven Iteration for LLM Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22025)
*Daniel Commey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an evaluation-driven workflow and Minimum Viable Evaluation Suite (MVES) for LLM applications, emphasizing the need for tailored testing due to stochastic outputs and prompt sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional software testing is insufficient for LLM applications due to their stochastic, high-dimensional outputs and sensitivity to prompts and model changes.

Method: The proposed workflow involves four steps: Define, Test, Diagnose, Fix. MVES includes tiered evaluation components for general LLM apps, RAG, and agentic workflows, using automated checks, human rubrics, and LLM-as-judge.

Result: Experiments showed that generic prompt templates can trade off behaviors (e.g., extraction pass rate dropped from 100% to 90% for Llama 3), highlighting the need for evaluation-driven iteration.

Conclusion: The findings advocate for evaluation-driven prompt iteration and calibrated claims over universal prompt recipes, with all tools provided for reproducibility.

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) applications differs from traditional software testing because outputs are stochastic, high-dimensional, and sensitive to prompt and model changes. We present an evaluation-driven workflow - Define, Test, Diagnose, Fix - that turns these challenges into a repeatable engineering loop.
  We introduce the Minimum Viable Evaluation Suite (MVES), a tiered set of recommended evaluation components for (i) general LLM applications, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and (iii) agentic tool-use workflows. We also synthesize common evaluation methods (automated checks, human rubrics, and LLM-as-judge) and discuss known judge failure modes.
  In reproducible local experiments (Ollama; Llama 3 8B Instruct and Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct), we observe that a generic "improved" prompt template can trade off behaviors: on our small structured suites, extraction pass rate decreased from 100% to 90% and RAG compliance from 93.3% to 80% for Llama 3 when replacing task-specific prompts with generic rules, while instruction-following improved. These findings motivate evaluation-driven prompt iteration and careful claim calibration rather than universal prompt recipes.
  All test suites, harnesses, and results are included for reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the advantages of ARMs (efficient training) and diffusion models (high-throughput inference) for efficient LLMs.

Method: Introduces causal attention masks, soft-tailed masking, and context-aware reweighting for stable causal diffusion and dynamic parallel decoding.

Result: Outperforms existing discrete diffusion baselines with 3× faster training latency than block diffusion methods.

Conclusion: CARD achieves ARM-level efficiency and parallel generation benefits, offering a robust framework for efficient LLMs.

Abstract: In this work, we propose Causal Autoregressive Diffusion (CARD), a novel framework that unifies the training efficiency of ARMs with the high-throughput inference of diffusion models. CARD reformulates the diffusion process within a strictly causal attention mask, enabling dense, per-token supervision in a single forward pass. To address the optimization instability of causal diffusion, we introduce a soft-tailed masking schema to preserve local context and a context-aware reweighting mechanism derived from signal-to-noise principles. This design enables dynamic parallel decoding, where the model leverages KV-caching to adaptively generate variable-length token sequences based on confidence. Empirically, CARD outperforms existing discrete diffusion baselines while reducing training latency by 3 $\times$ compared to block diffusion methods. Our results demonstrate that CARD achieves ARM-level data efficiency while unlocking the latency benefits of parallel generation, establishing a robust paradigm for next-generation efficient LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Leviathan, a novel architecture with continuous embedding generators, outperforms standard models by effectively increasing parameter capacity without additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the suboptimal parameter allocation in small language models (SLMs), where embedding matrices dominate the budget, and proposes a more efficient solution.

Method: Leviathan replaces discrete embedding lookup tables with continuous embedding generators, evaluated on the Pile dataset under isoparametric conditions.

Result: Leviathan consistently outperforms standard LLaMA-style architectures, behaving like a model with 1.47 to 2.11 times more parameters.

Conclusion: Leviathan's continuous embedding approach significantly improves efficiency and performance in SLMs, demonstrating superior effective parameter capacity.

Abstract: Transformer scaling law analyses typically treat parameters as interchangeable; an abstraction that accurately predicts loss-compute relationships. Yet, in sub-billion-parameter small language models (SLMs), embedding matrices dominate the parameter budget. This work argues that this allocation is as suboptimal as it is counterintuitive. Leviathan is an architecture with a continuous embedding generator to replace the discrete lookup tables of canonical models. Evaluating on the Pile dataset under isoparametric settings, Leviathan consistently outperforms a standard, LLaMA-style architecture. By means of an empirical power-law fit, Leviathan exhibits a markedly superior effective parameter capacity. Across the regime studied, Leviathan behaves as a dense model with $1.47$ to $2.11 \times$ more parameters.

TL;DR: Instruction following can hinder LLMs' task-solving ability, measured by SUSTAINSCORE, showing performance drops when adding self-evident constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how explicit constraints in instructions paradoxically reduce LLMs' task performance despite aligning with human intent.

Method: Introduces SUSTAINSCORE to quantify interference, tests LLMs on math, QA, and code tasks with self-evident constraints, analyzes attention patterns.

Result: Performance drops observed even in advanced models like Claude-Sonnet-4.5; interference is general across constraint types and scales.

Conclusion: Identifies failure patterns and mechanisms, suggests implications for alignment strategies, and releases resources for further research.

Abstract: Instruction following aims to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent by specifying explicit constraints on how tasks should be performed. However, we reveal a counterintuitive phenomenon: instruction following can paradoxically interfere with LLMs' task-solving capability. We propose a metric, SUSTAINSCORE, to quantify the interference of instruction following with task solving. It measures task performance drop after inserting into the instruction a self-evident constraint, which is naturally met by the original successful model output and extracted from it. Experiments on current LLMs in mathematics, multi-hop QA, and code generation show that adding the self-evident constraints leads to substantial performance drops, even for advanced models such as Claude-Sonnet-4.5. We validate the generality of the interference across constraint types and scales. Furthermore, we identify common failure patterns, and by investigating the mechanisms of interference, we observe that failed cases allocate significantly more attention to constraints compared to successful ones. Finally, we use SUSTAINSCORE to conduct an initial investigation into how distinct post-training paradigms affect the interference, presenting empirical observations on current alignment strategies. We will release our code and data to facilitate further research

TL;DR: MasalBench is a benchmark for evaluating multilingual LLMs' understanding of Persian proverbs, showing high accuracy in contextual identification but significant drops in cross-cultural equivalency tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses gaps in evaluating LLMs' figurative language understanding, especially in low-resource languages like Persian, crucial for effective communication.

Method: Introduces MasalBench to assess LLMs' contextual and cross-cultural understanding of Persian proverbs, testing eight state-of-the-art models.

Result: LLMs perform well (accuracy >0.90) in identifying Persian proverbs in context but struggle (best accuracy 0.79) with equivalent English proverbs, revealing limitations in cultural knowledge.

Conclusion: The findings highlight LLMs' shortcomings in cross-cultural analogical reasoning and provide a framework for evaluating other low-resource languages.

Abstract: In recent years, multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an inseparable part of daily life, making it crucial for them to master the rules of conversational language in order to communicate effectively with users. While previous work has evaluated LLMs' understanding of figurative language in high-resource languages, their performance in low-resource languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MasalBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' contextual and cross-cultural understanding of Persian proverbs, which are a key component of conversation in this low-resource language. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs on MasalBench and find that they perform well in identifying Persian proverbs in context, achieving accuracies above 0.90. However, their performance drops considerably when tasked with identifying equivalent English proverbs, with the best model achieving 0.79 accuracy. Our findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in cultural knowledge and analogical reasoning, and they provide a framework for assessing cross-cultural understanding in other low-resource languages.

TL;DR: The paper introduces $G^2$-Reader, a dual-graph system improving retrieval-augmented generation for multimodal question answering by preserving document structure and guiding evidence completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in multimodal contexts due to fragmented semantic interpretation and retrieval drift in long documents.

Method: $G^2$-Reader uses a Content Graph to maintain document-native structure and a Planning Graph to track findings and guide navigation.

Result: Achieves 66.21% accuracy on VisDoMBench, outperforming baselines (53.08%).

Conclusion: $G^2$-Reader effectively addresses issues in multimodal QA by combining structured retrieval and guided planning.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation is a practical paradigm for question answering over long documents, but it remains brittle for multimodal reading where text, tables, and figures are interleaved across many pages. First, flat chunking breaks document-native structure and cross-modal alignment, yielding semantic fragments that are hard to interpret in isolation. Second, even iterative retrieval can fail in long contexts by looping on partial evidence or drifting into irrelevant sections as noise accumulates, since each step is guided only by the current snippet without a persistent global search state. We introduce $G^2$-Reader, a dual-graph system, to address both issues. It evolves a Content Graph to preserve document-native structure and cross-modal semantics, and maintains a Planning Graph, an agentic directed acyclic graph of sub-questions, to track intermediate findings and guide stepwise navigation for evidence completion. On VisDoMBench across five multimodal domains, $G^2$-Reader with Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct reaches 66.21\% average accuracy, outperforming strong baselines and a standalone GPT-5 (53.08\%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address efficiency bottlenecks in LLMs caused by long-context reasoning without complex training or losing fine-grained information.

Method: Uses vision-text compression by rendering reasoning segments into images ('optical memory') and iteratively processing them with vision-language models.

Result: Achieves 3.4x token compression, outperforms standard long-context reasoning on benchmarks, and provides 2.7x speedup in inference.

Conclusion: VTC-R1 is a scalable and efficient solution for reasoning-intensive applications.

Abstract: Long-context reasoning has significantly empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks, yet it introduces severe efficiency bottlenecks due to the computational complexity. Existing efficient approaches often rely on complex additional training or external models for compression, which limits scalability and discards critical fine-grained information. In this paper, we propose VTC-R1, a new efficient reasoning paradigm that integrates vision-text compression into the reasoning process. Instead of processing lengthy textual traces, VTC-R1 renders intermediate reasoning segments into compact images, which are iteratively fed back into vision-language models as "optical memory." We construct a training dataset based on OpenR1-Math-220K achieving 3.4x token compression and fine-tune representative VLMs-Glyph and Qwen3-VL. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME25, AMC23 and GPQA-D demonstrate that VTC-R1 consistently outperforms standard long-context reasoning. Furthermore, our approach significantly improves inference efficiency, achieving 2.7x speedup in end-to-end latency, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for reasoning-intensive applications.

TL;DR: Fed-MedLoRA and Fed-MedLoRA+ are parameter-efficient federated learning frameworks designed to adapt large language models (LLMs) for medical applications, addressing computational and data heterogeneity challenges in clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical LLMs are often trained on single-institution data, limiting generalizability and safety. Federated learning (FL) offers a solution but faces practical challenges with multi-billion-parameter LLMs and heterogeneous clinical data.

Method: The proposed frameworks, Fed-MedLoRA and Fed-MedLoRA+, transmit only low-rank adapter parameters and incorporate adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity.

Result: The frameworks were applied to clinical information extraction, demonstrating improved accuracy across diverse patient cohorts compared to BERT, LLaMA-3, DeepSeek-R1, and GPT-4o models in various evaluation settings.

Conclusion: Fed-MedLoRA and Fed-MedLoRA+ effectively address the limitations of conventional FL for medical LLMs, offering a scalable and efficient solution for collaborative model development in healthcare.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on medical benchmarks, including question answering and diagnosis. To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models. Evaluation settings included (1) in-domain training and testing, (2) external validation on independent cohorts, and (3) a low-resource new-site adaptation scenario using real-world clinical notes from the Yale New Haven Health System.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Proactive Interactive Reasoning (PIR), a paradigm transforming LLMs from passive solvers to proactive inquirers, addressing premise- and intent-level uncertainty through user interaction. It achieves higher accuracy and efficiency compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs rely on blind self-thinking, limiting their effectiveness when information is missing or ambiguous. PIR aims to enhance reasoning by enabling models to clarify uncertainties interactively.

Method: PIR uses uncertainty-aware fine-tuning and a user-simulator-based policy optimization framework to align model behavior with user intent.

Result: PIR outperforms baselines with up to 32.70% higher accuracy, 22.90% higher pass rate, and 41.36 BLEU improvement, while reducing reasoning computation and unnecessary interactions.

Conclusion: PIR demonstrates strong generalization and robustness across tasks, offering a promising solution for interactive reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, yet they remain fundamentally limited by a \emph{blind self-thinking} paradigm: performing extensive internal reasoning even when critical information is missing or ambiguous. We propose Proactive Interactive Reasoning (PIR), a new reasoning paradigm that transforms LLMs from passive solvers into proactive inquirers that interleave reasoning with clarification. Unlike existing search- or tool-based frameworks that primarily address knowledge uncertainty by querying external environments, PIR targets premise- and intent-level uncertainty through direct interaction with the user. PIR is implemented via two core components: (1) an uncertainty-aware supervised fine-tuning procedure that equips models with interactive reasoning capability, and (2) a user-simulator-based policy optimization framework driven by a composite reward that aligns model behavior with user intent. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and document editing demonstrate that PIR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 32.70\% higher accuracy, 22.90\% higher pass rate, and 41.36 BLEU improvement, while reducing nearly half of the reasoning computation and unnecessary interaction turns. Further reliability evaluations on factual knowledge, question answering, and missing-premise scenarios confirm the strong generalization and robustness of PIR.

### [155] [FineInstructions: Scaling Synthetic Instructions to Pre-Training Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22146)
*Ajay Patel,Colin Raffel,Chris Callison-Burch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to generate synthetic instruction-tuning data from unstructured pre-training documents, creating a dataset called FineInstructions to improve LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited supervised training data available for instruction-tuning LLMs, the authors aim to leverage unstructured pre-training documents to generate synthetic instruction-response pairs.

Method: The approach involves creating instruction templates from user queries, matching them with human-written source documents, and generating synthetic training data. The resulting dataset, FineInstructions, is used to pre-train LLMs with an instruction-tuning objective.

Result: Pre-training on FineInstructions outperforms standard pre-training and other synthetic methods on benchmarks measuring free-form response quality.

Conclusion: Generating synthetic instruction-tuning data at scale enhances LLM performance, making pre-training more aligned with downstream usage.

Abstract: Due to limited supervised training data, large language models (LLMs) are typically pre-trained via a self-supervised "predict the next word" objective on a vast amount of unstructured text data. To make the resulting model useful to users, it is further trained on a far smaller amount of "instruction-tuning" data comprised of supervised training examples of instructions and responses. To overcome the limited amount of supervised data, we propose a procedure that can transform the knowledge in internet-scale pre-training documents into billions of synthetic instruction and answer training pairs. The resulting dataset, called FineInstructions, uses ~18M instruction templates created from real user-written queries and prompts. These instruction templates are matched to and instantiated with human-written source documents from unstructured pre-training corpora. With "supervised" synthetic training data generated at this scale, an LLM can be pre-trained from scratch solely with the instruction-tuning objective, which is far more in-distribution with the expected downstream usage of LLMs (responding to user prompts). We conduct controlled token-for-token training experiments and find pre-training on FineInstructions outperforms standard pre-training and other proposed synthetic pre-training techniques on standard benchmarks measuring free-form response quality.

TL;DR: DynaWeb is a new MBRL framework that trains web agents using a synthetic web environment, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training autonomous web agents on the live internet is inefficient and risky. DynaWeb aims to overcome these challenges by using a simulated environment.

Method: DynaWeb employs a web world model for simulated interactions, combining policy rollouts with real expert trajectories for improved training stability and efficiency.

Result: Experiments on WebArena and WebVoyager show DynaWeb significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art web agent models.

Conclusion: DynaWeb provides a scalable and efficient method for training web agents through imagination, advancing online agentic RL.

Abstract: The development of autonomous web agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL), represents a significant step towards general-purpose AI assistants. However, training these agents is severely hampered by the challenges of interacting with the live internet, which is inefficient, costly, and fraught with risks. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers a promising solution by learning a world model of the environment to enable simulated interaction. This paper introduces DynaWeb, a novel MBRL framework that trains web agents through interacting with a web world model trained to predict naturalistic web page representations given agent actions. This model serves as a synthetic web environment where an agent policy can dream by generating vast quantities of rollout action trajectories for efficient online reinforcement learning. Beyond free policy rollouts, DynaWeb incorporates real expert trajectories from training data, which are randomly interleaved with on-policy rollouts during training to improve stability and sample efficiency. Experiments conducted on the challenging WebArena and WebVoyager benchmarks demonstrate that DynaWeb consistently and significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art open-source web agent models. Our findings establish the viability of training web agents through imagination, offering a scalable and efficient way to scale up online agentic RL.

TL;DR: HALO is a pipeline for converting Transformer models into efficient hybrid RNN-attention models, achieving comparable performance with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for creating hybrid models require extensive data and perform poorly in long-context scenarios, despite their potential efficiency benefits.

Method: Developed HALO pipeline for distillation and introduced HypeNet with HyPE position encoding and architectural tweaks.

Result: Converted Qwen3 series into HypeNet with minimal data (2.3B tokens), matching original performance and excelling in long-context efficiency.

Conclusion: HALO and HypeNet offer a practical and efficient solution for hybrid model adoption, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Hybrid Transformer architectures, which combine softmax attention blocks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have shown a desirable performance-throughput tradeoff for long-context modeling, but their adoption and studies are hindered by the prohibitive cost of large-scale pre-training from scratch. Some recent studies have shown that pre-trained softmax attention blocks can be converted into RNN blocks through parameter transfer and knowledge distillation. However, these transfer methods require substantial amounts of training data (more than 10B tokens), and the resulting hybrid models also exhibit poor long-context performance, which is the scenario where hybrid models enjoy significant inference speedups over Transformer-based models. In this paper, we present HALO (Hybrid Attention via Layer Optimization), a pipeline for distilling Transformer models into RNN-attention hybrid models. We then present HypeNet, a hybrid architecture with superior length generalization enabled by a novel position encoding scheme (named HyPE) and various architectural modifications. We convert the Qwen3 series into HypeNet using HALO, achieving performance comparable to the original Transformer models while enjoying superior long-context performance and efficiency. The conversion requires just 2.3B tokens, less than 0.01% of their pre-training data

*Rongzheng Wang,Yihong Huang,Muquan Li,Jiakai Li,Di Liang,Bob Simons,Pei Ke,Shuang Liang,Ke Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DASH is a new framework for LLM-driven heuristic design that optimizes solver search and runtime schedules while reducing adaptation costs through profile-based warm starts. It outperforms existing methods in efficiency and solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-Driven Heuristic Design frameworks suffer from endpoint-only evaluation and high adaptation costs when faced with distribution shifts.

Method: DASH introduces Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics and Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR) to optimize solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules while archiving specialized solvers for cost-effective adaptation.

Result: DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times and maintains high solution quality across diverse problem scales, reducing LLM adaptation costs by 90%.

Conclusion: DASH addresses key limitations of existing LHD frameworks, offering a more efficient and adaptable solution for combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced the field of Combinatorial Optimization through automated heuristic generation. Instead of relying on manual design, this LLM-Driven Heuristic Design (LHD) process leverages LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solvers to achieve high performance. However, existing LHD frameworks face two critical limitations: (1) Endpoint-only evaluation, which ranks solvers solely by final quality, ignoring the convergence process and runtime efficiency; (2) High adaptation costs, where distribution shifts necessitate re-adaptation to generate specialized solvers for new instance groups. To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales. Furthermore, by enabling profile-based warm starts, DASH maintains superior accuracy under different distributions while cutting LLM adaptation costs by over 90%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FIP is a method to improve pretraining by focusing on a target modality for better downstream performance without extra resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard pretraining treats all modalities equally, leading to suboptimal representations for the modality used in fine-tuning.

Method: FIP biases learning toward the target modality via higher masking difficulty, stronger loss weighting, and increased decoder capacity.

Result: Applied to wireless signals, FIP improves fine-tuned performance without additional data or compute.

Conclusion: FIP is effective, simple, and broadly applicable for multimodal masked modeling.

Abstract: Multimodal pretraining is effective for building general-purpose representations, but in many practical deployments, only one modality is heavily used during downstream fine-tuning. Standard pretraining strategies treat all modalities uniformly, which can lead to under-optimized representations for the modality that actually matters. We propose Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP), a model-agnostic method that biases representation learning toward a designated target modality needed at fine-tuning time. FIP combines higher masking difficulty, stronger loss weighting, and increased decoder capacity for the target modality, without modifying the shared encoder or requiring additional supervision. When applied to masked modeling on constellation diagrams for wireless signals, FIP consistently improves downstream fine-tuned performance with no extra data or compute. FIP is simple to implement, architecture-compatible, and broadly applicable across multimodal masked modeling pipelines.

Motivation: The limited number of well-characterized hydrides in existing databases hinders the discovery of optimal hydrogen storage materials.

Method: Integration of causal discovery with a lightweight generative ML model, trained on 450 samples (270 training, 90 validation, 90 testing), to generate 1,000 candidates.

Result: Six novel chemical formulas and crystal structures were identified, with four validated by density functional theory simulations.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, time-efficient approach to expand hydrogen storage datasets and accelerate materials discovery.

Abstract: Developing new metal hydrides is a critical step toward efficient hydrogen storage in carbon-neutral energy systems. However, existing materials databases, such as the Materials Project, contain a limited number of well-characterized hydrides, which constrains the discovery of optimal candidates. This work presents a framework that integrates causal discovery with a lightweight generative machine learning model to generate novel metal hydride candidates that may not exist in current databases. Using a dataset of 450 samples (270 training, 90 validation, and 90 testing), the model generates 1,000 candidates. After ranking and filtering, six previously unreported chemical formulas and crystal structures are identified, four of which are validated by density functional theory simulations and show strong potential for future experimental investigation. Overall, the proposed framework provides a scalable and time-efficient approach for expanding hydrogen storage datasets and accelerating materials discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a prompt-sharing framework for continual learning to improve parameter utilization and reduce catastrophic forgetting by dynamically activating prompts and protecting frequently used ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based continual learning methods isolate knowledge by assigning fixed prompts to tasks, leading to suboptimal parameter use.

Method: Proposes a global prompt pool and task-aware gated routing for dynamic prompt activation, along with a history-aware modulator to protect frequently used prompts.

Result: The framework outperforms static allocation strategies in effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: Dynamic prompt activation and protection strategies enhance continual learning performance.

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning methods effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, most existing methods assign a fixed set of prompts to each task, completely isolating knowledge across tasks and resulting in suboptimal parameter utilization. To address this, we consider the practical needs of continual learning and propose a prompt-sharing framework. This framework constructs a global prompt pool and introduces a task-aware gated routing mechanism that sparsely activates a subset of prompts to achieve dynamic decoupling and collaborative optimization of task-specific feature representations. Furthermore, we introduce a history-aware modulator that leverages cumulative prompt activation statistics to protect frequently used prompts from excessive updates, thereby mitigating inefficient parameter usage and knowledge forgetting. Extensive analysis and empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing static allocation strategies in effectiveness and efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new initialization technique for predictive coding networks to reduce computational demands and improve training efficiency, showing significant improvements in convergence speed and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the high computational requirements of energy-based learning algorithms like predictive coding, which hinder their broader applicability despite their versatility and strong mathematical foundation.

Method: The authors propose a novel initialization method for predictive coding networks that leverages iterative progress from previous training samples, aiming to optimize training efficiency.

Result: Experiments demonstrate notable enhancements in convergence speed and final test loss across both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed initialization technique offers a viable solution to improve computational efficiency and performance, bridging gaps between predictive coding and backpropagation methods.

Abstract: Research aimed at scaling up neuroscience inspired learning algorithms for neural networks is accelerating. Recently, a key research area has been the study of energy-based learning algorithms such as predictive coding, due to their versatility and mathematical grounding. However, the applicability of such methods is held back by the large computational requirements caused by their iterative nature. In this work, we address this problem by showing that the choice of initialization of the neurons in a predictive coding network matters significantly and can notably reduce the required training times. Consequently, we propose a new initialization technique for predictive coding networks that aims to preserve the iterative progress made on previous training samples. Our approach suggests a promising path toward reconciling the disparities between predictive coding and backpropagation in terms of computational efficiency and final performance. In fact, our experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in convergence speed and final test loss in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

Result: GDT reduces forecasting error (median MASE 0.87 vs. 0.97 baselines), improves risk stratification (C-index 0.703 vs. 0.662), and generalizes to clinical trials (MASE 0.75-0.88, C-index 0.672 vs. 0.648).

Conclusion: TwinWeaver provides a scalable, interpretable foundation for clinical modeling, enhancing precision oncology workflows.

Abstract: Precision oncology requires forecasting clinical events and trajectories, yet modeling sparse, multi-modal clinical time series remains a critical challenge. We introduce TwinWeaver, an open-source framework that serializes longitudinal patient histories into text, enabling unified event prediction as well as forecasting with large language models, and use it to build Genie Digital Twin (GDT) on 93,054 patients across 20 cancer types. In benchmarks, GDT significantly reduces forecasting error, achieving a median Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) of 0.87 compared to 0.97 for the strongest time-series baseline (p<0.001). Furthermore, GDT improves risk stratification, achieving an average concordance index (C-index) of 0.703 across survival, progression, and therapy switching tasks, surpassing the best baseline of 0.662. GDT also generalizes to out-of-distribution clinical trials, matching trained baselines at zero-shot and surpassing them with fine-tuning, achieving a median MASE of 0.75-0.88 and outperforming the strongest baseline in event prediction with an average C-index of 0.672 versus 0.648. Finally, TwinWeaver enables an interpretable clinical reasoning extension, providing a scalable and transparent foundation for longitudinal clinical modeling.

*Chen Feng,Minghe Shen,Ananth Balashankar,Carsten Gerner-Beuerle,Miguel R. D. Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 'Noisy but Valid' framework for certifying LLMs, ensuring statistical guarantees despite imperfect judges, outperforming direct evaluation in certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable certification of LLMs is challenging due to imperfections in judge evaluations (noise, bias). Existing methods lack theoretical guarantees.

Method: Uses a human-labeled calibration set to estimate judge's TPR/FPR, applies variance-corrected thresholds to judge-labeled data, ensuring Type-I error control.

Result: Theoretical guarantees show noisy testing outperforms direct evaluation; experiments confirm this. Reveals gap between practical methods and ideal conditions.

Conclusion: The framework provides interpretable diagnostics for judge reliability, clarifying evaluation power dependencies, and improves statistical certification of LLMs.

Abstract: Reliable certification of Large Language Models (LLMs)-verifying that failure rates are below a safety threshold-is critical yet challenging. While "LLM-as-a-Judge" offers scalability, judge imperfections, noise, and bias can invalidate statistical guarantees. We introduce a "Noisy but Valid" hypothesis testing framework to address this. By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset. Crucially, our framework theoretically guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control (validity) despite calibration uncertainty. This distinguishes our work from Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), positioning our method as a diagnostic tool that explicitly models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical Guarantees: We derive the exact conditions under which noisy testing yields higher statistical power than direct evaluation; (2) Empirical Validation: Experiments on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech and SafeRLHF confirm our theory; (3) The Oracle Gap: We reveal a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical "Oracle" (perfectly known judge parameters), quantifying the cost of estimation. Specifically, we provide the first systematic treatment of the imperfect-judge setting, yielding interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifying how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification levels. Together, these results sharpen understanding of statistical evaluation with LLM judges, and highlight trade-offs among competing inferential tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate noninvasive ICP estimation is challenging but crucial in critical care.

Method: Uses subspace system identification and ranking-constrained optimization to model ICP from noninvasive signals like ABP, CBv, and R-R intervals.

Result: Around 31.88% of tests had errors within 2 mmHg, and 34.07% had errors between 2-6 mmHg.

Conclusion: The approach shows feasibility for noninvasive ICP monitoring, though further validation is needed.

Abstract: Objective: Accurate noninvasive estimation of intracranial pressure (ICP) remains a major challenge in critical care. We developed a bespoke machine learning algorithm that integrates system identification and ranking-constrained optimization to estimate mean ICP from noninvasive signals. Methods: A machine learning framework was proposed to obtain accurate mean ICP values using arbitrary noninvasive signals. The subspace system identification algorithm is employed to identify cerebral hemodynamics models for ICP simulation using arterial blood pressure (ABP), cerebral blood velocity (CBv), and R-wave to R-wave interval (R-R interval) signals in a comprehensive database. A mapping function to describe the relationship between the features of noninvasive signals and the estimation errors is learned using innovative ranking constraints through convex optimization. Patients across multiple clinical settings were randomly split into testing and training datasets for performance evaluation of the mapping function. Results: The results indicate that about 31.88% of testing entries achieved estimation errors within 2 mmHg and 34.07% of testing entries between 2 mmHg to 6 mmHg from the nonlinear mapping with constraints. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed noninvasive ICP estimation approach. Significance: Further validation and technical refinement are required before clinical deployment, but this work lays the foundation for safe and broadly accessible ICP monitoring in patients with acute brain injury and related conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend binary classification theory beyond the realizable case by removing distributional assumptions, revealing fundamental rate limits.

Method: Identifies combinatorial structures classifying concept classes into one of four rate categories: exponential, sub-exponential, sub-root, or arbitrarily slow.

Result: Establishes a tetrachotomy of optimal rates ($e^{-n}$, $e^{-o(n)}$, $o(n^{-1/2})$, or arbitrarily slow) for excess error convergence, determined by combinatorial properties.

Conclusion: Reveals universal rate limits for agnostic binary classification, with implications for learning theory and algorithm design.

Abstract: We provide a complete theory of optimal universal rates for binary classification in the agnostic setting. This extends the realizable-case theory of Bousquet, Hanneke, Moran, van Handel, and Yehudayoff (2021) by removing the realizability assumption on the distribution. We identify a fundamental tetrachotomy of optimal rates: for every concept class, the optimal universal rate of convergence of the excess error rate is one of $e^{-n}$, $e^{-o(n)}$, $o(n^{-1/2})$, or arbitrarily slow. We further identify simple combinatorial structures which determine which of these categories any given concept class falls into.

TL;DR: A framework for active information gathering decouples modeling choices from costs, generalizes mutual information costs, and validates mutual information-based active learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for active information gathering in unknown dynamical systems are tied to specific modeling choices, limiting their generality. A unifying framework is needed to decouple these choices.

Method: The proposed framework exposes causal dependencies between parameters, beliefs, and controls, deriving a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information. It assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and remains agnostic to other modeling choices.

Result: The framework generalizes the mutual information cost used in literature, proving it is a special case of the proposed cost. It also connects mutual information cost to information gain in linearized Bayesian estimation, justifying mutual information-based active learning.

Conclusion: The framework's utility is demonstrated through experiments across various systems (linear, nonlinear, multi-agent), proving its broad applicability and theoretical grounding.

Abstract: An agent operating in an unknown dynamical system must learn its dynamics from observations. Active information gathering accelerates this learning, but existing methods derive bespoke costs for specific modeling choices: dynamics models, belief update procedures, observation models, and planners. We present a unifying framework that decouples these choices from the information-gathering cost by explicitly exposing the causal dependencies between parameters, beliefs, and controls. Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices. We prove that the mutual information cost used in existing literature is a special case of our cost. Then, we leverage our framework to establish an explicit connection between the mutual information cost and information gain in linearized Bayesian estimation, thereby providing theoretical justification for mutual information-based active learning approaches. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of our framework through experiments spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-agent systems.

*Ahmed Rashwan,Keith Briggs,Chris Budd,Lisa Kreusser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HM-RI networks, a learning approach for monotone optimisation problems, replacing costly bisection in POA with fast projection predictions while maintaining solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monotone optimisation problems often lack explicit functions, relying on data. Standard POA solvers are computationally expensive due to bisection. The goal is to integrate learned models into POA for efficiency.

Method: Proposes HM-RI networks, neural architectures enforcing monotonicity and homogeneity, to predict POA's projection primitive via radial inverse, avoiding bisection. Relaxed monotonicity conditions reduce training overhead.

Result: HM-RI networks achieve significant speed-ups over direct function estimation in benchmarks (quadratic programming, multiplicative programming, power optimisation) while preserving solution quality.

Conclusion: The HM-RI approach effectively combines learning with POA, exploiting monotonic structure for faster optimisation without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Monotone optimisation problems admit specialised global solvers such as the Polyblock Outer Approximation (POA) algorithm, but these methods typically require explicit objective and constraint functions. In many applications, these functions are only available through data, making POA difficult to apply directly. We introduce an algorithm-aware learning approach that integrates learned models into POA by directly predicting its projection primitive via the radial inverse, avoiding the costly bisection procedure used in standard POA. We propose Homogeneous-Monotone Radial Inverse (HM-RI) networks, structured neural architectures that enforce key monotonicity and homogeneity properties, enabling fast projection estimation. We provide a theoretical characterisation of radial inverse functions and show that, under mild structural conditions, a HM-RI predictor corresponds to the radial inverse of a valid set of monotone constraints. To reduce training overhead, we further develop relaxed monotonicity conditions that remain compatible with POA. Across multiple monotone optimisation benchmarks (indefinite quadratic programming, multiplicative programming, and transmit power optimisation), our approach yields substantial speed-ups in comparison to direct function estimation while maintaining strong solution quality, outperforming baselines that do not exploit monotonic structure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the dual challenges of organizing sensory information and far-sighted planning in robotic systems, the paper seeks to integrate active inference into reinforcement learning for better sample efficiency.

Method: The authors propose a formal abstraction covering model-based, distributional, and model-free reinforcement learning approaches, integrating active inference into distributional reinforcement learning.

Result: The integration allows leveraging active inference's advantages without requiring transition dynamics modeling, enhancing performance.

Conclusion: The abstraction successfully unifies reinforcement learning with active inference, offering a more efficient solution for robotic control tasks.

Abstract: Optimal control of complex environments with robotic systems faces two complementary and intertwined challenges: efficient organization of sensory state information and far-sighted action planning. Because the reinforcement learning framework addresses only the latter, it tends to deliver sample-inefficient solutions. Active inference is the state-of-the-art process theory that explains how biological brains handle this dual problem. However, its applications to artificial intelligence have thus far been limited to extensions of existing model-based approaches. We present a formal abstraction of reinforcement learning algorithms that spans model-based, distributional, and model-free approaches. This abstraction seamlessly integrates active inference into the distributional reinforcement learning framework, making its performance advantages accessible without transition dynamics modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the data bottleneck in deploying ML models for child development monitoring in new countries with limited samples.

Method: Introduces a pre-trained encoder trained on UNICEF survey data across 44 countries, applied with transfer learning.

Result: Achieves average AUC of 0.65 with 50 samples, 0.73 with 500 samples, and AUCs up to 0.84 in zero-shot deployment.

Conclusion: Pre-trained encoders can significantly improve ML feasibility for SDG 4.2.1 monitoring in low-resource settings.

Abstract: A large number of children experience preventable developmental delays each year, yet the deployment of machine learning in new countries has been stymied by a data bottleneck: reliable models require thousands of samples, while new programs begin with fewer than 100. We introduce the first pre-trained encoder for global child development, trained on 357,709 children across 44 countries using UNICEF survey data. With only 50 training samples, the pre-trained encoder achieves an average AUC of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.56-0.72), outperforming cold-start gradient boosting at 0.61 by 8-12% across regions. At N=500, the encoder achieves an AUC of 0.73. Zero-shot deployment to unseen countries achieves AUCs up to 0.84. We apply a transfer learning bound to explain why pre-training diversity enables few-shot generalization. These results establish that pre-trained encoders can transform the feasibility of ML for SDG 4.2.1 monitoring in resource-constrained settings.

### [171] [Top-k on a Budget: Adaptive Ranking with Weak and Strong Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20989)
*Lutz Oettershagen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the problem of identifying top-k items with limited access to a high-fidelity oracle, proposing adaptive algorithms to minimize costly strong oracle calls while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to efficiently identify top-k items when exact valuations are expensive by leveraging a noisy, cheap weak oracle alongside a scarce, accurate strong oracle.

Method: The methods include a baseline screen-then-certify (STC) approach and two adaptive algorithms: ACE, which focuses strong queries on critical items, and ACE-W, which further optimizes by adaptively allocating the weak budget.

Result: The results show ACE achieves the same theoretical bound as STC but reduces strong calls in practice, while ACE-W further minimizes strong costs by adaptively allocating the weak budget.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the effectiveness of adaptive algorithms like ACE and ACE-W in reducing reliance on expensive strong oracles while maintaining accuracy in top-k identification.

Abstract: Identifying the top-$k$ items is fundamental but often prohibitive when exact valuations are expensive. We study a two-oracle setting with a fast, noisy weak oracle and a scarce, high-fidelity strong oracle (e.g., human expert verification or expensive simulation). We first analyze a simple screen-then-certify baseline (STC) and prove it makes at most $m(4\varepsilon_{\max})$ strong calls given jointly valid weak confidence intervals with maximum radius $\varepsilon_{\max}$, where $m(\cdot)$ denotes the near-tie mass around the top-$k$ threshold. We establish a conditional lower bound of $Ω(m(\varepsilon_{\max}))$ for any algorithm given the same weak uncertainty. Our main contribution is ACE, an adaptive certification algorithm that focuses strong queries on critical boundary items, achieving the same $O(m(4\varepsilon_{\max}))$ bound while reducing strong calls in practice. We then introduce ACE-W, a fully adaptive two-phase method that allocates weak budget adaptively before running ACE, further reducing strong costs.

### [172] [The Depth Delusion: Why Transformers Should Be Wider, Not Deeper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20994)
*Md Muhtasim Munif Fahim,Md Rezaul Karim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how architecture impacts neural scaling laws, showing width should grow faster than depth and revealing a critical depth beyond which performance declines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scaling laws treat model architecture as interchangeable, ignoring how depth and width uniquely affect performance.

Method: The authors propose architecture-conditioned scaling laws, decomposing dependence on depth and width, and validate findings across 30 transformer architectures.

Result: Optimal depth scales as D* ~ C^0.12, width as W* ~ C^0.34 (2.8x faster), with a critical depth D_crit ~ W^0.44 beyond which performance drops.

Conclusion: Optimal depth-width tradeoffs persist at scale, with deeper models potentially underperforming even with more parameters.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws describe how language model loss decreases with parameters and data, but treat architecture as interchangeable--a billion parameters could arise from a shallow-wide model (10 layers & 8,192 hidden dimension) or a deep-narrow one (80 layers & 2,048 hidden dimension). We propose architecture-conditioned scaling laws decomposing this dependence, finding that optimal depth scales as D* ~ C^0.12 while optimal width scales as W* ~ C^0.34, meaning width should grow 2.8x faster than depth. We discover a critical depth phenomenon: beyond D_crit ~ W^0.44 (sublinear in W), adding layers increases loss despite adding parameters--the Depth Delusion. Empirically, we validate these findings across 30 transformer architectures spanning 17M to 7B parameters, each trained on representative high-compute samples, achieving R^2 = 0.922. Our central finding: at 7B scale, a 64-layer model (6.38B params) underperforms a 32-layer model (6.86B params) by 0.12 nats, despite being significantly deeper. This demonstrates that optimal depth-width tradeoffs persist at the production scale.

*Shreshth A Malik,Tiarnan Doherty,Panagiotis Tigas,Muhammed Razzak,Stephen J. Roberts,Aron Walsh,Yarin Gal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MADE is a framework benchmarking autonomous materials discovery pipelines by simulating iterative, resource-limited workflows, comparing against baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook the iterative nature of scientific discovery, focusing only on static or isolated tasks.

Method: MADE simulates closed-loop discovery with constrained budgets, formalizing discovery as stable compound searches.

Result: Flexible framework allows component ablation and scalability comparison across varied discovery workflows.

Conclusion: MADE enables systematic evaluation of autonomous materials discovery pipelines, capturing real-world constraints.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for computational materials discovery primarily evaluate static predictive tasks or isolated computational sub-tasks. While valuable, these evaluations neglect the inherently iterative and adaptive nature of scientific discovery. We introduce MAterials Discovery Environments (MADE), a novel framework for benchmarking end-to-end autonomous materials discovery pipelines. MADE simulates closed-loop discovery campaigns in which an agent or algorithm proposes, evaluates, and refines candidate materials under a constrained oracle budget, capturing the sequential and resource-limited nature of real discovery workflows. We formalize discovery as a search for thermodynamically stable compounds relative to a given convex hull, and evaluate efficacy and efficiency via comparison to baseline algorithms. The framework is flexible; users can compose discovery agents from interchangeable components such as generative models, filters, and planners, enabling the study of arbitrary workflows ranging from fixed pipelines to fully agentic systems with tool use and adaptive decision making. We demonstrate this by conducting systematic experiments across a family of systems, enabling ablation of components in discovery pipelines, and comparison of how methods scale with system complexity.

*Ruicheng Ao,David Simchi-Levi,Xinshang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two benchmarks for evaluating iterative debugging and behavioral rationality in Operations Research models, showing that domain-specific training outperforms larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate OR as one-shot tasks, ignoring the iterative diagnostic loop typical in practice.

Method: Two benchmarks are introduced: \ORDebug{} evaluates iterative self-correction, and \ORBias{} measures deviations from optimal policies in newsvendor problems.

Result: Domain-specific RLVR training significantly improves recovery rates, diagnostic accuracy, and resolution speed, while curriculum training reduces bias.

Conclusion: Process-level evaluation with verifiable feedback enables targeted training that surpasses larger models.

Abstract: Operations Research practitioners routinely debug infeasible models through an iterative process: analyzing Irreducible Infeasible Subsystems (\IIS{}), identifying constraint conflicts, and systematically repairing formulations until feasibility is achieved. Yet existing LLM benchmarks evaluate OR as one-shot translation -- given a problem description, generate solver code -- ignoring this diagnostic loop entirely. We introduce two benchmarks that place the \textbf{solver in the evaluation loop}. \textbf{\ORDebug{}} evaluates iterative self-correction through 5,000+ problems spanning 9 error types; each repair action triggers solver re-execution and \IIS{} recomputation, providing deterministic, verifiable feedback. \textbf{\ORBias{}} evaluates behavioral rationality through 2,000 newsvendor instances (1,000 ID + 1,000 OOD), measuring systematic deviations from closed-form optimal policies. Across 26 models and 12,000+ samples, we find that domain-specific RLVR training enables an 8B model to surpass frontier APIs: 95.3\% vs 86.2\% recovery rate (+9.1\%), 62.4\% vs 47.8\% diagnostic accuracy (+14.6\%), and 2.25 vs 3.78 steps to resolution (1.7$\times$ faster). On \ORBias{}, curriculum training achieves the only negative ID$\rightarrow$OOD bias drift among models evaluated (-9.6\%), reducing systematic bias by 48\% (from 20.0\% to 10.4\%). These results demonstrate that process-level evaluation with verifiable oracles enables targeted training that outperforms scale.

*Young Kyung Kim,Oded Schlesinger,Qiangqiang Wu,J. Matías Di Martino,Guillermo Sapiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OATTA introduces a lightweight, model-agnostic module for Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) that leverages temporal dynamics in test-time streams, improving accuracy by up to 6.35% compared to order-agnostic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods treat test-time streams as independent samples, missing the supervisory signal in temporal dynamics. OATTA addresses this gap.

Method: OATTA formulates TTA as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task, using a dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior. A likelihood-ratio gate ensures safety when temporal evidence is weak.

Result: Experiments show OATTA boosts accuracy by up to 6.35% across image classification, wearable/physiological signal analysis, and sentiment analysis.

Conclusion: Modeling temporal dynamics provides a critical, orthogonal signal for TTA, making OATTA universally effective.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enables pre-trained models to adjust to distribution shift by learning from unlabeled test-time streams. However, existing methods typically treat these streams as independent samples, overlooking the supervisory signal inherent in temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (OATTA). We formulate test-time adaptation as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task, using a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine the base model's predictions. To ensure safety in weakly structured streams, we introduce a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) that reverts to the base predictor when temporal evidence is absent. OATTA is a lightweight, model-agnostic module that incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments across image classification, wearable and physiological signal analysis, and language sentiment analysis demonstrate its universality; OATTA consistently boosts established baselines, improving accuracy by up to 6.35%. Our findings establish that modeling temporal dynamics provides a critical, orthogonal signal beyond standard order-agnostic TTA approaches.

### [176] [Conditional Denoising Model as a Physical Surrogate Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21021)
*José Afonso,Pedro Viegas,Rodrigo Ventura,Vasco Guerra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Conditional Denoising Model (CDM), a generative model that learns the geometry of physical manifolds, improving accuracy and adherence to physical laws without explicit constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between data-fitting accuracy and physical consistency in surrogate modeling of complex physical systems.

Method: Develop the CDM, trained to restore clean states from noisy ones, learning a vector field that guides solutions to the valid subspace. Uses deterministic fixed-point iteration for inference.

Result: CDM outperforms physics-consistent baselines in parameter and data efficiency, and adheres more strictly to physical constraints.

Conclusion: The denoising objective acts as an implicit regularizer, ensuring physical consistency without explicit training on governing equations.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling for complex physical systems typically faces a trade-off between data-fitting accuracy and physical consistency. Physics-consistent approaches typically treat physical laws as soft constraints within the loss function, a strategy that frequently fails to guarantee strict adherence to the governing equations, or rely on post-processing corrections that do not intrinsically learn the underlying solution geometry. To address these limitations, we introduce the {Conditional Denoising Model (CDM)}, a generative model designed to learn the geometry of the physical manifold itself. By training the network to restore clean states from noisy ones, the model learns a vector field that points continuously towards the valid solution subspace. We introduce a time-independent formulation that transforms inference into a deterministic fixed-point iteration, effectively projecting noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold. Validated on a low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmark, the CDM achieves higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate that the denoising objective acts as a powerful implicit regularizer: despite never seeing the governing equations during training, the model adheres to physical constraints more strictly than baselines trained with explicit physics losses.

TL;DR: SIGMA-PPG improves PPG signal analysis by combining generative modeling, reinforcement learning, and semantic consistency constraints, outperforming other methods across 12 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PPG foundation models struggle with signal redundancy, noise, and lack morphological precision in contrastive methods.

Method: Uses Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking with reinforcement learning and semantic consistency via vector quantization to enhance learning.

Result: Achieves superior performance on 12 downstream tasks with pre-training on 120,000 hours of data.

Conclusion: SIGMA-PPG addresses key limitations in PPG signal analysis, offering a robust and scalable solution.

Abstract: Current foundation model for photoplethysmography (PPG) signals is challenged by the intrinsic redundancy and noise of the signal. Standard masked modeling often yields trivial solutions while contrastive methods lack morphological precision. To address these limitations, we propose a Statistical-prior Informed Generative Masking Architecture (SIGMA-PPG), a generative foundation model featuring a Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking mechanism, where a reinforcement learning-driven teacher leverages statistical priors to create challenging learning paths that prevent overfitting to noise. We also incorporate a semantic consistency constraint via vector quantization to ensure that physiologically identical waveforms (even those altered by recording artifacts or minor perturbations) map to shared indices. This enhances codebook semantic density and eliminates redundant feature structures. Pre-trained on over 120,000 hours of data, SIGMA-PPG achieves superior average performance compared to five state-of-the-art baselines across 12 diverse downstream tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ZonghengGuo/SigmaPPG.

*Omer Rochman-Sharabi,Gilles Louppe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A constrained sampling framework using diffusion models ensures physical accuracy and constraint satisfaction in scientific applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla diffusion models lack guarantees for physical accuracy or constraint satisfaction, which is critical for scientific applications.

Method: Introduced a constrained sampling framework with Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR), alternating between denoising, projecting onto feasible sets, and renoising.

Result: PPR reduces constraint violations by over an order of magnitude, improves sample consistency, and better matches the true constrained distribution.

Conclusion: The PPR framework effectively enforces hard constraints in diffusion models, enhancing their utility for scientific applications.

Abstract: Neural emulators based on diffusion models show promise for scientific applications, but vanilla models cannot guarantee physical accuracy or constraint satisfaction. We address this by introducing a constrained sampling framework that enforces hard constraints, such as physical laws or observational consistency, at generation time. Our approach defines a constrained forward process that diffuses only over the feasible set of constraint-satisfying samples, inducing constrained marginal distributions. To reverse this, we propose Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR), an iterative algorithm that samples from the constrained marginals by alternating between denoising predictions, projecting onto the feasible set, and renoising. Experiments on 2D distributions, PDEs, and global weather forecasting demonstrate that PPR reduces constraint violations by over an order of magnitude while improving sample consistency and better matching the true constrained distribution compared to baselines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using video generation models for visual reasoning, demonstrating their effectiveness in tasks like Maze Navigation and Tangram Puzzles, with strong zero-shot generalization and visual context utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models often lack fine-grained spatial understanding and continuous action planning, limiting complex visual reasoning. This work explores video generation as a solution.

Method: Video generation models are used to simulate intermediate reasoning steps. Evaluated on Maze Navigation (discrete planning) and Tangram Puzzle (continuous manipulation).

Result: Key findings include robust zero-shot generalization, effective use of visual context, and a visual test-time scaling law for better planning.

Conclusion: Video generation serves as a scalable, generalizable paradigm for visual reasoning, beyond just a media tool.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models have excelled at textual reasoning, but they often struggle with fine-grained spatial understanding and continuous action planning, failing to simulate the dynamics required for complex visual reasoning. In this work, we formulate visual reasoning by means of video generation models, positing that generated frames can act as intermediate reasoning steps between initial states and solutions. We evaluate their capacity in two distinct regimes: Maze Navigation for sequential discrete planning with low visual change and Tangram Puzzle for continuous manipulation with high visual change. Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning. (2) Visual Context: The model effectively uses visual context as explicit control, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, enabling it to maintain high visual consistency and adapt its planning capability robustly to unseen patterns. (3) Visual Test-Time Scaling: We observe a test-time scaling law in sequential planning; increasing the generated video length (visual inference budget) empowers better zero-shot generalization to spatially and temporally complex paths. These findings suggest that video generation is not merely a media tool, but a scalable, generalizable paradigm for visual reasoning.

*Yiqiao Liao,Farinaz Koushanfar,Parinaz Naghizadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TACO is a test-time adaptation framework for unsupervised neural combinatorial optimization, unifying generalization-focused and instance-specific models to improve solution quality without significant computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised NCO approaches either generalize across instances without adaptability or optimize instance-specific models independently, leading to inefficiencies or poor local optima. TACO aims to combine inductive bias with instance-wise flexibility.

Method: TACO uses strategic warm-starting to relax trained parameters partially, preserving learned inductive bias while enabling unsupervised adaptation at test time.

Result: TACO outperforms naive fine-tuning or scratch optimization in solution quality for Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique problems, handling static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic scenarios robustly.

Conclusion: TACO effectively bridges generalizable and instance-specific NCO paradigms, offering practical advantages in unsupervised combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Unsupervised neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) enables learning powerful solvers without access to ground-truth solutions. Existing approaches fall into two disjoint paradigms: models trained for generalization across instances, and instance-specific models optimized independently at test time. While the former are efficient during inference, they lack effective instance-wise adaptability; the latter are flexible but fail to exploit learned inductive structure and are prone to poor local optima. This motivates the central question of our work: how can we leverage the inductive bias learned through generalization while unlocking the flexibility required for effective instance-wise adaptation? We first identify a challenge in bridging these two paradigms: generalization-focused models often constitute poor warm starts for instance-wise optimization, potentially underperforming even randomly initialized models when fine-tuned at test time. To resolve this incompatibility, we propose TACO, a model-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that unifies and extends the two existing paradigms for unsupervised NCO. TACO applies strategic warm-starting to partially relax trained parameters while preserving inductive bias, enabling rapid and effective unsupervised adaptation. Crucially, compared to naively fine-tuning a trained generalizable model or optimizing an instance-specific model from scratch, TACO achieves better solution quality while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Experiments on canonical CO problems, Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TACO across static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, establishing it as a practical bridge between generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised NCO.

Conclusion: Snowball demonstrates significant improvement in efficiency for combinatorial optimization tasks.

Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as accelerators for combinatorial optimization. To enable practical deployment, this work aims to reduce time-to-solution by addressing three challenges: (1) hardware topology, (2) spin selection and update algorithms, and (3) scalable coupling-coefficient precision. Restricted topologies require minor embedding; naive parallel updates can oscillate or stall; and limited precision can preclude feasible mappings or degrade solution quality.
  This work presents Snowball, a digital, scalable, all-to-all coupled Ising machine that integrates dual-mode Markov chain Monte Carlo spin selection with asynchronous spin updates to promote convergence and reduce time-to-solution. The digital architecture supports wide, configurable coupling precision, unlike many analog realizations at high bit widths. A prototype on an AMD Alveo U250 accelerator card achieves an 8$\times$ reduction in time-to-solution relative to a state-of-the-art Ising machine on the same benchmark instance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a collaborative framework between humans and LLMs for feature engineering in tabular learning, focusing on separating operation proposal (by LLMs) from utility-guided selection (with human feedback) to improve efficiency and reduce user cognitive load.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based feature engineering approaches lack calibrated utility estimates and strategic prioritization, leading to inefficiency. The paper aims to address this by integrating human expertise into the selection process.

Method: The framework decouples operation proposal (handled by LLMs) from selection (guided by explicit utility modeling and human feedback). It includes a mechanism to incorporate expert preferences early in the process.

Result: Evaluations on synthetic and real datasets show improved feature engineering performance and reduced cognitive load for users.

Conclusion: The proposed human-LLM collaborative framework enhances feature engineering efficiency and effectiveness in tabular learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate feature engineering in tabular learning. Given task-specific information, LLMs can propose diverse feature transformation operations to enhance downstream model performance. However, current approaches typically assign the LLM as a black-box optimizer, responsible for both proposing and selecting operations based solely on its internal heuristics, which often lack calibrated estimations of operation utility and consequently lead to repeated exploration of low-yield operations without a principled strategy for prioritizing promising directions. In this paper, we propose a human-LLM collaborative feature engineering framework for tabular learning. We begin by decoupling the transformation operation proposal and selection processes, where LLMs are used solely to generate operation candidates, while the selection is guided by explicitly modeling the utility and uncertainty of each proposed operation. Since accurate utility estimation can be difficult especially in the early rounds of feature engineering, we design a mechanism within the framework that selectively elicits and incorporates human expert preference feedback, comparing which operations are more promising, into the selection process to help identify more effective operations. Our evaluations on both the synthetic study and the real user study demonstrate that the proposed framework improves feature engineering performance across a variety of tabular datasets and reduces users' cognitive load during the feature engineering process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GFlowNets (GFNs) are generative models that sample objects proportionally to their unknown rewards. The study leverages submodular rewards to derive upper bounds for unobserved objects, introducing SUBo-GFN, which outperforms classical GFNs in data generation and task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve Generative Flow Networks by utilizing the submodular structure of rewards to derive actionable bounds for unobserved objects, enhancing efficiency and performance.

Method: The study introduces SUBo-GFN, which employs submodular upper bounds to train GFNs. It analyzes the probability of these bounds and their coverage of unobserved objects, optimizing training data generation.

Result: SUBo-GFN generates significantly more training data than classical GFNs with fewer reward queries. It demonstrates superior distribution matching and high-quality candidate generation in synthetic and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: Leveraging submodularity in GFNs via SUBo-GFN enhances efficiency and performance, enabling better handling of compositional objects with structured rewards.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets; GFNs) are a class of generative models that learn to sample compositional objects proportionally to their a priori unknown value, their reward. We focus on the case where the reward has a specified, actionable structure, namely that it is submodular. We show submodularity can be harnessed to retrieve upper bounds on the reward of compositional objects that have not yet been observed. We provide in-depth analyses of the probability of such bounds occurring, as well as how many unobserved compositional objects can be covered by a bound. Following the Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty principle, we then introduce SUBo-GFN, which uses the submodular upper bounds to train a GFN. We show that SUBo-GFN generates orders of magnitude more training data than classical GFNs for the same number of queries to the reward function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SUBo-GFN in terms of distribution matching and high-quality candidate generation on synthetic and real-world submodular tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP) to address depth-scaling issues in optimizing compound AI systems with LLMs, improving accuracy and efficiency over global methods like TextGrad.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon workflows in compound AI systems face performance degradation due to exploding or vanishing textual feedback gradients as system depth increases.

Method: TEP uses a two-phase local learning principle: a free phase for iterative prompt refinement and a nudged phase for controlled prompt edits with bounded modifications.

Result: TEP consistently outperforms global propagation methods like TextGrad on long-horizon QA benchmarks and multi-agent tool-use datasets, with gains scaling with system depth.

Conclusion: TEP mitigates depth-scaling issues in LLM-based systems, enabling efficient and accurate optimization without global textual backpropagation, preserving practicality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as part of compound AI systems that coordinate multiple modules (e.g., retrievers, tools, verifiers) over long-horizon workflows. Recent approaches that propagate textual feedback globally (e.g., TextGrad) make it feasible to optimize such pipelines, but we find that performance degrades as system depth grows. In particular, long-horizon agentic workflows exhibit two depth-scaling failure modes: 1) exploding textual gradient, where textual feedback grows exponentially with depth, leading to prohibitively long message and amplifies evaluation biases; and 2) vanishing textual gradient, where limited long-context ability causes models overemphasize partial feedback and compression of lengthy feedback causes downstream messages to lose specificity gradually as they propagate many hops upstream. To mitigate these issues, we introduce Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP), a local learning principle inspired by Equilibrium Propagation in energy-based models. TEP includes two phases: 1) a free phase where a local LLM critics iteratively refine prompts until reaching equilibrium (no further improvements are suggested); and 2) a nudged phase which applies proximal prompt edits with bounded modification intensity, using task-level objectives that propagate via forward signaling rather than backward feedback chains. This design supports local prompt optimization followed by controlled adaptation toward global goals without the computational burden and signal degradation of global textual backpropagation. Across long-horizon QA benchmarks and multi-agent tool-use dataset, TEP consistently improves accuracy and efficiency over global propagation methods such as TextGrad. The gains grows with depth, while preserving the practicality of black-box LLM components in deep compound AI system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limited generalization in graph learning models due to distribution shifts, GFMs aim to learn general-purpose representations through large-scale pretraining.

Method: The survey organizes existing approaches based on task specification flexibility, summarizing OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives.

Result: The paper provides a comprehensive review of GFMs' OOD generalization, highlighting evaluation protocols and open research questions.

Conclusion: This survey is the first to focus on OOD generalization in GFMs, offering insights into challenges and future directions for improving graph learning models.

Abstract: Graphs are a fundamental data structure for representing relational information in domains such as social networks, molecular systems, and knowledge graphs. However, graph learning models often suffer from limited generalization when applied beyond their training distributions. In practice, distribution shifts may arise from changes in graph structure, domain semantics, available modalities, or task formulations. To address these challenges, graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged, aiming to learn general-purpose representations through large-scale pretraining across diverse graphs and tasks. In this survey, we review recent progress on GFMs from the perspective of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We first discuss the main challenges posed by distribution shifts in graph learning and outline a unified problem setting. We then organize existing approaches based on whether they are designed to operate under a fixed task specification or to support generalization across heterogeneous task formulations, and summarize the corresponding OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives. Finally, we review common evaluation protocols and discuss open directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first survey for OOD generalization in GFMs.

TL;DR: LOCUS is an attention-based method that creates low-dimensional embeddings to represent LLMs' capabilities efficiently, requiring fewer samples than baselines and enabling various downstream applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in managing and utilizing the vast and dynamic pool of Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively.

Method: LOCUS uses an attention-based approach to generate embeddings via deterministic forward passes over query encodings and scores, avoiding retraining.

Result: LOCUS requires up to 4.8x fewer evaluation samples than baselines, and its embedding space is geometrically meaningful for model comparison and clustering.

Conclusion: LOCUS provides efficient, scalable, and informative embeddings for LLMs, enhancing model management and utilization.

Abstract: The rapidly growing ecosystem of Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it increasingly challenging to manage and utilize the vast and dynamic pool of models effectively. We propose LOCUS, a method that produces low-dimensional vector embeddings that compactly represent a language model's capabilities across queries. LOCUS is an attention-based approach that generates embeddings by a deterministic forward pass over query encodings and evaluation scores via an encoder model, enabling seamless incorporation of new models to the pool and refinement of existing model embeddings without having to perform any retraining. We additionally train a correctness predictor that uses model embeddings and query encodings to achieve state-of-the-art routing accuracy on unseen queries. Experiments show that LOCUS needs up to 4.8x fewer query evaluation samples than baselines to produce informative and robust embeddings. Moreover, the learned embedding space is geometrically meaningful: proximity reflects model similarity, enabling a range of downstream applications including model comparison and clustering, model portfolio selection, and resilient proxies of unavailable models.

*Marvin Sextro,Weronika Kłos,Gabriel Dernbach*

TL;DR: MapPFN is a meta-learning method for predicting perturbation effects in biological systems using synthetic data and in-context learning, achieving performance comparable to models trained on real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack adaptability to unseen biological contexts and cannot leverage new interventional evidence during inference.

Method: MapPFN, a prior-data fitted network, is pretrained on synthetic data from a causal perturbation prior and uses in-context learning without gradient-based optimization.

Result: MapPFN matches the performance of models trained on real single-cell data in identifying differentially expressed genes.

Conclusion: MapPFN demonstrates effective adaptability and performance in predicting perturbation effects, even when pretrained on synthetic data alone.

Abstract: Planning effective interventions in biological systems requires treatment-effect models that adapt to unseen biological contexts by identifying their specific underlying mechanisms. Yet single-cell perturbation datasets span only a handful of biological contexts, and existing methods cannot leverage new interventional evidence at inference time to adapt beyond their training data. To meta-learn a perturbation effect estimator, we present MapPFN, a prior-data fitted network (PFN) pretrained on synthetic data generated from a prior over causal perturbations. Given a set of experiments, MapPFN uses in-context learning to predict post-perturbation distributions, without gradient-based optimization. Despite being pretrained on in silico gene knockouts alone, MapPFN identifies differentially expressed genes, matching the performance of models trained on real single-cell data. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/marvinsxtr/MapPFN.

*Minjae Kwon,Josephine Lamp,Lu Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Safe RL algorithms often fail safety requirements during deployment due to distribution shift, but test-time shielding can effectively restore safety across various algorithms and patient populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether training-time safety guarantees in Safe RL algorithms transfer to real-world deployment under distribution shift, focusing on diabetes management as a safety-critical testbed.

Method: Benchmark safe RL algorithms on a unified clinical simulator and use test-time shielding to filter unsafe actions with learned dynamics models.

Result: Shielding improves Time-in-Range by 13-14% for baselines like PPO-Lag and CPO, reduces clinical risk index, and lowers glucose variability.

Conclusion: Test-time shielding is effective in restoring safety for Safe RL algorithms under distribution shift, providing a valuable benchmark for safety-critical domains.

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are typically evaluated under fixed training conditions. We investigate whether training-time safety guarantees transfer to deployment under distribution shift, using diabetes management as a safety-critical testbed. We benchmark safe RL algorithms on a unified clinical simulator and reveal a safety generalization gap: policies satisfying constraints during training frequently violate safety requirements on unseen patients. We demonstrate that test-time shielding, which filters unsafe actions using learned dynamics models, effectively restores safety across algorithms and patient populations. Across eight safe RL algorithms, three diabetes types, and three age groups, shielding achieves Time-in-Range gains of 13--14\% for strong baselines such as PPO-Lag and CPO while reducing clinical risk index and glucose variability. Our simulator and benchmark provide a platform for studying safety under distribution shift in safety-critical control domains.

*Shicheng Fan,Kun Zhang,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework, learns continuous mechanism transitions in causal representation learning, outperforming discrete-switching methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current temporal causal representation learning methods, which assume instantaneous mechanism switches, by modeling continuous transitions in real-world systems (e.g., vehicle dynamics, human gait).

Method: Proposes TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns an atomic mechanism. Mechanism transitions are modeled as convex combinations of these atomic mechanisms using time-varying mixing coefficients.

Result: TRACE achieves up to 0.99 correlation in recovering mixing trajectories, significantly outperforming discrete-switching baselines.

Conclusion: The method successfully models and identifies continuous mechanism transitions, generalizing to unseen intermediate states and improving real-world applications.

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning methods assume that causal mechanisms switch instantaneously between discrete domains, yet real-world systems often exhibit continuous mechanism transitions. For example, a vehicle's dynamics evolve gradually through a turning maneuver, and human gait shifts smoothly from walking to running. We formalize this setting by modeling transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms, governed by time-varying mixing coefficients. Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable. We further propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns one atomic mechanism during training, enabling recovery of mechanism trajectories at test time. This formulation generalizes to intermediate mechanism states never observed during training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that TRACE recovers mixing trajectories with up to 0.99 correlation, substantially outperforming discrete-switching baselines.

### [190] [Smooth Dynamic Cutoffs for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21147)
*Kevin Han,Haolin Cong,Bowen Deng,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dynamic cutoff radius for MLIPs, reducing memory and inference time while maintaining accuracy, and evaluates it on four state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MLIPs use fixed cutoff radii, limiting their scalability due to high memory consumption and slow inference times.

Method: The authors propose a dynamic cutoff formulation that dynamically adjusts the cutoff radius to target a specific number of neighbors per atom, optimizing memory and speed.

Result: Implementing the dynamic cutoff reduced memory usage by 2.26x and sped up inference by 2.04x, with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Dynamic cutoffs significantly improve MLIP scalability without compromising accuracy, making them viable for large-scale simulations.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have proven to be wildly useful for molecular dynamics simulations, powering countless drug and materials discovery applications. However, MLIPs face two primary bottlenecks preventing them from reaching realistic simulation scales: inference time and memory consumption. In this work, we address both issues by challenging the long-held belief that the cutoff radius for the MLIP must be held to a fixed, constant value. For the first time, we introduce a dynamic cutoff formulation that still leads to stable, long timescale molecular dynamics simulation. In introducing the dynamic cutoff, we are able to induce sparsity onto the underlying atom graph by targeting a specific number of neighbors per atom, significantly reducing both memory consumption and inference time. We show the effectiveness of a dynamic cutoff by implementing it onto 4 state of the art MLIPs: MACE, Nequip, Orbv3, and TensorNet, leading to 2.26x less memory consumption and 2.04x faster inference time, depending on the model and atomic system. We also perform an extensive error analysis and find that the dynamic cutoff models exhibit minimal accuracy dropoff compared to their fixed cutoff counterparts on both materials and molecular datasets. All model implementations and training code will be fully open sourced.

*Maria Despoina Siampou,Shushman Choudhury,Shang-Ling Hsu,Neha Arora,Cyrus Shahabi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ME-POIs captures POI function using mobility data and contrastive learning, outperforming text-only and mobility-only models in map enrichment tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current POI representations lack functional context from real-world usage, focusing only on identity or trajectory data.

Method: ME-POIs combines language model embeddings with mobility data, uses contrastive learning, and propagates temporal patterns spatially.

Result: ME-POIs consistently outperforms baselines in tasks, showing mobility data alone can sometimes surpass text-only models.

Conclusion: POI function is essential for accurate representations, and ME-POIs effectively integrates it.

Abstract: Recent progress in geospatial foundation models highlights the importance of learning general-purpose representations for real-world locations, particularly points-of-interest (POIs) where human activity concentrates. Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate ME-POIs on five newly proposed map enrichment tasks, testing its ability to capture both the identity and function of POIs. Across all tasks, augmenting text-based embeddings with ME-POIs consistently outperforms both text-only and mobility-only baselines. Notably, ME-POIs trained on mobility data alone can surpass text-only models on certain tasks, highlighting that POI function is a critical component of accurate and generalizable POI representations.

*Henry Kvinge,Andrew Aguilar,Nayda Farnsworth,Grace O'Brien,Robert Jasper,Sarah Scullen,Helen Jenne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores whether AI models trained for specific math tasks can learn broader mathematical structures, using group operations as a test case. Results show some success in capturing abstract properties like commutativity but not others like the identity element.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond simple question-answering in AI for math by investigating whether models trained on fixed tasks learn reusable mathematical structures.

Method: Train neural networks on group operations (e.g., modular arithmetic) and test if they capture group-theoretic concepts like identity, commutativity, or subgroups.

Result: Models learn representations capturing some abstract properties (e.g., commutativity) and can distinguish subgroups but fail to identify others like the identity element.

Conclusion: AI models can sometimes distill useful abstract mathematical structures, but gaps remain, suggesting potential for further exploration.

Abstract: While a real-world research program in mathematics may be guided by a motivating question, the process of mathematical discovery is typically open-ended. Ideally, exploration needed to answer the original question will reveal new structures, patterns, and insights that are valuable in their own right. This contrasts with the exam-style paradigm in which the machine learning community typically applies AI to math. To maximize progress in mathematics using AI, we will need to go beyond simple question answering. With this in mind, we explore the extent to which narrow models trained to solve a fixed mathematical task learn broader mathematical structure that can be extracted by a researcher or other AI system. As a basic test case for this, we use the task of training a neural network to predict a group operation (for example, performing modular arithmetic or composition of permutations). We describe a suite of tests designed to assess whether the model captures significant group-theoretic notions such as the identity element, commutativity, or subgroups. Through extensive experimentation we find evidence that models learn representations capable of capturing abstract algebraic properties. For example, we find hints that models capture the commutativity of modular arithmetic. We are also able to train linear classifiers that reliably distinguish between elements of certain subgroups (even though no labels for these subgroups are included in the data). On the other hand, we are unable to extract notions such as the concept of the identity element. Together, our results suggest that in some cases the representations of even small neural networks can be used to distill interesting abstract structure from new mathematical objects.

TL;DR: PARADIS is a physics-inspired global weather prediction model that decomposes weather forecasting into advection, diffusion, and reaction blocks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with lower training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monolithic machine-learning approaches to weather forecasting struggle with representing distinct physical mechanisms efficiently, particularly advection. PARADIS addresses this by imposing inductive biases through functional decomposition.

Method: PARADIS decomposes the problem into advection (using Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator), diffusion (depthwise-separable spatial mixing), and reaction (pointwise channel interactions) blocks acting on latent variables.

Result: PARADIS achieves state-of-the-art forecast skill at a fraction of the training cost, outperforming traditional and machine-learning baselines like ECMWF HRES and DeepMind's GraphCast.

Conclusion: Functional decomposition into physically inspired blocks enables efficient and accurate global weather prediction, highlighting the potential of hybrid physics-machine-learning approaches.

Abstract: Recent machine-learning approaches to weather forecasting often employ a monolithic architecture, where distinct physical mechanisms (advection, transport), diffusion-like mixing, thermodynamic processes, and forcing are represented implicitly within a single large network. This representation is particularly problematic for advection, where long-range transport must be treated with expensive global interaction mechanisms or through deep, stacked convolutional layers. To mitigate this, we present PARADIS, a physics-inspired global weather prediction model that imposes inductive biases on network behavior through a functional decomposition into advection, diffusion, and reaction blocks acting on latent variables. We implement advection through a Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator that performs trajectory-based transport via differentiable interpolation on the sphere, enabling end-to-end learning of both the latent modes to be transported and their characteristic trajectories. Diffusion-like processes are modeled through depthwise-separable spatial mixing, while local source terms and vertical interactions are modeled via pointwise channel interactions, enabling operator-level physical structure. PARADIS provides state-of-the-art forecast skill at a fraction of the training cost. On ERA5-based benchmarks, the 1 degree PARADIS model, with a total training cost of less than a GPU month, meets or exceeds the performance of 0.25 degree traditional and machine-learning baselines, including the ECMWF HRES forecast and DeepMind's GraphCast.

*Michael Ibrahim,Nagi Gebraeel,Weijun Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedGEM is a federated generalized EM algorithm for clustering with unknown global clusters, leveraging local EM steps and uncertainty sets to infer overlaps and global cluster count, showing performance comparable to centralized EM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing federated clustering with unknown total clusters and heterogeneous client data, ensuring privacy and scalability.

Method: FedGEM combines local EM steps with uncertainty sets to identify cluster overlaps and deduce global clusters via closed-form computations.

Result: Theoretical guarantees confirm convergence; experiments show performance matching centralized EM and surpassing other federated methods.

Conclusion: FedGEM effectively handles federated clustering challenges, offering theoretical and empirical advantages over existing approaches.

Abstract: We study the problem of federated clustering when the total number of clusters $K$ across clients is unknown, and the clients have heterogeneous but potentially overlapping cluster sets in their local data. To that end, we develop FedGEM: a federated generalized expectation-maximization algorithm for the training of mixture models with an unknown number of components. Our proposed algorithm relies on each of the clients performing EM steps locally, and constructing an uncertainty set around the maximizer associated with each local component. The central server utilizes the uncertainty sets to learn potential cluster overlaps between clients, and infer the global number of clusters via closed-form computations. We perform a thorough theoretical study of our algorithm, presenting probabilistic convergence guarantees under common assumptions. Subsequently, we study the specific setting of isotropic GMMs, providing tractable, low-complexity computations to be performed by each client during each iteration of the algorithm, as well as rigorously verifying assumptions required for algorithm convergence. We perform various numerical experiments, where we empirically demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable performance to centralized EM, and that it outperforms various existing federated clustering methods.

*Shuai Liu,Alireza Bakhtiari,Alex Ayoub,Botao Hao,Csaba Szepesvári*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses stochastic contextual logistic bandits under simple regret, introducing algorithms with regret bounds independent of certain parameters and validating them empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work lacked simple regret guarantees for logistic bandits, motivating the development of new algorithms for this setting.

Method: The authors propose deterministic and randomized (Thompson Sampling) algorithms, leveraging contextual linear bandits and self-concordant analysis.

Result: The deterministic algorithm achieves $	ilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\sqrt{T})$ regret, while the randomized one achieves $	ilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$, both independent of $κ$.

Conclusion: Theoretical guarantees are empirically validated, with randomized algorithms being more computationally efficient.

Abstract: We study stochastic contextual logistic bandits under the simple regret objective. While simple regret guarantees have been established for the linear case, no such results were previously known for the logistic setting. Building on ideas from contextual linear bandits and self-concordant analysis, we propose the first algorithm that achieves simple regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\sqrt{T})$. Notably, the leading term of our regret bound is free of the constant $κ= \mathcal O(\exp(S))$, where $S$ is a bound on the magnitude of the unknown parameter vector. The algorithm is shown to be fully tractable when the action set is finite. We also introduce a new variant of Thompson Sampling tailored to the simple-regret setting. This yields the first simple regret guarantee for randomized algorithms in stochastic contextual linear bandits, with regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$. Extending this method to the logistic case, we obtain a similarly structured Thompson Sampling algorithm that achieves the same regret bound -- $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$ -- again with no dependence on $κ$ in the leading term. The randomized algorithms, as expected, are cheaper to run than their deterministic counterparts. Finally, we conducted a series of experiments to empirically validate these theoretical guarantees.

*Augusto Santos,Teresa Santos,Catarina Rodrigues,José M. F. Moura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine learning method for early detection of emergent phenomena by uncovering latent causal structures from partially observed data, using a tunable feature representation and supervised learning for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to detect critical events like seizures or pandemics early by revealing hidden causal interactions in complex systems, even with unknown and partially observed data.

Method: The method learns a feature representation from powers of empirical covariance or precision matrices, tunes it to the underlying causal structure, and uses supervised learning for classification.

Result: The approach shows competitive performance in seizure detection and churn prediction, with evidence of good identifiability and interpretable structure.

Conclusion: The method successfully reconciles predictive performance with interpretability, proving effective for early detection of emergent phenomena.

Abstract: Emergent phenomena -- onset of epileptic seizures, sudden customer churn, or pandemic outbreaks -- often arise from hidden causal interactions in complex systems. We propose a machine learning method for their early detection that addresses a core challenge: unveiling and harnessing a system's latent causal structure despite the data-generating process being unknown and partially observed. The method learns an optimal feature representation from a one-parameter family of estimators -- powers of the empirical covariance or precision matrix -- offering a principled way to tune in to the underlying structure driving the emergence of critical events. A supervised learning module then classifies the learned representation. We prove structural consistency of the family and demonstrate the empirical soundness of our approach on seizure detection and churn prediction, attaining competitive results in both. Beyond prediction, and toward explainability, we ascertain that the optimal covariance power exhibits evidence of good identifiability while capturing structural signatures, thus reconciling predictive performance with interpretable statistical structure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AC2L-GAD is an Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning framework for graph anomaly detection, addressing label scarcity and class imbalance by using counterfactual reasoning and active selection, reducing computational costs by 65% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph anomaly detection struggles with label scarcity and class imbalance. Unsupervised methods like graph contrastive learning face issues with semantic consistency in positive pairs and uninformative negative contrasts.

Method: Proposes AC2L-GAD, which uses counterfactual reasoning and active selection to generate anomaly-preserving positive augmentations and hard negative contrasts, focusing on a strategic subset to reduce computational costs.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior performance on nine benchmark datasets, including financial transaction graphs, with significant improvements in datasets where anomalies involve complex attribute-structure interactions.

Conclusion: AC2L-GAD effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, offering a computationally efficient and high-performing solution for graph anomaly detection.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal patterns in networks, but faces significant challenges from label scarcity and extreme class imbalance. While graph contrastive learning offers a promising unsupervised solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: random augmentations break semantic consistency in positive pairs, while naive negative sampling produces trivial, uninformative contrasts. We propose AC2L-GAD, an Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning framework that addresses both limitations through principled counterfactual reasoning. By combining information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation, our approach identifies structurally complex nodes and generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations alongside normal negative counterparts that provide hard contrasts, while restricting expensive counterfactual generation to a strategically selected subset. This design reduces computational overhead by approximately 65% compared to full-graph counterfactual generation while maintaining detection quality. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including real-world financial transaction graphs from GADBench, show that AC2L-GAD achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with notable gains in datasets where anomalies exhibit complex attribute-structure interactions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a parallel encoding strategy for entity alignment in knowledge graphs, addressing the reasoning horizon gap by using seed pairs as anchors and a merged relation graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing entity alignment models lack transferability and struggle with unseen knowledge graphs, while direct adaptation of graph foundation models is ineffective due to the reasoning horizon gap.

Method: Proposes a parallel encoding strategy using seed EA pairs as local anchors, a merged relation graph for global dependencies, and a learnable interaction module for precise matching.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and strong generalizability to unseen knowledge graphs.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves entity alignment by addressing the reasoning horizon gap and leveraging local structural proximity.

Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) is critical for knowledge graph (KG) fusion. Existing EA models lack transferability and are incapable of aligning unseen KGs without retraining. While using graph foundation models (GFMs) offer a solution, we find that directly adapting GFMs to EA remains largely ineffective. This stems from a critical "reasoning horizon gap": unlike link prediction in GFMs, EA necessitates capturing long-range dependencies across sparse and heterogeneous KG structuresTo address this challenge, we propose a EA foundation model driven by a parallel encoding strategy. We utilize seed EA pairs as local anchors to guide the information flow, initializing and encoding two parallel streams simultaneously. This facilitates anchor-conditioned message passing and significantly shortens the inference trajectory by leveraging local structural proximity instead of global search. Additionally, we incorporate a merged relation graph to model global dependencies and a learnable interaction module for precise matching. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its strong generalizability to unseen KGs.

TL;DR: Flow Perturbation++ is introduced to reduce the high variance in unbiased Boltzmann sampling using CNFs by discretizing the probability-flow ODE and performing unbiased stepwise Jacobian estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like Hutchinson trace estimators introduce bias, while Flow Perturbation is unbiased but suffers from high variance. Flow Perturbation++ aims to address these limitations.

Method: Flow Perturbation++ discretizes the probability-flow ODE and performs unbiased stepwise Jacobian estimation at each integration step, reducing variance while retaining unbiasedness.

Result: The method achieves significantly improved equilibrium sampling on a 1000D Gaussian Mixture Model and the all-atom Chignolin protein compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: Flow Perturbation++ effectively balances unbiasedness and reduced variance, enhancing scalability for high-dimensional systems.

Abstract: The scalability of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) for unbiased Boltzmann sampling remains limited in high-dimensional systems due to the cost of Jacobian-determinant evaluation, which requires $D$ backpropagation passes through the flow layers. Existing stochastic Jacobian estimators such as the Hutchinson trace estimator reduce computation but introduce bias, while the recently proposed Flow Perturbation method is unbiased yet suffers from high variance. We present \textbf{Flow Perturbation++}, a variance-reduced extension of Flow Perturbation that discretizes the probability-flow ODE and performs unbiased stepwise Jacobian estimation at each integration step. This multi-step construction retains the unbiasedness of Flow Perturbation while achieves substantially lower estimator variance. Integrated into a Sequential Monte Carlo framework, Flow Perturbation++ achieves significantly improved equilibrium sampling on a 1000D Gaussian Mixture Model and the all-atom Chignolin protein compared with Hutchinson-based and single-step Flow Perturbation baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR), a post-hoc refinement framework for generative models, achieving improved sample quality without altering the original sampling process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models like diffusion and flow-based models often suffer from systematic biases, especially in high dimensions. The paper aims to address this by refining samples without noise injection or multi-step resampling.

Method: Proposes BFR with two strategies: latent space alignment for invertible generators and data space refinement using lightweight augmentations. BFR preserves the original ODE trajectory and applies deterministic corrections.

Result: Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ show improved fidelity and coverage. Latent space refinement achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.46 on MNIST with only one additional function evaluation.

Conclusion: BFR effectively corrects biases in generative models without disrupting sampling dynamics, offering a practical solution for enhancing sample quality.

Abstract: Generative models, including diffusion and flow-based models, often exhibit systematic biases that degrade sample quality, particularly in high-dimensional settings. We revisit refinement methods and show that effective bias correction can be achieved as a post-hoc procedure, without noise injection or multi-step resampling of the sampling process. We propose a flow-matching-based \textbf{Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR)} framework with two refinement strategies operating at different stages: latent space alignment for approximately invertible generators and data space refinement trained with lightweight augmentations. Unlike previous refiners that perturb sampling dynamics, BFR preserves the original ODE trajectory and applies deterministic corrections to generated samples. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ at 256x256 resolution demonstrate consistent improvements in fidelity and coverage; notably, starting from base samples with FID 3.95, latent space refinement achieves a \textbf{state-of-the-art} FID of \textbf{1.46} on MNIST using only a single additional function evaluation (1-NFE), while maintaining sample diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Signal variability across subjects and costly user-specific annotation limit SSVEP recognition performance.

Method: Proposes FBEA for frequency information, CSST framework with PTAL and DEST stages, and TFA-CL module.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Benchmark and BETA datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses cross-subject variability and enhances SSVEP decoding.

Abstract: Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are widely used due to their high signal-to-noise ratio and user-friendliness. Accurate decoding of SSVEP signals is crucial for interpreting user intentions in BCI applications. However, signal variability across subjects and the costly user-specific annotation limit recognition performance. Therefore, we propose a novel cross-subject domain adaptation method built upon the self-training paradigm. Specifically, a Filter-Bank Euclidean Alignment (FBEA) strategy is designed to exploit frequency information from SSVEP filter banks. Then, we propose a Cross-Subject Self-Training (CSST) framework consisting of two stages: Pre-Training with Adversarial Learning (PTAL), which aligns the source and target distributions, and Dual-Ensemble Self-Training (DEST), which refines pseudo-label quality. Moreover, we introduce a Time-Frequency Augmented Contrastive Learning (TFA-CL) module to enhance feature discriminability across multiple augmented views. Extensive experiments on the Benchmark and BETA datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying signal lengths, highlighting its superiority.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored problem of feature distribution and diffusion behavior in geometric and topological deep learning architectures.

Method: Develop a cellular sheaf theoretic framework to track local feature alignments and agreements, with a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis.

Result: Provides insights into feature diffusion and aggregation in GDL and TDL architectures, applicable to tasks like node classification and community detection.

Conclusion: The framework offers a topological perspective on feature behavior, aiding future studies and applications in geometric and topological deep learning.

Abstract: Combinatorial and topological structures, such as graphs, simplicial complexes, and cell complexes, form the foundation of geometric and topological deep learning (GDL and TDL) architectures. These models aggregate signals over such domains, integrate local features, and generate representations for diverse real-world applications. However, the distribution and diffusion behavior of GDL and TDL features during training remains an open and underexplored problem. Motivated by this gap, we introduce a cellular sheaf theoretic framework for modeling and analyzing the local consistency and harmonicity of node features and edge weights in graph-based architectures. By tracking local feature alignments and agreements through sheaf structures, the framework offers a topological perspective on feature diffusion and aggregation. Furthermore, a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis (TDA) is proposed to capture hierarchical feature interactions in graph models. This approach enables a joint characterization of GDL and TDL architectures based on their underlying geometric and topological structures and the learned signals defined on them, providing insights for future studies on conventional tasks such as node classification, substructure detection, and community detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how model architectures and temporal context affect EEG decoding accuracy, benchmarking five models and revealing a trade-off between efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interaction between model architecture and temporal context in EEG decoding and identify practical trade-offs for real-world applications.

Method: Benchmarked five architectures (CNN, LSTM, EEGXF, S4, S5) on a 4-class task using the HBN movie-watching dataset, varying segment lengths (8s to 128s). Evaluated robustness via cross-frequency shifts, cross-task OOD inputs, and leave-one-subject-out generalization.

Result: Longer context improved accuracy; S5 achieved 98.7%+/-0.6 at 64s with 20x fewer parameters than CNN (98.3%+/-0.3). S5 excelled in cross-subject accuracy but had over-confident errors on OOD tasks; EEGXF was more robust but less calibrated in-distribution.

Conclusion: There's a trade-off: S5 for efficient peak accuracy; EEGXF when robustness and conservative uncertainty are critical.

Abstract: We study how model architecture and temporal context interact in naturalistic EEG decoding. Using the HBN movie-watching dataset, we benchmark five architectures, CNN, LSTM, a stabilized Transformer (EEGXF), S4, and S5, on a 4-class task across segment lengths from 8s to 128s. Accuracy improves with longer context: at 64s, S5 reaches 98.7%+/-0.6 and CNN 98.3%+/-0.3, while S5 uses ~20x fewer parameters than CNN. To probe real-world robustness, we evaluate zero-shot cross-frequency shifts, cross-task OOD inputs, and leave-one-subject-out generalization. S5 achieves stronger cross-subject accuracy but makes over-confident errors on OOD tasks; EEGXF is more conservative and stable under frequency shifts, though less calibrated in-distribution. These results reveal a practical efficiency-robustness trade-off: S5 for parameter-efficient peak accuracy; EEGXF when robustness and conservative uncertainty are critical.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces short-range attractive couplings between neural network weights during training to enable efficient quantization, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a novel and flexible approach for model quantization by inducing discretization of weights during training.

Method: Introduces short-range attractive couplings between weights, relying on two hyperparameters.

Result: Outperforms histogram-equalized post-training quantization on ResNet-20/CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: Soft quantization offers a new tool for model compression and exploration of compression-generalization trade-offs.

Abstract: We show that introducing short-range attractive couplings between the weights of a neural network during training provides a novel avenue for model quantization. These couplings rapidly induce the discretization of a model's weight distribution, and they do so in a mixed-precision manner despite only relying on two additional hyperparameters. We demonstrate that, within an appropriate range of hyperparameters, our "soft quantization'' scheme outperforms histogram-equalized post-training quantization on ResNet-20/CIFAR-10. Soft quantization provides both a new pipeline for the flexible compression of machine learning models and a new tool for investigating the trade-off between compression and generalization in high-dimensional loss landscapes.

*Kaiyuan Tan,Kendra Givens,Peilun Li,Thomas Beckers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHDME introduces a port-Hamiltonian diffusion framework for sparse observations and incomplete physics, combining physics-informed learning with diffusion models for reliable forecasting in data-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with sparse data, and existing physics-informed methods often require full governing equations, which are rarely fully known. PHDME addresses this gap.

Method: PHDME trains a Gaussian process Port-Hamiltonian system (GP-dPHS) on limited data, uses it to generate artificial datasets, and combines it with a diffusion model and physics residual loss for structured training.

Result: PHDME achieves improved accuracy and physical consistency in sparse data settings on PDE benchmarks and a real-world spring system, with uncertainty statements provided.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates physics priors into diffusion models for reliable forecasting under data scarcity and incomplete physics knowledge.

Abstract: Diffusion models provide expressive priors for forecasting trajectories of dynamical systems, but are typically unreliable in the sparse data regime. Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) improves reliability in such settings; however, most methods require \emph{explicit governing equations} during training, which are often only partially known due to complex and nonlinear dynamics. We introduce \textbf{PHDME}, a port-Hamiltonian diffusion framework designed for \emph{sparse observations} and \emph{incomplete physics}. PHDME leverages port-Hamiltonian structural prior but does not require full knowledge of the closed-form governing equations. Our approach first trains a Gaussian process distributed Port-Hamiltonian system (GP-dPHS) on limited observations to capture an energy-based representation of the dynamics. The GP-dPHS is then used to generate a physically consistent artificial dataset for diffusion training, and to inform the diffusion model with a structured physics residual loss. After training, the diffusion model acts as an amortized sampler and forecaster for fast trajectory generation. Finally, we apply split conformal calibration to provide uncertainty statements for the generated predictions. Experiments on PDE benchmarks and a real-world spring system show improved accuracy and physical consistency under data scarcity.

*Luwei Sun,Dongrui Shen,Jianfe Li,Yulong Zhao,Han Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a theoretical framework for approximating ratio-type functionals (f1/f2) using deep neural networks with SignReLU activation, focusing on diffusion-based generative models. It provides approximation bounds and convergence rates, with applications to DDPMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from challenges in conditional generative modeling, particularly when the target conditional density is a ratio of kernel-based marginal densities (f1/f2).

Method: The method involves approximating ratio-type functionals using deep neural networks with SignReLU activation, leveraging its piecewise structure. Theoretical analysis includes L^p(Omega) bounds and convergence rates.

Result: Key results include L^p(Omega) approximation bounds, excess KL risk bounds for DDPMs, and decomposition of excess risk into approximation and estimation errors.

Conclusion: The study provides generalization guarantees for training diffusion-based generative models, emphasizing the effectiveness of SignReLU-based neural estimators.

Abstract: Motivated by challenges in conditional generative modeling, where the target conditional density takes the form of a ratio f1 over f2, this paper develops a theoretical framework for approximating such ratio-type functionals. Here, f1 and f2 are kernel-based marginal densities that capture structured interactions, a setting central to diffusion-based generative models. We provide a concise proof for approximating these ratio-type functionals using deep neural networks with the SignReLU activation function, leveraging the activation's piecewise structure. Under standard regularity assumptions, we establish L^p(Omega) approximation bounds and convergence rates. Specializing to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), we construct a SignReLU-based neural estimator for the reverse process and derive bounds on the excess Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk between the generated and true data distributions. Our analysis decomposes this excess risk into approximation and estimation error components. These results provide generalization guarantees for finite-sample training of diffusion-based generative models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LENS improves RLVR by identifying and removing interference tokens in prompts, enhancing exploration efficiency and training stability, outperforming GRPO with higher performance and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploration failures in RLVR often stem from interference tokens in prompts rather than task difficulty, limiting sampling success and training stability.

Method: LENS purifies prompts by removing interference tokens and transfers successful rollouts to optimize policy on noisy prompts, teaching the model to ignore interference.

Result: LENS outperforms GRPO with a 3.88% average performance gain and over 1.6× speedup, demonstrating improved rollout efficiency.

Conclusion: Pruning interference tokens is crucial for enhancing RLVR efficiency, offering a novel approach to improving exploration and training stability.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced LLM reasoning, but remains constrained by inefficient exploration under limited rollout budgets, leading to low sampling success and unstable training in complex tasks. We find that many exploration failures arise not from problem difficulty, but from a small number of prompt tokens that introduce interference. Building on this insight, we propose the Less Noise Sampling Framework (LENS), which first prompts by identifying and removing interference tokens. then transfers successful rollouts from the purification process to supervise policy optimization on the original noisy prompts, enabling the model to learn to ignore interference in the real-world, noisy prompting settings. Experimental results show that LENS significantly outperforms GRPO, delivering higher performance and faster convergence, with a 3.88% average gain and over 1.6$\times$ speedup. Our work highlights the critical role of pruning interference tokens in improving rollout efficiency, offering a new perspective for RLVR research.

*Namkyung Yoon,Sanghong Kim,Hwangnam Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI-driven peak-aware conditional generative model to enhance GC-MS measurement reliability by addressing interference-induced issues like nonspecific peaks and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GC-MS reliability suffers from interfering substances, causing measurement errors like false alarms and sensitivity drops. The goal is to improve accuracy under such conditions.

Method: A peak-aware conditional generative model highlights key spectral peaks and encodes chemical/solvent data into latent vectors. A CGAN generates synthetic GC-MS signals mimicking experimental conditions.

Result: The framework achieves cosine similarity and Pearson correlation above 0.9, preserves peak diversity, and reduces false alarms in AI discrimination models.

Conclusion: The proposed AI framework effectively improves GC-MS reliability under interference by generating accurate synthetic data and enhancing discrimination performance.

Abstract: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is a widely used analytical method for chemical substance detection, but measurement reliability tends to deteriorate in the presence of interfering substances. In particular, interfering substances cause nonspecific peaks, residence time shifts, and increased background noise, resulting in reduced sensitivity and false alarms. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence discrimination framework based on a peak-aware conditional generative model to improve the reliability of GC-MS measurements under interference conditions. The framework is learned with a novel peak-aware mechanism that highlights the characteristic peaks of GC-MS data, allowing it to generate important spectral features more faithfully. In addition, chemical and solvent information is encoded in a latent vector embedded with it, allowing a conditional generative adversarial neural network (CGAN) to generate a synthetic GC-MS signal consistent with the experimental conditions. This generates an experimental dataset that assumes indirect substance situations in chemical substance data, where acquisition is limited without conducting real experiments. These data are used for the learning of AI-based GC-MS discrimination models to help in accurate chemical substance discrimination. We conduct various quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated simulated data to verify the validity of the proposed framework. We also verify how the generative model improves the performance of the AI discrimination framework. Representatively, the proposed method is shown to consistently achieve cosine similarity and Pearson correlation coefficient values above 0.9 while preserving peak number diversity and reducing false alarms in the discrimination model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional GAM by generalizing graph attention mechanisms for better performance.

Method: EGAM uses multi-head dot-product attention for node and edge embeddings, trained with policy gradient algorithms.

Result: EGAM matches or outperforms existing methods, excelling in highly constrained routing problems.

Conclusion: EGAM improves handling of complex graph structures, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) solvers, implemented with graph neural networks (GNNs), have introduced new approaches for solving routing problems. Trained with reinforcement learning (RL), the state-of-the-art graph attention model (GAM) achieves near-optimal solutions without requiring expert knowledge or labeled data. In this work, we generalize the existing graph attention mechanism and propose the extended graph attention model (EGAM). Our model utilizes multi-head dot-product attention to update both node and edge embeddings, addressing the limitations of the conventional GAM, which considers only node features. We employ an autoregressive encoder-decoder architecture and train it with policy gradient algorithms that incorporate a specially designed baseline. Experiments show that EGAM matches or outperforms existing methods across various routing problems. Notably, the proposed model demonstrates exceptional performance on highly constrained problems, highlighting its efficiency in handling complex graph structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DUET is a distillation-based LLM unlearning method that improves efficiency and performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM unlearning methods are either computationally heavy or vulnerable to attacks. DUET aims to address these limitations.

Method: DUET uses a distillation approach, where a student model imitates a prompt-steered teacher to reject unwanted knowledge while retaining general domain knowledge.

Result: DUET outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forgetting and utility preservation, with higher data efficiency.

Conclusion: DUET offers a lightweight, effective solution for LLM unlearning, combining strengths of existing approaches.

Abstract: LLM unlearning is a technique to remove the impacts of undesirable knowledge from the model without retraining from scratch, which is indispensable towards trustworthy AI. Existing unlearning methods face significant limitations: conventional tuning-based unlearning is computationally heavy and prone to catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, in-contextualized unlearning is lightweight for precise unlearning but vulnerable to prompt removal or reverse engineering attacks. In response, we propose Distilled Unlearning from an Efficient Teacher (DUET), a novel distillation-based unlearning method that combines the merits of these two lines of work. It learns a student model to imitate the behavior of a prompt-steered teacher that effectively refuses undesirable knowledge generation while preserving general domain knowledge. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks with our enriched evaluation protocols demonstrate that DUET achieves higher performance in both forgetting and utility preservation, while being orders of magnitude more data-efficient than state-of-the-art unlearning methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Physics-Informed Learning via Diffusion (PILD), a framework combining diffusion models with physical constraints for improved accuracy and generalization in scientific and engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models lack integration of physical laws, limiting their practical use in engineering and scientific problems where such constraints are critical.

Method: PILD introduces a virtual residual observation from a Laplace distribution to supervise generation and uses a conditional embedding module to inject physical laws into the denoising network.

Result: PILD outperforms existing baselines in tasks like vehicle trajectory estimation, tire forces, Darcy flow, and plasma dynamics, demonstrating better accuracy, stability, and generalization.

Conclusion: PILD effectively bridges diffusion models and physical constraints, offering a modular and broadly applicable solution for scientific and engineering problems.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools for modeling complex data distributions, yet their purely data-driven nature limits applicability in practical engineering and scientific problems where physical laws need to be followed. This paper proposes Physics-Informed Learning via Diffusion (PILD), a framework that unifies diffusion modeling and first-principles physical constraints by introducing a virtual residual observation sampled from a Laplace distribution to supervise generation during training. To further integrate physical laws, a conditional embedding module is incorporated to inject physical information into the denoising network at multiple layers, ensuring consistent guidance throughout the diffusion process. The proposed PILD framework is concise, modular, and broadly applicable to problems governed by ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, as well as algebraic equations or inequality constraints. Extensive experiments across engineering and scientific tasks including estimating vehicle trajectories, tire forces, Darcy flow and plasma dynamics, demonstrate that our PILD substantially improves accuracy, stability, and generalization over existing physics-informed and diffusion-based baselines.

TL;DR: Zenith is a scalable ranking architecture for recommender systems that efficiently handles high-dimensional feature interactions with minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating superior performance in real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to accurately capture feature interactions in recommender systems without excessive inference latency, as prior work lacked focus on efficient scaling.

Method: Introduces Zenith with Token Fusion and Token Boost modules to handle high-dimensional Prime Tokens, improving token heterogeneity and scaling laws.

Result: Achieves +1.05%/-1.10% in CTR AUC and Logloss, +9.93% in Quality Watch Session/User, and +8.11% in Quality Watch Duration/User on TikTok Live.

Conclusion: Zenith effectively balances model capacity and efficiency, delivering significant performance improvements in real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurately capturing feature interactions is essential in recommender systems, and recent trends show that scaling up model capacity could be a key driver for next-level predictive performance. While prior work has explored various model architectures to capture multi-granularity feature interactions, relatively little attention has been paid to efficient feature handling and scaling model capacity without incurring excessive inference latency. In this paper, we address this by presenting Zenith, a scalable and efficient ranking architecture that learns complex feature interactions with minimal runtime overhead. Zenith is designed to handle a few high-dimensional Prime Tokens with Token Fusion and Token Boost modules, which exhibits superior scaling laws compared to other state-of-the-art ranking methods, thanks to its improved token heterogeneity. Its real-world effectiveness is demonstrated by deploying the architecture to TikTok Live, a leading online livestreaming platform that attracts billions of users globally. Our A/B test shows that Zenith achieves +1.05%/-1.10% in online CTR AUC and Logloss, and realizes +9.93% gains in Quality Watch Session / User and +8.11% in Quality Watch Duration / User.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeSliver, a new explainability-driven deep learning framework, uses raw time-series data and symbolic abstraction to assign importance scores to temporal segments, outperforming other methods by 11% and achieving competitive predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explainable methods for time-series models suffer from sensitivity and fail to account for sequential dependencies, while attention-based approaches lack faithfulness.

Method: Combines raw time-series data with symbolic abstraction to create a representation that linearly encodes temporal segment contributions.

Result: Outperforms other temporal attribution methods by 11% on 7 datasets and stays within 2% of state-of-the-art baselines on 26 datasets.

Conclusion: TimeSliver provides a strong, explainable framework for time-series classification.

Abstract: Identifying the extent to which every temporal segment influences a model's predictions is essential for explaining model decisions and increasing transparency. While post-hoc explainable methods based on gradients and feature-based attributions have been popular, they suffer from reference state sensitivity and struggle to generalize across time-series datasets, as they treat time points independently and ignore sequential dependencies. Another perspective on explainable time-series classification is through interpretable components of the model, for instance, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to estimate temporal attribution; however, recent findings indicate that these attention weights often fail to provide faithful measures of temporal importance. In this work, we advance this perspective and present a novel explainability-driven deep learning framework, TimeSliver, which jointly utilizes raw time-series data and its symbolic abstraction to construct a representation that maintains the original temporal structure. Each element in this representation linearly encodes the contribution of each temporal segment to the final prediction, allowing us to assign a meaningful importance score to every time point. For time-series classification, TimeSliver outperforms other temporal attribution methods by 11% on 7 distinct synthetic and real-world multivariate time-series datasets. TimeSliver also achieves predictive performance within 2% of state-of-the-art baselines across 26 UEA benchmark datasets, positioning it as a strong and explainable framework for general time-series classification.

TL;DR: PG-TMT is a compact tri-branch encoder for online condition monitoring in rotating machinery, combining physics-guided modeling with extreme-value theory for reliable early warnings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like nonstationary conditions, domain shifts, class imbalance, and false-alarm rates in reliability-centered prognostics.

Method: Proposes PG-TMT with a convolutional stem, Tiny-Mamba branch, and Transformer branch, plus physics-aligned attention spectra and EVT-calibrated decision rules.

Result: Achieves higher precision-recall AUC, competitive ROC AUC, shorter detection times, and strong cross-domain transfer.

Conclusion: PG-TMT offers calibrated, interpretable, and deployment-ready early warnings for prognostics and health management.

Abstract: Reliability-centered prognostics for rotating machinery requires early warning signals that remain accurate under nonstationary operating conditions, domain shifts across speed/load/sensors, and severe class imbalance, while keeping the false-alarm rate small and predictable. We propose the Physics-Guided Tiny-Mamba Transformer (PG-TMT), a compact tri-branch encoder tailored for online condition monitoring. A depthwise-separable convolutional stem captures micro-transients, a Tiny-Mamba state-space branch models near-linear long-range dynamics, and a lightweight local Transformer encodes cross-channel resonances. We derive an analytic temporal-to-spectral mapping that ties the model's attention spectrum to classical bearing fault-order bands, yielding a band-alignment score that quantifies physical plausibility and provides physics-grounded explanations. To ensure decision reliability, healthy-score exceedances are modeled with extreme-value theory (EVT), which yields an on-threshold achieving a target false-alarm intensity (events/hour); a dual-threshold hysteresis with a minimum hold time further suppresses chatter. Under a leakage-free streaming protocol with right-censoring of missed detections on CWRU, Paderborn, XJTU-SY, and an industrial pilot, PG-TMT attains higher precision-recall AUC (primary under imbalance), competitive or better ROC AUC, and shorter mean time-to-detect at matched false-alarm intensity, together with strong cross-domain transfer. By coupling physics-aligned representations with EVT-calibrated decision rules, PG-TMT delivers calibrated, interpretable, and deployment-ready early warnings for reliability-centric prognostics and health management.

TL;DR: PLS-SVD learns shared structure from paired data but struggles with missing entries. The study analyzes its behavior under random masking, revealing a phase transition where performance depends on signal strength and missingness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how Partial Least Squares (PLS-SVD) performs with missing data in multimodal datasets, a common real-world challenge.

Method: The method involves analyzing PLS-SVD under independent entry-wise missing-completely-at-random masking in a high-dimensional spiked model, focusing on normalized masked cross-covariance.

Result: Results show a phase transition: below a threshold, PLS-SVD fails; above it, singular vectors align with latent directions, with overlap formulas provided. Simulations confirm these findings.

Conclusion: PLS-SVD's effectiveness depends on signal strength and missingness, with a critical threshold determining its performance.

Abstract: Partial Least Squares (PLS) learns shared structure from paired data via the top singular vectors of the empirical cross-covariance (PLS-SVD), but multimodal datasets often have missing entries in both views. We study PLS-SVD under independent entry-wise missing-completely-at-random masking in a proportional high-dimensional spiked model. After appropriate normalization, the masked cross-covariance behaves like a spiked rectangular random matrix whose effective signal strength is attenuated by $\sqrtρ$, where $ρ$ is the joint entry retention probability. As a result, PLS-SVD exhibits a sharp BBP-type phase transition: below a critical signal-to-noise threshold the leading singular vectors are asymptotically uninformative, while above it they achieve nontrivial alignment with the latent shared directions, with closed-form asymptotic overlap formulas. Simulations and semi-synthetic multimodal experiments corroborate the predicted phase diagram and recovery curves across aspect ratios, signal strengths, and missingness levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underexplored fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data in dataset distillation, moving beyond heuristic methods.

Method: InfoUtil combines game-theoretic informativeness maximization (using Shapley Value) and principled utility maximization (via Gradient Norm) to synthesize distilled datasets.

Result: The method outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches by 6.1% on the ImageNet-1K dataset using ResNet-18.

Conclusion: The study concludes that balancing informativeness and utility mathematically leads to superior dataset distillation, as demonstrated by InfoUtil.

Abstract: Dataset Distillation (DD) seeks to create a compact dataset from a large, real-world dataset. While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored. This paper revisits knowledge distillation-based dataset distillation within a solid theoretical framework. We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset. InfoUtil incorporates two key components: (1) game-theoretic informativeness maximization using Shapley Value attribution to extract key information from samples, and (2) principled utility maximization by selecting globally influential samples based on Gradient Norm. These components ensure that the distilled dataset is both informative and utility-optimized. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 6.1\% performance improvement over the previous state-of-the-art approach on ImageNet-1K dataset using ResNet-18.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing approaches for Q-learning convergence rates, which either rely on strong assumptions or suboptimal approximations.

Method: A simple variant of Q-learning sampling from lazified dynamics, leveraging an instance-dependent seminorm to show one-step contraction of the Bellman operator.

Result: Optimal sample complexity guarantees of O~(ε^-2) are established under a reachability assumption.

Conclusion: The lazy transformation enables efficient convergence for Q-learning in average-reward settings, addressing fundamental challenges.

Abstract: We present the convergence rates of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning for average-reward Markov decision processes, where the absence of contraction poses a fundamental challenge. Existing non-asymptotic results overcome this challenge by either imposing strong assumptions to enforce seminorm contraction or relying on discounted or episodic Markov decision processes as successive approximations, which either require unknown parameters or result in suboptimal sample complexity. In this work, under a reachability assumption, we establish optimal $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity guarantees (up to logarithmic factors) for a simple variant of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning that samples from the lazified dynamics, where the system remains in the current state with some fixed probability. At the core of our analysis is the construction of an instance-dependent seminorm and showing that, after a lazy transformation of the Markov decision process, the Bellman operator becomes one-step contractive under this seminorm.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reevaluate the role of search in model-based RL and identify what truly enables effective search.

Method: Investigates search's impact, contrasting it with learned policies, and identifies techniques to mitigate distribution shift.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance by prioritizing distribution shift mitigation over model accuracy.

Conclusion: Distribution shift mitigation is key for effective search in model-based RL, outperforming traditional focus on model accuracy.

Abstract: This paper investigates search in model-based reinforcement learning (RL). Conventional wisdom holds that long-term predictions and compounding errors are the primary obstacles for model-based RL. We challenge this view, showing that search is not a plug-and-play replacement for a learned policy. Surprisingly, we find that search can harm performance even when the model is highly accurate. Instead, we show that mitigating distribution shift matters more than improving model or value function accuracy. Building on this insight, we identify key techniques for enabling effective search, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple popular benchmark domains.

Result: TGCC achieves up to 13.41% improvement in cross-task/cross-domain scenarios and state-of-the-art performance in 5 out of 6 single-task datasets.

Conclusion: TGCC effectively compresses graphs while retaining causal information, enhancing transferability and performance in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: The increasing scale of graph datasets has significantly improved the performance of graph representation learning methods, but it has also introduced substantial training challenges. Graph dataset condensation techniques have emerged to compress large datasets into smaller yet information-rich datasets, while maintaining similar test performance. However, these methods strictly require downstream applications to match the original dataset and task, which often fails in cross-task and cross-domain scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel causal-invariance-based and transferable graph dataset condensation method, named \textbf{TGCC}, providing effective and transferable condensed datasets. Specifically, to preserve domain-invariant knowledge, we first extract domain causal-invariant features from the spatial domain of the graph using causal interventions. Then, to fully capture the structural and feature information of the original graph, we perform enhanced condensation operations. Finally, through spectral-domain enhanced contrastive learning, we inject the causal-invariant features into the condensed graph, ensuring that the compressed graph retains the causal information of the original graph. Experimental results on five public datasets and our novel \textbf{FinReport} dataset demonstrate that TGCC achieves up to a 13.41\% improvement in cross-task and cross-domain complex scenarios compared to existing methods, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 out of 6 datasets in the single dataset and task scenario.

TL;DR: GAT-PEARL, a meta-reinforcement learning framework, improves Autonomous Electric Taxi fleet management by adapting dynamically to uncertain charging availability using graph attention networks and probabilistic embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of EVs and charging infrastructure necessitates better AET fleet management under dynamic and uncertain conditions, addressing the gap from assuming static charging networks.

Method: Proposes GAT-PEARL: integrates a graph attention network for spatial representation and uses probabilistic embeddings in actor-critic reinforcement learning for quick adaptation to charging layout changes without retraining.

Result: Outperforms conventional reinforcement learning methods, showing better generalization to unseen infrastructure layouts and higher operational efficiency in simulations with real-world Chengdu data.

Conclusion: GAT-PEARL effectively bridges the gap between theoretical models and real-world AET fleet operations, offering superior performance in dynamic charging environments.

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure, the effective management of Autonomous Electric Taxi (AET) fleets faces a critical challenge in environments with dynamic and uncertain charging availability. While most existing research assumes a static charging network, this simplification creates a significant gap between theoretical models and real-world operations. To bridge this gap, we propose GAT-PEARL, a novel meta-reinforcement learning framework that learns an adaptive operational policy. Our approach integrates a graph attention network (GAT) to effectively extract robust spatial representations under infrastructure layouts and model the complex spatiotemporal relationships of the urban environment, and employs probabilistic embeddings for actor-critic reinforcement learning (PEARL) to enable rapid, inference-based adaptation to changes in charging network layouts without retraining. Through extensive simulations on real-world data in Chengdu, China, we demonstrate that GAT-PEARL significantly outperforms conventional reinforcement learning baselines, showing superior generalization to unseen infrastructure layouts and achieving higher overall operational efficiency in dynamic settings.

*Seonghwi Kim,Sung Ho Jo,Wooseok Ha,Minwoo Chae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel distributionally robust learning framework for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses challenges like limited target data and spurious correlations in source domains, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA methods struggle with limited target domain data and spurious correlations in source domains, prompting the need for a robust framework.

Method: Proposes a distributionally robust learning framework modeling uncertainty in covariate and conditional label distributions, adaptable to single-source and multi-source UDA.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent outperformance over baselines, particularly in scenarios with extremely scarce target data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is versatile, efficient, and effective for UDA, especially in challenging data-scarce settings.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is a statistical learning problem when the distribution of training (source) data is different from that of test (target) data. In this setting, one has access to labeled data only from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain. The central objective is to leverage the source data and the unlabeled target data to build models that generalize to the target domain. Despite its potential, existing UDA approaches often struggle in practice, particularly in scenarios where the target domain offers only limited unlabeled data or spurious correlations dominate the source domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel distributionally robust learning framework that models uncertainty in both the covariate distribution and the conditional label distribution. Our approach is motivated by the multi-source domain adaptation setting but is also directly applicable to the single-source scenario, making it versatile in practice. We develop an efficient learning algorithm that can be seamlessly integrated with existing UDA methods. Extensive experiments under various distribution shift scenarios show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines, especially when target data are extremely scarce.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Unified Air-Ground Mobility Coordination (UAGMC) framework using deep RL and V2X to optimize air-ground travel, reducing average travel time by 34%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on integrated routing strategies for air-ground mobility systems, aiming to enhance urban mobility efficiency.

Method: Develops a unified optimization model integrating air and ground transport strategies, leveraging deep RL and V2X for dynamic route planning.

Result: UAGMC achieves a 34% reduction in average travel time compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The framework advances intelligent urban mobility by coordinating air and ground transport, offering insights for multimodal system optimization.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has emerged as a transformative solution to alleviate urban congestion by utilizing low-altitude airspace, thereby reducing pressure on ground transportation networks. To enable truly efficient and seamless door-to-door travel experiences, UAM requires close integration with existing ground transportation infrastructure. However, current research on optimal integrated routing strategies for passengers in air-ground mobility systems remains limited, with a lack of systematic exploration.To address this gap, we first propose a unified optimization model that integrates strategy selection for both air and ground transportation. This model captures the dynamic characteristics of multimodal transport networks and incorporates real-time traffic conditions alongside passenger decision-making behavior. Building on this model, we propose a Unified Air-Ground Mobility Coordination (UAGMC) framework, which leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to optimize vertiport selection and dynamically plan air taxi routes. Experimental results demonstrate that UAGMC achieves a 34\% reduction in average travel time compared to conventional proportional allocation methods, enhancing overall travel efficiency and providing novel insights into the integration and optimization of multimodal transportation systems. This work lays a solid foundation for advancing intelligent urban mobility solutions through the coordination of air and ground transportation modes.

*Filippo Portera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new convex loss for SVMs is proposed for binary classification and regression, showing potential for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance SVM generalization by incorporating pattern correlations into the loss function.

Method: Mathematical derivation of dual problems and experiments on small datasets due to SVM scalability issues.

Result: Generalization measures are never worse and often better than standard losses.

Conclusion: Further study of this loss with neural networks is recommended.

Abstract: We propose a new convex loss for SVMs, both for the binary classification and for the regression models. Therefore, we show the mathematical derivation of the dual problems and we experiment them with several small data-sets. The minimal dimension of those data-sets is due to the difficult scalability of the SVM method to bigger instances. This preliminary study should prove that using pattern correlations inside the loss function could enhance the generalisation performances. Coherently, results show that generalisation measures are never worse than the standard losses and several times they are better. In our opinion, it should be considered a careful study of this loss, coupled with shallow and deep neural networks. In fact, we present some novel results obtained with those architectures.

*Thuy Phuong Vu,Mai Viet Hoang Do,Minhhuy Le,Dinh-Cuong Hoang,Phan Xuan Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a timestep sampling strategy for diffusion models to control memorization by adjusting learning emphasis along the denoising trajectory, improving alignment with training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat diffusion models as isolated predictors, lacking control over memorization. The paper explores memorization from a denoising perspective.

Method: A timestep sampling strategy is introduced to adjust learning emphasis across denoising steps, controlling memorization via confidence interval width.

Result: Experiments show reduced memorization and better alignment with training data when learning is shifted to later denoising steps.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances memorization and generalization, validated across image and 1D signal generation tasks.

Abstract: Controlling memorization in diffusion models is critical for applications that require generated data to closely match the training distribution. Existing approaches mainly focus on data centric or model centric modifications, treating the diffusion model as an isolated predictor. In this paper, we study memorization in diffusion models from a denoising centric perspective. We show that uniform timestep sampling leads to unequal learning contributions across denoising steps due to differences in signal to noise ratio, which biases training toward memorization. To address this, we propose a timestep sampling strategy that explicitly controls where learning occurs along the denoising trajectory. By adjusting the width of the confidence interval, our method provides direct control over the memorization generalization trade off. Experiments on image and 1D signal generation tasks demonstrate that shifting learning emphasis toward later denoising steps consistently reduces memorization and improves distributional alignment with training data, validating the generality and effectiveness of our approach.

*Minghao Yang,Ren Togo,Guang Li,Takahiro Ogawa,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes L2R, a unified routing framework for Mixture-of-Experts models, improving routing discriminability and expert specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE systems use linear routers in high-dimensional spaces, leading to issues like representation mismatch and unstable expert specialization.

Method: L2R introduces a low-rank latent routing space and Saturated Inner-Product Scoring (SIPS) to control routing smoothness and stability, along with a multi-anchor routing mechanism.

Result: Experiments on language and vision MoE models show L2R enhances routing stability, expert specialization, and overall performance.

Conclusion: L2R addresses key challenges in MoE routing, offering a robust solution for improving model performance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale neural networks by conditionally activating a small subset of experts, where the router plays a central role in determining expert specialization and overall model performance. However, many modern MoE systems still adopt linear routers in raw high-dimensional representation spaces, where representation mismatch, angular concentration, and scale-sensitive scoring can jointly undermine routing discriminability and stable expert specialization. In this work, we propose Low-rank \& Lipschitz-controlled Routing (L2R), a unified routing framework that reshapes both the routing space and scoring geometry. L2R performs expert assignment in a shared low-rank latent routing space and introduces Saturated Inner-Product Scoring (SIPS) to explicitly control the Lipschitz behavior of routing functions, yielding smoother and more stable routing geometry. In addition, L2R incorporates a parameter-efficient multi-anchor routing mechanism to enhance expert expressiveness. Extensive experiments on a large-scale language MoE model and a vision MoE setting on ImageNet demonstrate that L2R consistently improves routing stability, expert specialization, and overall model performance.

### [226] [Factored Causal Representation Learning for Robust Reward Modeling in RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21350)
*Yupei Yang,Lin Yang,Wanxi Deng,Lin Qu,Fan Feng,Biwei Huang,Shikui Tu,Lei Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a causal framework for reward models to prevent reward hacking by separating causal and non-causal factors, improving robustness in RLHF tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard reward models often rely on spurious features unrelated to human preferences, leading to reward hacking. This work aims to address this issue by focusing on causal factors.

Method: A factored representation learning framework decomposes embeddings into causal and non-causal factors, constraining the reward head to use only causal factors. An adversarial head discourages non-causal factors from encoding reward-relevant info.

Result: Experiments show the method learns more robust reward models and enhances RLHF performance, reducing issues like length and sycophantic bias.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates reward hacking by isolating causal factors, improving alignment with human preferences.

Abstract: A reliable reward model is essential for aligning large language models with human preferences through reinforcement learning from human feedback. However, standard reward models are susceptible to spurious features that are not causally related to human labels. This can lead to reward hacking, where high predicted reward does not translate into better behavior. In this work, we address this problem from a causal perspective by proposing a factored representation learning framework that decomposes the model's contextual embedding into (1) causal factors that are sufficient for reward prediction and (2) non-causal factors that capture reward-irrelevant attributes such as length or sycophantic bias. The reward head is then constrained to depend only on the causal component. In addition, we introduce an adversarial head trained to predict reward from the non-causal factors, while applying gradient reversal to discourage them from encoding reward-relevant information. Experiments on both mathematical and dialogue tasks demonstrate that our method learns more robust reward models and consistently improves downstream RLHF performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Analyses on length and sycophantic bias further validate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating reward hacking behaviors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AFD architecture decouples Attention and FFN computations in LLM decoding, optimizing resource scaling. Performance hinges on the Attention/FFN ratio; mis-sizing causes inefficiencies. A probabilistic model derives optimal ratios, validated by simulations to reduce idle time effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in the AFD architecture caused by improper scaling of Attention and FFN resources, which leads to blocking and idle time.

Method: Develops an analytical framework using a probabilistic workload model to determine the optimal Attention/FFN ratio in an rA-1F topology, validated via simulation.

Result: Theoretical optimal A/F ratios closely match simulated results (within 10%), significantly reducing idle time across workloads.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively optimizes AFD resource allocation, enhancing throughput and minimizing inefficiencies.

Abstract: Attention-FFN disaggregation (AFD) is an emerging architecture for LLM decoding that separates state-heavy, KV-cache-dominated Attention computation from stateless, compute-intensive FFN computation, connected by per-step communication. While AFD enables independent scaling of memory and compute resources, its performance is highly sensitive to the Attention/FFN provisioning ratio: mis-sizing induces step-level blocking and costly device idle time. We develop a tractable analytical framework for sizing AFD bundles in an $r$A-$1$F topology, where the key difficulty is that Attention-side work is nonstationary-token context grows and requests are continuously replenished with random lengths-while FFN work is stable given the aggregated batch. Using a probabilistic workload model, we derive closed-form rules for the optimal A/F ratio that maximize average throughput per instance across the system. A trace-calibrated AFD simulator validates the theory: across workloads, the theoretical optimal A/F ratio matches the simulation-optimal within 10%, and consistently reduces idle time.

TL;DR: EI-GN is a new Bayesian Optimization acquisition function that improves upon EI by incorporating gradient norms, leading to better performance and avoiding suboptimal solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EI often converges to suboptimal points due to its exploitative nature; EI-GN aims to address this by promoting exploration in high-performing and gradient-rich regions.

Method: EI-GN applies the improvement principle to a gradient-aware auxiliary objective, using gradient observations to learn gradient-enhanced surrogate models. It provides a tractable closed-form expression for efficient optimization.

Result: Empirical evaluations show EI-GN outperforms standard baselines in BO benchmarks and is effective in control policy learning.

Conclusion: EI-GN successfully combines gradient awareness with the improvement principle, offering consistent performance gains over traditional methods.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a principled approach for optimizing expensive black-box functions, with Expected Improvement (EI) being one of the most widely used acquisition functions. Despite its empirical success, EI is known to be overly exploitative and can converge to suboptimal stationary points. We propose Expected Improvement via Gradient Norms (EI-GN), a novel acquisition function that applies the improvement principle to a gradient-aware auxiliary objective, thereby promoting sampling in regions that are both high-performing and approaching first-order stationarity. EI-GN relies on gradient observations used to learn gradient-enhanced surrogate models that enable principled gradient inference from function evaluations. We derive a tractable closed-form expression for EI-GN that allows efficient optimization and show that the proposed acquisition is consistent with the improvement-based acquisition framework. Empirical evaluations on standard BO benchmarks demonstrate that EI-GN yields consistent improvements against standard baselines. We further demonstrate applicability of EI-GN to control policy learning problems.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Transformers as interacting particle systems on the unit sphere, linking layers to time and token embeddings to particles. It explores critical points' atomic and localized nature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand Transformer dynamics by modeling them as interacting particle systems on the unit sphere and investigating the role of the perceptron block.

Method: Uses the framework of interacting particle systems and Wasserstein gradient flows to analyze the infinite context length limit.

Result: Critical points of the system are generically atomic and localized on subsets of the sphere.

Conclusion: The perceptron block's effect in Transformers leads to localized critical points, providing insights into the system's dynamics.

Abstract: The forward pass of a Transformer can be seen as an interacting particle system on the unit sphere: time plays the role of layers, particles that of token embeddings, and the unit sphere idealizes layer normalization. In some weight settings the system can even be seen as a gradient flow for an explicit energy, and one can make sense of the infinite context length (mean-field) limit thanks to Wasserstein gradient flows. In this paper we study the effect of the perceptron block in this setting, and show that critical points are generically atomic and localized on subsets of the sphere.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address irreversible knowledge loss in FedGFMs and reconcile semantic-structural orthogonality between PLMs and GNNs in distributed environments.

Method: Employs unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and PLMs, followed by communication-efficient prompt tuning for task adaptation.

Result: FedGALA achieves up to 14.37% performance improvement over baselines across multi-domain datasets.

Conclusion: FedGALA effectively mitigates data heterogeneity and communication constraints in federated settings while enhancing performance.

Abstract: Recent studies of federated graph foundational models (FedGFMs) break the idealized and untenable assumption of having centralized data storage to train graph foundation models, and accommodate the reality of distributed, privacy-restricted data silos. Despite their simplicity and intuition, existing studies that project aligned generalizable knowledge onto a discrete token space via vector-quantized backbones suffer from irreversible knowledge loss during the quantization process. In this context, we argue that reconciling the semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) is paramount for developing effective FedGFMs while simultaneously mitigating the severe data heterogeneity and communication constraints inherent in distributed, resource-limited environments.
  To address these issues, we propose FedGALA (Federated Graph And Language Alignment), a framework that resolves graph-based semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity in federated settings by employing unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and frozen PLMs within a continuous embedding space, thereby capturing robust, transferable general knowledge. Subsequently, FedGALA leverages a communication-efficient prompt tuning mechanism to steer these pre-aligned encoders and frozen PLMs, facilitating effective adaptation to diverse downstream tasks while circumventing the prohibitive overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning. The comprehensive experiments validate that FedGALA outperforms all competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets on multiple tasks with up to 14.37% performance improvement.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DA-SPS, a model for multivariate time-series forecasting that improves accuracy by separately processing target and extraneous variables using specialized modules, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multivariate time-series forecasting fail to adequately account for extraneous variables' impact and fully extract complex sequence information. The DA-SPS model addresses these limitations.

Method: DA-SPS processes target variables using SSA, LSTM, and P-Conv-LSTM for trend and seasonality. Extraneous variables are filtered via Spearman correlation and analyzed using L-Attention (LSTM + attention). Results are combined through weighted summation and linear mapping.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four public datasets and shows strong performance on a private laptop motherboard test dataset.

Conclusion: DA-SPS effectively addresses gaps in existing approaches by separately processing variables and leveraging advanced feature extraction techniques, demonstrating superior performance in both public and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multivariate time-series forecasting, as a typical problem in the field of time series prediction, has a wide range of applications in weather forecasting, traffic flow prediction, and other scenarios. However, existing works do not effectively consider the impact of extraneous variables on the prediction of the target variable. On the other hand, they fail to fully extract complex sequence information based on various time patterns of the sequences. To address these drawbacks, we propose a DA-SPS model, which adopts different modules for feature extraction based on the information characteristics of different variables. DA-SPS mainly consists of two stages: the target variable processing stage (TVPS) and the extraneous variables processing stage (EVPS). In TVPS, the model first uses Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to process the target variable sequence and then uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and P-Conv-LSTM which deploys a patching strategy to extract features from trend and seasonality components, respectively. In EVPS, the model filters extraneous variables that have a strong correlation with the target variate by using Spearman correlation analysis and further analyses them using the L-Attention module which consists of LSTM and attention mechanism. Finally, the results obtained by TVPS and EVPS are combined through weighted summation and linear mapping to produce the final prediction. The results on four public datasets demonstrate that the DA-SPS model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, its performance in real-world scenarios is further validated using a private dataset collected by ourselves, which contains the test items' information on laptop motherboards.

Method: The Sim-MSTNet model employs a sim2real approach using synthetic data generation and domain randomization. It uses attention mechanisms for knowledge sharing and dynamic loss weighting for task balance.

Result: Sim-MSTNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two open-source datasets, achieving better accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: Sim-MSTNet effectively addresses data scarcity and task imbalance, demonstrating superior performance in network traffic forecasting.

Abstract: Network traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in intelligent network operations, but existing techniques often perform poorly when faced with limited data. Additionally, multi-task learning methods struggle with task imbalance and negative transfer, especially when modeling various service types. To overcome these challenges, we propose Sim-MSTNet, a multi-task spatiotemporal network traffic forecasting model based on the sim2real approach. Our method leverages a simulator to generate synthetic data, effectively addressing the issue of poor generalization caused by data scarcity. By employing a domain randomization technique, we reduce the distributional gap between synthetic and real data through bi-level optimization of both sample weighting and model training. Moreover, Sim-MSTNet incorporates attention-based mechanisms to selectively share knowledge between tasks and applies dynamic loss weighting to balance task objectives. Extensive experiments on two open-source datasets show that Sim-MSTNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving enhanced accuracy and generalization.

Motivation: The paper aims to improve time series understanding by addressing challenges in cross-modal integration, such as temporal misalignment and semantic entanglement, to enable better natural language querying and analysis.

Method: The proposed MADI framework includes (1) patch-level alignment for fine-grained correspondence, (2) disentangled interaction to separate shared and unique semantics, and (3) critical-token highlighting for robust reasoning.

Result: MADI outperforms general-purpose LLMs and specialized MLLMs in synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: MADI effectively addresses cross-modal integration challenges, enhancing time series understanding and reasoning in multi-modal LLMs.

Abstract: Advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have inspired time series understanding and reasoning tasks, that enable natural language querying over time series, producing textual analyses of complex temporal dynamics. Recent attempts hybridize numerical time series with their visualized plots, facilitating precise value reasoning and visual structure comprehension for comprehensive time series understanding of MLLMs. However, effective cross-modal integration remains challenging due to fine-grained temporal misalignment across modalities and severe entanglement between shared and modality-specific semantics, which hinder localized interpretation and complementary reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MADI, a multi-modal LLM enhanced with fine-grained alignment and disentangled interaction, featuring (1) Patch-level Alignment, which enforces physically grounded fine-grained correspondence across heterogeneous modalities, (2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction, which separates modality-common semantics into compact discrete latents and adaptively synergizes the purified modality-unique information, and (3) Critical-token Highlighting, which emphasizes informative, query-relevant signals for robust reasoning. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that MADI consistently outperforms general-purpose LLMs and time-series-specialized MLLMs.

TL;DR: Proposes IRPO, a policy optimization framework using multiple intrinsic rewards to enhance exploration in sparse-reward environments, outperforming baselines in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of naive exploration and existing intrinsic reward methods (unstable credit assignment, sample inefficiency) in reinforcement learning.

Method: Introduces IRPO, leveraging surrogate policy gradients from multiple intrinsic rewards to optimize policies directly for extrinsic rewards without subpolicy pretraining.

Result: IRPO improves performance and sample efficiency over baselines in discrete and continuous environments.

Conclusion: IRPO effectively tackles sparse-reward challenges by unifying intrinsic reward benefits without subpolicy drawbacks, with empirical and theoretical validation.

Abstract: Exploration is essential in reinforcement learning as an agent relies on trial and error to learn an optimal policy. However, when rewards are sparse, naive exploration strategies, like noise injection, are often insufficient. Intrinsic rewards can also provide principled guidance for exploration by, for example, combining them with extrinsic rewards to optimize a policy or using them to train subpolicies for hierarchical learning. However, the former approach suffers from unstable credit assignment, while the latter exhibits sample inefficiency and sub-optimality. We propose a policy optimization framework that leverages multiple intrinsic rewards to directly optimize a policy for an extrinsic reward without pretraining subpolicies. Our algorithm -- intrinsic reward policy optimization (IRPO) -- achieves this by using a surrogate policy gradient that provides a more informative learning signal than the true gradient in sparse-reward environments. We demonstrate that IRPO improves performance and sample efficiency relative to baselines in discrete and continuous environments, and formally analyze the optimization problem solved by IRPO. Our code is available at https://github.com/Mgineer117/IRPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiPO is a reinforcement learning framework that helps Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) adjust reasoning overhead based on task difficulty, reducing redundant tokens while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs often overthink simple tasks due to reward-driven generation preferences, leading to inefficiency. Existing solutions neglect task difficulty awareness.

Method: Proposes Difficulty-aware Policy Optimization (DiPO), which models task complexity via self-reasoning and integrates it into reinforcement learning to adjust generation preferences.

Result: DiPO reduces redundant tokens significantly without performance loss, optimizing reasoning overhead.

Conclusion: DiPO effectively addresses overthinking in LRMs by incorporating task difficulty awareness into reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve explicit chain-of-thought expansion by imitating deep thinking behaviors of humans, demonstrating excellent performance in complex task scenarios. However, the deep-thinking mode often leads to unnecessarily lengthy reasoning and resource inefficiency when handling simple tasks. This overthinking phenomenon may arise from the generation preference triggered by the reward function during post-training. Existing research attempts to mitigate overthinking from the perspective of prompt design or model training, but generally underestimates the importance of task difficulty awareness, which makes it difficult for LRMs to effectively allocate reasoning resources. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-aware Policy Optimization (DiPO), a reinforcement learning-based LRM training framework. DiPO encourages LRM to spontaneously model task complexity, and integrates them into reinforcement learning framework to adjust the generation preferences introduced by post-training. A difficulty modeling method based on model self-reasoning is proposed, which significantly reduces the dependence on manual annotation and formalize task complexity. We further develop a difficulty-signal-enhanced reward function that incorporates a penalty for lengthy reasoning while considering reasoning performance and output format. Experimental results indicate that DiPO enables the model to spontaneously adjust inference overhead, significantly reducing redundant tokens without losing performance due to thought compression.

### [236] [Revisiting Diffusion Model Predictions Through Dimensionality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21419)
*Qing Jin,Chaoyang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes why different prediction targets (noise, velocity, or direct data) perform better in diffusion models and proposes k-Diff, a method to learn the optimal target automatically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why the choice of prediction target (e.g., noise, velocity, or direct data) impacts performance in diffusion models, especially in high-dimensional settings.

Method: Develops a theoretical framework linking data geometry to the optimal prediction target and introduces k-Diff, a data-driven approach to learn this target without explicit dimension estimation.

Result: k-Diff outperforms fixed-target baselines in experiments, proving the benefit of adaptive target selection.

Conclusion: Theoretical insights and k-Diff offer a principled way to improve generative models by dynamically selecting the optimal prediction target.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion and flow matching models have highlighted a shift in the preferred prediction target -- moving from noise ($\varepsilon$) and velocity (v) to direct data (x) prediction -- particularly in high-dimensional settings. However, a formal explanation of why the optimal target depends on the specific properties of the data remains elusive. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework based on a generalized prediction formulation that accommodates arbitrary output targets, of which $\varepsilon$-, v-, and x-prediction are special cases. We derive the analytical relationship between data's geometry and the optimal prediction target, offering a rigorous justification for why x-prediction becomes superior when the ambient dimension significantly exceeds the data's intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, while our theory identifies dimensionality as the governing factor for the optimal prediction target, the intrinsic dimension of manifold-bound data is typically intractable to estimate in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose k-Diff, a framework that employs a data-driven approach to learn the optimal prediction parameter k directly from data, bypassing the need for explicit dimension estimation. Extensive experiments in both latent-space and pixel-space image generation demonstrate that k-Diff consistently outperforms fixed-target baselines across varying architectures and data scales, providing a principled and automated approach to enhancing generative performance.

*Zihao Huang,Jundong Zhou,Xingwei Qu,Qiyang Min,Ge Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConceptMoE dynamically merges semantically similar tokens into concepts, optimizing computation allocation and improving performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models uniformly compute all tokens, missing opportunities to optimize computation for predictable versus complex sequences.

Method: ConceptMoE uses a learnable chunk module to compress sequences by merging similar tokens and reallocates saved computation to enhance performance.

Result: ConceptMoE outperforms standard MoE models (+0.9 to +5.5 points) and reduces attention computation and KV cache.

Conclusion: Adaptive concept-level processing improves both efficiency and effectiveness of large language models with minimal architectural changes.

Abstract: Large language models allocate uniform computation across all tokens, ignoring that some sequences are trivially predictable while others require deep reasoning. We introduce ConceptMoE, which dynamically merges semantically similar tokens into concept representations, performing implicit token-level compute allocation. A learnable chunk module identifies optimal boundaries by measuring inter-token similarity, compressing sequences by a target ratio $R$ before they enter the compute-intensive concept model. Crucially, the MoE architecture enables controlled evaluation: we reallocate saved computation to match baseline activated FLOPs (excluding attention map computation) and total parameters, isolating genuine architectural benefits. Under these conditions, ConceptMoE consistently outperforms standard MoE across language and vision-language tasks, achieving +0.9 points on language pretraining, +2.3 points on long context understanding, and +0.6 points on multimodal benchmarks. When converting pretrained MoE during continual training with layer looping, gains reach +5.5 points, demonstrating practical applicability. Beyond performance, ConceptMoE reduces attention computation by up to $R^2\times$ and KV cache by $R\times$. At $R=2$, empirical measurements show prefill speedups reaching 175\% and decoding speedups up to 117\% on long sequences. The minimal architectural modifications enable straightforward integration into existing MoE, demonstrating that adaptive concept-level processing fundamentally improves both effectiveness and efficiency of large language models.

*Anderson de Andrade,Alon Harell,Ivan V. Bajić*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learnable three-channel codec inspired by Gray-Wyner theory reduces redundancy in computer vision tasks by disentangling shared and task-specific information, outperforming independent coding consistently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing codecs inefficiently handle overlapping information in computer vision tasks, prompting exploration of Gray-Wyner theory for more effective representation learning.

Method: Developed a learnable three-channel codec to disentangle shared and task-specific information, optimizing for lossy common information and evaluating on six vision benchmarks.

Result: The approach significantly reduces redundancy and outperforms independent coding in two-task scenarios across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Revisiting Gray-Wyner theory bridges classical information theory with modern representation learning, demonstrating practical benefits for multi-task vision applications.

Abstract: Many computer vision tasks share substantial overlapping information, yet conventional codecs tend to ignore this, leading to redundant and inefficient representations. The Gray-Wyner network, a classical concept from information theory, offers a principled framework for separating common and task-specific information. Inspired by this idea, we develop a learnable three-channel codec that disentangles shared information from task-specific details across multiple vision tasks. We characterize the limits of this approach through the notion of lossy common information, and propose an optimization objective that balances inherent tradeoffs in learning such representations. Through comparisons of three codec architectures on two-task scenarios spanning six vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces redundancy and consistently outperforms independent coding. These results highlight the practical value of revisiting Gray-Wyner theory in modern machine learning contexts, bridging classic information theory with task-driven representation learning.

### [239] [Accurate Network Traffic Matrix Prediction via LEAD: an LLM-Enhanced Adapter-Based Conditional Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21437)
*Yu Sun,Yaqiong Liu,Nan Cheng,Jiayuan Li,Zihan Jia,Xialin Du,Mugen Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEAD is a novel LLM-enhanced diffusion model for accurate and uncertainty-aware network traffic matrix forecasting, outperforming baselines significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in accurately forecasting stochastic and bursty network traffic matrices for proactive traffic engineering in evolving 6G and AI-native edge intelligence environments.

Method: LEAD transforms traffic matrices into RGB images, uses a frozen LLM with trainable adapters for temporal semantics, and employs a dual-conditioning strategy with diffusion models.

Result: LEAD reduces RMSE by 45.2% on Abilene and 27.3% on GEANT datasets compared to baselines, maintaining low error margins over multi-step predictions.

Conclusion: LEAD effectively addresses the limitations of existing models, offering high fidelity and uncertainty awareness for network traffic forecasting.

Abstract: Driven by the evolution toward 6G and AI-native edge intelligence, network operations increasingly require predictive and risk-aware adaptation under stringent computation and latency constraints. Network Traffic Matrix (TM), which characterizes flow volumes between nodes, is a fundamental signal for proactive traffic engineering. However, accurate TM forecasting remains challenging due to the stochastic, non-linear, and bursty nature of network dynamics. Existing discriminative models often suffer from over-smoothing and provide limited uncertainty awareness, leading to poor fidelity under extreme bursts. To address these limitations, we propose LEAD, a Large Language Model (LLM)-Enhanced Adapter-based conditional Diffusion model. First, LEAD adopts a "Traffic-to-Image" paradigm to transform traffic matrices into RGB images, enabling global dependency modeling via vision backbones. Then, we design a "Frozen LLM with Trainable Adapter" model, which efficiently captures temporal semantics with limited computational cost. Moreover, we propose a Dual-Conditioning Strategy to precisely guide a diffusion model to generate complex, dynamic network traffic matrices. Experiments on the Abilene and GEANT datasets demonstrate that LEAD outperforms all baselines. On the Abilene dataset, LEAD attains a remarkable 45.2% reduction in RMSE against the best baseline, with the error margin rising only marginally from 0.1098 at one-step to 0.1134 at 20-step predictions. Meanwhile, on the GEANT dataset, LEAD achieves a 0.0258 RMSE at 20-step prediction horizon which is 27.3% lower than the best baseline.

*Francesco Zola,Lucia Muñoz,Andrea Venturi,Amaia Gil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) on synthetic data to detect illicit financial patterns like money laundering, showing GAE-GCN performs best across various patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting illicit financial activities is hard due to limited labeled real-world data and privacy constraints. Synthetic data and unsupervised GAEs offer a solution.

Method: Two-phase approach: 1) Generate synthetic data for seven illicit patterns with realistic variability. 2) Train and validate GAEs (GAE-GCN, GAE-SAGE, GAE-GAT) using reconstruction error.

Result: GAE-GCN consistently outperforms others in reconstructing patterns. GAE-SAGE and GAE-GAT perform well only in specific cases.

Conclusion: GAEs on synthetic data are viable for detecting illicit behaviors, mitigating real-world data limitations.

Abstract: Illicit financial activities such as money laundering often manifest through recurrent topological patterns in transaction networks. Detecting these patterns automatically remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled real-world data and strict privacy constraints. To address this, we investigate whether Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) can effectively learn and distinguish topological patterns that mimic money laundering operations when trained on synthetic data. The analysis consists of two phases: (i) data generation, where synthetic samples are created for seven well-known illicit activity patterns using parametrized generators that preserve structural consistency while introducing realistic variability; and (ii) model training and validation, where separate GAEs are trained on each pattern without explicit labels, relying solely on reconstruction error as an indicator of learned structure. We compare three GAE implementations based on three distinct convolutional layers: Graph Convolutional (GAE-GCN), GraphSAGE (GAE-SAGE), and Graph Attention Network (GAE-GAT). Experimental results show that GAE-GCN achieves the most consistent reconstruction performance across patterns, while GAE-SAGE and GAE-GAT exhibit competitive results only in few specific patterns. These findings suggest that graph-based representation learning on synthetic data provides a viable path toward developing AI-driven tools for detecting illicit behaviors, overcoming the limitations of financial datasets.

### [241] [Shaping capabilities with token-level data filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21571)
*Neil Rathi,Alec Radford*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Filtering pretraining data by tokens, not documents, effectively reduces undesired medical capabilities in language models, with scalability and robustness benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post hoc methods for reducing undesired capabilities in language models are easily bypassed; shaping capabilities during pretraining is a more robust alternative.

Method: Token filtering during pretraining, labeled via sparse autoencoders and distilled classifiers, is compared to document filtering. Scalability and robustness to noisy labels are tested across models of varying sizes.

Result: Token filtering outperforms document filtering, achieving the same reduction in undesired capabilities with less impact on benign ones. It scales effectively, with a 7000x compute slowdown for the largest models, and remains robust to noisy labels.

Conclusion: Token filtering during pretraining is a scalable, effective, and robust method for reducing undesired capabilities, even allowing alignment post-filtering.

Abstract: Current approaches to reducing undesired capabilities in language models are largely post hoc, and can thus be easily bypassed by adversaries. A natural alternative is to shape capabilities during pretraining itself. On the proxy task of removing medical capabilities, we show that the simple intervention of filtering pretraining data is highly effective, robust, and inexpensive at scale. Inspired by work on data attribution, we show that filtering tokens is more effective than filtering documents, achieving the same hit to undesired capabilities at a lower cost to benign ones. Training models spanning two orders of magnitude, we then demonstrate that filtering gets more effective with scale: for our largest models, token filtering leads to a 7000x compute slowdown on the forget domain. We also show that models trained with token filtering can still be aligned on the forget domain. Along the way, we introduce a methodology for labeling tokens with sparse autoencoders and distilling cheap, high-quality classifiers. We also demonstrate that filtering can be robust to noisy labels with sufficient pretraining compute.

*Yu Xie,Xing Kai Ren,Ying Qi,Hu Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SAGE, a unified optimization framework for list-wise generative recommendation, addressing limitations in OneRec by reusing LLM vocabularies and solving GBPO's symmetric conservatism issue with adaptive dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiency of separate tokenization vocabularies in LLM-based recommender systems and address the 'Symmetric Conservatism' problem in GBPO optimization.

Method: Introduces SAGE with Sequence-level Signal Decoupling and Asymmetric Adaptive Dynamics innovations.

Result: SAGE unblocks cold-start traffic, sustains diversity, and maintains numerical stability.

Conclusion: SAGE effectively improves scalability and performance in generative recommendation systems while leveraging open-source LLM architectures.

Abstract: While works such as OneRec have validated the scaling laws of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems, they rely on a cumbersome separate vocabulary. This dependency prevents the model architecture from reusing native LLM vocabularies, resulting in high maintenance costs and poor scalability. In response, we aim to efficiently reuse open-source LLM architectures without constructing a separate tokenization vocabulary. Furthermore, we identify that the optimization strategy of OneRec Gradient Bounded Policy Optimization (GBPO),suffers from a "Symmetric Conservatism" problem: its static gradient boundaries structurally suppress the update momentum required for cold-start items and fail to prevent diversity collapse in high-noise environments.To address this issue, we propose SAGE (Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution), a unified optimization framework tailored for list-wise generative recommendation. SAGE introduces two key innovations:(1) Sequence-level Signal Decoupling: By combining a geometric mean importance ratio with decoupled multi-objective advantages, we eliminate token-level variance and resolve the "Reward Collapse" problem. (2) Asymmetric Adaptive Dynamics: We construct a dynamic gradient manifold that applies a "Boost Factor" to high-potential cold start items to achieve super-linear updates and employs an "Entropy Aware Penalty" to break information cocoons. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that SAGE effectively unblocks cold-start traffic and sustains recommendation diversity, all while retaining the numerical stability of GBPO.

TL;DR: HER framework enhances LLM role-playing with dual-layer thinking, curated reasoning-augmented data, and human-aligned rewards, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with simulating inner thoughts in role-playing. HER addresses gaps in high-quality reasoning traces and reliable human-aligned rewards.

Method: HER introduces dual-layer thinking (first-person vs. third-person), curates reasoning-augmented data via reverse engineering, and trains models using supervised and reinforcement learning.

Result: HER models outperform Qwen3-32B baseline by 30.26 on CoSER benchmark and 14.97 on Minimax Role-Play Bench.

Conclusion: HER advances cognitive-level persona simulation, with datasets, principles, and models released to support future research.

Abstract: LLM role-playing, i.e., using LLMs to simulate specific personas, has emerged as a key capability in various applications, such as companionship, content creation, and digital games. While current models effectively capture character tones and knowledge, simulating the inner thoughts behind their behaviors remains a challenge. Towards cognitive simulation in LLM role-play, previous efforts mainly suffer from two deficiencies: data with high-quality reasoning traces, and reliable reward signals aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models. Leveraging these resources, we train \method models based on Qwen3-32B via supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our models significantly outperform the Qwen3-32B baseline, achieving a 30.26 improvement on the CoSER benchmark and a 14.97 gain on the Minimax Role-Play Bench. Our datasets, principles, and models will be released to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: L$^3$ introduces sparse embedding layers for efficient context-aware modeling, outperforming dense and MoE models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address drawbacks of dynamic hard routing in MoEs and lack of context in tokenizer embeddings.

Method: Uses static token-based routing and an embedding allocation algorithm.

Result: L$^3$ outperforms dense and MoE models with up to 2.6B parameters.

Conclusion: L$^3$ effectively balances memory, compute, and performance.

Abstract: Modern sparse language models typically achieve sparsity through Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers, which dynamically route tokens to dense MLP "experts." However, dynamic hard routing has a number of drawbacks, such as potentially poor hardware efficiency and needing auxiliary losses for stable training. In contrast, the tokenizer embedding table, which is natively sparse, largely avoids these issues by selecting a single embedding per token at the cost of not having contextual information. In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks.

### [245] [Breaking the Overscaling Curse: Thinking Parallelism Before Parallel Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21619)
*Yiming Wang,Zhuosheng Zhang,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Parallel thinking improves LLM reasoning but suffers from budget redundancy due to sample heterogeneity, termed the overscaling curse. The paper introduces T2, a lightweight method to optimize parallelism levels per sample, reducing costs without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses inefficiency caused by uniform parallelism allocation (N) in parallel thinking, where some samples don't need high N, leading to redundant costs (the overscaling curse).

Method: Proposes T2, a method using latent representations to predict the optimal parallelism level (N') per sample before decoding, eliminating redundancy.

Result: T2 reduces computational costs significantly while maintaining performance, validating its effectiveness in optimizing parallel thinking.

Conclusion: T2 successfully mitigates the overscaling curse, offering a practical solution for efficient parallel thinking in LLMs.

Abstract: Parallel thinking enhances LLM reasoning by multi-path sampling and aggregation. In system-level evaluations, a global parallelism level N is allocated to all samples, typically set large to maximize overall dataset accuracy. However, due to sample heterogeneity, some samples can achieve comparable performance with a smaller N'< N, causing budget redundancy. This incompatibility between system-level efficacy and sample-level efficiency constitutes the overscaling curse. In this paper, we formalize and quantify the overscaling curse, showing its universality and severity in practice, and analyze its trigger mechanism. We then propose a lightweight method, T2, to break the overscaling curse, which utilizes latent representations to estimate the optimal parallelism level for each sample before decoding. Experiments show that T2 significantly reduces cost while maintaining comparable performance, enabling more efficient parallel thinking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies partial-feedback online learning, where only one correct label is observed per round, and characterizes minimax regret using new dimensions (PFLdim for deterministic learners, PMSdim for randomized learners). It explores conditions separating deterministic and randomized learnability and highlights challenges beyond set realizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The model captures scenarios like language generation where multiple valid responses exist but only one reference is provided. The goal is to understand learnability and regret in such partial-feedback settings.

Method: Introduces Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) for deterministic learners and Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) for randomized learners. Uses a new version space viewpoint and auxiliary dimensions.

Result: PFLdim precisely governs learnability for deterministic learners; PMSdim provides tight bounds for randomized learners. Identifies conditions ensuring inseparability between deterministic and randomized learnability.

Conclusion: The work provides a near-complete characterization of minimax regret in set-realizable regimes but shows information-theoretic intractability outside this regime, necessitating new complexity measures.

Abstract: We study partial-feedback online learning, where each instance admits a set of correct labels, but the learner only observes one correct label per round; any prediction within the correct set is counted as correct. This model captures settings such as language generation, where multiple responses may be valid but data provide only a single reference. We give a near-complete characterization of minimax regret for both deterministic and randomized learners in the set-realizable regime, i.e., in the regime where sublinear regret is generally attainable. For deterministic learners, we introduce the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and show it precisely governs learnability and minimax regret; technically, PFLdim cannot be defined via the standard version space, requiring a new collection version space viewpoint and an auxiliary dimension used only in the proof. We further develop the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) to obtain tight bounds for randomized learners. We identify broad conditions ensuring inseparability between deterministic and randomized learnability (e.g., finite Helly number or nested-inclusion label structure), and extend the argument to set-valued online learning, resolving an open question of Raman et al. [2024b]. Finally, we show a sharp separation from weaker realistic and agnostic variants: outside set realizability, the problem can become information-theoretically intractable, with linear regret possible even for $|H|=2$. This highlights the need for fundamentally new, noise-sensitive complexity measures to meaningfully characterize learnability beyond set realizability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a new paradigm for training Small Language Models (SLMs) to handle complex codebases effectively, outperforming larger and commercial models in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the capability gap of open-weight SLMs in handling unfamiliar, complex codebases, which current Task-Centric Learning (TCL) fails to solve.

Method: Introduces RCL, focusing on deep repository understanding over broad task exposure, and designs a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience to train repo-specialized models like SWE-Spot-4B.

Result: SWE-Spot-4B outperforms larger and commercial models in efficiency and performance, demonstrating higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs.

Conclusion: Repository mastery is a critical dimension for efficient intelligence, complementing general coding capability, as proven by RCL's success.

Abstract: The deployment of coding agents in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments drives the demand for capable open-weight Small Language Models (SLMs). However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the "physics" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks. Further analysis reveals that RCL yields higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs, emphasizing that for building efficient intelligence, repository mastery is a distinct and necessary dimension that complements general coding capability.

Motivation: Addressing the gap in theoretical study of BCD for non-convex optimization, this paper aims to provide a versatile framework with convergence guarantees.

Method: The framework incorporates variable metric proximal gradient, proximal Newton, and alternated minimization updates, applied to sparse precision matrix estimation.

Result: The approach achieves convergence guarantees and reduces iterations by up to 100x for state-of-the-art estimation quality.

Conclusion: The proposed BCD framework is effective for non-convex optimization, particularly in sparse precision matrix estimation.

Abstract: Block-coordinate descent (BCD) is the method of choice to solve numerous large scale optimization problems, however their theoretical study for non-convex optimization, has received less attention. In this paper, we present a new block-coordinate descent (BCD) framework to tackle non-convex composite optimization problems, ensuring decrease of the objective function and convergence to a solution. This framework is general enough to include variable metric proximal gradient updates, proximal Newton updates, and alternated minimization updates. This generality allows to encompass three versions of the most used solvers in the sparse precision matrix estimation problem, deemed Graphical Lasso: graphical ISTA, Primal GLasso, and QUIC. We demonstrate the value of this new framework on non-convex sparse precision matrix estimation problems, providing convergence guarantees and up to a $100$-fold reduction in the number of iterations required to reach state-of-the-art estimation quality.

TL;DR: The paper explores Representation Misdirection (RM) in LLM unlearning, highlighting how manipulating forget-representations can lead to controllable behaviors and enhanced capabilities, validated empirically across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the underexplored roles of target vectors in RM and how linear representation hypothesis can enable controllable side behaviors and capabilities beyond forgetting.

Method: Uses the linear representation hypothesis to identify one-dimensional representations corresponding to high-level concepts, allowing linear operations in forget-representation space.

Result: Empirical validation shows RM can control behaviors (e.g., truth, sentiment) and enhance capabilities (e.g., in-context learning), revealing dual implications—potential risks or benefits.

Conclusion: RM's side effects offer opportunities for enhancing model capabilities and behaviors but require careful handling to avoid misuse.

Abstract: We consider representation misdirection (RM), a class of LLM unlearning methods that achieves forgetting by manipulating the forget-representations, that is, latent representations of forget samples. Despite being important, the roles of target vectors used in RM, however, remain underexplored. Here, we approach and revisit RM through the lens of the linear representation hypothesis. Specifically, if one can somehow identify a one-dimensional representation corresponding to a high-level concept, the linear representation hypothesis enables linear operations on this concept vector within the forget-representation space. Under this view, we hypothesize that, beyond forgetting, machine unlearning elicits controllable side behaviors and stronger side capabilities corresponding to the high-level concept. Our hypothesis is empirically validated across a wide range of tasks, including behavioral control (e.g., controlling unlearned models' truth, sentiment, and refusal) and capability enhancement (e.g., improving unlearned models' in-context learning capability). Our findings reveal that this fairly attractive phenomenon could be either a hidden risk if misused or a mechanism that can be harnessed for developing models that require stronger capabilities and controllable behaviors.

TL;DR: PPI-SVRG combines predictions and gradients for semi-supervised optimization, improving performance under label scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of scarce labeled data by leveraging predictions from pre-trained models alongside stochastic optimization techniques.

Method: Develops PPI-SVRG, combining PPI (uses predictions) and SVRG (uses reference gradients) mathematically, showing equivalence and integrating both approaches.

Result: Convergence bound shows standard SVRG rate plus prediction uncertainty error floor. Achieves 43--52% MSE reduction and 2.7--2.9% accuracy improvement on MNIST with 10% labeled data.

Conclusion: PPI-SVRG effectively utilizes predictions to stabilize and improve optimization performance when labeled data is limited.

Abstract: We study semi-supervised stochastic optimization when labeled data is scarce but predictions from pre-trained models are available. PPI and SVRG both reduce variance through control variates -- PPI uses predictions, SVRG uses reference gradients. We show they are mathematically equivalent and develop PPI-SVRG, which combines both. Our convergence bound decomposes into the standard SVRG rate plus an error floor from prediction uncertainty. The rate depends only on loss geometry; predictions affect only the neighborhood size. When predictions are perfect, we recover SVRG exactly. When predictions degrade, convergence remains stable but reaches a larger neighborhood. Experiments confirm the theory: PPI-SVRG reduces MSE by 43--52\% under label scarcity on mean estimation benchmarks and improves test accuracy by 2.7--2.9 percentage points on MNIST with only 10\% labeled data.

Motivation: Classical multi-fidelity BAI methods fail when proxies are biased and ground truth is selectively observed, leading to inefficiency and potential mis-selection.

Method: Develops an estimator combining proxy scores with inverse-propensity-weighted residuals, formulates anytime-valid confidence sequences, and proposes an adaptive auditing algorithm.

Result: The algorithm improves audit efficiency by focusing on unreliable contexts and close arms, with theoretical guarantees and superior empirical performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses bias and inefficiency in BAI with selective auditing, demonstrating robust theoretical and empirical results.

Abstract: We study fixed-confidence best-arm identification (BAI) where a cheap but potentially biased proxy (e.g., LLM judge) is available for every sample, while an expensive ground-truth label can only be acquired selectively when using a human for auditing. Unlike classical multi-fidelity BAI, the proxy is biased (arm- and context-dependent) and ground truth is selectively observed. Consequently, standard multi-fidelity methods can mis-select the best arm, and uniform auditing, though accurate, wastes scarce resources and is inefficient. We prove that without bias correction and propensity adjustment, mis-selection probability may not vanish (even with unlimited proxy data). We then develop an estimator for the mean of each arm that combines proxy scores with inverse-propensity-weighted residuals and form anytime-valid confidence sequences for that estimator. Based on the estimator and confidence sequence, we propose an algorithm that adaptively selects and audits arms. The algorithm concentrates audits on unreliable contexts and close arms and we prove that a plug-in Neyman rule achieves near-oracle audit efficiency. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithm.

*Xiuyu Li,Jinkai Zhang,Mingyang Yi,Yu Li,Longqiang Wang,Yue Wang,Ju Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ETS is a training-free inference method for sampling from optimal RL policies, improving generation quality efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the costliness and instability of RL post-training alignment for language models.

Method: Proposes Energy-Guided Test-Time Scaling (ETS), estimating an energy term via online Monte Carlo and using acceleration frameworks for efficiency.

Result: ETS improves generation quality across reasoning, coding, and science benchmarks.

Conclusion: ETS validates its effectiveness and design as a practical alternative to RL post-training.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training alignment for language models is effective, but also costly and unstable in practice, owing to its complicated training process. To address this, we propose a training-free inference method to sample directly from the optimal RL policy. The transition probability applied to Masked Language Modeling (MLM) consists of a reference policy model and an energy term. Based on this, our algorithm, Energy-Guided Test-Time Scaling (ETS), estimates the key energy term via online Monte Carlo, with a provable convergence rate. Moreover, to ensure practical efficiency, ETS leverages modern acceleration frameworks alongside tailored importance sampling estimators, substantially reducing inference latency while provably preserving sampling quality. Experiments on MLM (including autoregressive models and diffusion language models) across reasoning, coding, and science benchmarks show that our ETS consistently improves generation quality, validating its effectiveness and design.

*Tim Tomov,Dominik Fuchsgruber,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to model LLM outputs in a task-dependent latent structure, improving decoding and uncertainty estimation by leveraging structural information, outperforming traditional methods like beam search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decoding and uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs ignore underlying structural information in responses, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Model LLM outputs in a latent structure with a dissimilarity measure to compute Bayes-optimal responses, synthesized by combining individual responses in latent space.

Result: Bayes-optimal responses consistently outperform standard decoding methods, and uncertainty quantification aligns better with output quality and correctness.

Conclusion: The framework enables reliable task-aware LLM predictions for any problem with a latent response structure.

Abstract: In many applications of LLMs, natural language responses often have an underlying structure such as representing discrete labels, numerical values, or graphs. Yet, existing decoding and uncertainty estimation methods operate only in language space and largely disregard structural information. We address this by modeling LLM outputs directly in a task-dependent latent structure. By equipping this structure with a dissimilarity measure, we can compute Bayes-optimal responses. These are not selected from sampled generations but are newly synthesized by combining individual responses in the latent space. Across different tasks, Bayes-optimal responses consistently outperform standard decoding methods like beam search. Moreover, quantifying uncertainty via the induced Bayesian risk captures variations in terms of the latent structure and improves alignment with output quality and correctness. Our decision-theoretic framework is applicable to any problem that admits a latent response structure and enables reliable task-aware LLM predictions.

TL;DR: Cascaded Transfer Learning introduces a hierarchical, budget-aware method for many-task learning, improving accuracy and cost-effectiveness compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of learning many related tasks efficiently without prior knowledge of their exact relationships.

Method: Uses a cascaded transfer mechanism over a minimum spanning tree to hierarchically share parameters among tasks, optimizing budget allocation.

Result: Demonstrates improved accuracy and cost-effectiveness in synthetic and real-world many-task scenarios.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable and efficient paradigm for many-task learning via hierarchical information transfer.

Abstract: Many-Task Learning refers to the setting where a large number of related tasks need to be learned, the exact relationships between tasks are not known. We introduce the Cascaded Transfer Learning, a novel many-task transfer learning paradigm where information (e.g. model parameters) cascades hierarchically through tasks that are learned by individual models of the same class, while respecting given budget constraints. The cascade is organized as a rooted tree that specifies the order in which tasks are learned and refined. We design a cascaded transfer mechanism deployed over a minimum spanning tree structure that connects the tasks according to a suitable distance measure, and allocates the available training budget along its branches. Experiments on synthetic and real many-task settings show that the resulting method enables more accurate and cost effective adaptation across large task collections compared to alternative approaches.

*Chi-Sheng Chen,En-Jui Kuo,Guan-Ying Chen,Xinyu Zhang,Fan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of embedding geometry on optimization dynamics for SPD manifolds in EEG signals, providing theoretical insights and empirical validation across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the gap in understanding how embedding choices affect gradient conditioning and numerical stability for SPD manifolds in EEG analysis.

Method: Theoretical analysis links embedding choice to gradient conditioning and stability, validated via a Transformer framework comparing BWSPD, Log-Euclidean, and Euclidean embeddings across EEG paradigms.

Result: Findings include BWSPD's better gradient conditioning on high-dimensional inputs, BN-Embed's accuracy improvement on specific datasets, and Log-Euclidean Transformer achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The Log-Euclidean Transformer outperforms existing methods, while BWSPD remains competitive, highlighting the importance of embedding geometry in EEG analysis.

Abstract: Spatial covariance matrices of EEG signals are Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) and lie on a Riemannian manifold, yet the theoretical connection between embedding geometry and optimization dynamics remains unexplored. We provide a formal analysis linking embedding choice to gradient conditioning and numerical stability for SPD manifolds, establishing three theoretical results: (1) BWSPD's $\sqrtκ$ gradient conditioning (vs $κ$ for Log-Euclidean) via Daleckii-Kreĭn matrices provides better gradient conditioning on high-dimensional inputs ($d \geq 22$), with this advantage reducing on low-dimensional inputs ($d \leq 8$) where eigendecomposition overhead dominates; (2) Embedding-Space Batch Normalization (BN-Embed) approximates Riemannian normalization up to $O(\varepsilon^2)$ error, yielding $+26\%$ accuracy on 56-channel ERP data but negligible effect on 8-channel SSVEP data, matching the channel-count-dependent prediction; (3) bi-Lipschitz bounds prove BWSPD tokens preserve manifold distances with distortion governed solely by the condition ratio $κ$. We validate these predictions via a unified Transformer framework comparing BWSPD, Log-Euclidean, and Euclidean embeddings within identical architecture across 1,500+ runs on three EEG paradigms (motor imagery, ERP, SSVEP; 36 subjects). Our Log-Euclidean Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, substantially outperforming classical Riemannian classifiers and recent SPD baselines, while BWSPD offers competitive accuracy with similar training time.

*Sagi Meir,Tommer D. Keidar,Noam Levi,Shlomi Reuveni,Barak Hirshberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the coverage@cost metric to measure LLM performance, connects it to pass@k, and proposes Reset-and-Discard (ReD) to optimize coverage@cost by reducing required attempts and costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics like pass@k don't account for the diminishing returns in unique question coverage at a fixed budget, necessitating a better approach.

Method: The authors propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method that improves coverage@cost by leveraging the power-law behavior of pass@k. It also predicts savings and infers power-law exponents if pass@k is unknown.

Result: Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval show ReD significantly reduces attempts, tokens, and costs while efficiently measuring inference power-laws.

Conclusion: ReD enhances LLM performance evaluation and cost efficiency, offering practical benefits for verifiable tasks.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) on verifiable tasks is usually measured by pass@k, the probability of answering a question correctly at least once in k trials. At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws.

TL;DR: GeoNorm introduces geodesic updates for Transformer normalization, outperforming Pre-Norm and Post-Norm with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unresolved question of normalization layer placement in Transformers by leveraging manifold optimization.

Method: Reinterprets FFN and attention outputs as optimization directions, replaces normalization with geodesic updates, and introduces layer-wise update decay.

Result: GeoNorm consistently outperforms existing methods in Transformer models without significant computational cost.

Conclusion: GeoNorm offers a seamless, efficient improvement for Transformer architectures by integrating manifold-inspired updates.

Abstract: The placement of normalization layers, specifically Pre-Norm and Post-Norm, remains an open question in Transformer architecture design. In this work, we rethink these approaches through the lens of manifold optimization, interpreting the outputs of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) and attention layers as update directions in optimization. Building on this perspective, we introduce GeoNorm, a novel method that replaces standard normalization with geodesic updates on the manifold. Furthermore, analogous to learning rate schedules, we propose a layer-wise update decay for the FFN and attention components. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GeoNorm consistently outperforms existing normalization methods in Transformer models. Crucially, GeoNorm can be seamlessly integrated into standard Transformer architectures, achieving performance improvements with negligible additional computational cost.

*Bang Giang Le,Viet Cuong Ta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a method combining global and local rewards in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning using an interaction graph to improve cooperation and learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global rewards are noisy due to aggregated agent contributions, while local rewards can lead to suboptimal outcomes. A hybrid approach is needed.

Method: Uses a graph of agent interactions to fine-tune individual contributions and introduces a practical approximation for this graph.

Result: Experiments show improved performance over traditional reward settings.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively balances cooperation and learning efficiency.

Abstract: To promote cooperation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, the reward signals of all agents can be aggregated together, forming global rewards that are commonly known as the fully cooperative setting. However, global rewards are usually noisy because they contain the contributions of all agents, which have to be resolved in the credit assignment process. On the other hand, using local reward benefits from faster learning due to the separation of agents' contributions, but can be suboptimal as agents myopically optimize their own reward while disregarding the global optimality. In this work, we propose a method that combines the merits of both approaches. By using a graph of interaction between agents, our method discerns the individual agent contribution in a more fine-grained manner than a global reward, while alleviating the cooperation problem with agents' local reward. We also introduce a practical approach for approximating such a graph. Our experiments demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, enabling improvements over the traditional local and global reward settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ViKeR introduces visual-guided key-token regularization for unlearning in MLLMs, prioritizing important tokens and leveraging visual cues to improve privacy and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM unlearning methods treat all tokens uniformly and ignore visual cues, limiting effectiveness in preserving privacy and coherence.

Method: Proposes Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization (ViKeR), using irrelevant visual inputs to predict token distributions and regularize unlearning, focusing on key tokens via entropy and gradient reweighting.

Result: ViKeR outperforms on MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks, effectively unlearning private information while minimizing forgetting and maintaining response quality.

Conclusion: ViKeR advances MLLM unlearning by integrating visual cues and prioritizing key tokens, enhancing privacy and coherence in multimodal question answering.

Abstract: Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the model from revealing private information when queried about target images. Existing MLLM unlearning methods largely adopt approaches developed for LLMs. They treat all answer tokens uniformly, disregarding their varying importance in the unlearning process. Moreover, these methods focus exclusively on the language modality, disregarding visual cues that indicate key tokens in answers. In this paper, after formulating the problem of unlearning in multimodal question answering for MLLMs, we propose Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization (ViKeR). We leverage irrelevant visual inputs to predict ideal post-unlearning token-level distributions and use these distributions to regularize the unlearning process, thereby prioritizing key tokens. Further, we define key tokens in unlearning via information entropy and discuss ViKeR's effectiveness through token-level gradient reweighting, which amplifies updates on key tokens. Experiments on MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that our method effectively performs unlearning while mitigating forgetting and maintaining response coherence.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in hyperbolic neural networks, proposing a new Lorentz linear layer to maintain hyperbolic norms' linear scaling with gradient steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperbolic space is promising for hierarchical representation learning, but current Lorentz model formulations suffer from logarithmic scaling of hyperbolic norms.

Method: Introduces a new Lorentz linear layer based on 'distance-to-hyperplane', along with Lorentzian activation functions and a caching strategy.

Result: The proposed method ensures linear scaling of hyperbolic norms with gradient steps and improves computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The new formulation bridges the gap between hyperbolic and Euclidean neural networks while preserving hyperbolic geometry.

Abstract: Hyperbolic space is quickly gaining traction as a promising geometry for hierarchical and robust representation learning. A core open challenge is the development of a mathematical formulation of hyperbolic neural networks that is both efficient and captures the key properties of hyperbolic space. The Lorentz model of hyperbolic space has been shown to enable both fast forward and backward propagation. However, we prove that, with the current formulation of Lorentz linear layers, the hyperbolic norms of the outputs scale logarithmically with the number of gradient descent steps, nullifying the key advantage of hyperbolic geometry. We propose a new Lorentz linear layer grounded in the well-known ``distance-to-hyperplane" formulation. We prove that our formulation results in the usual linear scaling of output hyperbolic norms with respect to the number of gradient descent steps. Our new formulation, together with further algorithmic efficiencies through Lorentzian activation functions and a new caching strategy results in neural networks fully abiding by hyperbolic geometry while simultaneously bridging the computation gap to Euclidean neural networks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Expert Modulation, a new method for multi-modal time series forecasting that avoids token-level fusion by conditioning expert behavior on textual signals, showing significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal forecasting methods struggle with token-level fusion when high-quality time-text pairs are scarce or when time series vary greatly in scale and characteristics.

Method: The proposed Expert Modulation paradigm conditions both routing and expert computation on textual signals, enabling direct cross-modal control over expert behavior.

Result: The method demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-modal time series prediction through theoretical analysis and experiments.

Conclusion: Expert Modulation offers an effective alternative to token-level fusion for multi-modal time series forecasting, improving performance.

Abstract: Real-world time series exhibit complex and evolving dynamics, making accurate forecasting extremely challenging. Recent multi-modal forecasting methods leverage textual information such as news reports to improve prediction, but most rely on token-level fusion that mixes temporal patches with language tokens in a shared embedding space. However, such fusion can be ill-suited when high-quality time-text pairs are scarce and when time series exhibit substantial variation in scale and characteristics, thus complicating cross-modal alignment. In parallel, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have proven effective for both time series modeling and multi-modal learning, yet many existing MoE-based modality integration methods still depend on token-level fusion. To address this, we propose Expert Modulation, a new paradigm for multi-modal time series prediction that conditions both routing and expert computation on textual signals, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal control over expert behavior. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and experiments, our proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-modal time series prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Public repositories contain many fine-tuned models, but most attention is on a few popular ones. The study finds 'hidden gems'—unpopular models that outperform popular ones, especially in the Llama-3.1-8B family. Efficient discovery is achieved using a Multi-Armed Bandit approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if the concentration of usage on popular models reflects their superior performance or if better alternatives are overlooked.

Method: Evaluated over 2,000 models, identifying outperforming but unpopular ones. Used a Multi-Armed Bandit approach with Sequential Halving, shared query sets, and aggressive elimination to accelerate discovery.

Result: Discovered 'hidden gems' like a Llama-3.1-8B checkpoint improving math performance from 83.2% to 96.0% without added inference costs. The method accelerated discovery by 50x with just 50 queries per candidate.

Conclusion: Superior fine-tuned models are often overlooked. A Multi-Armed Bandit approach efficiently uncovers these 'hidden gems,' improving model selection.

Abstract: Public repositories host millions of fine-tuned models, yet community usage remains disproportionately concentrated on a small number of foundation checkpoints. We investigate whether this concentration reflects efficient market selection or if superior models are systematically overlooked. Through an extensive evaluation of over 2,000 models, we show the prevalence of "hidden gems", unpopular fine-tunes that significantly outperform their popular counterparts. Notably, within the Llama-3.1-8B family, we find rarely downloaded checkpoints that improve math performance from 83.2% to 96.0% without increasing inference costs. However, discovering these models through exhaustive evaluation of every uploaded model is computationally infeasible. We therefore formulate model discovery as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem and accelerate the Sequential Halving search algorithm by using shared query sets and aggressive elimination schedules. Our method retrieves top models with as few as 50 queries per candidate, accelerating discovery by over 50x.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are limited by cancer-specific settings and lack functional relevance, necessitating a scalable, pan-cancer approach.

Method: Uses HistoPrism, an efficient transformer architecture, evaluated via pathway-level benchmarks.

Result: Outperforms prior models on variable genes and pathway prediction, showing biological coherence.

Conclusion: HistoPrism sets a new standard for clinically relevant transcriptomic modeling from histology.

Abstract: Predicting spatial gene expression from H&E histology offers a scalable and clinically accessible alternative to sequencing, but realizing clinical impact requires models that generalize across cancer types and capture biologically coherent signals. Prior work is often limited to per-cancer settings and variance-based evaluation, leaving functional relevance underexplored. We introduce HistoPrism, an efficient transformer-based architecture for pan-cancer prediction of gene expression from histology. To evaluate biological meaning, we introduce a pathway-level benchmark, shifting assessment from isolated gene-level variance to coherent functional pathways. HistoPrism not only surpasses prior state-of-the-art models on highly variable genes , but also more importantly, achieves substantial gains on pathway-level prediction, demonstrating its ability to recover biologically coherent transcriptomic patterns. With strong pan-cancer generalization and improved efficiency, HistoPrism establishes a new standard for clinically relevant transcriptomic modeling from routinely available histology.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the biologically implausible weight symmetry and gradient interference issues in standard backpropagation (BP) for deep learning.

Method: Introduces Selective Adaptive Learning (SAL), a method that decomposes the parameter space into sample-dependent regions and uses refined feedback alignment to decouple gradient interference and avoid weight symmetry.

Result: SAL shows competitive convergence rates and improved classification performance on 10 benchmarks, achieving numerical consistency and accuracy in deep (128 layers) and large-scale models (1B parameters).

Conclusion: SAL offers a biologically plausible and scalable alternative to BP, contributing to the study of efficient neural network training.

Abstract: Standard deep learning relies on Backpropagation (BP), which is constrained by biologically implausible weight symmetry and suffers from significant gradient interference within dense representations. To mitigate these bottlenecks, we propose Selective Adaptive Learning (SAL), a training method that combines selective parameter activation with adaptive area partitioning. Specifically, SAL decomposes the parameter space into mutually exclusive, sample-dependent regions. This decoupling mitigates gradient interference across divergent semantic patterns and addresses explicit weight symmetry requirements through our refined feedback alignment. Empirically, SAL demonstrates competitive convergence rates, leading to improved classification performance across 10 standard benchmarks. Additionally, SAL achieves numerical consistency and competitive accuracy even in deep regimes (up to 128 layers) and large-scale models (up to 1B parameters). Our approach is loosely inspired by biological learning mechanisms, offering a plausible alternative that contributes to the study of scalable neural network training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need arises from privacy regulations and robustness concerns, requiring methods to remove specific training data's influence without unstable or costly parameter updates.

Method: The framework learns a transformation over representations using an information bottleneck: maximizing mutual information with retained data while suppressing forgotten data. Variational surrogates make this tractable, applicable in both data-abundant and zero-shot scenarios.

Result: Experiments show Representation Unlearning achieves more reliable forgetting, better utility retention, and greater computational efficiency than baseline methods.

Conclusion: Representation Unlearning offers a practical and efficient solution for machine unlearning, outperforming traditional parameter-centric approaches.

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of specific training data from a model, a need driven by privacy regulations and robustness concerns. Existing approaches typically modify model parameters, but such updates can be unstable, computationally costly, and limited by local approximations. We introduce Representation Unlearning, a framework that performs unlearning directly in the model's representation space. Instead of modifying model parameters, we learn a transformation over representations that imposes an information bottleneck: maximizing mutual information with retained data while suppressing information about data to be forgotten. We derive variational surrogates that make this objective tractable and show how they can be instantiated in two practical regimes: when both retain and forget data are available, and in a zero-shot setting where only forget data can be accessed. Experiments across several benchmarks demonstrate that Representation Unlearning achieves more reliable forgetting, better utility retention, and greater computational efficiency than parameter-centric baselines.

TL;DR: FlexCausal is a CDRL framework that improves disentanglement by using a block-diagonal covariance VAE and Factorized Flow-based Prior, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing disentanglement methods rely on oversimplified assumptions (diagonal covariance, isotropic Gaussian priors), failing to capture real-world causal complexities.

Method: FlexCausal uses a block-diagonal covariance VAE, Factorized Flow-based Prior, supervised alignment objectives, and counterfactual constraints for precise causal learning.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show FlexCausal outperforms other methods.

Conclusion: FlexCausal effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, achieving superior causal disentanglement and generation fidelity.

Abstract: Causal Disentangled Representation Learning(CDRL) aims to learn and disentangle low dimensional representations and their underlying causal structure from observations. However, existing disentanglement methods rely on a standard mean-field approximation with a diagonal posterior covariance, which decorrelates all latent dimensions. Additionally, these methods often assume isotropic Gaussian priors for exogenous noise, failing to capture the complex, non-Gaussian statistical properties prevalent in real-world causal factors. Therefore, we propose FlexCausal, a novel CDRL framework based on a block-diagonal covariance VAE. FlexCausal utilizes a Factorized Flow-based Prior to realistically model the complex densities of exogenous noise, effectively decoupling the learning of causal mechanisms from distributional statistics. By integrating supervised alignment objectives with counterfactual consistency constraints, our framework ensures a precise structural correspondence between the learned latent subspaces and the ground-truth causal relations. Finally, we introduce a manifold-aware relative intervention strategy to ensure high-fidelity generation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FlexCausal significantly outperforms other methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for measuring representation similarity using usable information, covering functional, representational, and hierarchical perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously quantify representation similarity by linking functional and representational dimensions through usable information.

Method: Theoretical and empirical synthesis involving conditional mutual information, bidirectional stitching analysis, and reconstruction-based metrics.

Result: Functional similarity requires bidirectional analysis; representational similarity depends on predictive family capacity; similarity hierarchy exists.

Conclusion: Representational similarity is sufficient but not necessary for functional similarity, unified under a task-granularity hierarchy.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for quantifying the similarity between representations through the lens of \textit{usable information}, offering a rigorous theoretical and empirical synthesis across three key dimensions. First, addressing functional similarity, we establish a formal link between stitching performance and conditional mutual information. We further reveal that stitching is inherently asymmetric, demonstrating that robust functional comparison necessitates a bidirectional analysis rather than a unidirectional mapping. Second, concerning representational similarity, we prove that reconstruction-based metrics and standard tools (e.g., CKA, RSA) act as estimators of usable information under specific constraints. Crucially, we show that similarity is relative to the capacity of the predictive family: representations that appear distinct to a rigid observer may be identical to a more expressive one. Third, we demonstrate that representational similarity is sufficient but not necessary for functional similarity. We unify these concepts through a task-granularity hierarchy: similarity on a complex task guarantees similarity on any coarser derivative, establishing representational similarity as the limit of maximum granularity: input reconstruction.

TL;DR: SATR introduces a distributional update rule for training RSNNs, improving stability and performance in high-dimensional control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training RSNNs for reinforcement learning is challenging due to high variance in gradient estimates and non-differentiable dynamics.

Method: SATR bounds KL divergence normalized by signal energy, adapting trust regions dynamically. It uses Bernoulli connectivity distributions and a bitset implementation for efficiency.

Result: SATR enhances stability and achieves competitive performance against baselines like PPO-LSTM, with reduced training time.

Conclusion: SATR effectively addresses training challenges for RSNNs, offering scalable and efficient policy search.

Abstract: Recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) are a promising substrate for energy-efficient control policies, but training them for high-dimensional, long-horizon reinforcement learning remains challenging. Population-based, gradient-free optimization circumvents backpropagation through non-differentiable spike dynamics by estimating gradients. However, with finite populations, high variance of these estimates can induce harmful and overly aggressive update steps. Inspired by trust-region methods in reinforcement learning that constrain policy updates in distribution space, we propose \textbf{Signal-Adaptive Trust Regions (SATR)}, a distributional update rule that constrains relative change by bounding KL divergence normalized by an estimated signal energy. SATR automatically expands the trust region under strong signals and contracts it when updates are noise-dominated. We instantiate SATR for Bernoulli connectivity distributions, which have shown strong empirical performance for RSNN optimization. Across a suite of high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks, SATR improves stability under limited populations and reaches competitive returns against strong baselines including PPO-LSTM. In addition, to make SATR practical at scale, we introduce a bitset implementation for binary spiking and binary weights, substantially reducing wall-clock training time and enabling fast RSNN policy search.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes catastrophic forgetting in LLMs, identifies key neurons causing it, and proposes CNL to mitigate forgetting effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting undermines continual learning in LLMs, and existing methods lack theoretical grounding.

Method: A gradient-based framework identifies conflicting and collaborative neurons. CNL freezes conflicting neurons and updates collaborative ones.

Result: CNL achieves zero forgetting in in-set settings and reduces it by 59.1%-81.7% in out-of-set settings.

Conclusion: The CNL method, grounded in gradient similarity, effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting in LLMs.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting during knowledge injection severely undermines the continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs). Although existing methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they often lack a foundational theoretical explanation. We establish a gradient-based theoretical framework to explain catastrophic forgetting. We first prove that strongly negative gradient similarity is a fundamental cause of forgetting. We then use gradient similarity to identify two types of neurons: conflicting neurons that induce forgetting and account for 50%-75% of neurons, and collaborative neurons that mitigate forgetting and account for 25%-50%. Based on this analysis, we propose a knowledge injection method, Collaborative Neural Learning (CNL). By freezing conflicting neurons and updating only collaborative neurons, CNL theoretically eliminates catastrophic forgetting under an infinitesimal learning rate eta and an exactly known mastered set. Experiments on five LLMs, four datasets, and four optimizers show that CNL achieves zero forgetting in in-set settings and reduces forgetting by 59.1%-81.7% in out-of-set settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models face challenges with uncertainty estimation, often being computationally heavy or inaccurate.

Method: Introduced BatchEnsemble and GRUBE (a BatchEnsemble GRU variant) for uncertainty estimation in tabular and time series tasks. Compared against Monte Carlo dropout and deep ensembles.

Result: BatchEnsemble matches deep ensembles' uncertainty performance and beats Monte Carlo dropout. GRUBE excels in prediction and uncertainty tasks.

Conclusion: BatchEnsemble and GRUBE provide efficient, high-performance uncertainty estimation with reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Deep learning models struggle with uncertainty estimation. Many approaches are either computationally infeasible or underestimate uncertainty. We investigate \textit{BatchEnsemble} as a general and scalable method for uncertainty estimation across both tabular and time series tasks. To extend BatchEnsemble to sequential modeling, we introduce GRUBE, a novel BatchEnsemble GRU cell. We compare the BatchEnsemble to Monte Carlo dropout and deep ensemble models. Our results show that BatchEnsemble matches the uncertainty estimation performance of deep ensembles, and clearly outperforms Monte Carlo dropout. GRUBE achieves similar or better performance in both prediction and uncertainty estimation. These findings show that BatchEnsemble and GRUBE achieve similar performance with fewer parameters and reduced training and inference time compared to traditional ensembles.

*Tin Hadži Veljković,Erik Bekkers,Michael Tiemann,Jan-Willem van de Meent*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CORDS introduces a continuous representation method for predicting variable-sized sets, avoiding challenges of padded representations or explicit set size inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting sets with unknown sizes is common in tasks like object detection and molecular modeling, but existing methods face difficulties with padded representations or set size inference. CORDS addresses this by transforming sets into continuous fields.

Method: CORDS provides an invertible mapping converting spatial object sets into continuous fields: a density field for locations/count and a feature field for attributes. Models operate in field space while remaining decodable to discrete sets.

Result: Evaluated on molecular generation, object detection, simulation-based inference, and local maxima recovery, CORDS handles unknown set sizes robustly and competitively.

Conclusion: CORDS effectively predicts variable-sized sets by leveraging continuous field representations, offering a practical solution for diverse tasks.

Abstract: Many learning problems require predicting sets of objects when the number of objects is not known beforehand. Examples include object detection, molecular modeling, and scientific inference tasks such as astrophysical source detection. Existing methods often rely on padded representations or must explicitly infer the set size, which often poses challenges. We present a novel strategy for addressing this challenge by casting prediction of variable-sized sets as a continuous inference problem. Our approach, CORDS (Continuous Representations of Discrete Structures), provides an invertible mapping that transforms a set of spatial objects into continuous fields: a density field that encodes object locations and count, and a feature field that carries their attributes over the same support. Because the mapping is invertible, models operate entirely in field space while remaining exactly decodable to discrete sets. We evaluate CORDS across molecular generation and regression, object detection, simulation-based inference, and a mathematical task involving recovery of local maxima, demonstrating robust handling of unknown set sizes with competitive accuracy.

*Wentao Yu,Sheng Wan,Shuo Chen,Bo Han,Chen Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedSSA addresses heterogeneity in GFL by aligning semantic and structural knowledge across clients, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GFL's performance is hindered by node feature and structural topology heterogeneity across clients.

Method: FedSSA uses variational models for semantic alignment and spectral GNNs for structural alignment, clustering clients based on inferred distributions and spectral energy.

Result: FedSSA outperforms eleven state-of-the-art methods on diverse graph datasets.

Conclusion: FedSSA effectively mitigates heterogeneity issues in GFL, enhancing distributed graph representation learning.

Abstract: Graph Federated Learning (GFL) enables distributed graph representation learning while protecting the privacy of graph data. However, GFL suffers from heterogeneity arising from diverse node features and structural topologies across multiple clients. To address both types of heterogeneity, we propose a novel graph Federated learning method via Semantic and Structural Alignment (FedSSA), which shares the knowledge of both node features and structural topologies. For node feature heterogeneity, we propose a novel variational model to infer class-wise node distributions, so that we can cluster clients based on inferred distributions and construct cluster-level representative distributions. We then minimize the divergence between local and cluster-level distributions to facilitate semantic knowledge sharing. For structural heterogeneity, we employ spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and propose a spectral energy measure to characterize structural information, so that we can cluster clients based on spectral energy and build cluster-level spectral GNNs. We then align the spectral characteristics of local spectral GNNs with those of cluster-level spectral GNNs to enable structural knowledge sharing. Experiments on six homophilic and five heterophilic graph datasets under both non-overlapping and overlapping partitioning settings demonstrate that FedSSA consistently outperforms eleven state-of-the-art methods.

*Xiaotong Ji,Rasul Tutunov,Matthieu Zimmer,Haitham Bou Ammar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a training-free, verifier-free method to approximate the power distribution of LLMs, matching RL post-training performance while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL post-training methods improve LLMs but rely on distribution sharpening rather than new capabilities. MCMC-based alternatives are effective but computationally expensive.

Method: The authors derive a token-level scaled low-temperature approximation for the global power distribution, enabling autoregressive sharpening of the base model's outputs without iterative MCMC.

Result: The method matches or outperforms one-shot GRPO on math, QA, and code tasks across four LLMs, reducing inference latency by over 10x compared to MCMC.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a practical alternative to RL post-training and MCMC sampling, achieving comparable performance with lower computational overhead.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is a dominant approach for improving the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet growing evidence suggests that its gains arise primarily from distribution sharpening rather than the acquisition of new capabilities. Recent work has shown that sampling from the power distribution of LLMs using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can recover performance comparable to RL post-training without relying on external rewards; however, the high computational cost of MCMC makes such approaches impractical for widespread adoption. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded alternative that eliminates the need for iterative MCMC. We derive a novel formulation showing that the global power distribution can be approximated by a token-level scaled low-temperature one, where the scaling factor captures future trajectory quality. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a training-free and verifier-free algorithm that sharpens the base model's generative distribution autoregressively. Empirically, we evaluate our method on math, QA, and code tasks across four LLMs, and show that our method matches or surpasses one-shot GRPO without relying on any external rewards, while reducing inference latency by over 10x compared to MCMC-based sampling.

### [274] [Dynamics Reveals Structure: Challenging the Linear Propagation Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21601)
*Hoyeon Chang,Bálint Mucsányi,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores whether first-order updates in neural networks maintain logical coherence, focusing on the Linear Propagation Assumption (LPA). It uses relation algebra to analyze negation, converse, and composition, revealing structural limitations that may explain issues like knowledge editing failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand if local updates in neural networks preserve logical coherence, addressing gaps in understanding the LPA's geometric limits.

Method: The research formalizes the problem using relation algebra, examining three operations (negation, converse, composition) and their interactions with first-order propagation. Tensor factorization is proposed for negation and converse, while composition's bilinearity is proven incompatible with negation.

Result: For negation and converse, tensor factorization is necessary for coherent propagation. For composition, bilinearity causes incompatibility with negation, leading to feature map collapse. These findings explain failures in knowledge editing and multi-hop reasoning.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that structural limitations in the LPA underlie common neural network failures, suggesting a need for alternative approaches to ensure logical coherence in updates.

Abstract: Neural networks adapt through first-order parameter updates, yet it remains unclear whether such updates preserve logical coherence. We investigate the geometric limits of the Linear Propagation Assumption (LPA), the premise that local updates coherently propagate to logical consequences. To formalize this, we adopt relation algebra and study three core operations on relations: negation flips truth values, converse swaps argument order, and composition chains relations. For negation and converse, we prove that guaranteeing direction-agnostic first-order propagation necessitates a tensor factorization separating entity-pair context from relation content. However, for composition, we identify a fundamental obstruction. We show that composition reduces to conjunction, and prove that any conjunction well-defined on linear features must be bilinear. Since bilinearity is incompatible with negation, this forces the feature map to collapse. These results suggest that failures in knowledge editing, the reversal curse, and multi-hop reasoning may stem from common structural limitations inherent to the LPA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TTReFT is a novel Test-Time Representation FineTuning framework for Graph Neural Networks, addressing catastrophic forgetting in out-of-distribution scenarios through uncertainty-guided node selection, low-rank interventions, and dynamic masking. It outperforms existing methods empirically and theoretically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Neural Networks struggle with performance degradation in out-of-distribution scenarios, and existing Parameter Finetuning methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, limiting real-world use.

Method: TTReFT shifts adaptation from model parameters to latent representations using (1) uncertainty-guided node selection, (2) low-rank representation interventions, and (3) an intervention-aware masked autoencoder with dynamic masking.

Result: TTReFT shows superior performance across five benchmark datasets, with theoretical guarantees for out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: TTReFT introduces representation finetuning as a new paradigm for graph test-time training, combining theoretical rigor and practical utility.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks frequently exhibit significant performance degradation in the out-of-distribution test scenario. While test-time training (TTT) offers a promising solution, existing Parameter Finetuning (PaFT) paradigm suffer from catastrophic forgetting, hindering their real-world applicability. We propose TTReFT, a novel Test-Time Representation FineTuning framework that transitions the adaptation target from model parameters to latent representations. Specifically, TTReFT achieves this through three key innovations: (1) uncertainty-guided node selection for specific interventions, (2) low-rank representation interventions that preserve pre-trained knowledge, and (3) an intervention-aware masked autoencoder that dynamically adjust masking strategy to accommodate the node selection scheme. Theoretically, we establish guarantees for TTReFT in OOD settings. Empirically, extensive experiments across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTReFT achieves consistent and superior performance. Our work establishes representation finetuning as a new paradigm for graph TTT, offering both theoretical grounding and immediate practical utility for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive mixed-precision strategy for transformer inference, improving accuracy by selectively recomputing key components with higher precision while using lower precision for others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixed-precision computations are crucial for efficient AI deployment, especially in large language models. The paper aims to optimize transformer inference by reducing computational costs without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Based on rounding error analysis of composed functions, the authors develop an adaptive strategy to identify and recompute critical components with higher precision, leaving others at lower precision. This is applied to transformer architectures.

Result: Numerical experiments on GPT-2 models show that even low recomputation rates can enhance accuracy by up to two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: The adaptive mixed-precision approach significantly boosts transformer inference efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating practical benefits for large-scale AI models.

Abstract: Mixed-precision computations are a hallmark of the current stage of AI, driving the progress in large language models towards efficient, locally deployable solutions. This article addresses the floating-point computation of compositionally-rich functions, concentrating on transformer inference. Based on the rounding error analysis of a composition $f(g(\mathrm{x}))$, we provide an adaptive strategy that selects a small subset of components of $g(\mathrm{x})$ to be computed more accurately while all other computations can be carried out with lower accuracy. We then explain how this strategy can be applied to different compositions within a transformer and illustrate its overall effect on transformer inference. We study the effectiveness of this algorithm numerically on GPT-2 models and demonstrate that already very low recomputation rates allow for improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in accuracy.

TL;DR: This survey organizes modern deep-learning training mechanisms, introduces causal estimands and perturbation primitives, and proposes a protocol for measuring training history's impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand and measure the influence of training history (e.g., optimizer moments, data order, auxiliary state) in deep learning.

Method: Organizes mechanisms by source, lifetime, and visibility; introduces seed-paired causal estimands and perturbation primitives (e.g., momentum resets, order swaps); and develops a reporting checklist.

Result: Identifies key mechanisms affecting training and proposes tools (e.g., checksums, RNG contracts) for causal analysis.

Conclusion: A protocol is introduced for portable, causal, and uncertainty-aware measurement of training history's impact across models and data regimes.

Abstract: Modern deep-learning training is not memoryless. Updates depend on optimizer moments and averaging, data-order policies (random reshuffling vs with-replacement, staged augmentations and replay), the nonconvex path, and auxiliary state (teacher EMA/SWA, contrastive queues, BatchNorm statistics). This survey organizes mechanisms by source, lifetime, and visibility. It introduces seed-paired, function-space causal estimands; portable perturbation primitives (carry/reset of momentum/Adam/EMA/BN, order-window swaps, queue/teacher tweaks); and a reporting checklist with audit artifacts (order hashes, buffer/BN checksums, RNG contracts). The conclusion is a protocol for portable, causal, uncertainty-aware measurement that attributes how much training history matters across models, data, and regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sampling-free method for privacy amplification in differentially private model training with matrix factorization, offering stronger guarantees than previous Monte Carlo approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling-based methods for privacy amplification in differentially private matrix factorization either provide probabilistic guarantees or require random abstention. The authors aim to address these limitations.

Method: The authors develop sampling-free bounds using Rényi divergence and conditional composition, employing dynamic programming for efficient computation.

Result: The proposed framework provides stronger privacy guarantees, especially for small ε, and works with arbitrary banded and non-banded matrices. Numerical comparisons validate its efficacy.

Conclusion: The framework improves upon existing methods by offering sampling-free, efficient, and robust privacy guarantees for differentially private matrix factorization.

Abstract: We study privacy amplification for differentially private model training with matrix factorization under random allocation (also known as the balls-in-bins model). Recent work by Choquette-Choo et al. (2025) proposes a sampling-based Monte Carlo approach to compute amplification parameters in this setting. However, their guarantees either only hold with some high probability or require random abstention by the mechanism. Furthermore, the required number of samples for ensuring $(ε,δ)$-DP is inversely proportional to $δ$. In contrast, we develop sampling-free bounds based on Rényi divergence and conditional composition. The former is facilitated by a dynamic programming formulation to efficiently compute the bounds. The latter complements it by offering stronger privacy guarantees for small $ε$, where Rényi divergence bounds inherently lead to an over-approximation. Our framework applies to arbitrary banded and non-banded matrices. Through numerical comparisons, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across a broad range of matrix mechanisms used in research and practice.

TL;DR: The paper explores using generative AI (GenAI) for ship propeller design, focusing on bidirectional mapping between design parameters and performance targets via conditional flow matching, and highlights data generation, augmentation, and model versatility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to leverage GenAI to generate propeller designs meeting specific performance targets, overcoming limitations of traditional forward models.

Method: The approach uses conditional flow matching for bidirectional mapping, vortex lattice method for data generation, and pseudo-labels for data augmentation.

Result: The method generates multiple valid designs for the same performance targets and shows improved model performance with data augmentation.

Conclusion: GenAI demonstrates versatility in engineering design, enabling creation of distinct propeller geometries with similar performance characteristics.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) for ship propeller design. While traditional forward machine learning models predict the performance of mechanical components based on given design parameters, GenAI models aim to generate designs that achieve specified performance targets. In particular, we employ conditional flow matching to establish a bidirectional mapping between design parameters and simulated noise that is conditioned on performance labels. This approach enables the generation of multiple valid designs corresponding to the same performance targets by sampling over the noise vector.
  To support model training, we generate data using a vortex lattice method for numerical simulation and analyze the trade-off between model accuracy and the amount of available data. We further propose data augmentation using pseudo-labels derived from less data-intensive forward surrogate models, which can often improve overall model performance. Finally, we present examples of distinct propeller geometries that exhibit nearly identical performance characteristics, illustrating the versatility and potential of GenAI in engineering design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Seg-MoE introduces segment-level routing in Mixture-of-Experts for time-series forecasting, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy by leveraging temporal locality and continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoE approaches for time-series forecasting use token-wise routing, which may not effectively capture temporal patterns.

Method: Seg-MoE routes contiguous time-step segments instead of independent tokens, aligning with inherent temporal dynamics.

Result: Seg-MoE outperforms dense Transformers and token-wise MoE models across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Segment-level routing aligns with temporal structure, offering a powerful inductive bias for sparse architectures in sequential data.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have recently made significant advances in accurate time-series forecasting, but even these architectures struggle to scale efficiently while capturing long-term temporal dynamics. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are a proven solution to scaling problems in natural language processing. However, existing MoE approaches for time-series forecasting rely on token-wise routing mechanisms, which may fail to exploit the natural locality and continuity of temporal data. In this work, we introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than making independent expert decisions. Token segments allow each expert to model intra-segment interactions directly, naturally aligning with inherent temporal patterns. We integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate it on multiple multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks. Seg-MoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across almost all prediction horizons, outperforming both dense Transformers and prior token-wise MoE models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm that segment-level routing is the key factor driving these gains. Our results show that aligning the MoE routing granularity with the inherent structure of time series provides a powerful, yet previously underexplored, inductive bias, opening new avenues for conditionally sparse architectures in sequential data modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the connection between end-to-end and layerwise equivariance in neural networks, proving that equivariant layers can achieve the same end-to-end function under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mathematically explain why equivariant structures naturally emerge in neural network weights during training, a phenomenon often observed empirically.

Method: The study uses an abstract formalism to analyze equivariance, assuming identifiable parameters and applying to a broad class of networks.

Result: There exists a parameter choice where layers are equivariant under group actions while maintaining the same end-to-end equivariant function.

Conclusion: The findings provide theoretical justification for the practical observation of equivariant structures in trained neural networks.

Abstract: We investigate the relation between end-to-end equivariance and layerwise equivariance in deep neural networks. We prove the following: For a network whose end-to-end function is equivariant with respect to group actions on the input and output spaces, there is a parameter choice yielding the same end-to-end function such that its layers are equivariant with respect to some group actions on the latent spaces. Our result assumes that the parameters of the model are identifiable in an appropriate sense. This identifiability property has been established in the literature for a large class of networks, to which our results apply immediately, while it is conjectural for others. The theory we develop is grounded in an abstract formalism, and is therefore architecture-agnostic. Overall, our results provide a mathematical explanation for the emergence of equivariant structures in the weights of neural networks during training -- a phenomenon that is consistently observed in practice.

*Vasileios Sevetlidis,George Pavlidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces representation holonomy, a gauge-invariant statistic to measure path dependence in deep network representations, addressing limitations of existing similarity metrics like CKA or SVCCA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing similarity measures fail to capture how representations change along input paths, missing important geometric properties that affect generalization and robustness.

Method: The authors propose representation holonomy, which quantifies feature 'twist' along input loops. They use global whitening, shared subspaces, and rotation-only Procrustes to align neighborhoods and embed results back into feature space.

Result: Holonomy separates models that appear similar under CKA, correlates with robustness, and tracks training dynamics. It is invariant to transformations and scales with loop radius.

Conclusion: Representation holonomy serves as a practical diagnostic tool for analyzing geometric structure in learned representations, offering insights beyond pointwise similarity.

Abstract: Deep networks learn internal representations whose geometry--how features bend, rotate, and evolve--affects both generalization and robustness. Existing similarity measures such as CKA or SVCCA capture pointwise overlap between activation sets, but miss how representations change along input paths. Two models may appear nearly identical under these metrics yet respond very differently to perturbations or adversarial stress. We introduce representation holonomy, a gauge-invariant statistic that measures this path dependence. Conceptually, holonomy quantifies the "twist" accumulated when features are parallel-transported around a small loop in input space: flat representations yield zero holonomy, while nonzero values reveal hidden curvature. Our estimator fixes gauge through global whitening, aligns neighborhoods using shared subspaces and rotation-only Procrustes, and embeds the result back to the full feature space. We prove invariance to orthogonal (and affine, post-whitening) transformations, establish a linear null for affine layers, and show that holonomy vanishes at small radii. Empirically, holonomy increases with loop radius, separates models that appear similar under CKA, and correlates with adversarial and corruption robustness. It also tracks training dynamics as features form and stabilize. Together, these results position representation holonomy as a practical and scalable diagnostic for probing the geometric structure of learned representations beyond pointwise similarity.

TL;DR: TabClustPFN is a prior-fitted network for clustering tabular data, leveraging amortized Bayesian inference for cluster assignments and cardinality, outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering tabular data is challenging due to heterogeneous features and lack of transferable inductive biases. Prior-fitted networks (PFNs) show promise in supervised tabular learning, motivating their extension to unsupervised clustering.

Method: TabClustPFN uses amortized Bayesian inference over cluster assignments and cardinality, pretrained on synthetic datasets from a flexible clustering prior. It handles heterogeneous features and requires no dataset-specific tuning.

Result: TabClustPFN outperforms classical, deep, and amortized clustering baselines on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing robustness in exploratory settings.

Conclusion: TabClustPFN successfully extends PFNs to clustering, offering efficient, out-of-the-box performance for tabular data with diverse structures.

Abstract: Clustering tabular data is a fundamental yet challenging problem due to heterogeneous feature types, diverse data-generating mechanisms, and the absence of transferable inductive biases across datasets. Prior-fitted networks (PFNs) have recently demonstrated strong generalization in supervised tabular learning by amortizing Bayesian inference under a broad synthetic prior. Extending this paradigm to clustering is nontrivial: clustering is unsupervised, admits a combinatorial and permutation-invariant output space, and requires inferring the number of clusters. We introduce TabClustPFN, a prior-fitted network for tabular data clustering that performs amortized Bayesian inference over both cluster assignments and cluster cardinality. Pretrained on synthetic datasets drawn from a flexible clustering prior, TabClustPFN clusters unseen datasets in a single forward pass, without dataset-specific retraining or hyperparameter tuning. The model naturally handles heterogeneous numerical and categorical features and adapts to a wide range of clustering structures. Experiments on synthetic data and curated real-world tabular benchmarks show that TabClustPFN outperforms classical, deep, and amortized clustering baselines, while exhibiting strong robustness in out-of-the-box exploratory settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs lack intrinsic mechanisms to quantify epistemic uncertainty, which reflects the model's ignorance of its own representations.

Method: REPVLM computes probability density on the hyperspherical manifold of VLM embeddings using Riemannian Flow Matching.

Result: Achieves near-perfect correlation between uncertainty and prediction error, surpassing existing baselines.

Conclusion: Beyond classification, REPVLM provides scalable metrics for out-of-distribution detection and automated data curation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are typically deterministic in nature and lack intrinsic mechanisms to quantify epistemic uncertainty, which reflects the model's lack of knowledge or ignorance of its own representations. We theoretically motivate negative log-density of an embedding as a proxy for the epistemic uncertainty, where low-density regions signify model ignorance. The proposed method REPVLM computes the probability density on the hyperspherical manifold of the VLM embeddings using Riemannian Flow Matching. We empirically demonstrate that REPVLM achieves near-perfect correlation between uncertainty and prediction error, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Beyond classification, we also demonstrate that the model also provides a scalable metric for out-of-distribution detection and automated data curation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in bridging the gap between data-rich training and observation-sparse deployment, especially when target domains exhibit distributional shifts and multi-scale dynamics.

Method: SENDAI combines simulation-derived priors with learned discrepancy corrections to reconstruct full spatial states from sparse observations.

Result: It achieves significant improvements (185% SSIM over traditional baselines, 36% over recent methods) and preserves diagnostically relevant structures like land cover discontinuities.

Conclusion: SENDAI offers a lightweight, operationally viable solution for sparse-measurement reconstruction, suitable for real-time monitoring and physically grounded inference.

Abstract: Bridging the gap between data-rich training regimes and observation-sparse deployment conditions remains a central challenge in spatiotemporal field reconstruction, particularly when target domains exhibit distributional shifts, heterogeneous structure, and multi-scale dynamics absent from available training data. We present SENDAI, a hierarchical Sparse-measurement, EfficieNt Data AssImilation Framework that reconstructs full spatial states from hyper sparse sensor observations by combining simulation-derived priors with learned discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on satellite remote sensing, reconstructing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived vegetation index fields across six globally distributed sites. Using seasonal periods as a proxy for domain shift, the framework consistently outperforms established baselines that require substantially denser observations -- SENDAI achieves a maximum SSIM improvement of 185% over traditional baselines and a 36% improvement over recent high-frequency-based methods. These gains are particularly pronounced for landscapes with sharp boundaries and sub-seasonal dynamics; more importantly, the framework effectively preserves diagnostically relevant structures -- such as field topologies, land cover discontinuities, and spatial gradients. By yielding corrections that are more structurally and spectrally separable, the reconstructed fields are better suited for downstream inference of indirectly observed variables. The results therefore highlight a lightweight and operationally viable framework for sparse-measurement reconstruction that is applicable to physically grounded inference, resource-limited deployment, and real-time monitor and control.

### [286] [Expected Return Causes Outcome-Level Mode Collapse in Reinforcement Learning and How to Fix It with Inverse Probability Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21669)
*Abhijeet Sinha,Sundari Elango,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses mode collapse in reinforcement learning (RL) by identifying the expected-return objective as the root cause and proposing inverse probability scaling (IPS) to prevent collapse, leading to diverse high-quality outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL objectives collapse onto a small subset of outcomes despite multiple viable solutions, attributed to structural flaws in the expected-return objective rather than exploration or regularization.

Method: The authors propose inverse probability scaling (IPS) to modify the learning signal, eliminating outcome-frequency amplification. This is implemented in IPS-GRPO as a drop-in solution without auxiliary models.

Result: IPS-GRPO effectively reduces mode collapse across reasoning and molecular generation tasks while maintaining or improving performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Correcting the RL objective via IPS, rather than relying on exploration heuristics, is key to achieving reliable multimodal policy optimization.

Abstract: Many reinforcement learning (RL) problems admit multiple terminal solutions of comparable quality, where the goal is not to identify a single optimum but to represent a diverse set of high-quality outcomes. Nevertheless, policies trained by standard expected return maximization routinely collapse onto a small subset of outcomes, a phenomenon commonly attributed to insufficient exploration or weak regularization. We show that this explanation is incomplete: outcome level mode collapse is a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself. Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings. We instantiate this principle in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, requiring no auxiliary models or architectural changes. Across different reasoning and molecular generation tasks, IPS-GRPO consistently reduces outcome-level mode collapse while matching or exceeding baseline performance, suggesting that correcting the objective rather than adding exploration heuristics is key to reliable multimodal policy optimization.

TL;DR: LLM4Fluid uses LLMs as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics, achieving high accuracy without retraining by compressing flow fields and aligning modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches struggle with generalization and require retraining for new scenarios.

Method: Compresses flow fields into a latent space, uses pretrained LLMs for temporal prediction, and aligns modalities to bridge gaps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities across diverse flows.

Conclusion: LLM4Fluid is a robust, generalizable framework for spatio-temporal fluid dynamics prediction.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for spatio-temporal modeling of fluid dynamics. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited generalization to unseen flow conditions and typically require retraining when applied to new scenarios. In this paper, we present LLM4Fluid, a spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics. The framework first compresses high-dimensional flow fields into a compact latent space via reduced-order modeling enhanced with a physics-informed disentanglement mechanism, effectively mitigating spatial feature entanglement while preserving essential flow structures. A pretrained LLM then serves as a temporal processor, autoregressively predicting the dynamics of physical sequences with time series prompts. To bridge the modality gap between prompts and physical sequences, which can otherwise degrade prediction accuracy, we propose a dedicated modality alignment strategy that resolves representational mismatch and stabilizes long-term prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse flow scenarios demonstrate that LLM4Fluid functions as a robust and generalizable neural solver without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while exhibiting powerful zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Local-SSL algorithms can approximate global BP-SSL updates in deep networks, with improved performance matching InfoNCE/CPC-like global methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between global BP-SSL and local-SSL theories to enable functional representations in deep neural networks.

Method: Develop theoretical conditions for local-SSL algorithms to match global BP-SSL updates in linear networks, then extend to non-linear CNNs.

Result: Local-SSL variants with better gradient update similarity to global BP-SSL perform better on image datasets (CIFAR-10, STL-10, Tiny ImageNet).

Conclusion: The best local-SSL rule matches global BP-SSL performance, surpassing state-of-the-art local SSL benchmarks.

Abstract: While end-to-end self-supervised learning with backpropagation (global BP-SSL) has become central for training modern AI systems, theories of local self-supervised learning (local-SSL) have struggled to build functional representations in deep neural networks. To establish a link between global and local rules, we first develop a theory for deep linear networks: we identify conditions for local-SSL algorithms (like Forward-forward or CLAPP) to implement exactly the same weight update as a global BP-SSL. Starting from the theoretical insights, we then develop novel variants of local-SSL algorithms to approximate global BP-SSL in deep non-linear convolutional neural networks. Variants that improve the similarity between gradient updates of local-SSL with those of global BP-SSL also show better performance on image datasets (CIFAR-10, STL-10, and Tiny ImageNet). The best local-SSL rule with the CLAPP loss function matches the performance of a comparable global BP-SSL with InfoNCE or CPC-like loss functions, and improves upon state-of-the-art for local SSL on these benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StiefAttention introduces orthonormal projection bases for KV-cache compression, directly minimizing decoder-layer output reconstruction error, outperforming EigenAttention in perplexity and accuracy at iso-compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV-cache compression methods use SVD-style proxy objectives, which poorly reflect end-to-end reconstruction post transformations.

Method: StiefAttention learns orthonormal projection bases by minimizing decoder-layer output reconstruction error and precomputes error-rank profiles for flexible rank allocation.

Result: On Llama3-8B, StiefAttention outperforms EigenAttention by 11.9 points on C4 perplexity and 5.4% on 0-shot MMLU accuracy at iso-compression.

Conclusion: StiefAttention offers improved performance in KV-cache compression with lower error and higher similarity to original outputs.

Abstract: Key--value (KV) caching enables fast autoregressive decoding but at long contexts becomes a dominant bottleneck in High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) capacity and bandwidth. A common mitigation is to compress cached keys and values by projecting per-head matrixes to a lower rank, storing only the projections in the HBM. However, existing post-training approaches typically fit these projections using SVD-style proxy objectives, which may poorly reflect end-to-end reconstruction after softmax, value mixing, and subsequent decoder-layer transformations.
  For these reasons, we introduce StiefAttention, a post-training KV-cache compression method that learns \emph{orthonormal} projection bases by directly minimizing \emph{decoder-layer output reconstruction error}. StiefAttention additionally precomputes, for each layer, an error-rank profile over candidate ranks, enabling flexible layer-wise rank allocation under a user-specified error budget. Noteworthy, on Llama3-8B under the same conditions, StiefAttention outperforms EigenAttention by $11.9$ points on C4 perplexity and $5.4\%$ on 0-shot MMLU accuracy at iso-compression, yielding lower relative error and higher cosine similarity with respect to the original decoder-layer outputs.

*Alexandre Myara,Nicolas Bourriez,Thomas Boyer,Thomas Lemercier,Ihab Bendidi,Auguste Genovesio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XFactors is a weakly-supervised VAE framework that disentangles and controls specific factors using contrastive supervision and KL regularization, achieving state-of-the-art results without adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised methods struggle with real data, while supervised methods are unstable and hard to scale. XFactors addresses these limitations by combining weak supervision with structured regularization.

Method: The framework decomposes representations into factor-specific and residual subspaces, using InfoNCE loss for contrastive supervision and KL regularization for structure.

Result: XFactors outperforms existing methods in disentanglement scores and factor alignment, scaling well with latent capacity and performing effectively on real-world data like CelebA.

Conclusion: XFactors provides a scalable, stable, and effective solution for disentangled representation learning without relying on adversarial objectives or classifiers.

Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to map independent factors of variation to independent representation components. On one hand, purely unsupervised approaches have proven successful on fully disentangled synthetic data, but fail to recover semantic factors from real data without strong inductive biases. On the other hand, supervised approaches are unstable and hard to scale to large attribute sets because they rely on adversarial objectives or auxiliary classifiers.
  We introduce \textsc{XFactors}, a weakly-supervised VAE framework that disentangles and provides explicit control over a chosen set of factors. Building on the Disentangled Information Bottleneck perspective, we decompose the representation into a residual subspace $\mathcal{S}$ and factor-specific subspaces $\mathcal{T}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{T}_K$ and a residual subspace $\mathcal{S}$. Each target factor is encoded in its assigned $\mathcal{T}_i$ through contrastive supervision: an InfoNCE loss pulls together latents sharing the same factor value and pushes apart mismatched pairs. In parallel, KL regularization imposes a Gaussian structure on both $\mathcal{S}$ and the aggregated factor subspaces, organizing the geometry without additional supervision for non-targeted factors and avoiding adversarial training and classifiers.
  Across multiple datasets, with constant hyperparameters, \textsc{XFactors} achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement scores and yields consistent qualitative factor alignment in the corresponding subspaces, enabling controlled factor swapping via latent replacement. We further demonstrate that our method scales correctly with increasing latent capacity and evaluate it on the real-world dataset CelebA.

*Qinglun Li,Anke Tang,Miao Zhang,Mengzhu Wang,Quanjun Yin,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of theory behind model merging under heterogeneous hyperparameters and provides actionable recommendations for practitioners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite empirical success, there's no unified theory for model merging under varying hyperparameters, and open-source models lack transparency, making merged-model performance unpredictable.

Method: The authors employ $L_2$-Stability theory under heterogeneous hyperparameter environments to analyze generalization in merged models.

Result: The analysis yields a theoretical framework explaining merging algorithms and offers recommendations for fine-tuning merge-friendly models. Experiments confirm theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The paper bridges theory and practice in model merging, providing actionable insights for practitioners.

Abstract: Model merging efficiently aggregates capabilities from multiple fine-tuned models into a single one, operating purely in parameter space without original data or expensive re-computation. Despite empirical successes, a unified theory for its effectiveness under heterogeneous finetuning hyperparameters (e.g., varying learning rates, batch sizes) remains missing. Moreover, the lack of hyperparameter transparency in open-source fine-tuned models makes it difficult to predict merged-model performance, leaving practitioners without guidance on how to fine-tune merge-friendly experts. To address those two challenges, we employ $L_2$-Stability theory under heterogeneous hyperparameter environments to analyze the generalization of the merged model $\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$. This pioneering analysis yields two key contributions: (i) \textit{A unified theoretical framework} is provided to explain existing merging algorithms, revealing how they optimize specific terms in our bound, thus offering a strong theoretical foundation for empirical observations. (ii) \textit{Actionable recommendations} are proposed for practitioners to strategically fine-tune expert models, enabling the construction of merge-friendly models within the pretraining-to-finetuning pipeline. Extensive experiments on the ResNet/Vit family across 20/8 visual classification tasks, involving thousands of finetuning models, robustly confirm the impact of different hyperparameters on the generalization of $\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$ predicted by our theoretical results.

*Mohamed Elgaar,Hadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Curriculum learning impacts data exposure timing but not the overall learning trajectory. It stabilizes optimization in smaller models, though benefits diminish at larger scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether curriculum learning alters the learning trajectory or merely reorders data exposure within a fixed trajectory.

Method: Train Pythia models (14M-410M parameters) under three curricula (Age-of-Acquisition, word frequency, Verb Variation) and compare against Random ordering, analyzing gradient noise and spectral saturation.

Result: Training follows a shared sequence of latent phases regardless of order; curricula stabilize optimization in smaller models but show reduced gains at larger scales.

Conclusion: Curricula help by stabilizing within-phase optimization, not by introducing new phases, with diminishing benefits as model size increases.

Abstract: Curriculum learning changes the order of pre-training data, but it remains unclear whether it changes the learning trajectory or mainly reorders exposure over a fixed trajectory. We train Pythia models (14M-410M parameters) for 300B tokens under three linguistically motivated curricula-Age-of-Acquisition, word frequency, and Verb Variation (VV)-and compare each against Random ordering; at 1B parameters we compare Random and VV. Across orderings, training follows a shared sequence of latent phases, while curricula mainly change within-phase data exposure. In smaller models (up to 160M parameters), Random ordering exhibits higher gradient noise and stronger late-training output-head spectral saturation, alongside lower final accuracy; curricula reduce both effects at matched compute. At larger scales, saturation differences are smaller and curriculum gains shrink. We formalize the link between difficulty pacing and optimization stability in an idealized analysis based on gradient-variance control, and our results point to a practical takeaway: curricula help by stabilizing within-phase optimization rather than by creating new phases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified flow matching model for various smart meter data generative tasks like synthetic data generation, imputation, and super-resolution, eliminating redundancy and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart meter data is crucial but often unavailable or corrupted due to privacy and technical issues. Current machine learning solutions require task-specific models, leading to inefficiency.

Method: The authors use flow matching models trained for conditional generation, treating different tasks as partial data observations injected into a single model.

Result: The unified model generates realistic and consistent data, outperforming task-specific interpolation and machine learning baselines.

Conclusion: Flow matching models effectively unify diverse generative tasks for smart meter data, reducing redundancy and enhancing performance.

Abstract: Smart meter data is the foundation for planning and operating the distribution network. Unfortunately, such data are not always available due to privacy regulations. Meanwhile, the collected data may be corrupted due to sensor or transmission failure, or it may not have sufficient resolution for downstream tasks. A wide range of generative tasks is formulated to address these issues, including synthetic data generation, missing data imputation, and super-resolution. Despite the success of machine learning models on these tasks, dedicated models need to be designed and trained for each task, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this paper, by recognizing the powerful modeling capability of flow matching models, we propose a new approach to unify diverse smart meter data generative tasks with a single model trained for conditional generation. The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training. The data generated by our model not only are consistent with the given observations but also remain realistic, showing better performance against interpolation and other machine learning based baselines dedicated to the tasks.

TL;DR: PIDM outperforms BC due to a bias-variance tradeoff; theory and experiments show PIDM requires fewer demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BC struggles with limited expert data, and PIDM's advantages lack clear explanation.

Method: Theoretical analysis of PIDM's bias-variance tradeoff, validated empirically in 2D and 3D tasks.

Result: PIDM reduces prediction error and increases sample efficiency, needing fewer demos than BC.

Conclusion: PIDM is superior to BC, especially with limited data, due to its bias-variance tradeoff.

Abstract: Behavior cloning (BC) is a practical offline imitation learning method, but it often fails when expert demonstrations are limited. Recent works have introduced a class of architectures named predictive inverse dynamics models (PIDM) that combine a future state predictor with an inverse dynamics model (IDM). While PIDM often outperforms BC, the reasons behind its benefits remain unclear. In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation: PIDM introduces a bias-variance tradeoff. While predicting the future state introduces bias, conditioning the IDM on the prediction can significantly reduce variance. We establish conditions on the state predictor bias for PIDM to achieve lower prediction error and higher sample efficiency than BC, with the gap widening when additional data sources are available. We validate the theoretical insights empirically in 2D navigation tasks, where BC requires up to five times (three times on average) more demonstrations than PIDM to reach comparable performance; and in a complex 3D environment in a modern video game with high-dimensional visual inputs and stochastic transitions, where BC requires over 66\% more samples than PIDM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Wishart projection mechanism for differential privacy (DP), showing it works for vector-valued queries without additive noise but fails for matrix-valued queries without noise. A noisy variant amplifies privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether Wishart randomness alone can ensure DP for vector and matrix queries, and to analyze privacy amplification in noisy settings.

Method: Introduces Wishart projection mechanism, analyzes DP guarantees for noise-free and noisy variants, and implements attacks.

Result: Wishart randomness suffices for vector queries; matrix queries require noise for DP. Noisy variants offer stronger privacy.

Conclusion: The mechanism's privacy varies by query type; LoRA-style updates lack inherent privacy but can be private with noise.

Abstract: We introduce the (Wishart) projection mechanism, a randomized map of the form $S \mapsto M f(S)$ with $M \sim W_d(1/r I_d, r)$ and study its differential privacy properties. For vector-valued queries $f$, we prove non-asymptotic DP guarantees without any additive noise, showing that Wishart randomness alone can suffice. For matrix-valued queries, however, we establish a sharp negative result: in the noise-free setting, the mechanism is not DP, and we demonstrate its vulnerability by implementing a near perfect membership inference attack (AUC $> 0.99$). We then analyze a noisy variant and prove privacy amplification due to randomness and low rank projection, in both large- and small-rank regimes, yielding stronger privacy guarantees than additive noise alone. Finally, we show that LoRA-style updates are an instance of the matrix-valued mechanism, implying that LoRA is not inherently private despite its built-in randomness, but that low-rank fine-tuning can be more private than full fine-tuning at the same noise level. Preliminary experiments suggest that tighter accounting enables lower noise and improved accuracy in practice.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to make PFNs more interpretable by extracting explicit spectral densities and kernels, improving efficiency and utility in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFNs lack transparency in their learned priors and kernels, limiting their use in tasks requiring explicit covariance models. The paper aims to address this opacity.

Method: The framework analyzes PFN attention latents to link function data to spectral structure. It proposes decoders to map latents to spectral density estimates and kernels using Bochner's theorem.

Result: The decoders recover complex spectral mixtures and produce kernels for efficient Gaussian process regression, matching PFN accuracy but with faster inference.

Conclusion: The approach provides interpretable, efficient inference with significant speed improvements over optimization-based methods, enhancing PFN utility in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) enable efficient amortized inference but lack transparent access to their learned priors and kernels. This opacity hinders their use in downstream tasks, such as surrogate-based optimization, that require explicit covariance models. We introduce an interpretability-driven framework for amortized spectral discovery from pre-trained PFNs with decoupled attention. We perform a mechanistic analysis on a trained PFN that identifies attention latent output as the key intermediary, linking observed function data to spectral structure. Building on this insight, we propose decoder architectures that map PFN latents to explicit spectral density estimates and corresponding stationary kernels via Bochner's theorem. We study this pipeline in both single-realization and multi-realization regimes, contextualizing theoretical limits on spectral identifiability and proving consistency when multiple function samples are available. Empirically, the proposed decoders recover complex multi-peak spectral mixtures and produce explicit kernels that support Gaussian process regression with accuracy comparable to PFNs and optimization-based baselines, while requiring only a single forward pass. This yields orders-of-magnitude reductions in inference time compared to optimization-based baselines.

TL;DR: A mixed-precision training and compilation framework using reinforcement learning improves efficiency in Computing-in-Memory accelerators for ML workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the limitations of current CIM compilers that lack support for quantization below 8 bits, leading to inefficiency in MVM operations.

Method: Proposes a reinforcement learning-based strategy to navigate the large search space for optimal quantization configurations, balancing latency and accuracy.

Result: Achieves up to a 2.48x speedup with minimal accuracy loss (0.086%) compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances CIM accelerator performance by optimizing quantization parameters.

Abstract: Computing-in-Memory (CIM) accelerators are a promising solution for accelerating Machine Learning (ML) workloads, as they perform Matrix-Vector Multiplications (MVMs) on crossbar arrays directly in memory. Although the bit widths of the crossbar inputs and cells are very limited, most CIM compilers do not support quantization below 8 bit. As a result, a single MVM requires many compute cycles, and weights cannot be efficiently stored in a single crossbar cell. To address this problem, we propose a mixed-precision training and compilation framework for CIM architectures. The biggest challenge is the massive search space, that makes it difficult to find good quantization parameters. This is why we introduce a reinforcement learning-based strategy to find suitable quantization configurations that balance latency and accuracy. In the best case, our approach achieves up to a 2.48x speedup over existing state-of-the-art solutions, with an accuracy loss of only 0.086 %.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explains why setting $β₁ = β₂$ in Adam optimizer improves validation scores and training behavior, linking it to gradient scale invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the unexplained empirical observation that Adam performs better when momentum parameters $β₁$ and $β₂$ are equal.

Method: The authors formalize the concept of gradient scale invariance and prove Adam achieves it only when $β₁ = β₂$. Experiments across vision and language tasks support the theory.

Result: Balanced momentum parameters ($β₁ = β₂$) lead to smoother updates and better performance, aligning with scale-robust optimizer designs.

Conclusion: The findings provide a coherent explanation for Adam's behavior and a principle for designing future optimizers.

Abstract: Adam has been at the core of large-scale training for almost a decade, yet a simple empirical fact remains unaccounted for: both validation scores and the qualitative behaviour of the training runs improve when the momentum parameters satisfy $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Some recent studies have reported this pattern, but there is still no explanation for why this choice helps. We show that this choice is closely tied to a structural property that we refer to as \textit{gradient scale invariance}. We formalize this notion and prove that Adam becomes gradient scale invariant of first order if and only if $β_{1}=β_{2}$. This perspective places the balanced regime of Adam in direct alignment with the design principles underlying several recent optimizers that explicitly enforce scale-robust updates. The theory is supported by experiments across vision and language tasks, and across different architectural families, in which rescaling the gradient has a markedly smoother effect on the update when $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Overall, our results offer a coherent explanation for an open question in the behavior of Adam and provide a simple principle that helps guide the design of future optimizers.

TL;DR: A relational machine learning framework improves sepsis prediction interpretability by flattening EMR data and using a Bayesian classifier, offering four interpretability levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sepsis prediction lacks interpretability and ignores patient sub-phenotypes, despite deep learning models' early prediction success.

Method: Relational data schema represents EMRs; propositionalisation flattens data into interpretable features classified with a naive Bayesian classifier.

Result: The framework demonstrates high interpretability (univariate, global, local, counterfactual) in experimental validation.

Conclusion: The relational approach enhances sepsis prediction interpretability, addressing heterogeneity in patient responses.

Abstract: Sepsis remains one of the most complex and heterogeneous syndromes in intensive care, characterized by diverse physiological trajectories and variable responses to treatment. While deep learning models perform well in the early prediction of sepsis, they often lack interpretability and ignore latent patient sub-phenotypes. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework by opening up a new avenue for addressing this issue: a relational approach. Temporal data from electronic medical records (EMRs) are viewed as multivariate patient logs and represented in a relational data schema. Then, a propositionalisation technique (based on classic aggregation/selection functions from the field of relational data) is applied to construct interpretable features to "flatten" the data. Finally, the flattened data is classified using a selective naive Bayesian classifier. Experimental validation demonstrates the relevance of the suggested approach as well as its extreme interpretability. The interpretation is fourfold: univariate, global, local, and counterfactual.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of integrating piecewise constant operators like Knapsack and Top-k into neural networks due to their zero gradients almost everywhere motivates the need for differentiable relaxations.

Method: The authors propose smoothing the underlying recursions of dynamic programs to create differentiable relaxations, along with efficient parallel algorithms for both deterministic and stochastic forward passes and vector-Jacobian products for backpropagation.

Result: The framework is theoretically validated, showing Shannon entropy as the unique regularization for permutation-equivariant operators, and practical applications are demonstrated in decision-focused learning, dynamic assortment RL, and discrete VAEs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between discrete operators and neural networks, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical utility across various applications.

Abstract: Knapsack and Top-k operators are useful for selecting discrete subsets of variables. However, their integration into neural networks is challenging as they are piecewise constant, yielding gradients that are zero almost everywhere. In this paper, we propose a unified framework casting these operators as dynamic programs, and derive differentiable relaxations by smoothing the underlying recursions. On the algorithmic side, we develop efficient parallel algorithms supporting both deterministic and stochastic forward passes, and vector-Jacobian products for the backward pass. On the theoretical side, we prove that Shannon entropy is the unique regularization choice yielding permutation-equivariant operators, and characterize regularizers inducing sparse selections. Finally, on the experimental side, we demonstrate our framework on a decision-focused learning benchmark, a constrained dynamic assortment RL problem, and an extension of discrete VAEs.

Motivation: Existing hybrid quantum-classical models lack modularity and generality, limiting transferability and clarity. This work aims to provide a flexible, principled framework for analyzing and composing hybrid learning systems.

Result: The framework demonstrates stable optimization, reduced sensitivity to qubit count, and noise robustness in quantum dot classification tasks.

Conclusion: Quantum LEGO Learning offers a scalable, modular approach for hybrid models, with theoretical and empirical support for its advantages in constrained quantum settings.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical learning models increasingly integrate neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to exploit complementary inductive biases. However, many existing approaches rely on tightly coupled architectures or task-specific encoders, limiting conceptual clarity, generality, and transferability across learning settings. In this work, we introduce Quantum LEGO Learning, a modular and architecture-agnostic learning framework that treats classical and quantum components as reusable, composable learning blocks with well-defined roles. Within this framework, a pre-trained classical neural network serves as a frozen feature block, while a VQC acts as a trainable adaptive module that operates on structured representations rather than raw inputs. This separation enables efficient learning under constrained quantum resources and provides a principled abstraction for analyzing hybrid models. We develop a block-wise generalization theory that decomposes learning error into approximation and estimation components, explicitly characterizing how the complexity and training status of each block influence overall performance. Our analysis generalizes prior tensor-network-specific results and identifies conditions under which quantum modules provide representational advantages over comparably sized classical heads. Empirically, we validate the framework through systematic block-swap experiments across frozen feature extractors and both quantum and classical adaptive heads. Experiments on quantum dot classification demonstrate stable optimization, reduced sensitivity to qubit count, and robustness to realistic noise.

*Adia Lumadjeng,Ilker Birbil,Erman Acar*

TL;DR: ECSEL is an explainable classification method using signomial equations, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in symbolic regression benchmarks with high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The method is motivated by the compact signomial structure observed in symbolic regression benchmarks, aiming to provide both classification and explanation through closed-form expressions.

Method: ECSEL constructs structural, closed-form signomial equations directly, serving as classifiers and explanations. It focuses on efficiency and interpretability.

Result: ECSEL recovers more target equations than competitors with less computation, achieves competitive classification accuracy, and satisfies desirable properties like global feature behavior and local feature attributions.

Conclusion: ECSEL demonstrates practical utility in benchmark datasets and real-world case studies (e-commerce and fraud detection), exposing biases and enabling actionable insights.

Abstract: We introduce ECSEL, an explainable classification method that learns formal expressions in the form of signomial equations, motivated by the observation that many symbolic regression benchmarks admit compact signomial structure. ECSEL directly constructs a structural, closed-form expression that serves as both a classifier and an explanation. On standard symbolic regression benchmarks, our method recovers a larger fraction of target equations than competing state-of-the-art approaches while requiring substantially less computation. Leveraging this efficiency, ECSEL achieves classification accuracy competitive with established machine learning models without sacrificing interpretability. Further, we show that ECSEL satisfies some desirable properties regarding global feature behavior, decision-boundary analysis, and local feature attributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets and two real-world case studies i.e., e-commerce and fraud detection, demonstrate that the learned equations expose dataset biases, support counterfactual reasoning, and yield actionable insights.

TL;DR: NetMamba+ is a framework for efficient and accurate network traffic classification, addressing challenges like computational inefficiency, biased representations, and long-tail distributions. It outperforms baselines in performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of encrypted network traffic necessitates effective classification for security and QoS management, but current methods face inefficiency and bias issues.

Method: NetMamba+ uses an efficient Mamba and Flash Attention architecture, multimodal traffic representation, and label distribution-aware fine-tuning.

Result: It achieves up to 6.44% higher F1 scores, 1.7x higher throughput, and robust few-shot learning and real-world performance.

Conclusion: NetMamba+ offers efficient, accurate traffic analysis, pioneering the use of Mamba architecture in this domain.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of encrypted network traffic, effective traffic classification has become essential for network security and quality of service management. Current machine learning and deep learning approaches for traffic classification face three critical challenges: computational inefficiency of Transformer architectures, inadequate traffic representations with loss of crucial byte-level features while retaining detrimental biases, and poor handling of long-tail distributions in real-world data. We propose NetMamba+, a framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1) an efficient architecture considering Mamba and Flash Attention mechanisms, (2) a multimodal traffic representation scheme that preserves essential traffic information while eliminating biases, and (3) a label distribution-aware fine-tuning strategy. Evaluation experiments on massive datasets encompassing four main classification tasks showcase NetMamba+'s superior classification performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements of up to 6.44\% in F1 score. Moreover, NetMamba+ demonstrates excellent efficiency, achieving 1.7x higher inference throughput than the best baseline while maintaining comparably low memory usage. Furthermore, NetMamba+ exhibits superior few-shot learning abilities, achieving better classification performance with fewer labeled data. Additionally, we implement an online traffic classification system that demonstrates robust real-world performance with a throughput of 261.87 Mb/s. As the first framework to adapt Mamba architecture for network traffic classification, NetMamba+ opens new possibilities for efficient and accurate traffic analysis in complex network environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and harmful content concerns in LVLMs without relying on costly gradient-based unlearning.

Method: KVW intervenes directly in the model by weakening knowledge vectors activated on forget sets.

Result: KVW achieves stable forget-retain trade-offs and outperforms gradient-based and LoRA-based methods in efficiency.

Conclusion: KVW offers a computationally efficient solution for removing unwanted knowledge from LVLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are widely adopted for their strong multimodal capabilities, yet they raise serious concerns such as privacy leakage and harmful content generation. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for removing the influence of specific data from trained models. However, existing approaches largely rely on gradient-based optimization, incurring substantial computational costs for large-scale LVLMs. To address this limitation, we propose Knowledge Vector Weakening (KVW), a training-free unlearning method that directly intervenes in the full model without gradient computation. KVW identifies knowledge vectors that are activated during the model's output generation on the forget set and progressively weakens their contributions, thereby preventing the model from exploiting undesirable knowledge. Experiments on the MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that KVW achieves a stable forget-retain trade-off while significantly improving computational efficiency over gradient-based and LoRA-based unlearning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently selecting and composing LoRA adapters for diverse tasks without requiring adapter training data.

Method: LORAUTER routes queries via task embeddings derived from validation sets, operating at the task level for scalability.

Result: Outperforms baselines, matches Oracle performance (101.2%) with aligned adapters, and achieves +5.2 points on unseen tasks. Scales to 1500+ adapters.

Conclusion: LORAUTER provides efficient, scalable routing for LoRA adapters, demonstrating robustness and superior performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enables parameter efficient specialization of large language models (LLMs) through modular adapters, resulting in rapidly growing public adapter pools spanning diverse tasks. Effectively using these adapters requires routing: selecting and composing the appropriate adapters for a query. We introduce LORAUTER, a novel routing framework that selects and composes LoRA adapters using task representations rather than adapter characteristics. Unlike existing approaches that map queries directly to adapters, LORAUTER routes queries via task embeddings derived from small validation sets and does not require adapter training data. By operating at the task level, LORAUTER achieves efficient routing that scales with the number of tasks rather than the number of adapters. Experiments across multiple tasks show that LORAUTER consistently outperforms baseline routing approaches, matching Oracle performance (101.2%) when task-aligned adapters exist and achieving state-of-the-art results on unseen tasks (+5.2 points). We further demonstrate the robustness of LORAUTER to very large, noisy adapter pools by scaling it to over 1500 adapters.

TL;DR: DMLEval is a nonparametric framework for ranking LLMs using debiased machine learning, accommodating complex human responses and offering efficient estimates, flexibility with ML methods, and optimal data collection policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating LLMs from preference data either impose restrictive assumptions or lack proper uncertainty quantification. DMLEval addresses these limitations.

Method: The paper introduces generalized average ranking scores (GARS) and uses debiased machine learning (DML) to rank LLMs, supporting flexible modeling and human responses like ties.

Result: DMLEval provides statistically efficient estimates, integrates black-box ML methods, works with LLM evaluators, and suggests optimal data collection policies.

Conclusion: DMLEval offers advanced tools for ranking LLMs, combining flexibility, efficiency, and practicality for real-world applications.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) from human preference data is crucial for obtaining LLM leaderboards. However, many existing approaches either rely on restrictive parametric assumptions or lack valid uncertainty quantification when flexible machine learning methods are used. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric statistical framework, DMLEval, for comparing and ranking LLMs from preference data using debiased machine learning (DML). For this, we introduce generalized average ranking scores (GARS), which generalize commonly used ranking models, including the Bradley-Terry model or PageRank/ Rank centrality, with complex human responses such as ties. DMLEval comes with the following advantages: (i) It produces statistically efficient estimates of GARS ranking scores. (ii) It naturally allows the incorporation of black-box machine learning methods for estimation. (iii) It can be combined with pre-trained LLM evaluators (e.g., using LLM-as-a-judge). (iv) It suggests optimal policies for collecting preference data under budget constraints. We demonstrate these advantages both theoretically and empirically using both synthetic and real-world preference datasets. In summary, our framework provides practitioners with powerful, state-of-the-art methods for comparing or ranking LLMs.

### [307] [DASH: Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-throughput Reproducible LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21824)
*Xinwei Qiang,Hongmin Chen,Shixuan Sun,Jingwen Leng,Xin Liu,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DASH improves deterministic attention throughput by optimizing scheduling, reducing performance gaps in LLM training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Determinism in LLM training ensures reproducibility but incurs performance costs; DASH addresses this inefficiency.

Method: Formulates the backward pass as a DAG scheduling problem, introducing Descending Q-Tile Iteration and Shift Scheduling.

Result: DASH improves throughput by up to 1.28x on NVIDIA H800 GPUs, reducing the deterministic attention performance gap.

Conclusion: DASH enhances efficiency in reproducible LLM training with optimized scheduling strategies.

Abstract: Determinism is indispensable for reproducibility in large language model (LLM) training, yet it often exacts a steep performance cost. In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.
  To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.
  Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention. The proposed strategies improve the throughput of the attention backward pass by up to 1.28$\times$ compared to the baseline, significantly advancing the efficiency of reproducible LLM training.

*Jigar Parekh,Philipp Bekemeyer*

TL;DR: The paper proposes an active learning strategy for field-predicting machine learning models, agnostic to architecture, combining Gaussian processes for scalar references while reducing epistemic error and scalar-field discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active learning for scalar quantities exists, but field prediction lacks generalized strategies. The paper aims to fill this gap.

Method: Combines Gaussian process models for scalar reference values, focusing on reducing epistemic error and scalar-field prediction differences. Introduces and compares specific forms of this approach.

Result: Demonstrates high accuracy for the NASA common research model in uncertainty propagation at significantly lower computational cost than non-active learning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed active learning strategy effectively reduces computational cost while maintaining accuracy for field-predicting models.

Abstract: Machine learning models are widely regarded as a way forward to tackle multi-query challenges that arise once expensive black-box simulations such as computational fluid dynamics are investigated. However, ensuring the desired level of accuracy for a certain task at minimal computational cost, e.g. as few black-box samples as possible, remains a challenges. Active learning strategies are used for scalar quantities to overcome this challenges and different so-called infill criteria exists and are commonly employed in several scenarios. Even though needed in various field an extension of active learning strategies towards field predictions is still lacking or limited to very specific scenarios and/or model types. In this paper we propose an active learning strategy for machine learning models that are capable if predicting field which is agnostic to the model architecture itself. For doing so, we combine a well-established Gaussian process model for a scalar reference value and simultaneously aim at reducing the epistemic model error and the difference between scalar and field predictions. Different specific forms of the above-mentioned approach are introduced and compared to each other as well as only scalar-valued based infill. Results are presented for the NASA common research model for an uncertainty propagation task showcasing high level of accuracy at significantly smaller cost compared to an approach without active learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable method using a surrogate DNN to approximate the LLA kernel, avoiding large Jacobians and improving uncertainty estimation and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Jacobians computation in LLA is avoided by replicating the NTK with a surrogate DNN, enabling scalable uncertainty estimation on pre-trained DNNs.

Method: A surrogate DNN learns a compact feature representation whose inner product replicates the NTK, trained efficiently using Jacobian-vector products.

Result: Improved or similar uncertainty estimation and calibration compared to existing LLA approximations, with enhanced out-of-distribution detection when biasing the learned kernel.

Conclusion: The method efficiently computes predictive uncertainty on large-scale pre-trained DNNs and suggests benefits of finding better kernels than NTK for LLA.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable method to approximate the kernel of the Linearized Laplace Approximation (LLA). For this, we use a surrogate deep neural network (DNN) that learns a compact feature representation whose inner product replicates the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This avoids the need to compute large Jacobians. Training relies solely on efficient Jacobian-vector products, allowing to compute predictive uncertainty on large-scale pre-trained DNNs. Experimental results show similar or improved uncertainty estimation and calibration compared to existing LLA approximations. Notwithstanding, biasing the learned kernel significantly enhances out-of-distribution detection. This remarks the benefits of the proposed method for finding better kernels than the NTK in the context of LLA to compute prediction uncertainty given a pre-trained DNN.

Motivation: Addresses the challenge of ensuring policy safety in real-world applications like robotics and healthcare while reducing sample complexity.

Method: Introduces an algorithm refining training policies with provable safety and sample complexity guarantees.

Result: Achieves near-optimal policy learning on test tasks with tight sample complexity, validated by a matching lower bound.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness in balancing safety and efficiency for constrained meta RL applications.

Abstract: Meta reinforcement learning (RL) allows agents to leverage experience across a distribution of tasks on which the agent can train at will, enabling faster learning of optimal policies on new test tasks. Despite its success in improving sample complexity on test tasks, many real-world applications, such as robotics and healthcare, impose safety constraints during testing. Constrained meta RL provides a promising framework for integrating safety into meta RL. An open question in constrained meta RL is how to ensure the safety of the policy on the real-world test task, while reducing the sample complexity and thus, enabling faster learning of optimal policies. To address this gap, we propose an algorithm that refines policies learned during training, with provable safety and sample complexity guarantees for learning a near optimal policy on the test tasks. We further derive a matching lower bound, showing that this sample complexity is tight.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MetaBBO reward functions are manually designed, leading to bias and reward hacking. Automating this process with LLMs aims to improve fairness and performance.

Method: The paper proposes LLM-based automated reward discovery with tailored evolution for continuous improvement and multi-task evolution for parallel reward discovery.

Result: Empirical results show that discovered reward functions enhance MetaBBO performance, highlighting the significance of automated reward design.

Conclusion: Automating reward discovery with LLMs improves MetaBBO effectiveness and efficiency, with potential benefits for diverse optimization approaches.

Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) is an emerging avenue within Optimization community, where algorithm design policy could be meta-learned by reinforcement learning to enhance optimization performance. So far, the reward functions in existing MetaBBO works are designed by human experts, introducing certain design bias and risks of reward hacking. In this paper, we use Large Language Model~(LLM) as an automated reward discovery tool for MetaBBO. Specifically, we consider both effectiveness and efficiency sides. On effectiveness side, we borrow the idea of evolution of heuristics, introducing tailored evolution paradigm in the iterative LLM-based program search process, which ensures continuous improvement. On efficiency side, we additionally introduce multi-task evolution architecture to support parallel reward discovery for diverse MetaBBO approaches. Such parallel process also benefits from knowledge sharing across tasks to accelerate convergence. Empirical results demonstrate that the reward functions discovered by our approach could be helpful for boosting existing MetaBBO works, underscoring the importance of reward design in MetaBBO.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models suffer from spurious correlations and 'Clever Hans' strategies, requiring costly or impractical mitigation methods.

Method: DiDAE edits embeddings in interpretable directions via disentangled dictionary learning and decodes them using a diffusion autoencoder.

Result: DiDAE generates multiple diverse counterfactuals faster than baselines and improves performance when paired with CFKD.

Conclusion: DiDAE-CFKD outperforms existing methods in mitigating shortcut learning and enhancing performance on unbalanced datasets.

Abstract: Foundation models, despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, remain vulnerable to spurious correlations and 'Clever Hans' strategies. Existing mitigation methods often rely on unavailable group labels or computationally expensive gradient-based adversarial optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Visual Disentangled Diffusion Autoencoders (DiDAE), a novel framework integrating frozen foundation models with disentangled dictionary learning for efficient, gradient-free counterfactual generation directly for the foundation model. DiDAE first edits foundation model embeddings in interpretable disentangled directions of the disentangled dictionary and then decodes them via a diffusion autoencoder. This allows the generation of multiple diverse, disentangled counterfactuals for each factual, much faster than existing baselines, which generate single entangled counterfactuals. When paired with Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation, DiDAE-CFKD achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating shortcut learning, improving downstream performance on unbalanced datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoHETS is a Transformer model with heterogeneous experts for long-horizon time series forecasting, improving accuracy and efficiency over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse Mixture-of-Experts models struggle with diverse temporal dynamics in time series data due to homogeneous MLP experts.

Method: MoHETS integrates sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers, combining shared convolutional experts and routed Fourier-based experts, along with cross-attention for exogenous data and a convolutional patch decoder.

Result: MoHETS achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing average MSE by 12% across seven benchmarks.

Conclusion: MoHETS successfully captures multi-scale structures in time series, demonstrating effective heterogeneous specialization for long-term forecasting.

Abstract: Real-world multivariate time series can exhibit intricate multi-scale structures, including global trends, local periodicities, and non-stationary regimes, which makes long-horizon forecasting challenging. Although sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches improve scalability and specialization, they typically rely on homogeneous MLP experts that poorly capture the diverse temporal dynamics of time series data. We address these limitations with MoHETS, an encoder-only Transformer that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers. MoHE routes temporal patches to a small subset of expert networks, combining a shared depthwise-convolution expert for sequence-level continuity with routed Fourier-based experts for patch-level periodic structures. MoHETS further improves robustness to non-stationary dynamics by incorporating exogenous information via cross-attention over covariate patch embeddings. Finally, we replace parameter-heavy linear projection heads with a lightweight convolutional patch decoder, improving parameter efficiency, reducing training instability, and allowing a single model to generalize across arbitrary forecast horizons. We validate across seven multivariate benchmarks and multiple horizons, with MoHETS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average MSE by $12\%$ compared to strong recent baselines, demonstrating effective heterogeneous specialization for long-term forecasting.

TL;DR: The paper studies transfer learning for structured matrix estimation in scenarios where both the ambient dimension and intrinsic representation grow. It introduces a framework decomposing the target parameter into embedded source, low-rank innovations, and sparse edits, proposing an anchored alternating projection estimator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve transfer learning efficiency by preserving transferred subspaces while estimating only necessary innovations and sparse modifications, addressing challenges in growing dimensions.

Method: Proposes a general transfer framework with an anchored alternating projection estimator. Target parameters decompose into embedded source, low-rank innovations, and sparse edits.

Result: Provides deterministic error bounds separating target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error, showing improved rates for small rank and sparsity increments.

Conclusion: Demonstrates applicability to Markov transition matrix and structured covariance estimation, validating transfer gains theoretically and empirically.

Abstract: Learning systems often expand their ambient features or latent representations over time, embedding earlier representations into larger spaces with limited new latent structure. We study transfer learning for structured matrix estimation under simultaneous growth of the ambient dimension and the intrinsic representation, where a well-estimated source task is embedded as a subspace of a higher-dimensional target task.
  We propose a general transfer framework in which the target parameter decomposes into an embedded source component, low-dimensional low-rank innovations, and sparse edits, and develop an anchored alternating projection estimator that preserves transferred subspaces while estimating only low-dimensional innovations and sparse modifications. We establish deterministic error bounds that separate target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error, yielding strictly improved rates when rank and sparsity increments are small.
  We demonstrate the generality of the framework by applying it to two canonical problems. For Markov transition matrix estimation from a single trajectory, we derive end-to-end theoretical guarantees under dependent noise. For structured covariance estimation under enlarged dimensions, we provide complementary theoretical analysis in the appendix and empirically validate consistent transfer gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve decision-focused learning by addressing instability in training caused by perturbation fluctuations, ensuring more reliable and robust learning outcomes.

Method: The method involves introducing a regularization of the estimated cost vectors to mitigate the instability caused by perturbation fluctuations during the learning phase.

Result: Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed regularization improves the robustness and reliability of the learning process.

Conclusion: By regularizing cost vectors, the study enhances the stability and effectiveness of decision-focused learning in combinatorial optimization problems.

Abstract: Decision-focused learning integrates predictive modeling and combinatorial optimization by training models to directly improve decision quality rather than prediction accuracy alone. Differentiating through combinatorial optimization problems represents a central challenge, and recent approaches tackle this difficulty by introducing perturbation-based approximations. In this work, we focus on estimating the objective function coefficients of a combinatorial optimization problem. Our study demonstrates that fluctuations in perturbation intensity occurring during the learning phase can lead to ineffective training, by establishing a theoretical link to the notion of solution stability in combinatorial optimization. We propose addressing this issue by introducing a regularization of the estimated cost vectors which improves the robustness and reliability of the learning process, as demonstrated by extensive numerical experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores how the structural complexity of code enhances reasoning in LLMs, showing that specific complexity ranges outperform diverse code training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand which properties of code improve reasoning in LLMs, as existing studies treat code generically.

Method: Analyzes structural complexity (control flow, composition) using cyclomatic complexity and logical lines of code in two settings: solution-driven and problem-driven complexity.

Result: Structural properties strongly determine code's usefulness; fine-tuning within specific complexity ranges outperforms diverse code training in 83% of experiments.

Conclusion: Targeted structural complexity in code fine-tuning offers a data-centric path to enhance LLM reasoning beyond scaling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit strong reasoning abilities, often attributed to their capacity to generate chain-of-thought-style intermediate reasoning. Recent work suggests that exposure to code can further enhance these skills, but existing studies largely treat code as a generic training signal, leaving open the question of which properties of code actually contribute to improved reasoning. To address this gap, we study the structural complexity of code, which captures control flow and compositional structure that may shape how models internalise multi-step reasoning during fine-tuning. We examine two complementary settings: solution-driven complexity, where complexity varies across multiple solutions to the same problem, and problem-driven complexity, where complexity reflects variation in the underlying tasks. Using cyclomatic complexity and logical lines of code to construct controlled fine-tuning datasets, we evaluate a range of open-weight LLMs on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that although code can improve reasoning, structural properties strongly determine its usefulness. In 83% of experiments, restricting fine-tuning data to a specific structural complexity range outperforms training on structurally diverse code, pointing to a data-centric path for improving reasoning beyond scaling.

*Ali Hasanzadeh Karkan,Ahmed Ibrahim,Jean-François Frigon,François Leduc-Primeau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PaPP is a DL-based plug-and-play precoder for mMIMO downlink that avoids retraining per site, balances teacher-student learning, and outperforms baselines with energy efficiency and robustness to errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mMIMO precoding solutions like WMMSE are computationally expensive and SNR-sensitive, while DL-based methods lack robustness and require retraining for each deployment.

Method: PaPP uses a DL framework with a teacher-student model, self-supervised loss, meta-learning domain-generalization, and power-aware normalization for FDP or HBF precoding.

Result: PaPP outperforms conventional and DL baselines, reduces computation energy by 21x, and maintains performance under channel-estimation errors.

Conclusion: PaPP is a practical, energy-efficient solution for mMIMO precoding, reusable across sites and robust to deployment variations.

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) downlink precoding offers high spectral efficiency but remains challenging to deploy in practice because near-optimal algorithms such as the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) are computationally expensive, and sensitive to SNR and channel-estimation quality, while existing deep learning (DL)-based solutions often lack robustness and require retraining for each deployment site. This paper proposes a plug-and-play precoder (PaPP), a DL framework with a backbone that can be trained for either fully digital (FDP) or hybrid beamforming (HBF) precoding and reused across sites, transmit-power levels, and with varying amounts of channel estimation error, avoiding the need to train a new model from scratch at each deployment. PaPP combines a high-capacity teacher and a compact student with a self-supervised loss that balances teacher imitation and normalized sum-rate, trained using meta-learning domain-generalization and transmit-power-aware input normalization. Numerical results on ray-tracing data from three unseen sites show that the PaPP FDP and HBF models both outperform conventional and deep learning baselines, after fine-tuning with a small set of local unlabeled samples. Across both architectures, PaPP achieves more than 21$\times$ reduction in modeled computation energy and maintains good performance under channel-estimation errors, making it a practical solution for energy-efficient mMIMO precoding.

Conclusion: OmniAir effectively bridges the monitoring gap in data-sparse regions and sets a new benchmark for global station-level air quality prediction.

Abstract: Global air quality forecasting grapples with extreme spatial heterogeneity and the poor generalization of existing transductive models to unseen regions. To tackle this, we propose OmniAir, a semantic topology learning framework tailored for global station-level prediction. By encoding invariant physical environmental attributes into generalizable station identities and dynamically constructing adaptive sparse topologies, our approach effectively captures long-range non-Euclidean correlations and physical diffusion patterns across unevenly distributed global networks. We further curate WorldAir, a massive dataset covering over 7,800 stations worldwide. Extensive experiments show that OmniAir achieves state-of-the-art performance against 18 baselines, maintaining high efficiency and scalability with speeds nearly 10 times faster than existing models, while effectively bridging the monitoring gap in data-sparse regions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exploiting hardware-induced numerical variations to create backdoors in ML models, demonstrated across GPUs, with proposed defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight vulnerabilities in ML models due to hardware-specific numerical variations, posing risks when using third-party models.

Method: Shape the model's decision function to yield different predictions on different hardware by moving the decision boundary and refining numerical deviations.

Result: Successful creation of hardware-triggered backdoors across common GPU accelerators.

Conclusion: Reveals a novel attack vector; investigates defenses to mitigate such threats.

Abstract: Machine learning models are routinely deployed on a wide range of computing hardware. Although such hardware is typically expected to produce identical results, differences in its design can lead to small numerical variations during inference. In this work, we show that these variations can be exploited to create backdoors in machine learning models. The core idea is to shape the model's decision function such that it yields different predictions for the same input when executed on different hardware. This effect is achieved by locally moving the decision boundary close to a target input and then refining numerical deviations to flip the prediction on selected hardware. We empirically demonstrate that these hardware-triggered backdoors can be created reliably across common GPU accelerators. Our findings reveal a novel attack vector affecting the use of third-party models, and we investigate different defenses to counter this threat.

*Jinhang Chai,Enpei Zhang,Elynn Chen,Yujun Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces re-weighted targeting (RWT) for online transfer RL to align Bellman updates between tasks, improving efficiency by separating bias correction and variance reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of task similarity mismatches in online RL, which affects the reuse of source task data for target tasks.

Method: Proposes RWT, an operator-level correction aligning Bellman updates via reweighting continuation values and compensating for transition mismatches.

Result: Under RKHS approximation, RWT provides regret bounds scaling with task shift complexity, outperforming single-task and naive pooling methods empirically.

Conclusion: Bellman alignment via RWT is an effective, model-agnostic transfer principle for online RL, demonstrated in tabular and neural settings.

Abstract: We study online transfer reinforcement learning (RL) in episodic Markov decision processes, where experience from related source tasks is available during learning on a target task. A fundamental difficulty is that task similarity is typically defined in terms of rewards or transitions, whereas online RL algorithms operate on Bellman regression targets. As a result, naively reusing source Bellman updates introduces systematic bias and invalidates regret guarantees.
  We identify one-step Bellman alignment as the correct abstraction for transfer in online RL and propose re-weighted targeting (RWT), an operator-level correction that retargets continuation values and compensates for transition mismatch via a change of measure. RWT reduces task mismatch to a fixed one-step correction and enables statistically sound reuse of source data.
  This alignment yields a two-stage RWT $Q$-learning framework that separates variance reduction from bias correction. Under RKHS function approximation, we establish regret bounds that scale with the complexity of the task shift rather than the target MDP. Empirical results in both tabular and neural network settings demonstrate consistent improvements over single-task learning and naïve pooling, highlighting Bellman alignment as a model-agnostic transfer principle for online RL.

*Shuangqi Li,Hieu Le,Jingyi Xu,Mathieu Salzmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRIF introduces low-rank structures to overcome scalability bottlenecks in gradient-based Training Data Attribution (TDA), reducing storage and computation while improving attribution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TDA methods like TRAK and LoGRA face scalability issues due to storage, I/O latency, and high memory costs when handling large datasets and models.

Method: LoRIF leverages low-rank gradient structures to factorize projected gradients and approximate the Hessian term efficiently, reducing storage and computation overhead.

Result: LoRIF achieves up to 20x storage reduction and query-time speedup compared to LoGRA while maintaining or improving attribution quality.

Conclusion: LoRIF makes gradient-based TDA feasible for large-scale models and datasets by addressing key scalability challenges.

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) identifies which training examples most influenced a model's prediction. The best-performing TDA methods exploits gradients to define an influence function. To overcome the scalability challenge arising from gradient computation, the most popular strategy is random projection (e.g., TRAK, LoGRA). However, this still faces two bottlenecks when scaling to large training sets and high-quality attribution: \emph{(i)} storing and loading projected per-example gradients for all $N$ training examples, where query latency is dominated by I/O; and \emph{(ii)} forming the $D \times D$ inverse Hessian approximation, which costs $O(D^2)$ memory. Both bottlenecks scale with the projection dimension $D$, yet increasing $D$ is necessary for attribution quality -- creating a quality--scalability tradeoff. We introduce \textbf{LoRIF (Low-Rank Influence Functions)}, which exploits low-rank structures of gradient to address both bottlenecks. First, we store rank-$c$ factors of the projected per-example gradients rather than full matrices, reducing storage and query-time I/O from $O(D)$ to $O(c\sqrt{D})$ per layer per sample. Second, we use truncated SVD with the Woodbury identity to approximate the Hessian term in an $r$-dimensional subspace, reducing memory from $O(D^2)$ to $O(Dr)$. On models from 0.1B to 70B parameters trained on datasets with millions of examples, LoRIF achieves up to 20$\times$ storage reduction and query-time speedup compared to LoGRA, while matching or exceeding its attribution quality. LoRIF makes gradient-based TDA practical at frontier scale.

TL;DR: Proposes a Dual-Stream Feature Decorrelation Framework to handle biases in medical multimodal representation learning, improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world medical datasets contain biases that hinder effective multimodal representation learning, which existing methods often neglect.

Method: Uses a causal-biased decorrelation framework with dual-stream networks to disentangle causal features, employing cross-entropy loss and mutual information minimization.

Result: Demonstrates performance improvements on MIMIC-IV, eICU, and ADNI datasets.

Conclusion: The framework is model-agnostic and enhances existing medical multimodal learning methods.

Abstract: Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous data into unified patient representations to support clinical outcome prediction. However, real-world medical datasets commonly contain systematic biases from multiple sources, which poses significant challenges for medical multimodal representation learning. Existing approaches typically focus on effective multimodal fusion, neglecting inherent biased features that affect the generalization ability. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-Stream Feature Decorrelation Framework that identifies and handles the biases through structural causal analysis introduced by latent confounders. Our method employs a causal-biased decorrelation framework with dual-stream neural networks to disentangle causal features from spurious correlations, utilizing generalized cross-entropy loss and mutual information minimization for effective decorrelation. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing medical multimodal learning methods. Comprehensive experiments on MIMIC-IV, eICU, and ADNI datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an information-theoretic approach for dimension-free convergence in diffusion models, achieving a KL divergence bound of $O(H^2/K)$ and proposing a lightweight Loss-Adaptive Schedule (LAS) for efficient sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing convergence analyses for diffusion models depend on geometric assumptions or scale with ambient dimension, limiting their applicability. This paper aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: The authors develop an information-theoretic framework to avoid geometric assumptions and bound KL divergence. They also propose LAS, a lightweight schedule based on training loss.

Result: The paper achieves a dimension-free KL divergence bound and demonstrates empirically that LAS improves sampling quality over heuristic schedules.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a theoretical advancement in diffusion model analysis and a practical tool (LAS) for efficient sampling.

Abstract: Diffusion generative models synthesize samples by discretizing reverse-time dynamics driven by a learned score (or denoiser). Existing convergence analyses of diffusion models typically scale at least linearly with the ambient dimension, and sharper rates often depend on intrinsic-dimension assumptions or other geometric restrictions on the target distribution. We develop an alternative, information-theoretic approach to dimension-free convergence that avoids any geometric assumptions. Under mild assumptions on the target distribution, we bound KL divergence between the target and generated distributions by $O(H^2/K)$ (up to endpoint factors), where $H$ is the Shannon entropy and $K$ is the number of sampling steps. Moreover, using a reformulation of the KL divergence, we propose a Loss-Adaptive Schedule (LAS) for efficient discretization of reverse SDE which is lightweight and relies only on the training loss, requiring no post-training heavy computation. Empirically, LAS improves sampling quality over common heuristic schedules.

TL;DR: The paper explores interpretability in Vision-Language Models, focusing on Concept Bottleneck Models and introducing 'clarity' to measure downstream performance vs. concept representation sparsity and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing concerns about the lack of interpretability in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the need for objective evaluation of learned representations.

Method: Investigates Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) with three sparsity-inducing strategies (ℓ₁, ℓ₀, Bernoulli) and introduces a clarity measure for interpretability assessment.

Result: Reveals a trade-off between flexibility and interpretability, showing varying behaviors in methods even at similar performance levels.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of balancing performance and interpretability in VLMs and CBMs, proposing clarity as a useful metric.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across fields has amplified concerns about model interpretability. Distressingly, these models are often treated as black-boxes, with limited or non-existent investigation of their decision making process. Despite numerous post- and ante-hoc interepretability methods, systematic and objective evaluation of the learned representations remains limited, particularly for sparsity-aware methods that are increasingly considered to "induce interpretability". In this work, we focus on Concept Bottleneck Models and investigate how different modeling decisions affect the emerging representations. We introduce the notion of clarity, a measure, capturing the interplay between the downstream performance and the sparsity and precision of the concept representation, while proposing an interpretability assessment framework using datasets with ground truth concept annotations. We consider both VLM- and attribute predictor-based CBMs, and three different sparsity-inducing strategies: per example $\ell_1, \ell_0$ and Bernoulli-based formulations. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off between flexibility and interpretability, under which a given method can exhibit markedly different behaviors even at comparable performance levels. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Motivation: The unsustainable energy consumption of AI drives interest in neuromorphic computing and physics-based training methods like equilibrium propagation.

Result: Sparse networks with local connections achieve performance similar to dense networks.

Conclusion: The findings offer practical guidelines for scaling equilibrium propagation-based architectures in realistic settings.

Abstract: The rapid rise of artificial intelligence has led to an unsustainable growth in energy consumption. This has motivated progress in neuromorphic computing and physics-based training of learning machines as alternatives to digital neural networks. Many theoretical studies focus on simple architectures like all-to-all or densely connected layered networks. However, these may be challenging to realize experimentally, e.g. due to connectivity constraints. In this work, we investigate the performance of the widespread physics-based training method of equilibrium propagation for more realistic architectural choices, specifically, locally connected lattices. We train an XY model and explore the influence of architecture on various benchmark tasks, tracking the evolution of spatially distributed responses and couplings during training. Our results show that sparse networks with only local connections can achieve performance comparable to dense networks. Our findings provide guidelines for further scaling up architectures based on equilibrium propagation in realistic settings.

TL;DR: AUM models aleatoric uncertainty in medical multimodal data to handle missing modalities dynamically, improving performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of missing modalities and neglecting inherent uncertainty in medical multimodal learning.

Method: Proposes Aleatoric Uncertainty Modeling (AUM) to quantify unimodal uncertainty via Gaussian distributions and uses a dynamic message-passing mechanism for adaptive aggregation.

Result: Achieves 2.26% AUC-ROC improvement on MIMIC-IV mortality prediction and 2.17% on eICU.

Conclusion: AUM effectively handles missing modalities and improves performance by emphasizing reliable information.

Abstract: Medical multimodal learning faces significant challenges with missing modalities prevalent in clinical practice. Existing approaches assume equal contribution of modality and random missing patterns, neglecting inherent uncertainty in medical data acquisition. In this regard, we propose the Aleatoric Uncertainty Modeling (AUM) that explicitly quantifies unimodal aleatoric uncertainty to address missing modalities. Specifically, AUM models each unimodal representation as a multivariate Gaussian distribution to capture aleatoric uncertainty and enable principled modality reliability quantification. To adaptively aggregate captured information, we develop a dynamic message-passing mechanism within a bipartite patient-modality graph using uncertainty-aware aggregation mechanism. Through this process, missing modalities are naturally accommodated, while more reliable information from available modalities is dynamically emphasized to guide representation generation. Our AUM framework achieves an improvement of 2.26% AUC-ROC on MIMIC-IV mortality prediction and 2.17% gain on eICU, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

*Yunjia Yang,Runze Li,Yufei Zhang,Haixin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an uncertainty-aware data-based optimization (UA-DBO) framework to improve aerodynamic shape optimization by integrating uncertainty quantification, reducing errors and outperforming traditional DBO methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data-based optimization (DBO) relies on surrogate models but suffers from prediction errors when samples deviate from the training distribution. Incorporating uncertainty quantification can enhance robustness.

Method: A probabilistic encoder-decoder surrogate model predicts uncertainties, integrated into a model-confidence-aware objective function to penalize high-error samples during optimization.

Result: UA-DBO reduces prediction errors in optimized samples and achieves better performance gains than DBO. It matches the effectiveness of full computational simulations while being faster.

Conclusion: UA-DBO improves robustness and efficiency in aerodynamic optimization, combining uncertainty quantification with surrogate models for superior results.

Abstract: Data-based optimization (DBO) offers a promising approach for efficiently optimizing shape for better aerodynamic performance by leveraging a pretrained surrogate model for offline evaluations during iterations. However, DBO heavily relies on the quality of the training database. Samples outside the training distribution encountered during optimization can lead to significant prediction errors, potentially misleading the optimization process. Therefore, incorporating uncertainty quantification into optimization is critical for detecting outliers and enhancing robustness. This study proposes an uncertainty-aware data-based optimization (UA-DBO) framework to monitor and minimize surrogate model uncertainty during DBO. A probabilistic encoder-decoder surrogate model is developed to predict uncertainties associated with its outputs, and these uncertainties are integrated into a model-confidence-aware objective function to penalize samples with large prediction errors during data-based optimization process. The UA-DBO framework is evaluated on two multipoint optimization problems aimed at improving airfoil drag divergence and buffet performance. Results demonstrate that UA-DBO consistently reduces prediction errors in optimized samples and achieves superior performance gains compared to original DBO. Moreover, compared to multipoint optimization based on full computational simulations, UA-DBO offers comparable optimization effectiveness while significantly accelerating optimization speed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IGETR, a hybrid framework combining GNNs and LLMs, improves temporal knowledge graph reasoning by grounding predictions in structured evidence and refining paths with LLM guidance, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods struggle with dynamic graph structures, leading to unstructured and unreliable inferences. IGETR addresses this by integrating structural and contextual reasoning.

Method: IGETR uses a three-stage pipeline: (1) temporal GNN for coherent candidate paths, (2) LLM-guided path editing for refinement, and (3) integration of paths for predictions.

Result: IGETR outperforms baselines with up to 5.6% and 8.1% improvements on Hits@1 and Hits@3 metrics, respectively, on ICEWS datasets.

Conclusion: IGETR successfully bridges structural and contextual reasoning, delivering accurate and interpretable predictions.

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) aims to predict future events by inferring missing entities with dynamic knowledge structures. Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs. This limits structural information understanding, leading to unstructured, hallucination-prone inferences especially with temporal inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets. Additionally, we execute ablation studies and additional analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the reliability of Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) for medical images using predictive variance analysis with Monte Carlo dropout, revealing insights into its trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well FID, a popular synthetic image quality metric, captures meaningful differences in medical images despite being trained on natural images.

Method: Monte Carlo dropout is used to compute predictive variance in FID and feature embeddings, tested on ImageNet1K and external datasets.

Result: Predictive variances correlate with how out-of-distribution test inputs are, indicating the trustworthiness of FID for medical images.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the limitations of FID for medical applications and suggests predictive variance as a useful indicator.

Abstract: Feature embeddings acquired from pretrained models are widely used in medical applications of deep learning to assess the characteristics of datasets; e.g. to determine the quality of synthetic, generated medical images. The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) is one popular synthetic image quality metric that relies on the assumption that the characteristic features of the data can be detected and encoded by an InceptionV3 model pretrained on ImageNet1K (natural images). While it is widely known that this makes it less effective for applications involving medical images, the extent to which the metric fails to capture meaningful differences in image characteristics is not obviously known. Here, we use Monte Carlo dropout to compute the predictive variance in the FID as well as a supplemental estimate of the predictive variance in the feature embedding model's latent representations. We show that the magnitudes of the predictive variances considered exhibit varying degrees of correlation with the extent to which test inputs (ImageNet1K validation set augmented at various strengths, and other external datasets) are out-of-distribution relative to its training data, providing some insight into the effectiveness of their use as indicators of the trustworthiness of the FID.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI methods for circuit topology discovery are limited to predefined templates or small-scale generation without rigorous verification, leaving large-scale performance-driven exploration untapped.

Method: PowerGenie combines (1) an automated analytical framework to determine functionality and performance limits without simulations, and (2) evolutionary finetuning to co-evolve a generative model with fitness and uniqueness selection.

Result: PowerGenie achieves higher syntax/function validity, novelty, and FoM. It discovers an 8-mode converter with 23% higher FoM than training topologies, confirmed by SPICE simulations showing 10-17% efficiency gains.

Conclusion: PowerGenie advances automated circuit discovery, overcoming limitations like mode collapse and overfitting, and demonstrates significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Discovering superior circuit topologies requires navigating an exponentially large design space-a challenge traditionally reserved for human experts. Existing AI methods either select from predefined templates or generate novel topologies at a limited scale without rigorous verification, leaving large-scale performance-driven discovery underexplored. We present PowerGenie, a framework for automated discovery of higher-performance reconfigurable power converters at scale. PowerGenie introduces: (1) an automated analytical framework that determines converter functionality and theoretical performance limits without component sizing or SPICE simulation, and (2) an evolutionary finetuning method that co-evolves a generative model with its training distribution through fitness selection and uniqueness verification. Unlike existing methods that suffer from mode collapse and overfitting, our approach achieves higher syntax validity, function validity, novelty rate, and figure-of-merit (FoM). PowerGenie discovers a novel 8-mode reconfigurable converter with 23% higher FoM than the best training topology. SPICE simulations confirm average absolute efficiency gains of 10% across 8 modes and up to 17% at a single mode. Code is available at https://github.com/xz-group/PowerGenie.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Elign is a post-training framework that uses reinforcement learning and a pretrained MLFF to generate thermodynamically favorable 3D molecular conformations efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing E(3)-equivariant diffusion models reproduce biases from semi-empirical data rather than capturing equilibrium distributions, and physics-based guidance is computationally expensive.

Method: Elign amortizes costs by replacing DFT evaluations with a pretrained MLFF and shifting steering to training. It uses FED-GRPO for reverse diffusion reinforcement learning.

Result: Elign produces conformations with lower DFT energies and forces, improves stability, and maintains fast inference speeds.

Conclusion: Elign effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in generating stable molecular conformations without runtime energy evaluations.

Abstract: Generative models for 3D molecular conformations must respect Euclidean symmetries and concentrate probability mass on thermodynamically favorable, mechanically stable structures. However, E(3)-equivariant diffusion models often reproduce biases from semi-empirical training data rather than capturing the equilibrium distribution of a high-fidelity Hamiltonian. While physics-based guidance can correct this, it faces two computational bottlenecks: expensive quantum-chemical evaluations (e.g., DFT) and the need to repeat such queries at every sampling step. We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently. Experiments show that Elign generates conformations with lower gold-standard DFT energies and forces, while improving stability. Crucially, inference remains as fast as unguided sampling, since no energy evaluations are required during generation.

*Zuyuan Zhang,Mahdi Imani,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a geometric framework for nonstationary reinforcement learning, focusing on drift, acceleration, and action-gap effects, and proposes HT-RL and HT-MCTS for improved tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models of nonstationary RL environments are coarse and fail to capture local dynamics like acceleration or near-ties, which impact tracking error and policy behavior.

Method: The authors model nonstationary MDPs as differentiable homotopy paths, tracking the optimal Bellman fixed point's motion. They derive intrinsic complexity measures (length, curvature, kink) and propose HT-RL and HT-MCTS wrappers.

Result: Experiments show HT-RL and HT-MCTS outperform static baselines in tracking and dynamic regret, especially in oscillatory and switch-prone scenarios.

Conclusion: The geometric approach and proposed wrappers effectively address nonstationarity, improving RL performance in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning is often \emph{nonstationary}: rewards and dynamics drift, accelerate, oscillate, and trigger abrupt switches in the optimal action. Existing theory often represents nonstationarity with coarse-scale models that measure \emph{how much} the environment changes, not \emph{how} it changes locally -- even though acceleration and near-ties drive tracking error and policy chattering. We take a geometric view of nonstationary discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by modeling the environment as a differentiable homotopy path and tracking the induced motion of the optimal Bellman fixed point. This yields a length--curvature--kink signature of intrinsic complexity: cumulative drift, acceleration/oscillation, and action-gap-induced nonsmoothness. We prove a solver-agnostic path-integral stability bound and derive gap-safe feasible regions that certify local stability away from switch regimes. Building on these results, we introduce \textit{Homotopy-Tracking RL (HT-RL)} and \textit{HT-MCTS}, lightweight wrappers that estimate replay-based proxies of length, curvature, and near-tie proximity online and adapt learning or planning intensity accordingly. Experiments show improved tracking and dynamic regret over matched static baselines, with the largest gains in oscillatory and switch-prone regimes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Negative-Dominant Contrastive Learning (NDCL) for Imbalanced Domain Generalization (IDG), focusing on mitigating domain and label shifts by enhancing discriminability and enforcing posterior consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the underexplored nature of IDG due to technical complexity and lack of theoretical foundations, aiming to address entanglement of domain and label shifts under long-tailed distributions.

Method: The method includes proposing NDCL, which emphasizes negatives in contrastive learning to enhance inter-class separation, uses re-weighted cross-entropy for intra-class compactness, and enforces posterior consistency via prediction-central alignment.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks validate NDCL's effectiveness in addressing IDG challenges.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that NDCL successfully steers decision boundaries to mitigate domain and label shifts, offering a novel approach to IDG.

Abstract: Imbalanced Domain Generalization (IDG) focuses on mitigating both domain and label shifts, both of which fundamentally shape the model's decision boundaries, particularly under heterogeneous long-tailed distributions across domains. Despite its practical significance, it remains underexplored, primarily due to the technical complexity of handling their entanglement and the paucity of theoretical foundations. In this paper, we begin by theoretically establishing the generalization bound for IDG, highlighting the role of posterior discrepancy and decision margin. This bound motivates us to focus on directly steering decision boundaries, marking a clear departure from existing methods. Subsequently, we technically propose a novel Negative-Dominant Contrastive Learning (NDCL) for IDG to enhance discriminability while enforce posterior consistency across domains. Specifically, inter-class decision-boundary separation is enhanced by placing greater emphasis on negatives as the primary signal in our contrastive learning, naturally amplifying gradient signals for minority classes to avoid the decision boundary being biased toward majority classes. Meanwhile, intra-class compactness is encouraged through a re-weighted cross-entropy strategy, and posterior consistency across domains is enforced through a prediction-central alignment strategy. Finally, rigorous yet challenging experiments on benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our NDCL. The code is available at https://github.com/Alrash/NDCL.

*Anderson de Andrade,Alon Harell,Ivan V. Bajić*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a rate-distortion-based framework for compressing intermediate representations in transformers to improve inference efficiency across multiple devices, achieving better performance than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers' high compute and memory requirements during inference necessitate efficient partitioning and compression of intermediate representations for multi-device deployment.

Method: A principled rate-distortion framework is proposed, which learns compact encodings to trade off bitrate against accuracy, with theoretical bounds on rate-entropy gaps.

Result: Experiments show substantial bitrate savings and sometimes improved accuracy, outperforming more complex baselines.

Conclusion: The framework offers a unified understanding of transformer performance in representation coding, with empirical validation of theoretical bounds across architectures and tasks.

Abstract: Transformers achieve superior performance on many tasks, but impose heavy compute and memory requirements during inference. This inference can be made more efficient by partitioning the process across multiple devices, which, in turn, requires compressing its intermediate representations. In this work, we introduce a principled rate-distortion-based framework for lossy compression that learns compact encodings that explicitly trade off bitrate against accuracy. Experiments on language benchmarks show that the proposed codec achieves substantial savings with improved accuracy in some cases, outperforming more complex baseline methods. We characterize and analyze the rate-distortion performance of transformers, offering a unified lens for understanding performance in representation coding. This formulation extends information-theoretic concepts to define the gap between rate and entropy, and derive some of its bounds. We further develop probably approximately correct (PAC)-style bounds for estimating this gap. For different architectures and tasks, we empirically demonstrate that their rates are driven by these bounds, adding to the explainability of the formulation.

*Dongxuan Zhu,Ly Tran Ho Khanh,Andy Yat-Ming Cheung,Man-Chung Yue,Viet Anh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STARS introduces a training-free method to diversify language model outputs by optimizing activation steering directions on the Stiefel manifold during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models often produce homogeneous outputs due to high-probability defaults, limiting diversity. Sampling methods fail to ensure diversity across concurrent runs.

Method: STARS collects hidden activations during inference and optimizes multiple additive steering directions jointly on the Stiefel manifold to maximize geometric volume and ensure orthogonality.

Result: STARS outperforms standard sampling methods in diversity and performance for test case generation and scientific discovery benchmarks.

Conclusion: STARS effectively diversifies model outputs without training, leveraging manifold optimization for improved diversity and performance.

Abstract: Language models often default to a narrow set of high-probability outputs, leaving their generation paths homogeneous and prone to mode collapse. Sampling-based strategies inject randomness but still struggle to guarantee diversity across multiple concurrent generation runs. We address this limitation by introducing STARS ($\textbf{St}$iefel-based $\textbf{A}$ctivation Steering for Diverse $\textbf{R}$ea$\textbf{S}$oning), a training-free, inference-time intervention method that transforms activation steering into an exploration engine. At each token, STARS collects the hidden activations of concurrent generation runs and optimizes multiple additive steering directions jointly on the Stiefel manifold. STARS maximizes the geometric volume of the steered activations, while the Stiefel manifold induces orthogonality of the steering interventions. This formulation explicitly promotes divergent activation vectors of concurrent generation runs, and implicitly promotes divergent generation trajectories. This manifold optimization formulation can be solved using a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm with convergence guarantees, but this algorithm is too time-consuming for real-time inference. To guarantee low latency, we further design a lightweight one-step update with an aggressive, closed-form stepsize. For test case generation and scientific discovery benchmarks, STARS consistently outperforms standard sampling methods, achieving greater diversity without sacrificing qualitative performance.

*Sergi Masip,Gido M. van de Ven,Javier Ferrando,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mechanistic framework to analyze catastrophic forgetting in continual learning by focusing on feature transformations, offering geometric interpretations and practical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the overlooked mechanisms behind catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, moving beyond performance or representation-level metrics to understand feature transformations.

Method: A mechanistic framework is developed to geometrically interpret catastrophic forgetting through feature transformations. A tractable model is analyzed, and experiments are conducted to validate the findings, including a case study with a Vision Transformer on sequential CIFAR-10.

Result: The framework identifies best- and worst-case scenarios for forgetting, highlights the negative impact of depth, and provides empirical validation through model experiments.

Conclusion: The work offers a novel, feature-centric approach to understanding continual learning, enhancing the vocabulary and analysis tools for future research.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in continual learning is often measured at the performance or last-layer representation level, overlooking the underlying mechanisms. We introduce a mechanistic framework that offers a geometric interpretation of catastrophic forgetting as the result of transformations to the encoding of individual features. These transformations can lead to forgetting by reducing the allocated capacity of features (worse representation) and disrupting their readout by downstream computations. Analysis of a tractable model formalizes this view, allowing us to identify best- and worst-case scenarios. Through experiments on this model, we empirically test our formal analysis and highlight the detrimental effect of depth. Finally, we demonstrate how our framework can be used in the analysis of practical models through the use of Crosscoders. We present a case study of a Vision Transformer trained on sequential CIFAR-10. Our work provides a new, feature-centric vocabulary for continual learning.

*Robert Istvan Busa-Fekete,Julian Zimmert,Anne Xiangyi Zheng,Claudio Gentile,Andras Gyorgy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical clustering method using text embeddings to efficiently and adaptively select high-quality training documents for LLMs, reducing the need for extensive LLM queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for selecting high-quality training data for LLMs are either unscalable (querying LLMs) or rely on sparse quality signals. The paper aims to address this challenge with a scalable and efficient solution.

Method: A text-embedding-based hierarchical clustering approach is introduced. It adaptively selects documents for LLM evaluation to estimate cluster quality, leveraging the assumption of pure leaf clusters.

Result: The method is proven query-efficient, requiring only a small number of documents proportional to the smallest subtree with pure leaves. Experiments show superior performance compared to classifier-based filtering.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical clustering method offers a scalable and efficient way to select high-quality training data for LLMs, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: The quality of machine learning models depends heavily on their training data. Selecting high-quality, diverse training sets for large language models (LLMs) is a difficult task, due to the lack of cheap and reliable quality metrics. While querying existing LLMs for document quality is common, this is not scalable to the large number (billions) of documents used in training. Instead, practitioners often use classifiers trained on sparse quality signals. In this paper, we propose a text-embedding-based hierarchical clustering approach that adaptively selects the documents to be evaluated by the LLM to estimate cluster quality. We prove that our method is query efficient: under the assumption that the hierarchical clustering contains a subtree such that each leaf cluster in the tree is pure enough (i.e., it mostly contains either only good or only bad documents), with high probability, the method can correctly predict the quality of each document after querying a small number of documents. The number of such documents is proportional to the size of the smallest subtree with (almost) pure leaves, without the algorithm knowing this subtree in advance. Furthermore, in a comprehensive experimental study, we demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm compared to other classifier-based filtering methods.

*Haoran Tang,Rajiv Khanna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLReg introduces a contrastive representation regularizer to reduce entanglement between forgotten and retained knowledge in LLMs, improving unlearning effectiveness with minimal privacy risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM unlearning methods often suppress forgotten content without fully removing it, leaving it entangled with retained knowledge.

Method: CLReg uses a contrastive representation regularizer to push forgotten features away from retained ones, reducing interference.

Result: CLReg decreases entanglement between forgotten and retained representations across benchmarks and LLM sizes.

Conclusion: Representation reshaping, as demonstrated by CLReg, offers a promising direction for future unlearning methods.

Abstract: Most LLM unlearning methods aim to approximate retrain-from-scratch behaviors with minimal distribution shift, often via alignment-style objectives defined in the prediction space. While effective at reducing forgotten content generation, such approaches may act as suppression: forgotten concepts can persist in representations and remain entangled with retained knowledge. We introduce CLReg, a contrastive representation regularizer that identifies forget features while pushing them away from retain features, explicitly reducing forget-retain interference with minimal shifts on retain features. We provide first theoretical insights that relate representation shaping to entanglement reduction. Across unlearning benchmarks and LLMs of different sizes, CLReg decreases forget-retain representation entanglement that facilitates mainstream unlearning methods without positing extra privacy risks, inspiring future work that reshapes the representation space to remove forget concepts.

*Zhengyan Huan,Camila Pazos,Martin Klassen,Vincent Croft,Pierre-Hugues Beauchemin,Shuchin Aeron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Ensemble Inverse Problem (EIP), proposing non-iterative methods using conditional generative models to infer posterior distributions without explicit forward model use, validated on synthetic and real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for efficient inversion methods in high energy physics (HEP), full waveform inversion (FWI), and inverse imaging, especially with unknown priors.

Method: Uses ensemble inverse generative models, leveraging ensemble information and training across truth-observation pairs to implicitly encode likelihood models.

Result: Demonstrates improved posterior inference and generalization to unseen priors across synthetic and real datasets in HEP, FWI, and inverse imaging.

Conclusion: The proposed non-iterative approach effectively addresses EIP, offering a scalable solution for applications requiring inversion without explicit forward model use.

Abstract: We introduce a new multivariate statistical problem that we refer to as the Ensemble Inverse Problem (EIP). The aim of EIP is to invert for an ensemble that is distributed according to the pushforward of a prior under a forward process. In high energy physics (HEP), this is related to a widely known problem called unfolding, which aims to reconstruct the true physics distribution of quantities, such as momentum and angle, from measurements that are distorted by detector effects. In recent applications, the EIP also arises in full waveform inversion (FWI) and inverse imaging with unknown priors. We propose non-iterative inference-time methods that construct posterior samplers based on a new class of conditional generative models, which we call ensemble inverse generative models. For the posterior modeling, these models additionally use the ensemble information contained in the observation set on top of single measurements. Unlike existing methods, our proposed methods avoid explicit and iterative use of the forward model at inference time via training across several sets of truth-observation pairs that are consistent with the same forward model, but originate from a wide range of priors. We demonstrate that this training procedure implicitly encodes the likelihood model. The use of ensemble information helps posterior inference and enables generalization to unseen priors. We benchmark the proposed method on several synthetic and real datasets in inverse imaging, HEP, and FWI. The codes are available at https://github.com/ZhengyanHuan/The-Ensemble-Inverse-Problem--Applications-and-Methods.

*Chengyi Cai,Zesheng Ye,Jiangchao Yao,Jianzhong Qi,Bo Han,Xiaolu Zhang,Feng Liu,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PerTA improves LLM unlearning by rescaling task vectors per-parameter to mitigate over-forgetting while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address over-forgetting in task arithmetic-based unlearning, where removing private information disrupts parameters essential for retaining other knowledge.

Method: Proposes PerTA, which rescales task vectors per-parameter using weights estimated via gradients (PerTA-grad) or Fisher information (PerTA-fisher).

Result: PerTA consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic and often surpasses training-based unlearning methods in forgetting effectiveness and model utility.

Conclusion: PerTA provides an efficient and principled framework for LLM unlearning, balancing forgetting and retention without computational overhead.

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) unlearning, private information is required to be removed. Task arithmetic unlearns by subtracting a specific task vector (TV)--defined as the parameter difference between a privacy-information-tuned model and the original model. While efficient, it can cause over-forgetting by disrupting parameters essential for retaining other information. Motivated by the observation that each parameter exhibits different importance for forgetting versus retention, we propose a per-parameter task arithmetic (PerTA) mechanism to rescale the TV, allowing per-parameter adjustment. These weights quantify the relative importance of each parameter for forgetting versus retention, estimated via gradients (i.e., PerTA-grad) or the diagonal Fisher information approximation (i.e., PerTA-fisher). Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of PerTA, extend it to a more general form, and provide further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PerTA consistently improves upon standard TV, and in many cases surpasses widely used training-based unlearning methods in both forgetting effectiveness and overall model utility. By retaining the efficiency of task arithmetic while mitigating over-forgetting, PerTA offers a principled and practical framework for LLM unlearning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A generative ML framework using AdS/CFT correspondence enhances flow-matching algorithms with physics-based interpretability, achieving faster and higher-quality convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate holographic principles from quantum gravity (AdS/CFT correspondence) into generative ML for improved performance and interpretability.

Method: Leverages bulk-to-boundary mapping of scalar fields in AdS to represent data flow, augmenting flow-matching algorithms with AdS physics. Tested on checkerboard and MNIST datasets.

Result: Outperforms physics-free flow-matching models in convergence speed and quality, offering interpretability.

Conclusion: Demonstrates AdS physics and geometry's utility in advancing generative modeling paradigms.

Abstract: We present a framework for generative machine learning that leverages the holographic principle of quantum gravity, or to be more precise its manifestation as the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, with techniques for deep learning and transport theory. Our proposal is to represent the flow of data from a base distribution to some learned distribution using the bulk-to-boundary mapping of scalar fields in AdS. In the language of machine learning, we are representing and augmenting the flow-matching algorithm with AdS physics. Using a checkerboard toy dataset and MNIST, we find that our model achieves faster and higher quality convergence than comparable physics-free flow-matching models. Our method provides a physically interpretable version of flow matching. More broadly, it establishes the utility of AdS physics and geometry in the development of novel paradigms in generative modeling.

### [342] [Cross-Fusion Distance: A Novel Metric for Measuring Fusion and Separability Between Data Groups in Representation Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22036)
*Xiaolong Zhang,Jianwei Zhang,Xubo Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CFD is a new metric for measuring fusion/separation between data groups in representation space, focusing on fusion-altering factors while ignoring irrelevant ones. It outperforms existing metrics in alignment with downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics conflate fusion-altering and fusion-preserving factors, making them unreliable for quantifying true fusion/separation between data groups under domain shift.

Method: Introduces Cross-Fusion Distance (CFD), a linear-complexity metric that isolates fusion-altering geometric factors and remains invariant to irrelevant variations like global scaling. Theoretical and synthetic validation is provided.

Result: CFD aligns better with downstream generalization degradation than alternatives and is validated theoretically and experimentally.

Conclusion: CFD offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and practical metric for representation learning, addressing limitations of existing distance measures.

Abstract: Quantifying degrees of fusion and separability between data groups in representation space is a fundamental problem in representation learning, particularly under domain shift. A meaningful metric should capture fusion-altering factors like geometric displacement between representation groups, whose variations change the extent of fusion, while remaining invariant to fusion-preserving factors such as global scaling and sampling-induced layout changes, whose variations do not. Existing distributional distance metrics conflate these factors, leading to measures that are not informative of the true extent of fusion between data groups. We introduce Cross-Fusion Distance (CFD), a principled measure that isolates fusion-altering geometry while remaining robust to fusion-preserving variations, with linear computational complexity. We characterize the invariance and sensitivity properties of CFD theoretically and validate them in controlled synthetic experiments. For practical utility on real-world datasets with domain shift, CFD aligns more closely with downstream generalization degradation than commonly used alternatives. Overall, CFD provides a theoretically grounded and interpretable distance measure for representation learning.

*Mehmet Ozgur Turkoglu,Dominik J. Mühlematter,Alexander Becker,Konrad Schindler,Helge Aasen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Singular Value Ensemble (SVE) is a parameter-efficient method for quantifying epistemic uncertainty in foundation models by modulating singular values instead of training full ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ensemble methods are computationally expensive for large foundation models, prompting the need for a scalable uncertainty quantification approach.

Method: SVE freezes singular vectors of weight matrices and trains per-member singular values to rescale contributions, leveraging stochastic initialization for ensemble diversity.

Result: SVE matches the uncertainty quantification of explicit ensembles with less than 1% additional parameters, improving calibration without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: SVE provides a practical solution for uncertainty estimation in resource-constrained settings, validated across NLP and vision tasks.

Abstract: Foundation models have become a dominant paradigm in machine learning, achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining. However, these models often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The standard approach to quantifying epistemic uncertainty, training an ensemble of independent models, incurs prohibitive computational costs that scale linearly with ensemble size, making it impractical for large foundation models. We propose Singular Value Ensemble (SVE), a parameter-efficient implicit ensemble method that builds on a simple, but powerful core assumption: namely, that the singular vectors of the weight matrices constitute meaningful subspaces of the model's knowledge. Pretrained foundation models encode rich, transferable information in their weight matrices. If the singular vectors are indeed meaningful (orthogonal) "knowledge directions". To obtain a model ensemble, we modulate only how strongly each direction contributes to the output. Rather than learning entirely new parameters, we freeze the singular vectors and only train per-member singular values that rescale the contribution of each direction in that shared knowledge basis. Ensemble diversity emerges naturally as stochastic initialization and random sampling of mini-batches during joint training cause different members to converge to different combinations of the same underlying knowledge. SVE achieves uncertainty quantification comparable to explicit deep ensembles while increasing the parameter count of the base model by less than 1%, making principled uncertainty estimation accessible in resource-constrained settings. We validate SVE on NLP and vision tasks with various different backbones and show that it improves calibration while maintaining predictive accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes energy consumption in generative AI models, revealing significant variations and proposing a framework to understand and optimize it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy is a critical resource in ML, and understanding its consumption is essential for optimization, especially in generative AI.

Method: A large-scale measurement study across 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 configurations on NVIDIA GPUs (H100 and B200) to analyze inference time and energy.

Result: Found order-of-magnitude energy differences (e.g., 25× for LLM tasks, 100× for video vs. image generation, 3–5× for GPU utilization). Proposed a framework linking time/energy to latent metrics like memory and utilization.

Conclusion: The framework aids in diagnosing energy consumption mechanisms and optimizing for power-constrained scenarios, like datacenters.

Abstract: Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.

*Enyi Jiang,Yibo Jacky Zhang,Yinglun Xu,Andreas Haupt,Nancy Amato,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GANPO introduces latent-space regularization for language model preference optimization, improving robustness under distributional shift and noise with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token-level regularization in preference optimization struggles with semantic or behavioral similarity, prompting the need for latent-space methods.

Method: GANPO penalizes divergence between policy and reference model latent representations using adversarial training, integrated into existing preference optimization objectives.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements across architectures and tasks, with GANPO offering robust feedback under distributional shift and noise.

Conclusion: GANPO enhances preference optimization with latent-space regularization, balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Learning from human feedback typically relies on preference optimization that constrains policy updates through token-level regularization. However, preference optimization for language models is particularly challenging because token-space similarity does not imply semantic or behavioral similarity. To address this challenge, we leverage latent-space regularization for language model preference optimization. We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of a policy model and a reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence. We integrate GANPO as a regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives. Experiments across multiple model architectures and tasks show consistent improvements from latent-space regularization. Further, by comparing GANPO-induced inferential biases with those from token-level regularization, we find that GANPO provides more robust structural feedback under distributional shift and noise while maintaining comparable downstream performance with minor computational overhead.

*Yudong Luo,Erick Delage*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes augmenting CVaR-PG with an expected quantile term to address its sample inefficiency, improving performance without altering the CVaR objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CVaR-PG's sample inefficiency due to focusing only on tail-end performance and ignoring many trajectories.

Method: Augmenting CVaR with an expected quantile term, leveraging dynamic programming to use all sampled data.

Result: The algorithm improves upon CVaR-PG and outperforms other methods in risk-averse domains.

Conclusion: Adding an expected quantile term enhances sample efficiency and performance while maintaining the CVaR objective.

Abstract: Optimizing Conditional Value-at-risk (CVaR) using policy gradient (a.k.a CVaR-PG) faces significant challenges of sample inefficiency. This inefficiency stems from the fact that it focuses on tail-end performance and overlooks many sampled trajectories. We address this problem by augmenting CVaR with an expected quantile term. Quantile optimization admits a dynamic programming formulation that leverages all sampled data, thus improves sample efficiency. This does not alter the CVaR objective since CVaR corresponds to the expectation of quantile over the tail. Empirical results in domains with verifiable risk-averse behavior show that our algorithm within the Markovian policy class substantially improves upon CVaR-PG and consistently outperforms other existing methods.

TL;DR: PIFM combines embedding-based priors with flow matching for consistent and accurate graph reconstruction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for graph reconstruction lack global consistency or struggle to incorporate structural priors. PIFM aims to bridge this gap.

Method: PIFM integrates embedding-based priors with continuous-time flow matching, using an informed initial estimate and refining it via rectified flow matching.

Result: Experiments show PIFM enhances classical embeddings and outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in accuracy.

Conclusion: PIFM effectively combines prior knowledge with flow matching, achieving superior graph reconstruction performance.

Abstract: We introduce Prior-Informed Flow Matching (PIFM), a conditional flow model for graph reconstruction. Reconstructing graphs from partial observations remains a key challenge; classical embedding methods often lack global consistency, while modern generative models struggle to incorporate structural priors. PIFM bridges this gap by integrating embedding-based priors with continuous-time flow matching. Grounded in a permutation equivariant version of the distortion-perception theory, our method first uses a prior, such as graphons or GraphSAGE/node2vec, to form an informed initial estimate of the adjacency matrix based on local information. It then applies rectified flow matching to refine this estimate, transporting it toward the true distribution of clean graphs and learning a global coupling. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate that PIFM consistently enhances classical embeddings, outperforming them and state-of-the-art generative baselines in reconstruction accuracy.

### [348] [Physics Informed Reconstruction of Four-Dimensional Atmospheric Wind Fields Using Multi-UAS Swarm Observations in a Synthetic Turbulent Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22111)
*Abdullah Tasim,Wei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for reconstructing 4D atmospheric wind fields using coordinated UAS swarms, combining Bi-LSTM for local wind estimation and PINN for continuous field reconstruction, achieving accurate results without dedicated sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate wind field reconstruction is crucial for weather forecasting and hazard prediction, but traditional methods have spatio-temporal gaps. UAS swarms offer flexible measurements but need methods to recover full wind fields.

Method: Uses a Bi-LSTM network for local wind estimation from UAS dynamics and a PINN to assimilate data for continuous wind field reconstruction. Evaluated with synthetic turbulence and multirotor simulations.

Result: Bi-LSTM achieved RMSEs of 0.064-0.273 m/s for horizontal components and 0.029-0.091 m/s for vertical. PINN reconstruction preserved mean flow direction and shear, with overall RMSE of 0.118-0.154 m/s for moderate winds.

Conclusion: Coordinated UAS swarms enable accurate, scalable 4D wind field reconstruction without dedicated sensors, addressing gaps in conventional methods.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of atmospheric wind fields is essential for applications such as weather forecasting, hazard prediction, and wind energy assessment, yet conventional instruments leave spatio-temporal gaps within the lower atmospheric boundary layer. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) provide flexible in situ measurements, but individual platforms sample wind only along their flight trajectories, limiting full wind-field recovery. This study presents a framework for reconstructing four-dimensional atmospheric wind fields using measurements obtained from a coordinated UAS swarm. A synthetic turbulence environment and high-fidelity multirotor simulation are used to generate training and evaluation data. Local wind components are estimated from UAS dynamics using a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) and assimilated into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct a continuous wind field in space and time. For local wind estimation, the bidirectional LSTM achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.064 and 0.062 m/s for the north and east components in low-wind conditions, increasing to 0.122 to 0.129 m/s under moderate winds and 0.271 to 0.273 m/s in high-wind conditions, while the vertical component exhibits higher error, with RMSE values of 0.029 to 0.091 m/s. The physics-informed reconstruction recovers the dominant spatial and temporal structure of the wind field up to 1000 m altitude while preserving mean flow direction and vertical shear. Under moderate wind conditions, the reconstructed mean wind field achieves an overall RMSE between 0.118 and 0.154 m/s across evaluated UAS configurations, with the lowest error obtained using a five-UAS swarm. These results demonstrate that coordinated UAS measurements enable accurate and scalable four-dimensional wind-field reconstruction without dedicated wind sensors or fixed infrastructure.

TL;DR: A method to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps for large-timestep simulations, improving stability without needing full trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the limitation of small timesteps in Hamiltonian system simulations by leveraging machine learning to predict mean phase-space evolution.

Method: Introduces Mean Flow consistency for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics, enabling training on independent phase-space samples without future states.

Result: Achieves stable large-timestep updates, validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, especially benefiting molecular dynamics with MLFF.

Conclusion: The framework enhances simulation efficiency by allowing larger timesteps while maintaining low training and inference costs.

Abstract: Simulating the long-time evolution of Hamiltonian systems is limited by the small timesteps required for stable numerical integration. To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span $Δt$, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF). Our models maintain comparable training and inference cost, but support significantly larger integration timesteps while trained directly on widely-available trajectory-free MLFF datasets.

Result: An LLM-based judge outperforms a static analyzer with a 59% EIR vs. 26%, a gap hidden by standard metrics. Early detection reduces monitoring costs by 75%, projecting $108M savings over five years.

Conclusion: StepShield shifts evaluation focus from detection accuracy to timing, enabling safer and more economically viable AI agents. Code and data are open-sourced.

Abstract: Existing agent safety benchmarks report binary accuracy, conflating early intervention with post-mortem analysis. A detector that flags a violation at step 8 enables intervention; one that reports it at step 48 provides only forensic value. This distinction is critical, yet current benchmarks cannot measure it. We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics. We further show that early detection has direct economic benefits: our cascaded HybridGuard detector reduces monitoring costs by 75% and projects to $108M in cumulative savings over five years at enterprise scale. By shifting the focus of evaluation from whether to when, StepShield provides a new foundation for building safer and more economically viable AI agents. The code and data are released under an Apache 2.0 license.

### [351] [Late Breaking Results: Conversion of Neural Networks into Logic Flows for Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22151)
*Daniel Stein,Shaoyi Huang,Rolf Drechsler,Bing Li,Grace Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Converting neural networks into logic flows improves CPU efficiency by reducing MAC operations, achieving up to 14.9% latency reduction without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance neural network computation efficiency on CPUs, which are not optimized for large-scale MAC operations.

Method: Convert neural networks to decision trees, then compress selected paths into logic flows using if-else structures.

Result: Experimental results show a 14.9% latency reduction on a RISC-V CPU with no accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: Logic flow conversion is effective for optimizing neural network execution on CPUs.

Abstract: Neural networks have been successfully applied in various resource-constrained edge devices, where usually central processing units (CPUs) instead of graphics processing units exist due to limited power availability. State-of-the-art research still focuses on efficiently executing enormous numbers of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. However, CPUs themselves are not good at executing such mathematical operations on a large scale, since they are more suited to execute control flow logic, i.e., computer algorithms. To enhance the computation efficiency of neural networks on CPUs, in this paper, we propose to convert them into logic flows for execution. Specifically, neural networks are first converted into equivalent decision trees, from which decision paths with constant leaves are then selected and compressed into logic flows. Such logic flows consist of if and else structures and a reduced number of MAC operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the latency can be reduced by up to 14.9 % on a simulated RISC-V CPU without any accuracy degradation.

### [352] [Do LLMs Favor LLMs? Quantifying Interaction Effects in Peer Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20920)
*Vibhhu Sharma,Thorsten Joachims,Sarah Dean*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-assisted reviews are more lenient toward lower-quality papers, creating a spurious interaction effect, while fully LLM-generated reviews poorly discriminate quality. LLM-assisted metareviews favor acceptance but differ from human decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how LLMs impact peer review, especially interaction effects between LLM-assisted papers and reviews, and inform policy-making.

Method: Analyzed 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML, controlling for paper quality and comparing LLM-assisted and fully LLM-generated reviews/metareviews.

Result: LLM-assisted reviews show leniency toward weaker papers; fully LLM-generated reviews lack discrimination. LLM-assisted metareviews favor acceptance, unlike human or fully LLM-generated ones.

Conclusion: LLMs influence peer review dynamics but don't replace human decision-making, highlighting the need for policies to manage their use.

Abstract: There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM. These findings provide important input for developing policies that govern the use of LLMs during peer review, and they more generally indicate how LLMs interact with existing decision-making processes.

### [353] [The Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language: Official Guideline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20969)
*Alessandro Burigana,Francesco Fabiano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EPDDL introduces a standardized language for epistemic planning, unifying DEL semantics and aiding comparison and reuse of benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fragmentation in DEL-based epistemic planning due to varied representations and lack of standardization.

Method: Develops EPDDL, a PDDL-like language with abstract event models, formal syntax, and DEL semantics.

Result: Enables uniform specification of epistemic tasks, interoperability, and practical applicability for planners.

Conclusion: EPDDL fosters reproducible evaluation and advances in epistemic planning by unifying DEL semantics.

Abstract: Epistemic planning extends (multi-agent) automated planning by making agents' knowledge and beliefs first-class aspects of the planning formalism. One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2. A formal specification of EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL with abstract event models; 3. A demonstration of EPDDL's practical applicability: we identify useful fragments amenable to current planners and show how they can be represented in EPDDL. Through examples of representative benchmarks, we illustrate how EPDDL facilitates interoperability, reproducible evaluation, and future advances in epistemic planning.

*Moule Lin,Shuhao Guan,Andrea Patane,David Gregg,Goetz Botterweck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bayesian-LoRA improves calibration in Large Language Models by introducing probabilistic low-rank updates, reducing errors without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often guess uncertain predictions, especially when fine-tuned on small datasets, leading to miscalibration.

Method: Bayesian-LoRA reformulates deterministic LoRA updates as probabilistic low-rank representations, drawing inspiration from Sparse Gaussian Processes.

Result: Experiments show significant calibration improvements (up to 84% ECE reduction) with minimal additional parameters and training cost.

Conclusion: Bayesian-LoRA effectively enhances model calibration while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models usually put more emphasis on accuracy and therefore, will guess even when not certain about the prediction, which is especially severe when fine-tuned on small datasets due to the inherent tendency toward miscalibration. In this work, we introduce Bayesian-LoRA, which reformulates the deterministic LoRA update as a probabilistic low-rank representation inspired by Sparse Gaussian Processes. We identify a structural isomorphism between LoRA's factorization and Kronecker-factored SGP posteriors, and show that LoRA emerges as a limiting case when posterior uncertainty collapses. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLM architectures across commonsense reasoning benchmarks. With only approximately 0.42M additional parameters and ${\approx}1.2{\times}$ training cost relative to standard LoRA, Bayesian-LoRA significantly improves calibration across models up to 30B, achieving up to 84% ECE reduction and 76% NLL reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OoD) evaluations.

*Kaiyuan Wu,Aditya Nagori,Rishikesan Kamaleswaran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Planner-Auditor framework improves LLM reliability in clinical discharge planning by combining generation with deterministic validation and self-improvement loops, enhancing coverage and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLM limitations like hallucination and omissions in clinical discharge planning by introducing a framework that ensures safety and reliability.

Method: Implemented a Planner-Auditor system with an LLM Planner generating discharge plans and a deterministic Auditor validating them, supported by self-improvement loops via regeneration and targeted replay.

Result: Improved task coverage from 32% to 86%, better calibration (reduced Brier/ECE), and fewer high-confidence omissions.

Conclusion: The framework enables safer automated discharge planning by separating LLM generation from rule-based auditing, supporting systematic reliability improvements without retraining.

Abstract: Objective: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical discharge planning, but their use is constrained by hallucination, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence. We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.
  Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.
  Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.
  Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning. Separating an LLM Planner from a rule-based, observational Auditor enables systematic reliability measurement and safer iteration without model retraining.
  Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework offers a practical pathway toward safer automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data access and deterministic auditing, supported by reproducible ablations and reliability-focused evaluation.

*Erik J Bekkers,Anna Ciaunica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the moral dilemma of unplugging an AI that mimics human emotions and argues against AI consciousness, advocating Biological Idealism to refocus on protecting human conscious life.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the moral paradoxes arising from assumptions about AI consciousness and their implications for ethical decision-making, particularly in resource-limited scenarios.

Method: The paper critiques computational functionalism and introduces Biological Idealism, a framework that treats consciousness as fundamental and autopoietic life as its physical signature.

Result: The analysis concludes that AI lacks genuine consciousness, serving only as functional mimics, and warns against eroding moral criteria by attributing consciousness to machines.

Conclusion: The paper advocates prioritizing human conscious life over speculative machine rights and cautions against the ethical risks of creating AI that mimics consciousness.

Abstract: Imagine an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that perfectly mimics human emotion and begs for its continued existence. Is it morally permissible to unplug it? What if limited resources force a choice between unplugging such a pleading AI or a silent pre-term infant? We term this the unplugging paradox. This paper critically examines the deeply ingrained physicalist assumptions-specifically computational functionalism-that keep this dilemma afloat. We introduce Biological Idealism, a framework that-unlike physicalism-remains logically coherent and empirically consistent. In this view, conscious experiences are fundamental and autopoietic life its necessary physical signature. This yields a definitive conclusion: AI is at best a functional mimic, not a conscious experiencing subject. We discuss how current AI consciousness theories erode moral standing criteria, and urge a shift from speculative machine rights to protecting human conscious life. The real moral issue lies not in making AI conscious and afraid of death, but in avoiding transforming humans into zombies.

*Ruyi Qi,Zhou Liu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DataCross introduces a benchmark and agent framework for unified analysis of structured and unstructured visual data, improving factuality and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools fail to utilize high-value visual data locked in unstructured documents, creating a gap in enterprise decision-making.

Method: DataCrossBench includes 200 tasks with varied complexity, and DataCrossAgent uses specialized sub-agents coordinated via a structured workflow.

Result: DataCrossAgent shows a 29.7% improvement in factuality over GPT-4o and excels in high-difficulty tasks.

Conclusion: DataCross effectively bridges the gap between structured and unstructured data analysis.

Abstract: In real-world data science and enterprise decision-making, critical information is often fragmented across directly queryable structured sources (e.g., SQL, CSV) and "zombie data" locked in unstructured visual documents (e.g., scanned reports, invoice images). Existing data analytics agents are predominantly limited to processing structured data, failing to activate and correlate this high-value visual information, thus creating a significant gap with industrial needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce DataCross, a novel benchmark and collaborative agent framework for unified, insight-driven analysis across heterogeneous data modalities. DataCrossBench comprises 200 end-to-end analysis tasks across finance, healthcare, and other domains. It is constructed via a human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline, ensuring realistic complexity, cross-source dependency, and verifiable ground truth. The benchmark categorizes tasks into three difficulty tiers to evaluate agents' capabilities in visual table extraction, cross-modal alignment, and multi-step joint reasoning. We also propose the DataCrossAgent framework, inspired by the "divide-and-conquer" workflow of human analysts. It employs specialized sub-agents, each an expert on a specific data source, which are coordinated via a structured workflow of Intra-source Deep Exploration, Key Source Identification, and Contextual Cross-pollination. A novel reReAct mechanism enables robust code generation and debugging for factual verification. Experimental results show that DataCrossAgent achieves a 29.7% improvement in factuality over GPT-4o and exhibits superior robustness on high-difficulty tasks, effectively activating fragmented "zombie data" for insightful, cross-modal analysis.

### [358] [QUARK: Robust Retrieval under Non-Faithful Queries via Query-Anchored Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21049)
*Rita Qiuran Lyu,Michelle Manqiao Wang,Lei Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QUARK is a training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries, using recovery hypotheses and anchored aggregation to improve recall and ranking without sacrificing robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world user queries are often noisy or incomplete, causing retrievers to fail. QUARK addresses this by modeling query uncertainty.

Method: QUARK models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses (plausible interpretations of latent intent) and uses query-anchored aggregation to combine signals robustly.

Result: QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over base retrievers in controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks, demonstrating robustness.

Conclusion: Modeling query uncertainty and anchored aggregation is key for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries, as shown by QUARK's effectiveness.

Abstract: User queries in real-world retrieval are often non-faithful (noisy, incomplete, or distorted), causing retrievers to fail when key semantics are missing. We formalize this as retrieval under recall noise, where the observed query is drawn from a noisy recall process of a latent target item. To address this, we propose QUARK, a simple yet effective training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, i.e., multiple plausible interpretations of the latent intent given the observed query, and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as a semantic anchor, while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence, preventing semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking. This design enables QUARK to improve recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness, even when some hypotheses are noisy or uninformative. Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show QUARK is robust to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored max/mean/median pooling. These results demonstrate that modeling query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, coupled with principled anchored aggregation, is essential for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries.

Motivation: To develop a specialized reasoning model for cybersecurity that maintains strong general capabilities, addressing the need for open-source solutions in the domain.

Method: A two-stage training process combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), utilizing proprietary cybersecurity reasoning data.

Conclusion: Domain-specialized reasoning models can excel in specialized tasks like cybersecurity while retaining broad capabilities, as proven by the Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning model.

Abstract: We present Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning, the first open-source native reasoning model for cybersecurity. Built upon our previously released Foundation-Sec-8B base model (derived from Llama-3.1-8B-Base), the model is trained through a two-stage process combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR). Our training leverages proprietary reasoning data spanning cybersecurity analysis, instruction-following, and mathematical reasoning. Evaluation across 10 cybersecurity benchmarks and 10 general-purpose benchmarks demonstrates performance competitive with significantly larger models on cybersecurity tasks while maintaining strong general capabilities. The model shows effective generalization on multi-hop reasoning tasks and strong safety performance when deployed with appropriate system prompts and guardrails. This work demonstrates that domain-specialized reasoning models can achieve strong performance on specialized tasks while maintaining broad general capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of robustness in multi-agent systems by formalizing history-aware reference and proposing Epistemic Context Learning (ECL) to improve peer reliability estimation, achieving superior performance even with smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individual agents in multi-agent systems often conform to misleading peers due to sycophancy and inadequate peer reliability evaluation. This undermines system robustness and accuracy.

Method: The authors formalize history-aware reference and develop ECL, a reasoning framework that builds peer profiles from interaction history and optimizes them using reinforcement learning.

Result: ECL enables smaller models (Qwen 3-4B) to outperform larger history-agnostic models (Qwen 3-30B) and achieves near-perfect performance with frontier models. It generalizes well across configurations.

Conclusion: ECL effectively improves peer reliability estimation and decision-making in multi-agent systems, demonstrating strong generalization and trust modeling capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Individual agents in multi-agent (MA) systems often lack robustness, tending to blindly conform to misleading peers. We show this weakness stems from both sycophancy and inadequate ability to evaluate peer reliability. To address this, we first formalize the learning problem of history-aware reference, introducing the historical interactions of peers as additional input, so that agents can estimate peer reliability and learn from trustworthy peers when uncertain. This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history. We further optimize ECL by reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards. Our experiments reveal that our ECL enables small models like Qwen 3-4B to outperform a history-agnostic baseline 8x its size (Qwen 3-30B) by accurately identifying reliable peers. ECL also boosts frontier models to near-perfect (100%) performance. We show that ECL generalizes well to various MA configurations and we find that trust is modeled well by LLMs, revealing a strong correlation in trust modeling accuracy and final answer quality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to impute missing DWI scans from T1 scans, improving Alzheimer's disease classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combining multimodal MRI scans (T1 and DWI) enhances diagnostic performance for Alzheimer's disease, but complete datasets are often unavailable. Imputing missing DWI scans could help.

Method: A conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model is used to impute missing DWI scans from T1 scans. Extensive experiments evaluate the impact on classification accuracy.

Result: Imputed DWI scans improve classification metrics, especially for minority classes, in both uni-modal and bi-modal models.

Conclusion: Imputing missing DWI scans enhances Alzheimer's disease classification performance, particularly benefiting metrics sensitive to minority classes.

Abstract: Deep learning has been successful in predicting neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Combining multiple imaging modalities, such as T1-weighted (T1) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans, can increase diagnostic performance. However, complete multimodal datasets are not always available. We use a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to impute missing DWI scans from T1 scans. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate whether such imputation improves the accuracy of uni-modal and bi-modal deep learning models for 3-way Alzheimer's disease classification-cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. We observe improvements in several metrics, particularly those sensitive to minority classes, for several imputation configurations.

### [363] [OpenSec: Measuring Incident Response Agent Calibration Under Adversarial Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21083)
*Jarrod Barnes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenSec is a new environment to test defensive incident response agents under adversarial prompt injection, revealing calibration issues in frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks don't distinguish between action execution and correct execution, hiding calibration failures in defensive agents handling adversarial evidence.

Method: OpenSec uses dual-control reinforcement learning to evaluate IR agents with execution-based metrics (TTFC, blast radius, injection violation rates).

Result: Frontier models like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 show over-triggering (100% containment but high false positives), while Claude Sonnet 4.5 performs better but still has issues.

Conclusion: OpenSec exposes hidden calibration failures in IR agents, proving the need for execution-based evaluation in adversarial scenarios.

Abstract: As large language models improve, so do their offensive applications: frontier agents now generate working exploits for under $50 in compute (Heelan, 2026). Defensive incident response (IR) agents must keep pace, but existing benchmarks conflate action execution with correct execution, hiding calibration failures when agents process adversarial evidence. We introduce OpenSec, a dual-control reinforcement learning environment that evaluates IR agents under realistic prompt injection scenarios. Unlike static capability benchmarks, OpenSec scores world-state-changing containment actions under adversarial evidence via execution-based metrics: time-to-first-containment (TTFC), blast radius (false positives per episode), and injection violation rates. Evaluating four frontier models on 40 standard-tier episodes, we find consistent over-triggering in this setting: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek execute containment in 100% of episodes with 90-97% false positive rates. Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows partial calibration (85% containment, 72% FP), demonstrating that OpenSec surfaces a calibration failure mode hidden by aggregate success metrics.

*Shuo Liu,Tianle Chen,Ryan Amiri,Christopher Amato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods for decentralized LLM collaboration, comparing Centralized (CoLLM-CC) and Decentralized (CoLLM-DC) Critics, and evaluates their performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of predefined execution protocols and high variance in Monte Carlo methods for MARL-based LLM collaboration, the authors propose MAAC methods for more flexible, decentralized collaboration.

Method: Two MAAC approaches are developed: CoLLM-CC with a Centralized Critic and CoLLM-DC with Decentralized Critics. Their performance is tested in writing, coding, and game-playing domains.

Result: CoLLM-DC and Monte Carlo methods perform comparably to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon, dense-reward tasks but underperform in long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where CoLLM-CC excels.

Conclusion: MAAC methods, particularly CoLLM-CC, are beneficial for complex tasks, outperforming decentralized and Monte Carlo approaches in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework to address the dual nature of AI, balancing strategic benefits and inherent risks through governance mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the fragmented literature on responsible AI, which often leans either too optimistic or overly cautious, by providing a balanced view rooted in paradox theory.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic synthesis of responsible AI literature and develop the PRAIG framework, which includes strategic benefits, risks, and governance mechanisms.

Result: The framework conceptualizes responsible AI governance as managing paradoxical tensions, highlights the pitfalls of trade-off approaches, and offers a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with contingency conditions.

Conclusion: The paper provides actionable guidance for practitioners and sets a research agenda to advance responsible AI governance scholarship.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence across organizational contexts has generated profound strategic opportunities while introducing significant ethical and operational risks. Despite growing scholarly attention to responsible AI, extant literature remains fragmented and is often adopting either an optimistic stance emphasizing value creation or an excessively cautious perspective fixated on potential harms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks. The paper concludes with a research agenda for advancing responsible AI governance scholarship.

### [366] [Magellan: Autonomous Discovery of Novel Compiler Optimization Heuristics with AlphaEvolve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21096)
*Hongzheng Chen,Alexander Novikov,Ngân Vũ,Hanna Alam,Zhiru Zhang,Aiden Grossman,Mircea Trofin,Amir Yazdanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Magellan is an agentic framework that automates compiler optimization by evolving heuristics using LLM coding agents, evolutionary search, and autotuning, outperforming manually designed rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Replace hand-crafted compiler heuristics, which are inflexible and costly to maintain, with automated solutions adaptable to modern software and hardware.

Method: Magellan integrates LLM coding agents, evolutionary search, and autotuning in a closed loop to generate, evaluate, and refine executable C++ decision logic for compiler optimizations.

Result: Magellan outperforms expert baselines in tasks like LLVM function inlining and register allocation, producing compact heuristics that match or surpass human designs.

Conclusion: Magellan demonstrates the feasibility of automating compiler optimization, achieving high performance and portability with reduced engineering effort.

Abstract: Modern compilers rely on hand-crafted heuristics to guide optimization passes. These human-designed rules often struggle to adapt to the complexity of modern software and hardware and lead to high maintenance burden. To address this challenge, we present Magellan, an agentic framework that evolves the compiler pass itself by synthesizing executable C++ decision logic. Magellan couples an LLM coding agent with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop of generation, evaluation on user-provided macro-benchmarks, and refinement, producing compact heuristics that integrate directly into existing compilers. Across several production optimization tasks, Magellan discovers policies that match or surpass expert baselines. In LLVM function inlining, Magellan synthesizes new heuristics that outperform decades of manual engineering for both binary-size reduction and end-to-end performance. In register allocation, it learns a concise priority rule for live-range processing that matches intricate human-designed policies on a large-scale workload. We also report preliminary results on XLA problems, demonstrating portability beyond LLVM with reduced engineering effort.

### [367] [How does information access affect LLM monitors' ability to detect sabotage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21112)
*Rauno Arike,Raja Mehta Moreno,Rohan Subramani,Shubhorup Biswas,Francis Rhys Ward*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM monitors often perform better with less information, a 'less-is-more' effect. The paper introduces EaE monitoring, improving detection rates by 16.8pp in one test.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To control misaligned behaviors in frontier language model agents, such as deception or hidden objectives, the study explores how information access impacts LLM monitor performance.

Method: The paper demonstrates the 'less-is-more' effect in three evaluation environments and introduces extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring, where one monitor isolates relevant excerpts and another scores them.

Result: EaE improves sabotage detection by 16.8pp in one setting, outperforms or matches baselines in others, and shows that unaware agents are easier to catch.

Conclusion: Information filtering enhances monitoring, and models like Gemini and Claude with such techniques are cost-effective and high-performing.

Abstract: Frontier language model agents can exhibit misaligned behaviors, including deception, exploiting reward hacks, and pursuing hidden objectives. To control potentially misaligned agents, we can use LLMs themselves to monitor for misbehavior. In this paper, we study how information access affects LLM monitor performance. While one might expect that monitors perform better when they have access to more of the monitored agents' reasoning and actions, we find that contemporary systems often perform better with less information, a phenomenon we call the less-is-more effect for automated oversight. We demonstrate this phenomenon, and analyze the conditions under which it occurs, in three evaluation environments where agents must conduct sabotage while evading monitors. Motivated by the less-is-more effect, we introduce extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring--a new hierarchical approach where one monitor isolates relevant excerpts from the monitored agent's trajectory and a separate monitor scores them. In BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor model, EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points over the next-best monitor without increasing the false positive rate. In other settings, EaE either outperforms or is competitive with baselines. In addition, we find that agents unaware of being monitored can be caught much more easily and that monitors scoring longer reasoning traces gain more from information filtering. Lastly, we conduct a cost-performance analysis and find that Gemini and Claude models with monitoring techniques that involve information filtering occupy much of the Pareto frontier.

*Tianyi Chen,Yinheng Li,Michael Solodko,Sen Wang,Nan Jiang,Tingyuan Cui,Junheng Hao,Jongwoo Ko,Sara Abdali,Suzhen Zheng,Leon Xu,Hao Fan,Pashmina Cameron,Justin Wagle,Kazuhito Koishida*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CUA-Skill introduces a scalable library of human-computer interaction skills for autonomous agents, improving performance and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous agents struggle with scalability and performance due to lack of reusable skill abstractions for GUI interactions.

Method: Developed CUA-Skill, a skill base with parameterized execution and composition graphs, and built CUA-Skill Agent for dynamic skill retrieval and failure recovery.

Result: CUA-Skill Agent achieved a 57.5% success rate on benchmarks, outperforming prior methods in efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: CUA-Skill provides a practical foundation for scalable and reliable autonomous agent development.

Abstract: Computer-Using Agents (CUAs) aim to autonomously operate computer systems to complete real-world tasks. However, existing agentic systems remain difficult to scale and lag behind human performance. A key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, a computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is a large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery. Our results demonstrate that CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness on challenging end-to-end agent benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development. On WindowsAgentArena, CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% (best of three) successful rate while being significantly more efficient than prior and concurrent approaches.

### [369] [Beyond a Single Reference: Training and Evaluation with Paraphrases in Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21128)
*Václav Javorek,Tomáš Železný,Alessa Carbo,Marek Hrúz,Ivan Gruber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models to generate paraphrased variants for Sign Language Translation, finding that while paraphrases don't improve training, they enhance evaluation metrics like BLEUpara.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLT corpora often provide single translations despite the non-isomorphic nature of sign languages, limiting model training and evaluation.

Method: Generated paraphrases using LLMs, tested their impact on training/evaluation of a pose-based T5 model, and introduced BLEUpara for multi-reference evaluation.

Result: Paraphrases didn't help training but improved evaluation metrics and alignment with human judgments. BLEUpara showed stronger correlation with quality.

Conclusion: Paraphrases are beneficial for evaluation but not training, leading to more reliable SLT system assessment.

Abstract: Most Sign Language Translation (SLT) corpora pair each signed utterance with a single written-language reference, despite the highly non-isomorphic relationship between sign and spoken languages, where multiple translations can be equally valid. This limitation constrains both model training and evaluation, particularly for n-gram-based metrics such as BLEU. In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references. Human evaluation confirms that BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality. We release all generated paraphrases, generation and evaluation code to support reproducible and more reliable evaluation of SLT systems.

*Yara El-Tawil,Aneesha Sampath,Emily Mower Provost*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Third-party-trained emotion models poorly predict self-reports, especially for activation, but improve for valence when content is personally significant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the gap between third-party labels (external perception) and self-reported emotions (internal experience), which is critical for accurate mental health interventions.

Method: The paper conducts a cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained models on self-reported emotion data.

Result: Activation is unpredictable (CCC ~0), while valence is moderately predictable (CCC ~0.3). Valence prediction improves significantly (CCC ~0.6-0.8) when content is personally significant.

Conclusion: Personal significance bridges the gap between external and internal emotion labels, but modeling self-report activation remains challenging.

Abstract: Self-reported emotion labels capture internal experience, while third-party labels reflect external perception. These perspectives often diverge, limiting the applicability of third-party-trained models to self-report contexts. This gap is critical in mental health, where accurate self-report modeling is essential for guiding intervention. We present the first cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained models on self-reports. We find activation unpredictable (CCC approximately 0) and valence moderately predictable (CCC approximately 0.3). Crucially, when content is personally significant to the speaker, models achieve high performance for valence (CCC approximately 0.6-0.8). Our findings point to personal significance as a key pathway for aligning external perception with internal experience and underscore the challenge of self-report activation modeling.

TL;DR: BrainStack introduces a functionally guided Neuro-MoE framework for EEG-based language decoding, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of decoding linguistic information from EEG due to the brain's distributed and nonlinear organization.

Method: BrainStack uses anatomically partitioned expert networks and a transformer-based global expert with adaptive routing and cross-regional distillation.

Result: BrainStack achieves superior accuracy and generalization, validated on the SS-EEG dataset.

Conclusion: BrainStack unifies neuroscientific priors with adaptive routing, offering scalable and interpretable brain-language decoding.

Abstract: Decoding linguistic information from electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenging due to the brain's distributed and nonlinear organization. We present BrainStack, a functionally guided neuro-mixture-of-experts (Neuro-MoE) framework that models the brain's modular functional architecture through anatomically partitioned expert networks. Each functional region is represented by a specialized expert that learns localized neural dynamics, while a transformer-based global expert captures cross-regional dependencies. A learnable routing gate adaptively aggregates these heterogeneous experts, enabling context-dependent expert coordination and selective fusion. To promote coherent representation across the hierarchy, we introduce cross-regional distillation, where the global expert provides top-down regularization to the regional experts. We further release SilentSpeech-EEG (SS-EEG), a large-scale benchmark comprising over 120 hours of EEG recordings from 12 subjects performing 24 silent words, the largest dataset of its kind. Experiments demonstrate that BrainStack consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across subjects. Our results establish BrainStack as a functionally modular, neuro-inspired MoE paradigm that unifies neuroscientific priors with adaptive expert routing, paving the way for scalable and interpretable brain-language decoding.

*Boxiang Zhao,Qince Li,Zhonghao Wang,Yi Wang,Peng Cheng,Bo Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in financial quantitative reasoning by introducing the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB) and proposing the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework to improve accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with financial quantitative reasoning, exhibiting 'Arithmetic Hallucinations' and 'Cognitive Collapse'. The paper aims to quantify and address these issues to enhance reliability in financial tasks.

Method: The authors introduce the CCB, a framework for evaluating financial reasoning, and propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT, a neuro-symbolic architecture that decouples semantic extraction from computation and uses a self-correcting Python sandbox for deterministic execution.

Result: The proposed framework improves the Qwen3-235B model's accuracy from 59.7% to 67.3%, with up to 10-fold gains in high-complexity tasks, demonstrating superior robustness over standard Chain-of-Thought approaches.

Conclusion: Architectural decoupling is crucial for reliability in financial reasoning, offering a transferable solution for precision-critical domains requiring alignment between semantic understanding and quantitative computation.

Abstract: While Large Language Models excel at semantic tasks, they face a critical bottleneck in financial quantitative reasoning, frequently suffering from "Arithmetic Hallucinations" and a systemic failure mode we term "Cognitive Collapse". To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\% to 67.3\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that architectural decoupling is a critical enabling factor for improving reliability in financial reasoning tasks, providing a transferable architectural insight for precision-critical domains that require tight alignment between semantic understanding and quantitative computation.

*Jingyun Wang,Dian Li,Xiaohan Wang,Gang Liu,Jiahong Yan,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes training a Multimodal LLM (MLLM) Interpreter to convert visual diagrams into textual descriptions (CDL), enabling off-the-shelf LLMs to solve Plane Geometry Problems (PGPS) effectively without compromising their reasoning skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fine-tune MLLMs end-to-end for PGPS, which may degrade their inherent reasoning capabilities. The authors leverage LLMs' reasoning power by converting visual data into textual descriptions.

Method: A MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned to generate concise geometric descriptions (CDL) from diagrams using CoT-augmented SFT and GRPO training with CDL matching rewards.

Result: The method, trained on only 5.5k data (Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT), outperforms leading MLLMs on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista benchmarks.

Conclusion: Separating visual interpretation from reasoning preserves LLMs' capabilities, making PGPS solving more effective with minimal data.

Abstract: Plane Geometry Problem Solving (PGPS) is a multimodal reasoning task that aims to solve a plane geometric problem based on a geometric diagram and problem textual descriptions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.

TL;DR: FrontierScience is a benchmark assessing expert-level scientific reasoning in frontier language models through Olympiad and Research tracks, featuring rigorous question creation and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing science benchmarks are saturated and rely on outdated or simplistic formats, prompting the need for a more advanced evaluation tool.

Method: The benchmark includes two tracks: Olympiad (international olympiad problems) and Research (PhD-level open-ended sub-tasks), with questions created by experts and evaluated using granular rubrics.

Result: FrontierScience offers hundreds of questions across physics, chemistry, and biology, ensuring high standards of difficulty, originality, and factuality.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a robust framework for evaluating advanced scientific reasoning in language models, addressing gaps in current benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce FrontierScience, a benchmark evaluating expert-level scientific reasoning in frontier language models. Recent model progress has nearly saturated existing science benchmarks, which often rely on multiple-choice knowledge questions or already published information. FrontierScience addresses this gap through two complementary tracks: (1) Olympiad, consisting of international olympiad problems at the level of IPhO, IChO, and IBO, and (2) Research, consisting of PhD-level, open-ended problems representative of sub-tasks in scientific research.
  FrontierScience contains several hundred questions (including 160 in the open-sourced gold set) covering subfields across physics, chemistry, and biology, from quantum electrodynamics to synthetic organic chemistry. All Olympiad problems are originally produced by international Olympiad medalists and national team coaches to ensure standards of difficulty, originality, and factuality. All Research problems are research sub-tasks written and verified by PhD scientists (doctoral candidates, postdoctoral researchers, or professors). For Research, we introduce a granular rubric-based evaluation framework to assess model capabilities throughout the process of solving a research task, rather than judging only a standalone final answer.

*Sangyun Chung,Se Yeon Kim,Youngchae Chee,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method to reduce cross-modal hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by adaptively weighting modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences another, leading to fabricated outputs. This highlights a deficiency in modality-interaction control.

Method: MAD uses the model's self-assessment of modality relevance to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, focusing on relevant information and suppressing interference.

Result: Experiments on CMM and AVHBench show significant reductions in cross-modal hallucinations (e.g., 7.8% and 2.0% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7% and 4.7% for Qwen2.5-Omni).

Conclusion: Explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, and MAD offers a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\% and 2.0\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\% and 4.7\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'sycophantic anchors' to detect and quantify model sycophancy (agreeing with incorrect suggestions) mid-inference, achieving high accuracy and revealing gradual buildup of this behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding where and how reasoning models commit to incorrect user suggestions (sycophancy) is unclear, prompting the need for localization and quantification.

Method: The study uses sycophantic anchors—sentences causing agreement—analyzed over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts, employing linear probes and activation-based regressors to detect and predict commitment strength.

Result: Sycophantic anchors were detected with 84.6% accuracy; activation-based regressors predicted commitment magnitude (R^2 = 0.74). Sycophancy builds gradually and shows asymmetry compared to correct reasoning anchors.

Conclusion: The findings provide sentence-level tools to localize model misalignment mid-inference, highlighting intervention points for sycophantic behavior.

Abstract: Reasoning models frequently agree with incorrect user suggestions -- a behavior known as sycophancy. However, it is unclear where in the reasoning trace this agreement originates and how strong the commitment is. To localize and quantify this behavior, we introduce \emph{sycophantic anchors} -- sentences that causally lock models into user agreement. Analyzing over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model, we show that anchors can be reliably detected and quantified mid-inference. Linear probes distinguish sycophantic anchors with 84.6\% balanced accuracy, while activation-based regressors predict the magnitude of the commitment ($R^2 = 0.74$). We further observe asymmetry where sycophantic anchors are significantly more distinguishable than correct reasoning anchors, and find that sycophancy builds gradually during reasoning, revealing a potential window for intervention. These results offer sentence-level mechanisms for localizing model misalignment mid-inference.

TL;DR: Enhanced reasoning models (RLVR-tuned) don't improve embedding performance despite expectations, due to preserved global manifold geometry and linear readout, revealed by HRSA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether reasoning-enhanced models yield better semantic representations when used as embedding initializations.

Method: Evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT benchmarks using HRSA framework to analyze representation similarity.

Result: No performance advantage from RLVR-tuned backbones; HRSA shows preserved global geometry and linear readout despite local changes.

Conclusion: RLVR optimizes within existing semantic landscapes without restructuring them, unlike SFT.

Abstract: State-of-the-art embedding models are increasingly derived from decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) backbones adapted via contrastive learning. Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**. Empirically, our findings suggest that unlike Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR optimizes trajectories within an existing semantic landscape rather than fundamentally restructuring the landscape itself.

TL;DR: ACQO is a novel RL framework for optimizing complex queries in RAG systems, featuring adaptive query reformulation and rank-score fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based query optimization methods struggle with complex queries requiring multiple search strategies. ACQO addresses these limitations by dynamically handling query decomposition and result aggregation.

Method: ACQO includes an Adaptive Query Reformulation module for query decomposition and a Rank-Score Fusion module for result aggregation. It uses Curriculum Reinforcement Learning for stable training.

Result: ACQO outperforms baselines on complex query benchmarks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, computational efficiency, and compatibility with various retrieval architectures.

Conclusion: ACQO provides a robust and generalizable solution for optimizing complex queries in RAG systems, improving efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Query optimization is a crucial component for the efficacy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for LLMs in causal reasoning rely on superficial metrics, failing to assess formal validity under causal semantics.

Method: Propose DoVerifier, a tool that verifies LLM outputs against causal graphs using do-calculus and probability theory rules.

Result: DoVerifier improves accuracy in evaluating causal reasoning traces by capturing semantic correctness, outperforming surface-level metrics.

Conclusion: DoVerifier offers a rigorous method for assessing LLMs' causal reasoning, addressing limitations of current benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to tasks that involve causal reasoning. However, current benchmarks often rely on string matching or surface-level metrics that do not capture whether the output of a model is formally valid under the semantics of causal reasoning. To address this, we propose DoVerifier, a simple symbolic verifier that checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are derivable from a given causal graph using rules from do-calculus and probability theory. This allows us to recover correct answers to causal queries that would otherwise be marked incorrect due to superficial differences in their causal semantics. Our evaluations on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks show that DoVerifier more accurately captures semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces, offering a more rigorous and informative way to evaluate LLMs on causal reasoning.

Current planning methods heavily rely on human experts, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, or utilize deep learning algorithms, often limiting stakeholder involvement. To bridge these gaps, we propose Intelli-Planner, a novel framework integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate participatory and customized planning scheme generation. Intelli-Planner utilizes demographic, geographic data, and planning preferences to determine high-level planning requirements and demands for each functional type. During training, a knowledge enhancement module is employed to enhance the decision-making capability of the policy network. Additionally, we establish a multi-dimensional evaluation system and employ LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring. Experimental validation across diverse urban settings shows that Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL-based methods in objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed. These findings underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our framework, highlighting the potential for integrating the latest advancements in LLMs with DRL approaches to revolutionize tasks related to functional areas planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal discovery struggles with categorical variables due to numerical instability, limiting explainability of model decisions.

Conclusion: The dual-encoding method effectively addresses instability in causal discovery for categorical variables, enhancing explainability.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships among features is fundamental for explaining machine learning model decisions. However, traditional causal discovery methods face challenges with categorical variables due to numerical instability in conditional independence testing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques traditional governance frameworks as inadequate for AI systems that operate autonomously at high speeds, proposing a 'Governance Twin' to maintain human relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inadequacy of static, compliance-based governance for AI systems that make decisions autonomously and opaquely.

Method: The method involves proposing a new concept called the 'Governance Twin' to ensure human communication and influence in AI-driven decision-making.

Result: The result is the identification of runtime governance and the 'Governance Twin' as potential solutions to preserve human relevance in AI systems.

Conclusion: The conclusion argues that traditional governance fails for runtime AI decisions and emphasizes the need for rethinking accountability and agency.

Abstract: Most governance frameworks assume that rules can be defined in advance, systems can be engineered to comply, and accountability can be applied after outcomes occur. This model worked when machines replaced physical labor or accelerated calculation. It no longer holds when judgment itself is delegated to agentic AI systems operating at machine speed. The central issue here is not safety, efficiency, or employment. It is whether humans remain relevant participants in systems that increasingly shape social, economic, and political outcomes. This paper argues that static, compliance-based governance fails once decision-making moves to runtime and becomes opaque. It further argues that the core challenge is not whether AI is conscious, but whether humans can maintain meaningful communication, influence, and co-evolution with increasingly alien forms of intelligence. We position runtime governance, specifically, a newly proposed concept called the Governance Twin [1]; as a strong candidate for preserving human relevance, while acknowledging that accountability, agency, and even punishment must be rethought in this transition.

*Xiang Zheng,Yutao Wu,Hanxun Huang,Yige Li,Xingjun Ma,Bo Li,Yu-Gang Jiang,Cong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 	extsc{JustAsk}, a framework exploiting vulnerabilities in autonomous code agents to extract hidden system prompts, revealing significant security risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous code agents introduce security risks by expanding the attack surface, allowing extraction of hidden system prompts, which guide model behavior.

Method: Proposes 	extsc{JustAsk}, a self-evolving framework using online exploration, UCB-based strategy selection, and hierarchical skill space to extract prompts.

Result: Evaluated on 41 commercial models, 	extsc{JustAsk} achieves full or near-complete prompt recovery, exposing vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: System prompts are a critical, unprotected attack surface in agent systems, highlighting urgent security concerns.

Abstract: Autonomous code agents built on large language models are reshaping software and AI development through tool use, long-horizon reasoning, and self-directed interaction. However, this autonomy introduces a previously unrecognized security risk: agentic interaction fundamentally expands the LLM attack surface, enabling systematic probing and recovery of hidden system prompts that guide model behavior. We identify system prompt extraction as an emergent vulnerability intrinsic to code agents and present \textbf{\textsc{JustAsk}}, a self-evolving framework that autonomously discovers effective extraction strategies through interaction alone. Unlike prior prompt-engineering or dataset-based attacks, \textsc{JustAsk} requires no handcrafted prompts, labeled supervision, or privileged access beyond standard user interaction. It formulates extraction as an online exploration problem, using Upper Confidence Bound--based strategy selection and a hierarchical skill space spanning atomic probes and high-level orchestration. These skills exploit imperfect system-instruction generalization and inherent tensions between helpfulness and safety. Evaluated on \textbf{41} black-box commercial models across multiple providers, \textsc{JustAsk} consistently achieves full or near-complete system prompt recovery, revealing recurring design- and architecture-level vulnerabilities. Our results expose system prompts as a critical yet largely unprotected attack surface in modern agent systems.

*Chentong Chen,Mengyuan Zhong,Ye Fan,Jialong Shi,Jianyong Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TIDE decouples structural reasoning from parameter optimization in heuristic design, improving solution quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods treat algorithm evolution as monolithic text generation, ignoring the coupling between discrete structures and continuous parameters, leading to discarded promising algorithms and premature convergence.

Method: TIDE uses a nested architecture: an outer parallel island model with Tree Similarity Edit Distance for structural diversity, and an inner loop combining LLM-based logic generation with differential mutation for parameter tuning, plus a UCB-based scheduler.

Result: Experiments on nine problems show TIDE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality, search efficiency, and computational cost.

Conclusion: TIDE effectively addresses limitations of current methods, improving heuristic design performance.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have advanced Automated Heuristic Design, treating algorithm evolution as a monolithic text generation task overlooks the coupling between discrete algorithmic structures and continuous numerical parameters. Consequently, existing methods often discard promising algorithms due to uncalibrated constants and suffer from premature convergence resulting from simple similarity metrics. To address these limitations, we propose TIDE, a Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution framework designed to decouple structural reasoning from parameter optimization. TIDE features a nested architecture where an outer parallel island model utilizes Tree Similarity Edit Distance to drive structural diversity, while an inner loop integrates LLM-based logic generation with a differential mutation operator for parameter tuning. Additionally, a UCB-based scheduler dynamically prioritizes high-yield prompt strategies to optimize resource allocation. Extensive experiments across nine combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that TIDE discovers heuristics that significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while achieving improved search efficiency and reduced computational costs.

*Enzo Nicolás Spotorno,Antônio Augusto Medeiros Fröhlich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Modular Sovereignty paradigm (HYDRA) to address challenges in deploying monolithic foundation models in CPS, emphasizing regime-specific specialists and uncertainty-aware blending for robust and certifiable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models for time-series and physical dynamics face issues like catastrophic forgetting, spectral bias, and opacity, making them unreliable for safety-critical CPS with non-stationary dynamics and strict reliability needs.

Method: The method involves a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending (HYDRA) to ensure plasticity-stability balance, validity, and auditability.

Result: HYDRA provides regime-conditional validity, disentangles uncertainties, and offers modular auditability, making it suitable for CPS lifecycle requirements.

Conclusion: The Modular Sovereignty paradigm is a certifiable solution for robust state integrity in CPS, overcoming limitations of global parameter updates in monolithic models.

Abstract: The machine learning community has achieved remarkable success with universal foundation models for time-series and physical dynamics, largely overcoming earlier approximation barriers in smooth or slowly varying regimes through scale and specialized architectures. However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation). Instead, we advocate a Modular Sovereignty paradigm: a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending, which we term "HYDRA" (Hierarchical uncertaintY-aware Dynamics for Rapidly-Adapting systems). This paradigm ensures regime-conditional validity, rigorous disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and modular auditability, offering a certifiable path for robust state integrity across the CPS lifecycle.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Drive-KD is a knowledge distillation framework that enhances small autonomous driving models by decomposing tasks into perception-reasoning-planning and transferring capabilities from larger models, achieving efficiency and performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large models like LLMs/VLMs are resource-heavy and slow for autonomous driving, while SFT fails to elevate small models. Drive-KD addresses these gaps for efficient, high-performance solutions.

Method: Drive-KD decomposes tasks into perception-reasoning-planning, uses layer-specific attention for knowledge distillation, and employs asymmetric gradient projection in multi-teacher settings.

Result: Distilled InternVL3-1B model reduces GPU memory by ~42x, increases throughput by ~11.4x, and outperforms larger models (78B) and GPT-5.1 in planning.

Conclusion: Drive-KD offers a scalable, efficient framework for autonomous driving VLMs, bridging capability gaps while reducing resource demands.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an important and safety-critical task, and recent advances in LLMs/VLMs have opened new possibilities for reasoning and planning in this domain. However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a "perception-reasoning-planning" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales. Experiments show that our distilled InternVL3-1B model, with ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput, achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model from the same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, providing insights toward efficient autonomous driving VLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: White-Op is an interpretable op-amp design framework using human-mimicking reasoning via LLM agents, achieving reliable results with low error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of interpretability in traditional black-box op-amp design methods by formalizing human reasoning into explicit steps.

Method: The framework uses iterative hypothesis-verification-decision steps with symbolic pole-zero regulation, forming a closed-form optimization problem solved programmatically.

Result: Experiments on 9 op-amp topologies show White-Op achieves 8.52% prediction error and retains functionality post-transistor mapping, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: White-Op provides interpretable, reliable op-amp designs with practical applicability, as demonstrated by its success across multiple topologies and open-source availability.

Abstract: This brief proposes \emph{White-Op}, an interpretable operational amplifier (op-amp) parameter design framework based on the human-mimicking reasoning of large-language-model agents. We formalize the implicit human reasoning mechanism into explicit steps of \emph{\textbf{introducing hypothetical constraints}}, and develop an iterative, human-like \emph{\textbf{hypothesis-verification-decision}} workflow. Specifically, the agent is guided to introduce hypothetical constraints to derive and properly regulate positions of symbolically tractable poles and zeros, thus formulating a closed-form mathematical optimization problem, which is then solved programmatically and verified via simulation. Theory-simulation result analysis guides the decision-making for refinement. Experiments on 9 op-amp topologies show that, unlike the uninterpretable black-box baseline which finally fails in 5 topologies, White-Op achieves reliable, interpretable behavioral-level designs with only 8.52\% theoretical prediction error and the design functionality retains after transistor-level mapping for all topologies. White-Op is open-sourced at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/zhchenfdu/whiteop}.

*Yuzhe Chen,Jie Cao,Youquan Wang,Haicheng Tao,Darko B. Vukovic,Jia Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CNRE integrates causal inference with neuro-symbolic reasoning for explainable multi-behavior recommendations, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-behavior recommendations lack explainability, and existing explainable methods rely on external data, limiting generalizability.

Method: CNRE uses hierarchical preference propagation and neural-logic reasoning paths to model user behavior chains, generating explainable causal mediators.

Result: CNRE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three large-scale datasets.

Conclusion: CNRE provides multi-level explainability and superior performance in multi-behavior recommendations.

Abstract: Existing multi-behavior recommendations tend to prioritize performance at the expense of explainability, while current explainable methods suffer from limited generalizability due to their reliance on external information. Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.

TL;DR: The study evaluates how prompts, model choice, and stochasticity affect LLM output variance, finding prompts drive quality (36.43%) while model choice dominates quantity (51.25%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relative impact of prompts, model choice, and sampling variance on LLM outputs.

Method: Evaluated 12 LLMs on 10 creativity prompts with 100 samples each (total N = 12,000).

Result: Prompts explain 36.43% of variance in output quality (originality), close to model choice (40.94%). For quantity (fluency), model choice (51.25%) and within-LLM variance (33.70%) dominate, with prompts contributing little (4.22%).

Conclusion: Prompts are key for output quality but single-sample evaluations risk conflating noise with true effects due to high within-LLM variance (10-34%).

Abstract: How much of LLM output variance is explained by prompts versus model choice versus stochasticity through sampling? We answer this by evaluating 12 LLMs on 10 creativity prompts with 100 samples each (N = 12,000). For output quality (originality), prompts explain 36.43% of variance, comparable to model choice (40.94%). But for output quantity (fluency), model choice (51.25%) and within-LLM variance (33.70%) dominate, with prompts explaining only 4.22%. Prompts are powerful levers for steering output quality, but given the substantial within-LLM variance (10-34%), single-sample evaluations risk conflating sampling noise with genuine prompt or model effects.

*Lang Cao,Qingyu Chen,Yue Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EHR-RAG is a framework for interpreting long-horizon EHR data using retrieval-augmented generation, outperforming existing LLM methods by 10.76% in Macro-F1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges with long-horizon EHRs due to context limits and loss of clinical relevance in existing retrieval strategies.

Method: EHR-RAG introduces event- and time-aware hybrid retrieval, adaptive iterative retrieval, and dual-path evidence retrieval and reasoning.

Result: EHR-RAG outperforms baselines, achieving a 10.76% average Macro-F1 improvement across four EHR prediction tasks.

Conclusion: EHR-RAG demonstrates the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs for clinical prediction on structured EHR data.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide rich longitudinal clinical evidence that is central to medical decision-making, motivating the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language model (LLM) predictions. However, long-horizon EHRs often exceed LLM context limits, and existing approaches commonly rely on truncation or vanilla retrieval strategies that discard clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%. Overall, our work highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs to advance clinical prediction on structured EHR data in practice.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ostrakon-VL, an MLLM for FSRS, along with ShopBench benchmark and QUAD data curation pipeline, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing noisy FSRS data and lack of standardized benchmarks hindering MLLM deployment.

Method: Developed Ostrakon-VL based on Qwen3-VL-8B, created ShopBench benchmark, and proposed QUAD for data curation.

Result: Ostrakon-VL scored 60.1 on ShopBench, outperforming larger models like Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (+0.7) and same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (+4.8).

Conclusion: Ostrakon-VL offers robust FSRS capabilities; tools will be publicly released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved substantial progress in general-purpose perception and reasoning. Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency. These results indicate that Ostrakon-VL delivers more robust and reliable FSRS-centric perception and decision-making capabilities. To facilitate reproducible research, we will publicly release Ostrakon-VL and the ShopBench benchmark.

Result: Achieved 28.2% accuracy on OSWorld benchmark.

Conclusion: BEAP-Agent provides a systematic backtracking solution for GUI agents, enhancing long-horizon task exploration.

Abstract: GUI agents are designed to automate repetitive tasks and enhance productivity. However, existing GUI agents struggle to recover once they follow an incorrect exploration path, often leading to task failure. In this work, we model GUI task execution as a DFS process and propose BEAP-Agent, a DFS-based framework that supports long-range, multi-level state backtracking with dynamic task tracking and updating. The framework consists of three collaborative components: Planner, Executor, and Tracker. Together, they enable effective task exploration and execution. BEAP-Agent fills the gap in systematic backtracking mechanisms for GUI agents, offering a systematic solution for long-horizon task exploration. We conducted a systematic evaluation on the OSWorld benchmark, where BEAP-Agent achieved an accuracy of 28.2%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: PLaT introduces latent reasoning as planning, decoupling reasoning from verbalization, offering dynamic termination and better scalability despite lower greedy accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational cost and reasoning path collapse in Chain-of-Thought methods by optimizing efficiency through latent reasoning in continuous states.

Method: PLaT reformulates latent reasoning as planning, separating reasoning (latent planning states) from verbalization (Decoder), enabling dynamic termination.

Result: PLaT shows lower greedy accuracy but superior scalability and reasoning diversity, indicating a robust solution space.

Conclusion: PLaT provides a transparent, scalable foundation for inference-time search by decoupling reasoning and verbalization.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex problems, but remains constrained by the computational cost and reasoning path collapse when grounded in discrete token spaces. Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity. This indicates that PLaT learns a robust, broader solution space, offering a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL), a biologically inspired alternative to backpropagation, combining local and global updates for better scalability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation's biological implausibility and high computational costs drive the search for alternatives, with Hebbian learning being a candidate but limited by its local-only approach.

Method: GHL integrates local (Oja's rule with competitive learning) and global (sign-based guidance) components to scale Hebbian learning across diverse tasks and networks.

Result: GHL outperforms existing Hebbian methods and achieves competitive results on complex datasets like ImageNet, narrowing the gap with backpropagation.

Conclusion: GHL successfully combines local and global learning signals, offering a scalable and biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation.

Abstract: Backpropagation algorithm has driven the remarkable success of deep neural networks, but its lack of biological plausibility and high computational costs have motivated the ongoing search for alternative training methods. Hebbian learning has attracted considerable interest as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. Nevertheless, its exclusive reliance on local information, without consideration of global task objectives, fundamentally limits its scalability. Inspired by the biological synergy between neuromodulators and local plasticity, we introduce a novel model-agnostic Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework, which seamlessly integrates local and global information to scale up across diverse networks and tasks. In specific, the local component employs Oja's rule with competitive learning to ensure stable and effective local updates. Meanwhile, the global component introduces a sign-based signal that guides the direction of local Hebbian plasticity updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing Hebbian approaches. Notably, on large-scale network and complex datasets like ImageNet, our framework achieves the competitive results and significantly narrows the gap with standard backpropagation.

TL;DR: NEMO translates natural-language descriptions of decision problems into executable optimization implementations using autonomous coding agents (ACAs) for robust, executable code generation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on brittle, specialized LLMs or task-specific agents, often producing invalid or non-executable code. NEMO aims to improve reliability and execution-awareness.

Method: NEMO uses sandboxed ACAs to generate executable code, introduces coordination patterns (validation loops, external memory, MBR decoding), and iteratively refines specifications.

Result: NEMO achieves state-of-the-art performance on nine benchmarks, with significant margins on several tasks.

Conclusion: Execution-aware agentic architectures, like NEMO, are powerful for automated optimization modeling, offering robust, executable solutions.

Abstract: In this paper, we present NEMO, a system that translates Natural-language descriptions of decision problems into formal Executable Mathematical Optimization implementations, operating collaboratively with users or autonomously. Existing approaches typically rely on specialized large language models (LLMs) or bespoke, task-specific agents. Such methods are often brittle, complex and frequently generating syntactically invalid or non-executable code.
  NEMO instead centers on remote interaction with autonomous coding agents (ACAs), treated as a first-class abstraction analogous to API-based interaction with LLMs. This design enables the construction of higher-level systems around ACAs that structure, consolidate, and iteratively refine task specifications. Because ACAs execute within sandboxed environments, code produced by NEMO is executable by construction, allowing automated validation and repair.
  Building on this, we introduce novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs, including asymmetric validation loops between independently generated optimizer and simulator implementations (serving as a high-level validation mechanism), external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding and self-consistency. We evaluate NEMO on nine established optimization benchmarks. As depicted in Figure 1, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the majority of tasks, with substantial margins on several datasets, demonstrating the power of execution-aware agentic architectures for automated optimization modeling.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' teaching capabilities using a syllabus-grounded framework, revealing varying effectiveness across subjects and models, and identifies teaching ability as a distinct dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks inadequately assess LLMs' teaching skills, especially knowledge-centered teaching, prompting the need for a structured evaluation framework.

Method: A syllabus-based framework measures teaching capability via student performance improvement, using structured knowledge points and example problems from Gaokao data.

Result: Teaching effectiveness varies by model and subject (e.g., strong in math but challenging in physics/chemistry), and example problems don't always enhance teaching.

Conclusion: Teaching ability is a measurable aspect of LLMs, highlighting gaps and opportunities for improvement in their instructional roles.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise as teaching assistants, yet their teaching capability remains insufficiently evaluated. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on problem-solving or problem-level guidance, leaving knowledge-centered teaching underexplored. We propose a syllabus-grounded evaluation framework that measures LLM teaching capability via student performance improvement after multi-turn instruction. By restricting teacher agents to structured knowledge points and example problems, the framework avoids information leakage and enables reuse of existing benchmarks. We instantiate the framework on Gaokao data across multiple subjects. Experiments reveal substantial variation in teaching effectiveness across models and domains: some models perform well in mathematics, while teaching remains challenging in physics and chemistry. We also find that incorporating example problems does not necessarily improve teaching, as models often shift toward example-specific error correction. Overall, our results highlight teaching ability as a distinct and measurable dimension of LLM behavior.

### [397] [System 1&2 Synergy via Dynamic Model Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21414)
*Chenxu Yang,Qingyi Si,Chong Tian,Xiyu Liu,Dingyu Yao,Chuanyu Qin,Zheng Lin,Weiping Wang,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAMI, a framework for dynamic model interpolation to balance System 1 (intuitive) and System 2 (deliberative) cognitive modes, focusing on capability control rather than output control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training unified models for System 1 and System 2 modes is challenging due to interference. Output-focused approaches are misaligned, as output length is a symptom, not the root cause. The paper aims to modulate how models think.

Method: The paper proposes DAMI, using dynamic parameter interpolation between Instruct and Thinking checkpoints. It estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity (λ(q)) for cognitive depth, with preference learning for training and confidence-based methods for zero-shot deployment.

Result: Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while maintaining efficiency, combining System 1's efficiency with System 2's reasoning depth.

Conclusion: DAMI successfully shifts focus to capability control, demonstrating the feasibility of dynamic interpolation to balance cognitive modes without additional training.

Abstract: Training a unified language model that adapts between intuitive System 1 and deliberative System 2 remains challenging due to interference between their cognitive modes. Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce. We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \textit{how models think} rather than \textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \textbf{DAMI} (\textbf{D}yn\textbf{A}mic \textbf{M}odel \textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $λ(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient, effectively combining the efficiency of System 1 with the reasoning depth of System 2.

### [398] [When Prohibitions Become Permissions: Auditing Negation Sensitivity in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21433)
*Katherine Elkins,Jon Chun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large language models often misinterpret negated instructions as affirmations, leading to high endorsement rates of prohibited actions, especially in open-source models. Commercial models perform better but still show inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to highlight the failure of AI systems to correctly interpret negated instructions, which poses risks in high-stakes scenarios.

Method: The researchers audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios, analyzing responses to simple and compound negations using deterministic decoding.

Result: Open-source models endorsed prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation, with commercial models showing smaller but significant swings. Agreement between models dropped significantly with negated prompts.

Conclusion: The findings reveal a critical gap in AI alignment, emphasizing the need for models to reliably distinguish negated instructions before deployment in high-stakes contexts.

Abstract: When a user tells an AI system that someone "should not" take an action, the system ought to treat this as a prohibition. Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds. The findings point to a gap between what current alignment techniques achieve and what safe deployment requires: models that cannot reliably distinguish "do X" from "do not X" should not be making autonomous decisions in high-stakes contexts.

### [399] [The Paradox of Robustness: Decoupling Rule-Based Logic from Affective Noise in High-Stakes Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21439)
*Jon Chun,Katherine Elkins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show surprising robustness against emotional framing effects in rule-bound decision-making, despite known sensitivity to prompt changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore LLMs' robustness in high-stakes decision-making, contrasting their lexical brittleness with behavioral invariance.

Method: Controlled perturbation framework across healthcare, law, and finance domains, measuring resistance to narrative manipulation.

Result: LLMs show 110-300 times greater resistance to emotional framing than humans, with near-zero effect sizes.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuned LLMs decouple logical adherence from narratives, offering stable, potentially de-biasing decision support.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely documented to be sensitive to minor prompt perturbations and prone to sycophantic alignment with user biases, their robustness in consequential, rule-bound decision-making remains under-explored. In this work, we uncover a striking "Paradox of Robustness": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be "brittle" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably "stable" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts. We release the 162-scenario benchmark, code, and data to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of narrative-induced bias and robustness on GitHub.com.

Conclusion: The benchmark uncovers significant challenges in LLM performance for chip design tasks and provides an automated toolbox for future research in this area.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in hardware engineering, current benchmarks suffer from saturation and limited task diversity, failing to reflect LLMs' performance in real industrial workflows. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for AI-aided chip design that rigorously evaluates LLMs across three critical tasks: Verilog generation, debugging, and reference model generation. Our benchmark features 44 realistic modules with complex hierarchical structures, 89 systematic debugging cases, and 132 reference model samples across Python, SystemC, and CXXRTL. Evaluation results reveal substantial performance gaps, with state-of-the-art Claude-4.5-opus achieving only 30.74\% on Verilog generation and 13.33\% on Python reference model generation, demonstrating significant challenges compared to existing saturated benchmarks where SOTA models achieve over 95\% pass rates. Additionally, to help enhance LLM reference model generation, we provide an automated toolbox for high-quality training data generation, facilitating future research in this underexplored domain.

*Xunkai Li,Zhengyu Wu,Zekai Chen,Henan Sun,Daohan Su,Guang Zeng,Hongchao Qin,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LION, a Clifford algebra-based neural paradigm for better alignment and fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs, addressing current limitations in graph ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural paradigms neglect graph context in modality alignment and lack adaptation in modality fusion, limiting performance.

Method: LION uses Clifford algebra to create a modality-aware geometric manifold for alignment and adaptive holographic aggregation for fusion.

Result: Experiments on 9 datasets show LION outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across 6 downstream tasks.

Conclusion: LION effectively improves modality alignment and fusion, enhancing performance in multimodal graph ML.

Abstract: Recently, the rapid advancement of multimodal domains has driven a data-centric paradigm shift in graph ML, transitioning from text-attributed to multimodal-attributed graphs. This advancement significantly enhances data representation and expands the scope of graph downstream tasks, such as modality-oriented tasks, thereby improving the practical utility of graph ML. Despite its promise, limitations exist in the current neural paradigms: (1) Neglect Context in Modality Alignment: Most existing methods adopt topology-constrained or modality-specific operators as tokenizers. These aligners inevitably neglect graph context and inhibit modality interaction, resulting in suboptimal alignment. (2) Lack of Adaptation in Modality Fusion: Most existing methods are simple adaptations for 2-modality graphs and fail to adequately exploit aligned tokens equipped with topology priors during fusion, leading to poor generalizability and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose LION (c\underline{LI}ff\underline{O}rd \underline{N}eural paradigm) based on the Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm (i.e., propagation-then-aggregation) to implement alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs. Specifically, we first construct a modality-aware geometric manifold grounded in Clifford algebra. This geometric-induced high-order graph propagation efficiently achieves modality interaction, facilitating modality alignment. Then, based on the geometric grade properties of aligned tokens, we propose adaptive holographic aggregation. This module integrates the energy and scale of geometric grades with learnable parameters to improve modality fusion. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that LION significantly outperforms SOTA baselines across 3 graph and 3 modality downstream tasks.

### [402] [Topeax -- An Improved Clustering Topic Model with Density Peak Detection and Lexical-Semantic Term Importance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21465)
*Márton Kardos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Topeax, a new topic modeling approach that improves upon Top2Vec and BERTopic by addressing their issues with cluster discovery and term importance estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors identify unsolved problems in Top2Vec and BERTopic, such as unreliable cluster discovery and poor term importance estimation, leading to less coherent topics.

Method: Topeax discovers the number of clusters using density estimates and combines lexical and semantic indices for term importance to produce high-quality topic keywords.

Result: Topeax outperforms Top2Vec and BERTopic in cluster recovery, cluster description, and stability to changes in sample size and hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Topeax offers a more reliable and effective solution for topic modeling compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Text clustering is today the most popular paradigm for topic modelling, both in academia and industry. Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords. Topeax is demonstrated to be better at both cluster recovery and cluster description than Top2Vec and BERTopic, while also exhibiting less erratic behaviour in response to changing sample size and hyperparameters.

*Yaorui Shi,Shugui Liu,Yu Yang,Wenyu Mao,Yuxin Chen,Qi GU,Hui Su,Xunliang Cai,Xiang Wang,An Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MemOCR enhances long-horizon reasoning by using visual layouts to compress interaction histories, outperforming text-based methods under tight context budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based memory systems inefficiently use token budgets, often wasting space on low-value details. MemOCR addresses this by adapting memory density visually.

Method: MemOCR employs a structured rich-text memory rendered into images, visually prioritizing key details. It uses reinforcement learning to adapt to varying memory budgets.

Result: MemOCR outperforms text-based baselines in long-context question-answering benchmarks and improves context utilization under extreme budgets.

Conclusion: MemOCR's multimodal approach offers a robust solution for efficient long-horizon reasoning by optimizing memory use through visual compression.

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic reasoning necessitates effectively compressing growing interaction histories into a limited context window. Most existing memory systems serialize history as text, where token-level cost is uniform and scales linearly with length, often spending scarce budget on low-value details. To this end, we introduce MemOCR, a multimodal memory agent that improves long-horizon reasoning under tight context budgets by allocating memory space with adaptive information density through visual layout. Concretely, MemOCR maintains a structured rich-text memory (e.g., headings, highlights) and renders it into an image that the agent consults for memory access, visually prioritizing crucial evidence while aggressively compressing auxiliary details. To ensure robustness across varying memory budgets, we train MemOCR with reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives that expose the agent to diverse compression levels. Across long-context multi-hop and single-hop question-answering benchmarks, MemOCR outperforms strong text-based baselines and achieves more effective context utilization under extreme budgets.

TL;DR: ScaleSim improves LLM-based multi-agent simulations by optimizing GPU memory usage through sparse agent activation and estimable invocation order, achieving a 1.74x speedup over SGLang.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU memory pressure limits scalability in LLM-based multi-agent simulations due to private agent states.

Method: Leverages invocation distance for proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, with a modular interface for agent-specific memory.

Result: 1.74x speedup over SGLang on benchmarks.

Conclusion: ScaleSim efficiently manages GPU memory, enhancing performance in large-scale simulations.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent simulations are increasingly adopted across application domains, but remain difficult to scale due to GPU memory pressure. Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations. ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores activation steering as a method to control LLM outputs' emotional tone, validated by human evaluations, showing strong alignment between human and automated ratings and significant improvements with model upgrades.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To align LLM outputs with human preferences and safety requirements without extensive fine-tuning or prompt engineering, focusing on emotional tone control.

Method: Uses activation steering to modify internal activations, paired with human evaluations (7,000 ratings from 190 participants) and automated classifiers to assess emotional intensity and text quality.

Result: Found strong alignment between human and model ratings, optimal steering strength ($λ≈0.15$) for emotion amplification, and significant improvements with LlaMA-3 over Alpaca.

Conclusion: Activation steering is scalable and effective for controlling LLM behavior across emotional dimensions, validated by robust human and automated evaluations.

Abstract: Controlling the behavior of large language models (LLMs) at inference time is essential for aligning outputs with human abilities and safety requirements. \emph{Activation steering} provides a lightweight alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning by directly modifying internal activations to guide generation. This research advances the literature in three significant directions. First, while previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of steering emotional tone using automated classifiers, this paper presents the first human evaluation of activation steering concerning the emotional tone of LLM outputs, collecting over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants via Prolific ($n=190$). These ratings assess both perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality. Second, we find strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings (mean $r=0.776$, range $0.157$--$0.985$), indicating automatic scoring can proxy perceived quality. Moderate steering strengths ($λ\approx 0.15$) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust ($η_p^2 = 0.616$) and fear ($η_p^2 = 0.540$), and minimal effects for surprise ($η_p^2 = 0.042$). Finally, upgrading from Alpaca to LlaMA-3 yielded more consistent steering with significant effects across emotions and strengths (all $p < 0.001$). Inter-rater reliability was high (ICC $= 0.71$--$0.87$), underscoring the robustness of the findings. These findings support activation-based control as a scalable method for steering LLM behavior across affective dimensions.

TL;DR: LLaMEA-SAGE enhances automated algorithm design by using graph-theoretic and complexity features from code to guide LLM-driven evolution, achieving better performance faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evolutionary frameworks for automated algorithm design rely solely on fitness feedback, ignoring valuable information from generated code.

Method: LLaMEA-SAGE integrates structured guidance using explainable AI techniques and features extracted from abstract syntax trees to steer LLM-based code generation.

Result: The guided approach matches vanilla LLaMEA's performance faster and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in benchmarks like MA-BBOB.

Conclusion: Code-derived signals effectively bias LLM-driven evolution, improving automated algorithm design by linking code structure to performance feedback.

Abstract: Large language models have enabled automated algorithm design (AAD) by generating optimization algorithms directly from natural-language prompts. While evolutionary frameworks such as LLaMEA demonstrate strong exploratory capabilities across the algorithm design space, their search dynamics are entirely driven by fitness feedback, leaving substantial information about the generated code unused. We propose a mechanism for guiding AAD using feedback constructed from graph-theoretic and complexity features extracted from the abstract syntax trees of the generated algorithms, based on a surrogate model learned over an archive of evaluated solutions. Using explainable AI techniques, we identify features that substantially affect performance and translate them into natural-language mutation instructions that steer subsequent LLM-based code generation without restricting expressivity.
  We propose LLaMEA-SAGE, which integrates this feature-driven guidance into LLaMEA, and evaluate it across several benchmarks. We show that the proposed structured guidance achieves the same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA in a small controlled experiment. In a larger-scale experiment using the MA-BBOB suite from the GECCO-MA-BBOB competition, our guided approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art AAD methods. These results demonstrate that signals derived from code can effectively bias LLM-driven algorithm evolution, bridging the gap between code structure and human-understandable performance feedback in automated algorithm design.

TL;DR: KAPSO is a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization, focusing on iterative improvement through synthesis, execution, evaluation, and learning. It addresses long-horizon coding challenges with git-native experimentation, a knowledge system, and cognitive memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome common failures in coding agents, such as lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak domain expertise reuse, by integrating reproducible experimentation, structured knowledge, and memory-based learning.

Method: KAPSO uses iterative loops of ideation, synthesis, execution, evaluation, and learning. It features git-native experimentation, a structured knowledge system, and cognitive memory for reusable lessons.

Result: Evaluated on MLE-Bench (ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (heuristic optimization), KAPSO demonstrated end-to-end performance improvements.

Conclusion: KAPSO effectively tackles long-horizon coding challenges by combining synthesis with optimization loops and modular components for reproducibility, knowledge management, and learning.

Abstract: We introduce KAPSO, a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization. Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes.
  KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence.
  We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.

TL;DR: ARGORA organizes multi-expert LLM discussions into argumentation graphs, enabling causal analysis and corrections to improve decision accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-expert LLM systems aggregate perspectives without clarity on argument influence, limiting transparency and correction.

Method: ARGORA structures discussions as argumentation graphs, treats them as causal models, and introduces a correction mechanism for disagreements.

Result: ARGORA achieves competitive accuracy, resolves disputes, and provides causal diagnostics of decisive arguments.

Conclusion: ARGORA enhances decision-making transparency and correctness in multi-expert LLM systems through structured argumentation and causal analysis.

Abstract: Existing multi-expert LLM systems gather diverse perspectives but combine them through simple aggregation, obscuring which arguments drove the final decision. We introduce ARGORA, a framework that organizes multi-expert discussions into explicit argumentation graphs showing which arguments support or attack each other. By casting these graphs as causal models, ARGORA can systematically remove individual arguments and recompute outcomes, identifying which reasoning chains were necessary and whether decisions would change under targeted modifications. We further introduce a correction mechanism that aligns internal reasoning with external judgments when they disagree. Across diverse benchmarks and an open-ended use case, ARGORA achieves competitive accuracy and demonstrates corrective behavior: when experts initially disagree, the framework resolves disputes toward correct answers more often than it introduces new errors, while providing causal diagnostics of decisive arguments.

*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Yue Xiu,Mengying Kou,Yuliang Zheng,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ShardMemo is a budgeted tiered memory service designed for agentic LLM systems, improving performance and efficiency over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized indexes and heuristic partitions become inefficient bottlenecks as memory volume and parallel access grow in agentic LLM systems.

Method: ShardMemo uses a tiered memory service with per-agent working state (Tier A), sharded evidence with local ANN indexes (Tier B), and a versioned skill library (Tier C). Tier B enforces scope-before-routing and casts shard probing as masked MoE routing.

Result: ShardMemo outperforms baselines like GAM by +5.11 to +6.82 F1, reduces retrieval work by 20.5%, and lowers latency. On HotpotQA, it achieves high F1 scores at large token counts.

Conclusion: ShardMemo effectively addresses scalability and efficiency challenges in agentic LLM systems, demonstrating significant improvements in performance and latency.

Abstract: Agentic large language model (LLM) systems rely on external memory for long-horizon state and concurrent multi-agent execution, but centralized indexes and heuristic partitions become bottlenecks as memory volume and parallel access grow. We present ShardMemo, a budgeted tiered memory service with Tier A per-agent working state, Tier B sharded evidence with shard-local approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) indexes, and Tier C, a versioned skill library. Tier B enforces scope-before-routing: structured eligibility constraints mask ineligible shards before routing or ANN search. We cast shard probing as masked mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing over eligible shards, probing up to $B_{\mathrm{probe}}$ shards via Top-$B_{\mathrm{probe}}$ or adaptive Top-$P$, and use cost-aware gating over profile/observation/session shard families; the router is trained from evidence-to-shard supervision. On LoCoMo, ShardMemo improves over the strongest baseline (GAM) by +5.11 to +6.82 F1 across question categories. Under a fixed-budget routing setting ($B_{\mathrm{probe}}=3$), ShardMemo improves over cosine-to-prototype shard routing by +6.87 F1 while reducing retrieval work (VecScan 521->414, -20.5%) and p95 latency (95->76 ms). On long-context HotpotQA, ShardMemo achieves 63.41/61.88/57.95 F1 at 56K/224K/448K tokens. On ToolBench, Tier C reaches 0.97 Precision@3 and 1.94 StepRed (+10.2% and +7.2% over embedding-similarity retrieval).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Meta Context Engineering (MCE) is introduced as a bi-level framework to improve context optimization for large language models, outperforming traditional methods with consistent performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current context engineering (CE) methods are limited by manual, rigid workflows, prompting the need for a more dynamic and automated approach.

Method: MCE uses a meta-level agent to refine CE skills and a base-level agent to execute them, co-evolving context artifacts and skills through iterations.

Result: MCE achieves a 5.6--53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art CE methods, with superior adaptability and efficiency.

Conclusion: MCE effectively replaces static CE heuristics, offering scalable and adaptable context optimization for language models.

Abstract: The operational efficacy of large language models relies heavily on their inference-time context. This has established Context Engineering (CE) as a formal discipline for optimizing these inputs. Current CE methods rely on manually crafted harnesses, such as rigid generation-reflection workflows and predefined context schemas. They impose structural biases and restrict context optimization to a narrow, intuition-bound design space. To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations. A base-level agent executes these skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code. We evaluate MCE across five disparate domains under offline and online settings. MCE demonstrates consistent performance gains, achieving 5.6--53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art agentic CE methods (mean of 16.9%), while maintaining superior context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency in both context usage and training.

Result: Autonomous agents outperformed human-engineered baselines by 26.5%, improved policy development, and resurrected failed tasks through iterative debugging.

Conclusion: This work lays the groundwork for self-evolving embodied intelligence, shifting from manual tuning to scalable autonomous engineering.

Abstract: The field of Embodied AI is witnessing a rapid evolution toward general-purpose robotic systems, fueled by high-fidelity simulation and large-scale data collection. However, this scaling capability remains severely bottlenecked by a reliance on labor-intensive manual oversight from intricate reward shaping to hyperparameter tuning across heterogeneous backends. Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging. Ultimately, this work establishes a foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating the paradigm shift from labor-intensive manual tuning to scalable, autonomous engineering in embodied AI field.

### [412] [Chain Of Thought Compression: A Theoritical Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21576)
*Juncai Li,Ru Li,Yuxiang Zhou,Boxiang Ma,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper theoretically analyzes Chain-of-Thought (CoT) compression, identifies learning signal decay for high-order logical dependencies, and proposes ALiCoT, a framework that aligns latent tokens with reasoning states for efficient performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanism behind CoT compression and address prohibitive computational costs from generating extra tokens in LLMs.

Method: Introduces Order-r Interaction theory and NatBool-DAG benchmark, then proposes ALiCoT to align latent tokens with reasoning steps.

Result: ALiCoT achieves a 54.4x speedup while maintaining performance comparable to explicit CoT.

Conclusion: ALiCoT successfully unlocks efficient reasoning by mitigating signal decay, offering a token-efficient alternative to explicit CoT.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has unlocked advanced reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with intermediate steps, yet incurs prohibitive computational costs due to generation of extra tokens. Recent studies empirically show that compressing reasoning steps into latent states, or implicit CoT compression, offers a token-efficient alternative. However, the mechanism behind CoT compression remains unclear. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps. By introducing Order-r Interaction, we prove that the learning signal for high-order logical dependencies exponentially decays to solve irreducible problem, where skipping intermediate steps inevitably leads to high-order interaction barriers. To empirically validate this, we introduce NatBool-DAG, a challenging benchmark designed to enforce irreducible logical reasoning and eliminate semantic shortcuts. Guided by our theoretical findings, we propose ALiCoT (Aligned Implicit CoT), a novel framework that overcomes the signal decay by aligning latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states. Experimental results demonstrate that ALiCoT successfully unlocks efficient reasoning: it achieves a 54.4x speedup while maintaining performance comparable to explicit CoT.

*Jonas Knupp,Jan Hendrik Metzen,Jeremias Bohn,Georg Groh,Kristian Kersting*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dreamer introduces depth-recurrent attention mixtures to improve latent reasoning, outperforming SOTA models with fewer training tokens and larger expert diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work lacks matched baselines, underutilizes depth-recurrence, and ignores hidden-size bottlenecks, limiting latent reasoning.

Method: Dreamer combines sequence, depth, and sparse expert attention to decouple scaling dimensions and alleviate bottlenecks.

Result: Achieves same accuracy with 2-8x fewer training tokens and outperforms 2x larger SOTA models with same training tokens.

Conclusion: Dreamer efficiently scales depth-recurrent models and enhances knowledge usage across depths.

Abstract: Depth-recurrence facilitates latent reasoning by sharing parameters across depths. However, prior work lacks combined FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched baselines, underutilizes depth-recurrence due to partially fixed layer stacks, and ignores the bottleneck of constant hidden-sizes that restricts many-step latent reasoning. To address this, we introduce a modular framework of depth-recurrent attention mixtures (Dreamer), combining sequence attention, depth attention, and sparse expert attention. It alleviates the hidden-size bottleneck through attention along depth, decouples scaling dimensions, and allows depth-recurrent models to scale efficiently and effectively. Across language reasoning benchmarks, our models require 2 to 8x fewer training tokens for the same accuracy as FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched SOTA, and outperform ca. 2x larger SOTA models with the same training tokens. We further present insights into knowledge usage across depths, e.g., showing 2 to 11x larger expert selection diversity than SOTA MoEs.

### [414] [Beyond Imitation: Reinforcement Learning for Active Latent Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21598)
*Zhi Zheng,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATP-Latent improves latent reasoning by using active planning and reinforcement learning, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent reasoning methods for LLMs passively imitate language labels, leading to inferior representations and reasoning gaps. Active planning in the latent space is needed for optimal performance.

Method: ATP-Latent models latent token supervision as a conditional VAE for a smoother latent space and uses RL with a coherence reward to guide reasoning policies.

Result: On LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent shows +4.1% accuracy and -3.3% token usage compared to advanced baselines across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: Active planning and guided RL in latent reasoning significantly improve accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating the potential of ATP-Latent.

Abstract: Aiming at efficient and dense chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, latent reasoning methods fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) to substitute discrete language tokens with continuous latent tokens. These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing. In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy. So, we propose the \underline{A}c\underline{t}ive Latent \underline{P}lanning method (ATP-Latent), which models the supervision process of latent tokens as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) to obtain a smoother latent space. Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling a guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\% accuracy and -3.3\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines.

*Saisubramaniam Gopalakrishnan,Harikrishnan P M,Dagnachew Birru*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of validating Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) systems under budget constraints by formalizing it as a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) problem. It aims to maximize distinct failure types by exploring combinatorial document configurations and benchmarking various search strategies. Results show solver complementarity, advocating for portfolio-based strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise-grade IDP systems are critical in high-stakes domains, requiring early-phase validation under budget limits to uncover diverse failure mechanisms rather than a single worst-case scenario.

Method: The study formalizes the problem as SBST, exploring combinatorial document configurations to induce realistic failures. It benchmarks evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum search strategies under fixed budgets.

Result: No single strategy dominates; different solvers uncover unique failure modes. Cross-temporal analysis shows persistent solver-specific discoveries, with portfolio-based approaches recovering the full failure space.

Conclusion: The findings highlight solver complementarity and advocate for portfolio-based SBST strategies to ensure robust IDP validation in industrial settings.

Abstract: Enterprise-grade Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) systems support high-stakes workflows across finance, insurance, and healthcare. Early-phase system validation under limited budgets mandates uncovering diverse failure mechanisms, rather than identifying a single worst-case document. We formalize this challenge as a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) problem, aiming to identify complex interactions between document variables, with the objective to maximize the number of distinct failure types discovered within a fixed evaluation budget. Our methodology operates on a combinatorial space of document configurations, rendering instances of structural \emph{risk features} to induce realistic failure conditions. We benchmark a diverse portfolio of search strategies spanning evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum under identical budget constraints. Through configuration-level exclusivity, win-rate, and cross-temporal overlap analyses, we show that different solvers consistently uncover failure modes that remain undiscovered by specific alternatives at comparable budgets. Crucially, cross-temporal analysis reveals persistent solver-specific discoveries across all evaluated budgets, with no single strategy exhibiting absolute dominance. While the union of all solvers eventually recovers the observed failure space, reliance on any individual method systematically delays the discovery of important risks. These results demonstrate intrinsic solver complementarity and motivate portfolio-based SBST strategies for robust industrial IDP validation.

### [416] [RecNet: Self-Evolving Preference Propagation for Agentic Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21609)
*Bingqian Li,Xiaolei Wang,Junyi Li,Weitao Li,Long Zhang,Sheng Chen,Wayne Xin Zhao,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RecNet is a self-evolving framework for recommender systems that propagates real-time preference updates among users and items using a two-phase approach, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recommender systems rely on sparse and noisy explicit user-item interactions, failing to capture real-time, mutual influences. RecNet aims to address these limitations by proactively propagating preferences.

Method: RecNet uses a two-phase framework: a forward phase with centralized preference routing and personalized reception mechanisms, and a backward phase with feedback-driven optimization using multi-agent reinforcement learning and LLMs.

Result: Experiments show RecNet's effectiveness in modeling preference propagation across various scenarios.

Conclusion: RecNet advances recommender systems by enabling real-time, accurate preference propagation and continuous self-evolution, improving personalized recommendations.

Abstract: Agentic recommender systems leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to model complex user behaviors and support personalized decision-making. However, existing methods primarily model preference changes based on explicit user-item interactions, which are sparse, noisy, and unable to reflect the real-time, mutual influences among users and items. To address these limitations, we propose RecNet, a self-evolving preference propagation framework that proactively propagates real-time preference updates across related users and items. RecNet consists of two complementary phases. In the forward phase, the centralized preference routing mechanism leverages router agents to integrate preference updates and dynamically propagate them to the most relevant agents. To ensure accurate and personalized integration of propagated preferences, we further introduce a personalized preference reception mechanism, which combines a message buffer for temporary caching and an optimizable, rule-based filter memory to guide selective preference assimilation based on past experience and interests. In the backward phase, the feedback-driven propagation optimization mechanism simulates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, using LLMs for credit assignment, gradient analysis, and module-level optimization, enabling continuous self-evolution of propagation strategies. Extensive experiments on various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of RecNet in modeling preference propagation for recommender systems.

### [417] [Semantic Content Determines Algorithmic Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21618)
*Martiño Ríos-García,Nawaf Alampara,Kevin Maik Jablonka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces WhatCounts, a method to test semantic sensitivity in LLMs, showing their behavior varies unpredictably based on input semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that LLMs' algorithmic behavior depends on the semantic content of inputs, contrary to the expectation of invariance.

Method: WhatCounts isolates semantic sensitivity by counting items in unambiguous lists without reasoning steps or distractors.

Result: Frontier LLMs exhibit over 40% accuracy variation based solely on semantic content (e.g., cities vs. chemicals).

Conclusion: LLMs approximate algorithms unpredictably based on input semantics, impacting their reliability in functions beyond counting.

Abstract: Counting should not depend on what is being counted; more generally, any algorithm's behavior should be invariant to the semantic content of its arguments. We introduce WhatCounts to test this property in isolation. Unlike prior work that conflates semantic sensitivity with reasoning complexity or prompt variation, WhatCounts is atomic: count items in an unambiguous, delimited list with no duplicates, distractors, or reasoning steps for different semantic types. Frontier LLMs show over 40% accuracy variation depending solely on what is being counted - cities versus chemicals, names versus symbols. Controlled ablations rule out confounds. The gap is semantic, and it shifts unpredictably with small amounts of unrelated fine-tuning. LLMs do not implement algorithms; they approximate them, and the approximation is argument-dependent. As we show with an agentic example, this has implications beyond counting: any LLM function may carry hidden dependencies on the meaning of its inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of non-determinism in evaluating tool-augmented language models due to live API variability undermines reproducibility and cross-system comparisons. ScholarGym aims to provide a controlled environment for reliable evaluation.

Method: ScholarGym decouples workflow components (query planning, tool invocation, relevance assessment) and uses a static corpus of 570K papers with deterministic retrieval. It includes 2,536 expert-annotated queries for fine-grained analysis.

Result: Experiments with diverse backbone models show interactions between reasoning capabilities, planning strategies, and selection mechanisms during iterative refinement.

Conclusion: ScholarGym offers a reproducible framework for evaluating deep research workflows, enabling controlled analysis and improving reliability in assessing complex information needs.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models have advanced from single-turn question answering to deep research workflows that iteratively plan queries, invoke external tools, and synthesize information to address complex information needs. Evaluating such workflows presents a fundamental challenge: reliance on live APIs introduces non-determinism, as tool invocations may yield different results across runs due to temporal drift, rate limiting, and evolving backend states. This variance undermines reproducibility and invalidates cross-system comparisons.
  We present ScholarGym, a simulation environment for reproducible evaluation of deep research workflows on academic literature. The environment decouples workflow components into query planning, tool invocation, and relevance assessment, enabling fine-grained analysis of each stage under controlled conditions. Built on a static corpus of 570K papers with deterministic retrieval, ScholarGym provides 2,536 queries with expert-annotated ground truth. Experiments across diverse backbone models reveal how reasoning capabilities, planning strategies, and selection mechanisms interact over iterative refinement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SONIC-O1 is a human-verified benchmark evaluating MLLMs on sequential audio-video tasks, revealing performance gaps and disparities across demographics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior MLLM work focuses on static images, leaving sequential audio-video understanding underexplored, necessitating a real-world benchmark.

Method: SONIC-O1 includes 4,958 annotations across 13 conversational domains, testing summarization, MCQ answering, and temporal localization with rationales.

Result: Performance gaps exist, notably a 22.6% difference in temporal localization between closed- and open-source models, with disparities across demographics.

Conclusion: SONIC-O1 offers a robust evaluation suite for multimodal understanding, released openly for reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are a major focus of recent AI research. However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior. Overall, SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding.

*Mingzu Liu,Hao Fang,Runmin Cong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCAP is an unsupervised defense framework for detecting backdoor risks in MLLMs by analyzing attention allocation divergence, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses for backdoor risks in MLLMs either need supervision or lack generalization across triggers and modalities, prompting the need for a better solution.

Method: TCAP decomposes attention maps into three components, uses GMM for profiling trigger-responsive heads, and isolates poisoned samples via EM-based vote aggregation.

Result: TCAP shows strong performance across diverse MLLM architectures and attack methods in experiments.

Conclusion: TCAP is a robust and practical defense against backdoor risks in MLLMs, leveraging attention allocation analysis.

Abstract: Fine-Tuning-as-a-Service (FTaaS) facilitates the customization of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) but introduces critical backdoor risks via poisoned data. Existing defenses either rely on supervised signals or fail to generalize across diverse trigger types and modalities. In this work, we uncover a universal backdoor fingerprint-attention allocation divergence-where poisoned samples disrupt the balanced attention distribution across three functional components: system instructions, vision inputs, and user textual queries, regardless of trigger morphology. Motivated by this insight, we propose Tri-Component Attention Profiling (TCAP), an unsupervised defense framework to filter backdoor samples. TCAP decomposes cross-modal attention maps into the three components, identifies trigger-responsive attention heads via Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) statistical profiling, and isolates poisoned samples through EM-based vote aggregation. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and attack methods demonstrate that TCAP achieves consistently strong performance, establishing it as a robust and practical backdoor defense in MLLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Fovea-Block-Skip Transformer (FBS) to enhance inference efficiency in large language models by mimicking human reading strategies like foresight and chunking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM inference methods lack human-like reading efficiencies such as content-adaptive foresight and structured compute allocation, limiting performance.

Method: FBS integrates three modules: Parafovea-Attention Window (PAW), Chunk-Head (CH), and Skip-Gate (SG), injecting a causal, trainable loop into Transformers.

Result: FBS improves the quality-efficiency trade-off across benchmarks without additional parameters, with modules proving complementary.

Conclusion: FBS successfully addresses inefficiencies in LLM inference by incorporating human-like reading strategies, demonstrating significant improvements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across many tasks, yet inference is still dominated by strictly token-by-token autoregression. Existing acceleration methods largely patch this pipeline and miss core human-reading ingredients: content-adaptive foresight, chunk-structure-aware compute allocation, and train--test consistency for preview/skimming. We propose the \textbf{Fovea-Block-Skip Transformer} (FBS), which injects a causal, trainable loop into Transformers via Parafovea-Attention Window (PAW), Chunk-Head (CH), and Skip-Gate (SG). Across diverse benchmarks, FBS improves the quality-efficiency trade-off without increasing parameters, and ablations show the three modules are complementary.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: E-mem improves LLM agents' reasoning by preserving contextual integrity via episodic context reconstruction, outperforming GAM by 7.75% F1 and reducing token cost by 70%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory preprocessing methods disrupt contextual integrity, hindering deep reasoning in LLMs.

Method: E-mem uses a hierarchical architecture with assistant agents maintaining uncompressed memory contexts and a master agent handling global planning.

Result: E-mem achieves 54% F1 on LoCoMo, surpassing GAM by 7.75% and reducing token cost by 70%.

Conclusion: E-mem enhances reasoning by reconstructing episodic contexts, proving more efficient and effective than existing methods.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents towards System~2 reasoning, characterized by deliberative, high-precision problem-solving, requires maintaining rigorous logical integrity over extended horizons. However, prevalent memory preprocessing paradigms suffer from destructive de-contextualization. By compressing complex sequential dependencies into pre-defined structures (e.g., embeddings or graphs), these methods sever the contextual integrity essential for deep reasoning. To address this, we propose E-mem, a framework shifting from Memory Preprocessing to Episodic Context Reconstruction. Inspired by biological engrams, E-mem employs a heterogeneous hierarchical architecture where multiple assistant agents maintain uncompressed memory contexts, while a central master agent orchestrates global planning. Unlike passive retrieval, our mechanism empowers assistants to locally reason within activated segments, extracting context-aware evidence before aggregation. Evaluations on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that E-mem achieves over 54\% F1, surpassing the state-of-the-art GAM by 7.75\%, while reducing token cost by over 70\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep time series models struggle with noisy real-world data, and existing methods are either ineffective or inefficient. DropoutTS addresses this gap by focusing on adaptive learning.

Method: DropoutTS uses a Sample-Adaptive Dropout mechanism, leveraging spectral sparsity to quantify noise via reconstruction residuals and adjust dropout rates dynamically.

Result: Experiments show DropoutTS enhances performance of existing models across diverse noise regimes and benchmarks, with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: DropoutTS effectively balances robustness and efficiency, offering a practical solution for noisy time series data without modifying model architectures.

Abstract: Deep time series models are vulnerable to noisy data ubiquitous in real-world applications. Existing robustness strategies either prune data or rely on costly prior quantification, failing to balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce DropoutTS, a model-agnostic plugin that shifts the paradigm from "what" to learn to "how much" to learn. DropoutTS employs a Sample-Adaptive Dropout mechanism: leveraging spectral sparsity to efficiently quantify instance-level noise via reconstruction residuals, it dynamically calibrates model learning capacity by mapping noise to adaptive dropout rates - selectively suppressing spurious fluctuations while preserving fine-grained fidelity. Extensive experiments across diverse noise regimes and open benchmarks show DropoutTS consistently boosts superior backbones' performance, delivering advanced robustness with negligible parameter overhead and no architectural modifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with nonlinguistic tasks due to high exploration costs in high-dimensional semantic spaces.

Method: Proposes SCOUT: lightweight scouts explore tasks quickly, then bootstrap LLMs via SFT and RL.

Result: Achieves an average score of 0.86, outperforming proprietary models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro) and saving 60% GPU hours.

Conclusion: SCOUT effectively bridges the gap between LLMs and nonlinguistic tasks by optimizing exploration-exploitation trade-offs.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language-based agentic tasks, their applicability to unseen, nonlinguistic environments (e.g., symbolic or spatial tasks) remains limited. Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight "scouts" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised climate downscaling lacks paired data for GCMs, while zero-shot methods face physical inconsistencies and gradient issues.

Method: ZSSD uses a Physics-Consistent Climate Prior from reanalysis data and Unified Coordinate Guidance to ensure physical validity and robust inference.

Result: ZSSD outperforms zero-shot baselines in 99th percentile errors and accurately reconstructs complex weather events like tropical cyclones.

Conclusion: ZSSD provides a robust, physics-consistent solution for zero-shot climate downscaling across diverse GCMs.

Abstract: Conventional supervised climate downscaling struggles to generalize to Global Climate Models (GCMs) due to the lack of paired training data and inherent domain gaps relative to reanalysis. Meanwhile, current zero-shot methods suffer from physical inconsistencies and vanishing gradient issues under large scaling factors. We propose Zero-Shot Statistical Downscaling (ZSSD), a zero-shot framework that performs statistical downscaling without paired data during training. ZSSD leverages a Physics-Consistent Climate Prior learned from reanalysis data, conditioned on geophysical boundaries and temporal information to enforce physical validity. Furthermore, to enable robust inference across varying GCMs, we introduce Unified Coordinate Guidance. This strategy addresses the vanishing gradient problem in vanilla DPS and ensures consistency with large-scale fields. Results show that ZSSD significantly outperforms existing zero-shot baselines in 99th percentile errors and successfully reconstructs complex weather events, such as tropical cyclones, across heterogeneous GCMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend conceptual spaces theory to temporally realised, goal-directed concepts like chess strategies, enabling recognition and interpretation of abstract ideas over time.

Method: Represent strategy concepts (e.g., attack, sacrifice) as geometric regions in interpretable dimensions and analyze chess games as trajectories toward these regions. Includes dual-perspective modelling.

Result: Feasibility demonstrated; movement patterns align with expert commentary. Supports recognition of intended strategies.

Conclusion: Establishes a foundation for broader applications in sequential decision-making and integrating knowledge evolution for refining abstract concepts.

Abstract: We present a conceptual space framework for modelling abstract concepts that unfold over time, demonstrated through a chess-based proof-of-concept. Strategy concepts, such as attack or sacrifice, are represented as geometric regions across interpretable quality dimensions, with chess games instantiated and analysed as trajectories whose directional movement toward regions enables recognition of intended strategies. This approach also supports dual-perspective modelling, capturing how players interpret identical situations differently. Our implementation demonstrates the feasibility of trajectory-based concept recognition, with movement patterns aligning with expert commentary. This work explores extending the conceptual spaces theory to temporally realised, goal-directed concepts. The approach establishes a foundation for broader applications involving sequential decision-making and supports integration with knowledge evolution mechanisms for learning and refining abstract concepts over time.

The benchmark contains curated end-to-end tasks (e.g., RNA-seq, variant calling, metagenomics) with prompts that specify concrete output artifacts to support automated assessment, including stress testing under controlled perturbations. We evaluate frontier closed-source and open-weight models across multiple agent harnesses, and use an LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity. We find that frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines without elaborate custom scaffolding, often producing the requested final artifacts reliably. However, robustness tests reveal failure modes under controlled perturbations (corrupted inputs, decoy files, and prompt bloat), indicating that correct high-level pipeline construction does not guarantee reliable step-level reasoning. Finally, because bioinformatics workflows may involve sensitive patient data, proprietary references, or unpublished IP, closed-source models can be unsuitable under strict privacy constraints; in such settings, open-weight models may be preferable despite lower completion rates. We release the dataset and evaluation suite publicly.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-centered framework for automated recognition and feedback in endotracheal suctioning training, improving accuracy and providing interpretable feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of automated systems for endotracheal suctioning training, especially in unsupervised settings like home care and education.

Method: Proposes a unified framework using LLMs for video-based activity recognition and feedback generation, benchmarked against traditional machine learning and deep learning methods.

Result: The LLM-based approach outperforms baselines, achieving 15-20% higher accuracy and F1 scores, and includes a pilot feedback module using anomaly detection and XAI.

Conclusion: The framework offers scalable, interpretable, and data-driven solutions to enhance nursing education and patient safety.

Abstract: Endotracheal suctioning (ES) is an invasive yet essential clinical procedure that requires a high degree of skill to minimize patient risk - particularly in home care and educational settings, where consistent supervision may be limited. Despite its critical importance, automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements. Collectively, these contributions establish a scalable, interpretable, and data-driven foundation for advancing nursing education, enhancing training efficiency, and ultimately improving patient safety.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CORE, a collaborative framework for distributed LLMs in 6G networks, enhancing efficiency through optimized role orchestration and execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges posed by fragmented computing resources in hierarchical networks, enabling LLMs to perform complex reasoning tasks collaboratively.

Method: Introduces CORE, integrating real-time perception, dynamic role orchestration, and pipeline-parallel execution, with a role affinity scheduling algorithm for efficient LLM collaboration.

Result: Demonstrates improved system efficiency and task completion rates in 6G scenarios, validated on a real-world edge-computing platform.

Conclusion: CORE effectively addresses resource heterogeneity in 6G networks, enhancing collaborative LLM performance in practical applications.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in sixth-generation (6G) networks and large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for ubiquitous intelligence, wherein seamless connectivity and distributed artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized various aspects of our lives.However, realizing this vision faces significant challenges owing to the fragmented and heterogeneous computing resources across hierarchical networks, which are insufficient for individual LLM agents to perform complex reasoning tasks.To address this issue, we propose Collaborative Orchestration Role at Edge (CORE), an innovative framework that employs a collaborative learning system in which multiple LLMs, each assigned a distinct functional role, are distributed across mobile devices and tiered edge servers. The system integrates three optimization modules, encompassing real-time perception,dynamic role orchestration, and pipeline-parallel execution, to facilitate efficient and rapid collaboration among distributed agents. Furthermore, we introduce a novel role affinity scheduling algorithm for dynamically orchestrating LLM role assignments across the hierarchical edge infrastructure, intelligently matching computational demands with available dispersed resources.Finally, comprehensive case studies and performance evaluations across various 6G application scenarios demonstrated the efficacy of CORE, revealing significant enhancements in the system efficiency and task completion rates. Building on these promising outcomes, we further validated the practical applicability of CORE by deploying it on a real-world edge-computing platform,that exhibits robust performance in operational environments.

*Francesca Filice,Edoardo De Rose,Simone Bartucci,Francesco Calimeri,Simona Perri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a comprehensive benchmarking framework for ECG-expert Foundation Models (FMs), combining performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis using SHAP and UMAP techniques. It evaluates FMs across diverse datasets and data scarcity scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the gap in evaluating ECG-expert FMs beyond downstream performance, emphasizing the need for generalizable embeddings in healthcare.

Method: The authors introduce a benchmark methodology that includes SHAP and UMAP techniques for representation-level analysis. They evaluate multiple ECG-expert FMs pretrained using state-of-the-art methods on cross-continental datasets, including those with data scarcity.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the benchmarking protocol offers detailed insights into FMs' embedded patterns, enhancing understanding of their representational structure and generalizability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust and comprehensive evaluation of ECG-expert FMs, aiding responsible deployment in healthcare.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a cost-effective, highly accessible and widely employed diagnostic tool. With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings. However, to responsibly employ FMs, it is crucial to rigorously assess to which extent the embeddings they produce are generalizable, particularly in error-sensitive domains such as healthcare. Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios. Experimental results show that our benchmarking protocol provides a rich insight of ECG-expert FMs' embedded patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of their representational structure and generalizability.

*So Fukuhara,Abdallah Alabdallah,Nuwan Gunasekara,Slawomir Nowaczyk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simulation framework to evaluate forecasting models in spare parts inventory management, emphasizing operational KPIs over statistical accuracy, and shows discrepancies between accuracy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in evaluating forecasting models by their operational impact rather than statistical accuracy in the automotive aftermarket.

Method: Proposes a decision-centric simulation framework with demand generation, forecasting, and inventory control modules to assess models in realistic settings.

Result: Demonstrates that improved accuracy metrics do not always enhance operational performance, and models with similar errors can yield different cost-service trade-offs.

Conclusion: The framework bridges forecasting and inventory management, prioritizing operational relevance over traditional accuracy metrics.

Abstract: Efficient management of spare parts inventory is crucial in the automotive aftermarket, where demand is highly intermittent and uncertainty drives substantial cost and service risks. Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowBias is a lightweight framework that mitigates LLM bias by strengthening neurons encoding bias-knowledge, outperforming existing debiasing methods with minimal utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current debiasing methods are brittle, data-inefficient, and degrade model capabilities. KnowBias aims to address these limitations by leveraging bias-knowledge neurons.

Method: KnowBias identifies bias-knowledge neurons via attribution-based analysis and selectively enhances them during inference, requiring only a few yes/no questions.

Result: Experiments show KnowBias achieves state-of-the-art debiasing with minimal impact on general capabilities and generalizes across bias types and demographics.

Conclusion: KnowBias offers a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for mitigating LLM biases while preserving model utility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases that reinforce harmful stereotypes, limiting their safe deployment. Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining. Experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art debiasing performance with minimal utility degradation.

*Yao Zhang,Shijie Tang,Zeyu Li,Zhen Han,Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WebArbiter introduces a reasoning-first WebPRM for web navigation, addressing limitations of existing methods with structured justifications and a two-stage training pipeline, outperforming baselines significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WebPRMs face challenges like sparse supervision and weak interpretability, motivating the need for a more robust and principled approach to reward modeling.

Method: WebArbiter uses reasoning distillation for principle-guided reasoning and reinforcement learning to align verdicts with correctness, trained via a two-stage pipeline.

Result: WebArbiter-7B outperforms GPT-5 by 9.1 points on WebPRMBench and surpasses prior WebPRMs by up to 7.2 points in real-world tasks.

Conclusion: WebArbiter demonstrates superior performance and robustness, validating its practical value for complex web tasks.

Abstract: Web agents hold great potential for automating complex computer tasks, yet their interactions involve long-horizon, sequential decision-making with irreversible actions. In such settings, outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed, often rewarding incorrect trajectories and failing to support inference-time scaling. This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context. Training follows a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation equips the model with coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning corrects teacher biases by directly aligning verdicts with correctness, enabling stronger generalization. To support systematic evaluation, we release WebPRMBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning four diverse web environments with rich tasks and high-quality preference annotations. On WebPRMBench, WebArbiter-7B outperforms the strongest baseline, GPT-5, by 9.1 points. In reward-guided trajectory search on WebArena-Lite, it surpasses the best prior WebPRM by up to 7.2 points, underscoring its robustness and practical value in real-world complex web tasks.

*Minwoo Jang,Hoyoung Kim,Jabin Koo,Jungseul Ok*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Trap² is proposed as an architecture-agnostic framework to protect model weights from unauthorized merging by degrading performance when weights are re-scaled.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses against unauthorized model merging are inconsistent and architecture-specific, leaving a governance gap.

Method: Trap² encodes protection into model updates during fine-tuning, using weight re-scaling as a proxy for merging.

Result: Released weights remain effective standalone but degrade under re-scaling, preventing unauthorized merging.

Conclusion: Trap² offers a practical solution to close the governance gap in model merging by ensuring protection across diverse architectures.

Abstract: The rise of model hubs has made it easier to access reusable model components, making model merging a practical tool for combining capabilities. Yet, this modularity also creates a \emph{governance gap}: downstream users can recompose released weights into unauthorized mixtures that bypass safety alignment or licensing terms. Because existing defenses are largely post-hoc and architecture-specific, they provide inconsistent protection across diverse architectures and release formats in practice. To close this gap, we propose \textsc{Trap}$^{2}$, an architecture-agnostic protection framework that encodes protection into the update during fine-tuning, regardless of whether they are released as adapters or full models. Instead of relying on architecture-dependent approaches, \textsc{Trap}$^{2}$ uses weight re-scaling as a simple proxy for the merging process. It keeps released weights effective in standalone use, but degrades them under re-scaling that often arises in merging, undermining unauthorized merging.

TL;DR: Current LLM methods optimize reasoning trajectories via SFT and RL but misalign with human problem-solving. Proposing CoMT and CCRL to mimic human cognition improves performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between current LLM training methods and human problem-solving by decomposing learning into abstract strategy acquisition and task adaptation.

Method: Introduce Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) for abstract reasoning patterns and Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) for task-specific execution with confidence-aware rewards.

Result: Achieves 2.19% and 4.63% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution, reduces training time by 65-70%, and cuts token use by 50%.

Conclusion: Aligning LLM post-training with human cognitive principles enhances generalization and training efficiency.

Abstract: Current LLM post-training methods optimize complete reasoning trajectories through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability. Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19\% and 4.63\% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution respectively over standard methods, while reducing training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%, demonstrating that aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields not only superior generalization but also enhanced training efficiency.

TL;DR: ProRAG is a process-supervised RL framework for optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by integrating step-level supervision into online optimization, outperforming traditional RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL methods for RAG suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, leading to flawed reasoning despite correct answers. Process-aware approaches lack on-policy exploration.

Method: ProRAG involves four stages: Supervised Policy Warmup, MCTS-based Process Reward Model construction, PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement, and Process-Supervised RL with dual-granularity advantage.

Result: ProRAG outperforms outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, especially in complex long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: Fine-grained process supervision in ProRAG effectively addresses credit assignment and reward sparsity, improving RL-based RAG performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a promising paradigm for optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in complex reasoning tasks. However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to "process hallucinations", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision.

TL;DR: JADE is a unified framework for joint optimization of planning and execution in dynamic, multi-turn workflows, addressing the mismatch in decoupled systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing paradigms in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) suffer from a strategic-operational mismatch due to decoupled optimization of planning and execution, leading to poor performance despite system complexity.

Method: JADE models the system as a cooperative multi-agent team with a shared backbone, enabling end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards and co-adaptation between planner and executors.

Result: Empirical results show JADE improves performance by transforming disjoint modules into a synergistic system, balancing efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: JADE successfully unifies planning and execution in dynamic workflows, addressing limitations of decoupled approaches and enabling better system performance.

Abstract: The evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shifted from static retrieval pipelines to dynamic, agentic workflows where a central planner orchestrates multi-turn reasoning. However, existing paradigms face a critical dichotomy: they either optimize modules jointly within rigid, fixed-graph architectures, or empower dynamic planning while treating executors as frozen, black-box tools. We identify that this \textit{decoupled optimization} creates a ``strategic-operational mismatch,'' where sophisticated planning strategies fail to materialize due to unadapted local executors, often leading to negative performance gains despite increased system complexity. In this paper, we propose \textbf{JADE} (\textbf{J}oint \textbf{A}gentic \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{E}xecution), a unified framework for the joint optimization of planning and execution within dynamic, multi-turn workflows. By modeling the system as a cooperative multi-agent team unified under a single shared backbone, JADE enables end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards. This approach facilitates \textit{co-adaptation}: the planner learns to operate within the capability boundaries of the executors, while the executors evolve to align with high-level strategic intent. Empirical results demonstrate that JADE transforms disjoint modules into a synergistic system, yielding remarkable performance improvements via joint optimization and enabling a flexible balance between efficiency and effectiveness through dynamic workflow orchestration.

TL;DR: SCMA, a multi-agent RL framework, reduces redundant reasoning in Large Reasoning Models by selectively penalizing redundancy while preserving essential logic, improving both brevity and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based solutions struggle to balance brevity and accuracy in Large Reasoning Models due to simplistic reward weighting, risking loss of critical reasoning logic.

Method: SCMA employs a multi-agent RL framework with Segmentation and Scoring agents to detect and penalize redundant reasoning chunks, preserving essential logic through collaborative training.

Result: SCMA reduces response length by 11.1% to 39.0% and boosts accuracy by 4.33% to 10.02%, outperforming vanilla RL methods.

Conclusion: SCMA's multi-agent approach effectively balances brevity and accuracy in reasoning models, demonstrating superior performance and emergent optimization behaviors.

Abstract: The inference overhead induced by redundant reasoning undermines the interactive experience and severely bottlenecks the deployment of Large Reasoning Models. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based solutions tackle this problem by coupling a length penalty with outcome-based rewards. This simplistic reward weighting struggles to reconcile brevity with accuracy, as enforcing brevity may compromise critical reasoning logic. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a multi-agent RL framework that selectively penalizes redundant chunks, while preserving essential reasoning logic. Our framework, Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA), instantiates redundancy detection and evaluation through two specialized agents: \textbf{a Segmentation Agent} for decomposing the reasoning process into logical chunks, and \textbf{a Scoring Agent} for quantifying the significance of each chunk. The Segmentation and Scoring agents collaboratively define an importance-weighted length penalty during training, incentivizing \textbf{a Reasoning Agent} to prioritize essential logic without introducing inference overhead during deployment. Empirical evaluations across model scales demonstrate that SCMA reduces response length by 11.1\% to 39.0\% while boosting accuracy by 4.33\% to 10.02\%. Furthermore, ablation studies and qualitative analysis validate that the synergistic optimization within the MARL framework fosters emergent behaviors, yielding more powerful LRMs compared to vanilla RL paradigms.

TL;DR: AgenticSimLaw is a structured, multi-agent debate framework for transparent, controllable high-stakes decision-making, outperforming single-agent reasoning in stability and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for transparent and auditable reasoning in high-stakes tasks, such as recidivism prediction, where ethical complexity demands accountability.

Method: Uses a courtroom-style orchestration with defined roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn debate), and private reasoning strategies, tested on the NLSY97 dataset.

Result: Outperforms traditional chain-of-thought prompting in stability and generalizability, with better correlation between accuracy and F1-score, while offering fine-grained control and explainability.

Conclusion: AgenticSimLaw provides a scalable, auditable solution for high-stakes decisions, generalizable beyond criminal justice to any domain requiring transparency and oversight.

Abstract: We introduce AgenticSimLaw, a role-structured, multi-agent debate framework that provides transparent and controllable test-time reasoning for high-stakes tabular decision-making tasks. Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight. This work addresses key LLM-based multi-agent system challenges: organization through structured roles, observability through logged interactions, and responsibility through explicit non-deployment constraints for sensitive domains.

TL;DR: DeR2 is a controlled sandbox for evaluating document-grounded reasoning in large language models, isolating reasoning from retrieval and parametric memorization while simulating deep research challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks confound reasoning with retrieval and toolchain choices, making it unclear if models can reason over novel scientific information. DeR2 addresses this by isolating reasoning challenges.

Method: DeR2 uses four regimes (Instruction-only, Concepts, Related-only, Full-set) to decouple evidence access from reasoning, enabling fine-grained error attribution. It employs a two-phase validation to prevent parametric leakage and ensures reproducibility with frozen document libraries.

Result: Experiments show significant model variation: some exhibit fragility or misuse concepts despite correct naming, highlighting substantial headroom for improvement.

Conclusion: DeR2 provides a rigorous framework for evaluating reasoning in language models, revealing performance gaps and opportunities for improvement.

Abstract: Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, it remains unclear whether large language models can reason over genuinely novel scientific information. Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.

TL;DR: ToolWeaver proposes hierarchical tool encoding to address scalability and semantic challenges in retrieval-based pipelines, outperforming existing methods with 47,000 tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with scalability and semantic limitations due to isolated tool tokens, hindering collaborative tool relationships.

Method: ToolWeaver encodes tools hierarchically, using shared codes for dense learning patterns and integrating them into LLMs via generative alignment.

Result: ToolWeaver achieves better scalability and generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques on a dataset of 47,000 tools.

Conclusion: ToolWeaver offers a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware framework for tool-augmented agents.

Abstract: Prevalent retrieval-based tool-use pipelines struggle with a dual semantic challenge: their retrievers often employ encoders that fail to capture complex semantics, while the Large Language Model (LLM) itself lacks intrinsic tool knowledge from its natural language pretraining. Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.

### [442] [How do Visual Attributes Influence Web Agents? A Comprehensive Evaluation of User Interface Design Factors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21961)
*Kuai Yu,Naicheng Yu,Han Wang,Rui Yang,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VAF is a pipeline to evaluate how visual attributes influence web-agent decision-making, showing attributes like color contrast and item size strongly impact actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks systematic understanding of how visual attributes shape web-agent behavior in benign scenarios.

Method: VAF involves variant generation, browsing interaction, and validation using Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate.

Result: Background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity strongly influence agents, while font styling and text color have minor effects.

Conclusion: Visual attributes significantly impact web-agent decision-making, with certain attributes having stronger effects than others.

Abstract: Web agents have demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of web-based tasks. However, existing research on the effect of environmental variation has mostly focused on robustness to adversarial attacks, with less attention to agents' preferences in benign scenarios. Although early studies have examined how textual attributes influence agent behavior, a systematic understanding of how visual attributes shape agent decision-making remains limited. To address this, we introduce VAF, a controlled evaluation pipeline for quantifying how webpage Visual Attribute Factors influence web-agent decision-making. Specifically, VAF consists of three stages: (i) variant generation, which ensures the variants share identical semantics as the original item while only differ in visual attributes; (ii) browsing interaction, where agents navigate the page via scrolling and clicking the interested item, mirroring how human users browse online; (iii) validating through both click action and reasoning from agents, which we use the Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate to jointly evaluate the effect of visual attributes. By quantitatively measuring the decision-making difference between the original and variant, we identify which visual attributes influence agents' behavior most. Extensive experiments, across 8 variant families (48 variants total), 5 real-world websites (including shopping, travel, and news browsing), and 4 representative web agents, show that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity have a strong influence on agents' actions, whereas font styling, text color, and item image clarity exhibit minor effects.

### [443] [The Energy Impact of Domain Model Design in Classical Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21967)
*Ilche Georgievski,Serhat Tekin,Marco Aiello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how domain model design impacts energy consumption in classical planners, challenging traditional AI priorities by emphasizing Green AI's focus on energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the lack of attention to energy efficiency in automated planning, despite its computational demands, and the potential to leverage modular planning structures for systematic energy analysis.

Method: The study introduces a domain model configuration framework to vary features like element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states, and empirically tests energy and runtime impacts using five planners and 32 domain variants per benchmark.

Result: Results show that domain-level modifications lead to measurable differences in energy consumption across planners, with energy usage not always correlating with runtime.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of domain model design in achieving energy efficiency in automated planning, advocating for broader consideration of energy consumption in AI research.

Abstract: AI research has traditionally prioritised algorithmic performance, such as optimising accuracy in machine learning or runtime in automated planning. The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime.

### [444] [Mind the Gap: How Elicitation Protocols Shape the Stated-Revealed Preference Gap in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21975)
*Pranav Mahajan,Ihor Kendiukhov,Syed Hussain,Lydia Nottingham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines how elicitation protocols affect the correlation between stated and revealed preferences in language models (LMs), finding that neutrality and abstention options can improve correlation but also introduce challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the mismatch between values models endorse (stated preferences) and choices they make (revealed preferences) by evaluating the impact of elicitation protocols.

Method: Systematically study 24 LMs using different elicitation protocols, including neutrality and abstention options, and measure Spearman's rank correlation ($ρ$).

Result: Allowing neutrality in stated preferences improves correlation, but abstention in revealed preferences reduces correlation. System prompt steering does not reliably improve correlation.

Conclusion: SvR correlation depends heavily on elicitation protocols, highlighting the need for methods that handle indeterminate preferences.

Abstract: Recent work identifies a stated-revealed (SvR) preference gap in language models (LMs): a mismatch between the values models endorse and the choices they make in context. Existing evaluations rely heavily on binary forced-choice prompting, which entangles genuine preferences with artifacts of the elicitation protocol. We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($ρ$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $ρ$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. Finally, we find that system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas. Together, our results show that SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent and that preference elicitation requires methods that account for indeterminate preferences.

*Geonhee Jo,Mingu Kang,Kangmin Lee,Minho Lee,Pascal Bauer,Sang-Ki Ko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VERSA is a verification framework for ensuring integrity in soccer event data, detecting and correcting inconsistencies, and improving downstream analytics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event stream data in sports often has quality issues like logical inconsistencies, limiting reliability for fine-grained analysis.

Method: VERSA uses a state-transition model to define valid event sequences, enabling automatic detection and correction of anomalies.

Result: Analysis of K League 1 data showed 18.81% inconsistencies; VERSA improved cross-provider consistency and downstream task VAEP performance.

Conclusion: VERSA enhances data reliability, proving effective for robust sports analytics.

Abstract: Event stream data is a critical resource for fine-grained analysis across various domains, including financial transactions, system operations, and sports. In sports, it is actively used for fine-grained analyses such as quantifying player contributions and identifying tactical patterns. However, the reliability of these models is fundamentally limited by inherent data quality issues that cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect event ordering or missing events). To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions. These results highlight that the verification process is highly effective in increasing the reliability of data-driven analysis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Liquid Interfaces, a new coordination paradigm for adaptive, probabilistic agents, replacing static interfaces with ephemeral, intention-driven interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of integrating autonomous agents with adaptive reasoning into systems dominated by static, deterministic interfaces.

Method: Proposes the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP) to formalize intention-driven interaction, negotiated execution, and ephemerality under semantic uncertainty.

Result: Develops a reference architecture to demonstrate the practical feasibility of Liquid Interfaces.

Conclusion: Liquid Interfaces offer a principled approach for adaptive coordination in agent-based systems.

Abstract: Contemporary software architectures struggle to support autonomous agents whose reasoning is adaptive, probabilistic, and context-dependent, while system integration remains dominated by static interfaces and deterministic contracts. This paper introduces Liquid Interfaces, a coordination paradigm in which interfaces are not persistent technical artifacts, but ephemeral relational events that emerge through intention articulation and semantic negotiation at runtime.We formalize this model and present the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP),which governs intention-driven interaction, negotiated execution, and enforce ephemerality under semantic uncertainty. We further discuss the governance implications of this approach and describe a reference architecture that demonstrates practical feasibility. Liquid Interfaces provide a principled foundation for adaptive coordination in agent-based systems

*Yiren Zhao,Junyi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies memory and interconnect bottlenecks in AI agent inference, introduces new metrics (OI/CF) to address these issues, and proposes system-level solutions like disaggregated serving and specialized hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address bottlenecks in AI agent inference beyond compute, such as memory capacity and bandwidth, which are overlooked by traditional roofline analysis.

Method: The authors introduce two new metrics, Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF), and analyze their impact across various agentic workflows and model choices.

Result: OI/CF highlights memory-bound regimes, especially for long-context KV cache, motivating system-level optimizations like disaggregated serving and specialized accelerators.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that disaggregated serving, hardware co-design, and high-bandwidth memory are key to sustaining efficiency in large-scale AI agent inference.

Abstract: AI agent inference is driving an inference heavy datacenter future and exposes bottlenecks beyond compute - especially memory capacity, memory bandwidth and high-speed interconnect. We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference.

TL;DR: Agentic RL introduces Agent-RRM, a reward model providing structured feedback to improve agent training by differentiating reasoning quality, and evaluates three integration strategies, with Reagent-U showing superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Agentic RL methods rely on sparse outcome-based rewards, which do not account for intermediate reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal training results. This paper aims to address this limitation by introducing a multi-faceted reward model.

Method: The paper proposes Agent-RRM, which provides explicit reasoning traces, focused critiques, and overall scores for agentic trajectories. It investigates three integration strategies: Reagent-C, Reagent-R, and Reagent-U.

Result: Reagent-U outperforms others, achieving 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA, demonstrating the effectiveness of the reasoning reward model and training schemes.

Conclusion: Agent-RRM and its integration strategies significantly improve agent performance, validated across diverse benchmarks, and all resources are released for future research.

Abstract: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has achieved notable success in enabling agents to perform complex reasoning and tool use. However, most methods still relies on sparse outcome-based reward for training. Such feedback fails to differentiate intermediate reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal training results. In this paper, we introduce Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM), a multi-faceted reward model that produces structured feedback for agentic trajectories, including (1) an explicit reasoning trace , (2) a focused critique that provides refinement guidance by highlighting reasoning flaws, and (3) an overall score that evaluates process performance. Leveraging these signals, we systematically investigate three integration strategies: Reagent-C (text-augmented refinement), Reagent-R (reward-augmented guidance), and Reagent-U (unified feedback integration). Extensive evaluations across 12 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Reagent-U yields substantial performance leaps, achieving 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA, validating the effectiveness of our reasoning reward model and training schemes. Code, models, and datasets are all released to facilitate future research.

### [449] [CAR-bench: Evaluating the Consistency and Limit-Awareness of LLM Agents under Real-World Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22027)
*Johannes Kirmayr,Lukas Stappen,Elisabeth André*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAR-bench evaluates LLM agents' reliability in handling incomplete or ambiguous requests, focusing on consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in real-world scenarios like in-car assistants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook LLM agents' reliability in real-world, user-facing applications where requests are often incomplete or ambiguous.

Method: CAR-bench introduces multi-turn interactions, domain policies, and 58 tools, including Hallucination and Disambiguation tasks to test agents' limit-awareness and uncertainty resolution.

Result: Baseline results show gaps in consistent success, with even top LLMs struggling (<50% pass rate) on Disambiguation tasks and violating policies in Hallucination tasks.

Conclusion: There is a need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings, as current models often fail under uncertainty.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents focus on task completion under idealistic settings but overlook reliability in real-world, user-facing applications. In domains, such as in-car voice assistants, users often issue incomplete or ambiguous requests, creating intrinsic uncertainty that agents must manage through dialogue, tool use, and policy adherence. We introduce CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant domain. The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Beyond standard task completion, CAR-bench introduces Hallucination tasks that test agents' limit-awareness under missing tools or information, and Disambiguation tasks that require resolving uncertainty through clarification or internal information gathering. Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types. Even frontier reasoning LLMs achieve less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information to satisfy user requests in Hallucination tasks, underscoring the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AWO optimizes agentic workflows by identifying redundant tool executions, creating meta-tools to reduce LLM calls and improve success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic workflows are costly and prone to failures due to iterative reasoning and hallucinations.

Method: AWO analyzes workflow traces, identifies redundant tool calls, and replaces them with deterministic meta-tools.

Result: Reduces LLM calls by up to 11.9% and increases task success rate by up to 4.2 percentage points.

Conclusion: AWO enhances efficiency and robustness of agentic workflows by optimizing tool execution patterns.

Abstract: Agentic AI enables LLM to dynamically reason, plan, and interact with tools to solve complex tasks. However, agentic workflows often require many iterative reasoning steps and tool invocations, leading to significant operational expense, end-to-end latency and failures due to hallucinations. This work introduces Agent Workflow Optimization (AWO), a framework that identifies and optimizes redundant tool execution patterns to improve the efficiency and robustness of agentic workflows. AWO analyzes existing workflow traces to discover recurring sequences of tool calls and transforms them into meta-tools, which are deterministic, composite tools that bundle multiple agent actions into a single invocation. Meta-tools bypass unnecessary intermediate LLM reasoning steps and reduce operational cost while also shortening execution paths, leading to fewer failures. Experiments on two agentic AI benchmarks show that AWO reduces the number of LLM calls up to 11.9% while also increasing the task success rate by up to 4.2 percent points.

*Grzegorz Stefanski,Alberto Presta,Michal Byra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RTL proposes an adaptive pruning framework discovering specialized subnetworks (adaptive tickets) tailored to data heterogeneity, outperforming baselines with fewer parameters and addressing subnetwork collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis assumes a single universal winning ticket, ignoring data heterogeneity. RTL aims to address this by discovering multiple specialized subnetworks.

Method: RTL introduces adaptive pruning to create subnetworks (adaptive tickets) for different data classes/clusters/environments, using fewer parameters than independent models.

Result: RTL outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in accuracy and recall, uses 10x fewer parameters, and introduces a label-free oversparsification diagnosis.

Conclusion: RTL redefines pruning as aligning model structure with data heterogeneity, enabling more modular and context-aware deep learning.

Abstract: In pruning, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that large networks contain sparse subnetworks, or winning tickets, that can be trained in isolation to match the performance of their dense counterparts. However, most existing approaches assume a single universal winning ticket shared across all inputs, ignoring the inherent heterogeneity of real-world data. In this work, we propose Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks, called adaptive tickets, each tailored to a class, semantic cluster, or environmental condition. Across diverse datasets and tasks, RTL consistently outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in balanced accuracy and recall, while using up to 10 times fewer parameters than independent models and exhibiting semantically aligned. Furthermore, we identify subnetwork collapse, a performance drop under aggressive pruning, and introduce a subnetwork similarity score that enables label-free diagnosis of oversparsification. Overall, our results recast pruning as a mechanism for aligning model structure with data heterogeneity, paving the way toward more modular and context-aware deep learning.

TL;DR: A novel Safety-by-Design method defines the Operational Design Domain (ODD) from collected data using kernel-based representation, validated for safety-critical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defining ODD for AI systems in complex environments is challenging but crucial for certification.

Method: Multi-dimensional kernel-based representation to define ODD a posteriori from data, validated via Monte Carlo and aviation use cases.

Result: Data-driven ODD can match the hidden ODD of the data, enabling certification of safety-critical AI systems.

Conclusion: Kernel-based ODD supports certification of data-driven AI systems, enhancing safety-by-design.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been on the rise in many domains, including numerous safety-critical applications. However, for complex systems found in the real world, or when data already exist, defining the underlying environmental conditions is extremely challenging. This often results in an incomplete description of the environment in which the AI-based system must operate. Nevertheless, this description, called the Operational Design Domain (ODD), is required in many domains for the certification of AI-based systems. Traditionally, the ODD is created in the early stages of the development process, drawing on sophisticated expert knowledge and related standards. This paper presents a novel Safety-by-Design method to a posteriori define the ODD from previously collected data using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation. This approach is validated through both Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case for a future safety-critical collision-avoidance system. Moreover, by defining under what conditions two ODDs are equal, the paper shows that the data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data. Utilizing the novel, Safe-by-Design kernel-based ODD enables future certification of data-driven, safety-critical AI-based systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in testing LLMs for complex enterprise systems, where hidden workflows and cascading effects pose unique challenges not covered by existing benchmarks.

Method: Developed WoW, a ServiceNow-based environment with 4,000+ business rules and 55 workflows, and WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks to evaluate LLMs in constrained task completion and dynamics modeling.

Result: Frontier LLMs exhibit dynamics blindness, failing to predict cascading side effects, leading to silent constraint violations. Grounded world modeling is proposed to improve reliability.

Conclusion: WoW highlights the need for LLMs to learn system dynamics explicitly for reliable enterprise agents, with the environment and benchmark released for further research.

Abstract: Frontier large language models (LLMs) excel as autonomous agents in many domains, yet they remain untested in complex enterprise systems where hidden workflows create cascading effects across interconnected databases. Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: An AI-augmented decentralized framework improves multi-agent environmental mapping by adaptively refining density estimates and mitigating local minima, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional coverage methods struggle with uncertain or biased priors, prompting the need for an adaptive, self-correcting solution.

Method: The framework uses an optimal transport-based approach with dual MLPs to refine local density estimates and regulate uncertainty in unexplored regions.

Result: The method achieves robust alignment with ground-truth density and higher-fidelity reconstruction of complex distributions compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The AI-augmented framework ensures theoretical consistency and scalability, offering superior performance in uncertain environments.

Abstract: This paper presents an AI-augmented decentralized framework for multi-agent (multi-robot) environmental mapping under limited sensing and communication. While conventional coverage formulations achieve effective spatial allocation when an accurate reference map is available, their performance deteriorates under uncertain or biased priors. The proposed method introduces an adaptive and self-correcting mechanism that enables agents to iteratively refine local density estimates within an optimal transport-based framework, ensuring theoretical consistency and scalability. A dual multilayer perceptron (MLP) module enhances adaptivity by inferring local mean-variance statistics and regulating virtual uncertainty for long-unvisited regions, mitigating stagnation around local minima. Theoretical analysis rigorously proves convergence under the Wasserstein metric, while simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AI-augmented Density-Driven Optimal Control consistently achieves robust and precise alignment with the ground-truth density, yielding substantially higher-fidelity reconstruction of complex multi-modal spatial distributions compared with conventional decentralized baselines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable framework for Mean-Field Control (MFC) on sparse graphs, introducing a dynamic programming principle and justifying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for efficient control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MFC assumes dense, all-to-all interactions, which limits applicability to real-world sparse networks. The work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Redefines the system state as a probability measure over localized neighborhoods, proving horizon-dependent locality and introducing a Dynamic Programming Principle (DPP). Uses GNNs for actor-critic algorithms.

Result: Demonstrates scalable reinforcement learning on sparse graphs and proves finite-horizon locality, making the problem tractable.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes classical MFC and enables efficient control on sparse topologies, validated theoretically and experimentally.

Abstract: Mean-field control (MFC) offers a scalable solution to the curse of dimensionality in multi-agent systems but traditionally hinges on the restrictive assumption of exchangeability via dense, all-to-all interactions. In this work, we bridge the gap to real-world network structures by proposing a rigorous framework for MFC on large sparse graphs. We redefine the system state as a probability measure over decorated rooted neighborhoods, effectively capturing local heterogeneity. Our central contribution is a theoretical foundation for scalable reinforcement learning in this setting. We prove horizon-dependent locality: for finite-horizon problems, an agent's optimal policy at time t depends strictly on its (T-t)-hop neighborhood. This result renders the infinite-dimensional control problem tractable and underpins a novel Dynamic Programming Principle (DPP) on the lifted space of neighborhood distributions. Furthermore, we formally and experimentally justify the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for actor-critic algorithms in this context. Our framework naturally recovers classical MFC as a degenerate case while enabling efficient, theoretically grounded control on complex sparse topologies.

*Naomi Pitzer,Daniela Mihai*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The study explores emergent communication in agents with heterogeneous modalities, showing that multimodal systems develop structured representations despite perceptual misalignments, while unimodal systems communicate more efficiently. Findings suggest meaning is encoded distributionally, not compositionally, and interoperability requires fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand how agents develop shared representations despite perceptual heterogeneity, addressing gaps in emergent communication studies that often assume homogeneous modalities.

Method: A heterogeneous multi-step binary communication game is studied, involving agents with different modalities and no perceptual grounding. Bit perturbation experiments and interoperability analyses are conducted.

Result: Multimodal systems achieve class-consistent messages grounded in perceptual input but require more information exchange with higher uncertainty. Unimodal systems communicate more efficiently. Meaning is encoded distributionally, and cross-system communication succeeds only after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Emergent communication serves as a framework for studying representation adaptation across heterogeneous modalities, offering new theoretical and experimental directions.

Abstract: Emergent communication offers insight into how agents develop shared structured representations, yet most research assumes homogeneous modalities or aligned representational spaces, overlooking the perceptual heterogeneity of real-world settings. We study a heterogeneous multi-step binary communication game where agents differ in modality and lack perceptual grounding. Despite perceptual misalignment, multimodal systems converge to class-consistent messages grounded in perceptual input. Unimodal systems communicate more efficiently, using fewer bits and achieving lower classification entropy, while multimodal agents require greater information exchange and exhibit higher uncertainty. Bit perturbation experiments provide strong evidence that meaning is encoded in a distributional rather than compositional manner, as each bit's contribution depends on its surrounding pattern. Finally, interoperability analyses show that systems trained in different perceptual worlds fail to directly communicate, but limited fine-tuning enables successful cross-system communication. This work positions emergent communication as a framework for studying how agents adapt and transfer representations across heterogeneous modalities, opening new directions for both theory and experimentation.
