This shift in design explicitly tests three critical, yet under-evaluated capabilities: 1) systematic collation of fragmented information from disparate sources, 2) de-duplication and entity resolution to ensure precision, and 3) the ability to reason about stopping criteria within an open-ended search space. Each task is structured as a causal chain, where discovering information for one step is dependent on the successful completion of the previous one, stressing long-horizon planning and context retention. All tasks are grounded in the open web with objectively verifiable answer sets. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art agent architectures reveals significant performance limitations: even the most advanced models struggle to balance high recall with precision. We observe distinct failure modes ranging from premature stopping (under-retrieval) to hedging behaviors, where agents cast an overly wide net of low-confidence answers to artificially boost recall.

In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher.

SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate.

Dense retrieval with dual-modality encoders leads in accuracy, but its computation and storage scale poorly with corpus size. Thus, real-time large-scale applications adopt two-stage retrieval, where a fast recall model gathers a small candidate pool, which is reranked by an advanced dense retriever. Due to hugely reduced candidates, the reranking model can use any off-the-shelf dense retriever without hurting efficiency, meaning the recall model bounds two-stage TVR performance. Recently, generative retrieval (GR) replaces dense video embeddings with discrete semantic IDs and retrieves by decoding text queries into ID tokens. GR offers near-constant inference and storage complexity, and its semantic IDs capture high-level video features via quantization, making it ideal for quickly eliminating irrelevant candidates during recall. However, as a recall model in two-stage TVR, GR suffers from (i) semantic ambiguity, where each video satisfies diverse queries but is forced into one semantic ID; and (ii) cross-modal misalignment, as semantic IDs are solely derived from visual features without text supervision. We propose Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), designing a novel GR method to uplift recalled candidate quality.

The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts.

This motivates the central question of our work: how can we leverage the inductive bias learned through generalization while unlocking the flexibility required for effective instance-wise adaptation?

Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO).

In this paper, we identify systematic weaknesses of these pooling strategies: [CLS] tends to concentrate information toward the initial positions of the sequence and can under-represent distributed evidence, while mean pooling can dilute salient local signals, sometimes leading to worse short-context performance. To address these issues, we introduce Landmark (LMK) pooling, which partitions a sequence into chunks, inserts landmark tokens between chunks, and forms the final representation by mean-pooling the landmark token embeddings. This simple mechanism improves long-context extrapolation without sacrificing local salient features, at the cost of introducing a small number of special tokens. We empirically demonstrate that LMK pooling matches existing methods on short-context retrieval tasks and yields substantial improvements on long-context tasks, making it a practical and scalable alternative to existing pooling methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "LMK pooling improves sequence representation by partitioning sequences into chunks with landmarks, balancing local and long-context performance.", "motivation": "Identifies weaknesses in standard pooling methods ([CLS] and mean pooling), which either concentrate information or dilute salient signals.", "method": "Introduces Landmark (LMK) pooling: partitions sequences into chunks, inserts landmark tokens, and mean-pools their embeddings.", "result": "LMK pooling matches existing methods on short-context tasks and improves long-context performance.", "conclusion": "LMK pooling is a practical and scalable alternative to traditional pooling strategies."}}

Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(\u03c4> 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated).

Recent approaches that propagate textual feedback globally (e.g., TextGrad) make it feasible to optimize such pipelines, but we find that performance degrades as system depth grows. In particular, long-horizon agentic workflows exhibit two depth-scaling failure modes: 1) exploding textual gradient, where textual feedback grows exponentially with depth, leading to prohibitively long message and amplifies evaluation biases; and 2) vanishing textual gradient, where limited long-context ability causes models overemphasize partial feedback and compression of lengthy feedback causes downstream messages to lose specificity gradually as they propagate many hops upstream. To mitigate these issues, we introduce Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP), a local learning principle inspired by Equilibrium Propagation in energy-based models. TEP includes two phases: 1) a free phase where a local LLM critics iteratively refine prompts until reaching equilibrium (no further improvements are suggested); and 2) a nudged phase which applies proximal prompt edits with bounded modification intensity, using task-level objectives that propagate via forward signaling rather than backward feedback chains.

However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE).

Ideally, exploration needed to answer the original question will reveal new structures, patterns, and insights that are valuable in their own right. This contrasts with the exam-style paradigm in which the machine learning community typically applies AI to math. To maximize progress in mathematics using AI, we will need to go beyond simple question answering. With this in mind, we explore the extent to which narrow models trained to solve a fixed mathematical task learn broader mathematical structure that can be extracted by a researcher or other AI system. As a basic test case for this, we use the task of training a neural network to predict a group operation (for example, performing modular arithmetic or composition of permutations). We describe a suite of tests designed to assess whether the model captures significant group-theoretic notions such as the identity element, commutativity, or subgroups. Through extensive experimentation we find evidence that models learn representations capable of capturing abstract algebraic properties. For example, we find hints that models capture the commutativity of modular arithmetic. We are also able to train linear classifiers that reliably distinguish between elements of certain subgroups (even though no labels for these subgroups are included in the data). On the other hand, we are unable to extract notions such as the concept of the identity element.

In this work, we uncover a striking \"Paradox of Robustness\": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms.

Therefore, memory systems are developed to leverage essential historical information. Existing memory systems typically follow a pipeline of offline memory construction and update, and online retrieval. Despite the flexible online phase, the offline phase remains fixed and task-independent. In this phase, memory construction operates under a predefined workflow and fails to emphasize task relevant information. Meanwhile, memory updates are guided by generic metrics rather than task specific supervision. This leads to a misalignment between offline memory preparation and task requirements, which undermines downstream task performance. To this end, we propose an Adversarial Memory Adaptation mechanism (AMA) that aligns memory construction and update with task objectives by simulating task execution. Specifically, first, a challenger agent generates question answer pairs based on the original dialogues. The constructed memory is then used to answer these questions, simulating downstream inference. Subsequently, an evaluator agent assesses the responses and performs error analysis. Finally, an adapter agent analyzes the error cases and performs dual level updates on both the construction strategy and the content. Through this process, the memory system receives task aware supervision signals in advance during the offline phase, enhancing its adaptability to downstream tasks.

To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios.

Experiments on current LLMs in mathematics, multi-hop QA, and code generation show that adding the self-evident constraints leads to substantial performance drops, even for advanced models such as Claude-Sonnet-4.5. We validate the generality of the interference across constraint types and scales. Furthermore, we identify common failure patterns, and by investigating the mechanisms of interference, we observe that failed cases allocate significantly more attention to constraints compared to successful ones. Finally, we use SUSTAINSCORE to conduct an initial investigation into how distinct post-training paradigms affect the interference, presenting empirical observations on current alignment strategies.

However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time.

Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences.

We introduce representation holonomy, a gauge-invariant statistic that measures this path dependence.

Nevertheless, policies trained by standard expected return maximization routinely collapse onto a small subset of outcomes, a phenomenon commonly attributed to insufficient exploration or weak regularization. We show that this explanation is incomplete: outcome level mode collapse is a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself. Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings. We instantiate this principle in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, requiring no auxiliary models or architectural changes.

Specifically, AUM models each unimodal representation as a multivariate Gaussian distribution to capture aleatoric uncertainty and enable principled modality reliability quantification. To adaptively aggregate captured information, we develop a dynamic message-passing mechanism within a bipartite patient-modality graph using uncertainty-aware aggregation mechanism. Through this process, missing modalities are naturally accommodated, while more reliable information from available modalities is dynamically emphasized to guide representation generation.

We propose Singular Value Ensemble (SVE), a parameter-efficient implicit ensemble method that builds on a simple, but powerful core assumption: namely, that the singular vectors of the weight matrices constitute meaningful subspaces of the model's knowledge. Pretrained foundation models encode rich, transferable information in their weight matrices. If the singular vectors are indeed meaningful (orthogonal) \"knowledge directions\".

Rather than learning entirely new parameters, we freeze the singular vectors and only train per-member singular values that rescale the contribution of each direction in that shared knowledge basis. Ensemble diversity emerges naturally as stochastic initialization and random sampling of mini-batches during joint training cause different members to converge to different combinations of the same underlying knowledge.
