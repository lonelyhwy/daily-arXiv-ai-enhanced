### [1] [Do Open-Vocabulary Detectors Transfer to Aerial Imagery? A Comparative Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22164)
*Christos Tsourveloudis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks five state-of-the-art OVD models on aerial imagery, revealing severe domain transfer issues and semantic confusion as the primary bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the transferability of OVD models to aerial imagery, addressing challenges in zero-shot recognition for this domain.

Method: Evaluates five OVD models on the LAE-80C dataset under strict zero-shot conditions, using Global, Oracle, and Single-Category inference modes.

Result: Best model (OWLv2) achieves 27.6% F1-score with high false positives. Reducing vocabulary size improves performance 15x, showing semantic confusion is a key issue.

Conclusion: Aerial OVD suffers from domain transfer problems, requiring domain-adaptive solutions due to poor performance and brittleness across datasets.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) enables zero-shot recognition of novel categories through vision-language models, achieving strong performance on natural images. However, transferability to aerial imagery remains unexplored. We present the first systematic benchmark evaluating five state-of-the-art OVD models on the LAE-80C aerial dataset (3,592 images, 80 categories) under strict zero-shot conditions. Our experimental protocol isolates semantic confusion from visual localization through Global, Oracle, and Single-Category inference modes. Results reveal severe domain transfer failure: the best model (OWLv2) achieves only 27.6% F1-score with 69% false positive rate. Critically, reducing vocabulary size from 80 to 3.2 classes yields 15x improvement, demonstrating that semantic confusion is the primary bottleneck. Prompt engineering strategies such as domain-specific prefixing and synonym expansion, fail to provide meaningful performance gains. Performance varies dramatically across datasets (F1: 0.53 on DIOR, 0.12 on FAIR1M), exposing brittleness to imaging conditions. These findings establish baseline expectations and highlight the need for domain-adaptive approaches in aerial OVD.

### [2] [What Lies Beneath: A Call for Distribution-based Visual Question & Answer Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22218)
*Jill P. Naiman,Daniel J. Evans,JooYoung Seo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new VQA benchmark for scientific charts, highlighting the gap in existing datasets that lack underlying data and introducing synthetic histograms to test reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA datasets for charts often miss underlying data or assume direct mark-to-data correspondence, limiting their ability to test reasoning challenges in scientific chart interpretation.

Method: The authors create synthetic histogram charts from ground truth data, compare human and model responses, and release an open-source dataset with figures, data, and annotations.

Result: The study identifies limitations in existing VQA datasets and provides a new benchmark to evaluate reasoning in scientific chart interpretation.

Conclusion: A dedicated VQA benchmark for scientific charts with no 1-to-1 mark-to-data correspondence is needed, and the released dataset addresses this gap.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) has become an important benchmark for assessing how large multimodal models (LMMs) interpret images. However, most VQA datasets focus on real-world images or simple diagrammatic analysis, with few focused on interpreting complex scientific charts. Indeed, many VQA datasets that analyze charts do not contain the underlying data behind those charts or assume a 1-to-1 correspondence between chart marks and underlying data. In reality, charts are transformations (i.e. analysis, simplification, modification) of data. This distinction introduces a reasoning challenge in VQA that the current datasets do not capture. In this paper, we argue for a dedicated VQA benchmark for scientific charts where there is no 1-to-1 correspondence between chart marks and underlying data. To do so, we survey existing VQA datasets and highlight limitations of the current field. We then generate synthetic histogram charts based on ground truth data, and ask both humans and a large reasoning model questions where precise answers depend on access to the underlying data. We release the open-source dataset, including figures, underlying data, distribution parameters used to generate the data, and bounding boxes for all figure marks and text for future research.

### [3] [Lost in Space? Vision-Language Models Struggle with Relative Camera Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22228)
*Ken Deng,Yifu Qiu,Yoni Kasten,Shay B. Cohen,Yftah Ziser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with 3D spatial reasoning and multi-image tasks, underperforming traditional methods and humans despite strong 2D capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight VLMs' limitations in understanding 3D spatial structures and propose benchmarks to evaluate their performance in relative camera pose estimation.

Method: Introduces VRRPI-Bench (realistic scenarios) and VRRPI-Diag (isolated motion degrees) to test VLMs' ability in RCPE.

Result: VLMs perform poorly (~0.64) compared to classic baselines (~0.97) and humans (~0.92), especially in depth and roll transformations; multi-image reasoning is inconsistent (~59.7%).

Conclusion: VLMs lack robustness in 3D and multi-view spatial reasoning, revealing gaps despite their strong 2D perception.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well in 2D perception and semantic reasoning compared to their limited understanding of 3D spatial structure. We investigate this gap using relative camera pose estimation (RCPE), a fundamental vision task that requires inferring relative camera translation and rotation from a pair of images. We introduce VRRPI-Bench, a benchmark derived from unlabeled egocentric videos with verbalized annotations of relative camera motion, reflecting realistic scenarios with simultaneous translation and rotation around a shared object. We further propose VRRPI-Diag, a diagnostic benchmark that isolates individual motion degrees of freedom. Despite the simplicity of RCPE, most VLMs fail to generalize beyond shallow 2D heuristics, particularly for depth changes and roll transformations along the optical axis. Even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-5 ($0.64$) fall short of classic geometric baselines ($0.97$) and human performance ($0.92$). Moreover, VLMs exhibit difficulty in multi-image reasoning, with inconsistent performance (best $59.7\%$) when integrating spatial cues across frames. Our findings reveal limitations in grounding VLMs in 3D and multi-view spatial reasoning.

### [4] [Geometry without Position? When Positional Embeddings Help and Hurt Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22231)
*Jian Shi,Michael Birsak,Wenqing Cui,Zhenyu Li,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines how positional embeddings in vision transformers act as geometric priors, influencing spatial structure and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the geometric role of positional embeddings in vision transformers beyond their traditional use as token indices.

Method: Introduces token-level diagnostics to measure geometric consistency and conducts experiments on 14 foundation ViT models.

Result: Reveals that positional embeddings are a causal mechanism shaping spatial structure in ViT representations.

Conclusion: Positional embeddings play a critical role in governing geometric properties and spatial reasoning in vision transformers.

Abstract: This paper revisits the role of positional embeddings (PEs) within vision transformers (ViTs) from a geometric perspective. We show that PEs are not mere token indices but effectively function as geometric priors that shape the spatial structure of the representation. We introduce token-level diagnostics that measure how multi-view geometric consistency in ViT representation depends on consitent PEs. Through extensive experiments on 14 foundation ViT models, we reveal how PEs influence multi-view geometry and spatial reasoning. Our findings clarify the role of PEs as a causal mechanism that governs spatial structure in ViT representations. Our code is provided in https://github.com/shijianjian/vit-geometry-probes

### [5] [Is Hierarchical Quantization Essential for Optimal Reconstruction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22244)
*Shirin Reyhanian,Laurenz Wiskott*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Single-level VQ-VAEs can match hierarchical variants in reconstruction fidelity when properly tuned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if single-level VQ-VAEs can equal hierarchical versions in reconstruction quality, independent of codebook collapse.

Method: Compared a two-level VQ-VAE with a capacity-matched single-level model on ImageNet, using lightweight interventions like data initialization and hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Single-level VQ-VAEs achieve similar reconstruction fidelity to hierarchical ones when codebook collapse is mitigated.

Conclusion: Hierarchy isn't inherently superior; proper tuning of single-level models can yield comparable results.

Abstract: Vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are central to models that rely on high reconstruction fidelity, from neural compression to generative pipelines. Hierarchical extensions, such as VQ-VAE2, are often credited with superior reconstruction performance because they split global and local features across multiple levels. However, since higher levels derive all their information from lower levels, they should not carry additional reconstructive content beyond what the lower-level already encodes. Combined with recent advances in training objectives and quantization mechanisms, this leads us to ask whether a single-level VQ-VAE, with matched representational budget and no codebook collapse, can equal the reconstruction fidelity of its hierarchical counterpart. Although the multi-scale structure of hierarchical models may improve perceptual quality in downstream tasks, the effect of hierarchy on reconstruction accuracy, isolated from codebook utilization and overall representational capacity, remains empirically underexamined. We revisit this question by comparing a two-level VQ-VAE and a capacity-matched single-level model on high-resolution ImageNet images. Consistent with prior observations, we confirm that inadequate codebook utilization limits single-level VQ-VAEs and that overly high-dimensional embeddings destabilize quantization and increase codebook collapse. We show that lightweight interventions such as initialization from data, periodic reset of inactive codebook vectors, and systematic tuning of codebook hyperparameters significantly reduce collapse. Our results demonstrate that when representational budgets are matched, and codebook collapse is mitigated, single-level VQ-VAEs can match the reconstruction fidelity of hierarchical variants, challenging the assumption that hierarchical quantization is inherently superior for high-quality reconstructions.

### [6] [VMonarch: Efficient Video Diffusion Transformers with Structured Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22275)
*Cheng Liang,Haoxian Chen,Liang Hou,Qi Fan,Gangshan Wu,Xin Tao,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VMonarch introduces a structured Monarch matrix-based attention mechanism for Video DiTs, reducing quadratic complexity and enabling efficient, high-quality video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of traditional attention mechanisms limits scalability in Video DiTs. VMonarch addresses this by leveraging sparse spatio-temporal attention patterns.

Method: VMonarch adapts Monarch matrix factorization for spatio-temporal correlations, uses recomputation to stabilize alternating minimization, and integrates an online entropy algorithm for fast updates.

Result: VMonarch reduces attention FLOPs by 17.5x, speeds up computation by over 5x, and matches or surpasses full attention quality on VBench.

Conclusion: VMonarch effectively overcomes the attention bottleneck in Video DiTs, offering scalable and efficient video generation with minimal quality trade-offs.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism severely limits the context scalability of Video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). We find that the highly sparse spatio-temporal attention patterns exhibited in Video DiTs can be naturally represented by the Monarch matrix. It is a class of structured matrices with flexible sparsity, enabling sub-quadratic attention via an alternating minimization algorithm. Accordingly, we propose VMonarch, a novel attention mechanism for Video DiTs that enables efficient computation over the dynamic sparse patterns with structured Monarch matrices. First, we adapt spatio-temporal Monarch factorization to explicitly capture the intra-frame and inter-frame correlations of the video data. Second, we introduce a recomputation strategy to mitigate artifacts arising from instabilities during alternating minimization of Monarch matrices. Third, we propose a novel online entropy algorithm fused into FlashAttention, enabling fast Monarch matrix updates for long sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMonarch achieves comparable or superior generation quality to full attention on VBench after minimal tuning. It overcomes the attention bottleneck in Video DiTs, reduces attention FLOPs by a factor of 17.5, and achieves a speedup of over 5x in attention computation for long videos, surpassing state-of-the-art sparse attention methods at 90% sparsity.

### [7] [Coarse-to-Real: Generative Rendering for Populated Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22301)
*Gonzalo Gomez-Nogales,Yicong Hong,Chongjian Ge,Marc Comino-Trinidad,Dan Casas,Yi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C2R is a generative rendering framework that synthesizes realistic urban crowd videos from coarse 3D simulations, using a neural renderer guided by text prompts and a mixed CG-real training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rendering pipelines struggle with scalability and realism for dynamic scenes. C2R aims to bridge the gap between coarse simulations and realistic imagery efficiently.

Method: The approach combines coarse 3D renderings for control with a neural renderer for realism, using a two-phase training strategy to learn from real footage and introduce controllability.

Result: C2R produces temporally consistent, controllable, and realistic urban scene videos from minimal 3D input, generalizing across diverse CG and game inputs.

Conclusion: C2R offers a scalable and efficient solution for generating realistic dynamic scenes, leveraging generative rendering and domain-shared features.

Abstract: Traditional rendering pipelines rely on complex assets, accurate materials and lighting, and substantial computational resources to produce realistic imagery, yet they still face challenges in scalability and realism for populated dynamic scenes. We present C2R (Coarse-to-Real), a generative rendering framework that synthesizes real-style urban crowd videos from coarse 3D simulations. Our approach uses coarse 3D renderings to explicitly control scene layout, camera motion, and human trajectories, while a learned neural renderer generates realistic appearance, lighting, and fine-scale dynamics guided by text prompts. To overcome the lack of paired training data between coarse simulations and real videos, we adopt a two-phase mixed CG-real training strategy that learns a strong generative prior from large-scale real footage and introduces controllability through shared implicit spatio-temporal features across domains. The resulting system supports coarse-to-fine control, generalizes across diverse CG and game inputs, and produces temporally consistent, controllable, and realistic urban scene videos from minimal 3D input. We will release the model and project webpage at https://gonzalognogales.github.io/coarse2real/.

### [8] [FlexMap: Generalized HD Map Construction from Flexible Camera Configurations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22376)
*Run Wang,Chaoyi Zhou,Amir Salarpour,Xi Liu,Zhi-Qi Cheng,Feng Luo,Mert D. Pesé,Siyu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexMap introduces a flexible HD map construction method for autonomous driving that adapts to various camera configurations without retraining, using a geometry-aware foundation model and cross-frame attention to avoid explicit projections. It outperforms existing methods and remains robust to sensor variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HD map construction methods rely on fixed multi-camera setups and explicit 2D-to-BEV transformations, making them fragile when sensors fail or configurations vary. FlexMap aims to address these limitations for more practical deployment.

Method: FlexMap uses a geometry-aware foundation model with cross-frame attention to implicitly encode 3D scene understanding. It includes a spatial-temporal enhancement module and a camera-aware decoder with latent camera tokens, eliminating the need for projection matrices.

Result: FlexMap outperforms existing methods across multiple camera configurations and maintains robustness to missing views and sensor variations.

Conclusion: FlexMap provides a more flexible and robust solution for HD map construction, enabling broader real-world applicability in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps provide essential semantic information of road structures for autonomous driving systems, yet current HD map construction methods require calibrated multi-camera setups and either implicit or explicit 2D-to-BEV transformations, making them fragile when sensors fail or camera configurations vary across vehicle fleets. We introduce FlexMap, unlike prior methods that are fixed to a specific N-camera rig, our approach adapts to variable camera configurations without any architectural changes or per-configuration retraining. Our key innovation eliminates explicit geometric projections by using a geometry-aware foundation model with cross-frame attention to implicitly encode 3D scene understanding in feature space. FlexMap features two core components: a spatial-temporal enhancement module that separates cross-view spatial reasoning from temporal dynamics, and a camera-aware decoder with latent camera tokens, enabling view-adaptive attention without the need for projection matrices. Experiments demonstrate that FlexMap outperforms existing methods across multiple configurations while maintaining robustness to missing views and sensor variations, enabling more practical real-world deployment.

### [9] [Jailbreaks on Vision Language Model via Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22398)
*Aarush Noheria,Yuguang Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A jailbreak framework exploits Chain-of-Thought prompting and adaptive noising to bypass safety filters in vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models are vulnerable to prompt variations, exposing safety alignment flaws.

Method: Uses post-training Chain-of-Thought prompting and ReAct-driven adaptive noising to refine adversarial inputs.

Result: Dual-strategy improves attack success rates while maintaining naturalness.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bypasses safety filters, highlighting vulnerabilities in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have become central to tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, and text-to-image generation. However, their outputs are highly sensitive to prompt variations, which can reveal vulnerabilities in safety alignment. In this work, we present a jailbreak framework that exploits post-training Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to construct stealthy prompts capable of bypassing safety filters. To further increase attack success rates (ASR), we propose a ReAct-driven adaptive noising mechanism that iteratively perturbs input images based on model feedback. This approach leverages the ReAct paradigm to refine adversarial noise in regions most likely to activate safety defenses, thereby enhancing stealth and evasion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed dual-strategy significantly improves ASR while maintaining naturalness in both text and visual domains.

### [10] [EMBC Special Issue: Calibrated Uncertainty for Trustworthy Clinical Gait Analysis Using Probabilistic Multiview Markerless Motion Capture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22412)
*Seth Donahue,Irina Djuraskovic,Kunal Shah,Fabian Sinz,Ross Chafetz,R. James Cotton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the calibration and reliability of a probabilistic multi-view markerless motion capture (MMMC) method for human movement analysis, showing accurate and reliable confidence intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance clinical trust and implementation of MMMC systems by ensuring they not only provide accurate measurements but also reliable confidence intervals indicating their accuracy for individual cases.

Method: The study builds on variational inference for joint angle posterior distributions, analyzing data from 68 participants across two institutions. Validation was performed using an instrumented walkway and marker-based motion capture, with calibration measured via Expected Calibration Error (ECE).

Result: The model showed reliable calibration (ECE < 0.1) for step/stride length and gait kinematics. Median errors were ~16 mm (step), ~12 mm (stride), and 1.5–3.8 degrees (joint angles). Predicted uncertainty strongly correlated with observed errors.

Conclusion: The probabilistic MMMC method effectively quantifies epistemic uncertainty, enabling identification of unreliable outputs without ground-truth instrumentation, thus supporting clinical adoption.

Abstract: Video-based human movement analysis holds potential for movement assessment in clinical practice and research. However, the clinical implementation and trust of multi-view markerless motion capture (MMMC) require that, in addition to being accurate, these systems produce reliable confidence intervals to indicate how accurate they are for any individual. Building on our prior work utilizing variational inference to estimate joint angle posterior distributions, this study evaluates the calibration and reliability of a probabilistic MMMC method. We analyzed data from 68 participants across two institutions, validating the model against an instrumented walkway and standard marker-based motion capture. We measured the calibration of the confidence intervals using the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). The model demonstrated reliable calibration, yielding ECE values generally < 0.1 for both step and stride length and bias-corrected gait kinematics. We observed a median step and stride length error of ~16 mm and ~12 mm respectively, with median bias-corrected kinematic errors ranging from 1.5 to 3.8 degrees across lower extremity joints. Consistent with the calibrated ECE, the magnitude of the model's predicted uncertainty correlated strongly with observed error measures. These findings indicate that, as designed, the probabilistic model reconstruction quantifies epistemic uncertainty, allowing it to identify unreliable outputs without the need for concurrent ground-truth instrumentation.

### [11] [Countering the Over-Reliance Trap: Mitigating Object Hallucination for LVLMs via a Self-Validation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22451)
*Shiyu Liu,Xinyi Wen,Zhibin Lan,Ante Wang,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses object hallucination in LVLMs for image captioning, proposing a Self-Validation Framework to mitigate reliance on language priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object hallucination in LVLMs undermines reliability; prior work lacks thorough analysis of over-reliance on language priors.

Method: Proposes Language-Prior-Free Verification and a Self-Validation Framework for caption validation and selection.

Result: Achieves 65.6% improvement on CHAIRI metric with LLaVA-v1.5-7B, surpassing SOTA methods.

Conclusion: Highlights a novel approach leveraging LVLMs' inherent potential to reduce hallucination.

Abstract: Despite progress in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), object hallucination remains a critical issue in image captioning task, where models generate descriptions of non-existent objects, compromising their reliability. Previous work attributes this to LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors and attempts to mitigate it through logits calibration. However, they still lack a thorough analysis of the over-reliance. To gain a deeper understanding of over-reliance, we conduct a series of preliminary experiments, indicating that as the generation length increases, LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors leads to inflated probability of hallucinated object tokens, consequently exacerbating object hallucination. To circumvent this issue, we propose Language-Prior-Free Verification to enable LVLMs to faithfully verify the confidence of object existence. Based on this, we propose a novel training-free Self-Validation Framework to counter the over-reliance trap. It first validates objects' existence in sampled candidate captions and further mitigates object hallucination via caption selection or aggregation. Experiment results demonstrate that our framework mitigates object hallucination significantly in image captioning task (e.g., 65.6% improvement on CHAIRI metric with LLaVA-v1.5-7B), surpassing the previous SOTA methods. This result highlights a novel path towards mitigating hallucination by unlocking the inherent potential within LVLMs themselves.

### [12] [ScribbleSense: Generative Scribble-Based Texture Editing with Intent Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22455)
*Yudi Zhang,Yeming Geng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScribbleSense improves scribble-based 3D texture editing by using MLLMs and image generation to clarify intent and enhance precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with ambiguous scribble instructions and unclear semantic locations in 3D texture editing.

Method: Combines MLLMs to predict scribble intent and image generation models to extract local texture details.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in scribble-based texture editing.

Conclusion: ScribbleSense effectively resolves ambiguity and enhances precision in 3D texture editing.

Abstract: Interactive 3D model texture editing presents enhanced opportunities for creating 3D assets, with freehand drawing style offering the most intuitive experience. However, existing methods primarily support sketch-based interactions for outlining, while the utilization of coarse-grained scribble-based interaction remains limited. Furthermore, current methodologies often encounter challenges due to the abstract nature of scribble instructions, which can result in ambiguous editing intentions and unclear target semantic locations. To address these issues, we propose ScribbleSense, an editing method that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image generation models to effectively resolve these challenges. We leverage the visual capabilities of MLLMs to predict the editing intent behind the scribbles. Once the semantic intent of the scribble is discerned, we employ globally generated images to extract local texture details, thereby anchoring local semantics and alleviating ambiguities concerning the target semantic locations. Experimental results indicate that our method effectively leverages the strengths of MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art interactive editing performance for scribble-based texture editing.

### [13] [Training-Free Representation Guidance for Diffusion Models with a Representation Alignment Projector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22468)
*Wenqiang Zu,Shenghao Xie,Bo Lei,Lei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a representation alignment projector to mitigate semantic drift in early denoising stages of diffusion transformers, improving image synthesis quality and semantic coherence without altering model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address semantic drift and inconsistent alignment in diffusion transformers during early denoising stages, leveraging unsupervised feature representations for better semantic preservation.

Method: Uses a representation alignment projector to inject predicted representations into intermediate sampling steps, acting as a semantic anchor.

Result: Shows notable improvements in class-conditional ImageNet synthesis, lowering FID scores (e.g., REPA-XL/2 from 5.9 to 3.3) and outperforming existing guidance methods like representative guidance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances semantic coherence and visual fidelity, proving effective for reinforcing semantic preservation in diffusion sampling.

Abstract: Recent progress in generative modeling has enabled high-quality visual synthesis with diffusion-based frameworks, supporting controllable sampling and large-scale training. Inference-time guidance methods such as classifier-free and representative guidance enhance semantic alignment by modifying sampling dynamics; however, they do not fully exploit unsupervised feature representations. Although such visual representations contain rich semantic structure, their integration during generation is constrained by the absence of ground-truth reference images at inference. This work reveals semantic drift in the early denoising stages of diffusion transformers, where stochasticity results in inconsistent alignment even under identical conditioning. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a guidance scheme using a representation alignment projector that injects representations predicted by a projector into intermediate sampling steps, providing an effective semantic anchor without modifying the model architecture. Experiments on SiTs and REPAs show notable improvements in class-conditional ImageNet synthesis, achieving substantially lower FID scores; for example, REPA-XL/2 improves from 5.9 to 3.3, and the proposed method outperforms representative guidance when applied to SiT models. The approach further yields complementary gains when combined with classifier-free guidance, demonstrating enhanced semantic coherence and visual fidelity. These results establish representation-informed diffusion sampling as a practical strategy for reinforcing semantic preservation and image consistency.

*Junfei Xie,Peng Pan,Xulong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAVC improves MLLMs' fine-grained reasoning by selectively refining attention heads and using visual cropping guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with fine-grained reasoning due to low-resolution inputs and noisy attention aggregation.

Method: HAVC filters attention heads via an OCR task, refines them using spatial entropy and gradient sensitivity, and generates a Visual Cropping Guidance Map.

Result: HAVC outperforms state-of-the-art cropping methods in fine-grained VQA benchmarks, offering precise localization and stronger visual grounding.

Conclusion: HAVC provides a simple, effective strategy to enhance MLLMs' precision without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong performance in Visual Question Answering (VQA) but remain limited in fine-grained reasoning due to low-resolution inputs and noisy attention aggregation. We propose \textbf{Head Aware Visual Cropping (HAVC)}, a training-free method that improves visual grounding by leveraging a selectively refined subset of attention heads. HAVC first filters heads through an OCR-based diagnostic task, ensuring that only those with genuine grounding ability are retained. At inference, these heads are further refined using spatial entropy for stronger spatial concentration and gradient sensitivity for predictive contribution. The fused signals produce a reliable Visual Cropping Guidance Map, which highlights the most task-relevant region and guides the cropping of a subimage subsequently provided to the MLLM together with the image-question pair. Extensive experiments on multiple fine-grained VQA benchmarks demonstrate that HAVC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art cropping strategies, achieving more precise localization, stronger visual grounding, providing a simple yet effective strategy for enhancing precision in MLLMs.

TL;DR: PromptMAD is a cross-modal prompting framework integrating vision-language alignment for unsupervised visual anomaly detection, achieving state-of-the-art results on MVTec-AD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like class diversity, scarce anomalies, and camouflaged defects in multi-class visual anomaly detection.

Method: Combines CLIP-encoded text prompts for semantic guidance, Focal loss for pixel-level imbalance, and a segmentor with multi-scale features and Transformer attention.

Result: Achieves 98.35% mean AUC and 66.54% AP on MVTec-AD, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: PromptMAD effectively integrates semantic and visual cues for superior anomaly detection and localization.

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection in multi-class settings poses significant challenges due to the diversity of object categories, the scarcity of anomalous examples, and the presence of camouflaged defects. In this paper, we propose PromptMAD, a cross-modal prompting framework for unsupervised visual anomaly detection and localization that integrates semantic guidance through vision-language alignment. By leveraging CLIP-encoded text prompts describing both normal and anomalous class-specific characteristics, our method enriches visual reconstruction with semantic context, improving the detection of subtle and textural anomalies. To further address the challenge of class imbalance at the pixel level, we incorporate Focal loss function, which emphasizes hard-to-detect anomalous regions during training. Our architecture also includes a supervised segmentor that fuses multi-scale convolutional features with Transformer-based spatial attention and diffusion iterative refinement, yielding precise and high-resolution anomaly maps. Extensive experiments on the MVTec-AD dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art pixel-level performance, improving mean AUC to 98.35% and AP to 66.54%, while maintaining efficiency across diverse categories.

*Renjie Lu,Xulong Zhang,Xiaoyang Qu,Jianzong Wang,Shangfei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MirrorTalk is a generative framework using a diffusion model and style encoder to synthesize personalized talking faces, improving lip-sync accuracy and personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with disentangling speaker-specific style and semantic content in facial motions, hindering faithful persona transfer.

Method: Uses a conditional diffusion model with a Semantically-Disentangled Style Encoder (SDSE) and hierarchical modulation for balanced audio-style synthesis.

Result: Achieves better lip-sync accuracy and personalization preservation compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MirrorTalk effectively addresses the challenge of synthesizing expressive and personalized talking faces.

Abstract: Synthesizing personalized talking faces that uphold and highlight a speaker's unique style while maintaining lip-sync accuracy remains a significant challenge. A primary limitation of existing approaches is the intrinsic confounding of speaker-specific talking style and semantic content within facial motions, which prevents the faithful transfer of a speaker's unique persona to arbitrary speech. In this paper, we propose MirrorTalk, a generative framework based on a conditional diffusion model, combined with a Semantically-Disentangled Style Encoder (SDSE) that can distill pure style representations from a brief reference video. To effectively utilize this representation, we further introduce a hierarchical modulation strategy within the diffusion process. This mechanism guides the synthesis by dynamically balancing the contributions of audio and style features across distinct facial regions, ensuring both precise lip-sync accuracy and expressive full-face dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MirrorTalk achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of lip-sync accuracy and personalization preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamVAR is a Visual Autoregressive (VAR) model framework for subject-driven image synthesis, outperforming diffusion models by simplifying autoregressive dependencies and enhancing semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation, VAR models' potential remains underexplored due to their unified architecture and efficient inference.

Method: DreamVAR uses next-scale prediction, pre-filling subject features before predicting target image tokens to simplify dependencies. It also incorporates reinforcement learning for alignment and consistency.

Result: DreamVAR achieves superior appearance preservation compared to leading diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the untapped potential of VAR models in subject-driven image synthesis, offering a simpler and more efficient alternative to diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent advances in subject-driven image generation using diffusion models have attracted considerable attention for their remarkable capabilities in producing high-quality images. Nevertheless, the potential of Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models, despite their unified architecture and efficient inference, remains underexplored. In this work, we present DreamVAR, a novel framework for subject-driven image synthesis built upon a VAR model that employs next-scale prediction. Technically, multi-scale features of the reference subject are first extracted by a visual tokenizer. Instead of interleaving these conditional features with target image tokens across scales, our DreamVAR pre-fills the full subject feature sequence prior to predicting target image tokens. This design simplifies autoregressive dependencies and mitigates the train-test discrepancy in multi-scale conditioning scenario within the VAR paradigm. DreamVAR further incorporates reinforcement learning to jointly enhance semantic alignment and subject consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamVAR achieves superior appearance preservation compared to leading diffusion-based methods.

*Gyuwon Han,Young Kyun Jang,Chanho Eom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoVA, a retrieval task accounting for visual and auditory variations in videos, along with a new benchmark AV-Comp and fusion method AVT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks ignore audio differences despite visual similarity.

Method: Proposed AVT Compositional Fusion integrates video, audio, and text features.

Result: AVT outperforms traditional unimodal fusion.

Conclusion: CoVA and AVT provide a strong baseline for composed video retrieval with audio.

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) aims to retrieve a target video from a large gallery using a reference video and a textual query specifying visual modifications. However, existing benchmarks consider only visual changes, ignoring videos that differ in audio despite visual similarity. To address this limitation, we introduce Composed retrieval for Video with its Audio CoVA, a new retrieval task that accounts for both visual and auditory variations. To support this, we construct AV-Comp, a benchmark consisting of video pairs with cross-modal changes and corresponding textual queries that describe the differences. We also propose AVT Compositional Fusion (AVT), which integrates video, audio, and text features by selectively aligning the query to the most relevant modality. AVT outperforms traditional unimodal fusion and serves as a strong baseline for CoVA. Examples from the proposed dataset, including both visual and auditory information, are available at https://perceptualai-lab.github.io/CoVA/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DNA framework uses pre-trained models' latent forgery detection capabilities via discriminative neural anchors, achieving superior performance without extensive retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on resource-heavy fine-tuning, while pre-trained models may already encode forgery detection capabilities.

Method: DNA uses coarse-to-fine excavation, pinpointing critical layers and isolating forgery-discriminative units (FDUs) via triadic fusion scoring and curvature-truncation.

Result: DNA outperforms detection benchmarks, even in few-shot scenarios, and shows robustness across architectures and unseen models.

Conclusion: Activating latent neurons in pre-trained models is more effective than fine-tuning for forgery detection.

Abstract: As generative AI achieves hyper-realism, superficial artifact detection has become obsolete. While prevailing methods rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning of black-box backbones, we propose that forgery detection capability is already encoded within pre-trained models rather than requiring end-to-end retraining. To elicit this intrinsic capability, we propose the discriminative neural anchors (DNA) framework, which employs a coarse-to-fine excavation mechanism. First, by analyzing feature decoupling and attention distribution shifts, we pinpoint critical intermediate layers where the focus of the model logically transitions from global semantics to local anomalies. Subsequently, we introduce a triadic fusion scoring metric paired with a curvature-truncation strategy to strip away semantic redundancy, precisely isolating the forgery-discriminative units (FDUs) inherently imprinted with sensitivity to forgery traces. Moreover, we introduce HIFI-Gen, a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark built upon the very latest models, to address the lag in existing datasets. Experiments demonstrate that by solely relying on these anchors, DNA achieves superior detection performance even under few-shot conditions. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable robustness across diverse architectures and against unseen generative models, validating that waking up latent neurons is more effective than extensive fine-tuning.

### [20] [Can 3D point cloud data improve automated body condition score prediction in dairy cattle?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22522)
*Zhou Tang,Jin Wang,Angelo De Castro,Yuxi Zhang,Victoria Bastos Primo,Ana Beatriz Montevecchio Bernardino,Gota Morota,Xu Wang,Ricardo C Chebel,Haipeng Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparison of depth images and 3D point clouds for predicting body condition scores (BCS) in dairy cattle, showing depth images often outperform point clouds unless hindquarter data is used.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional BCS scoring is subjective and labor-intensive; computer vision offers objectivity but needs evaluation of 3D point clouds vs. depth images.

Method: Compared depth images and point clouds under four settings (raw, full-body, hindquarter, handcrafted features) using data from 1,020 cows with cross-validation.

Result: Depth images generally outperformed point clouds except with hindquarter data. Both methods lost accuracy with handcrafted features; point clouds were more noise-sensitive.

Conclusion: 3D point clouds didn’t consistently surpass depth images for BCS prediction under tested conditions.

Abstract: Body condition score (BCS) is a widely used indicator of body energy status and is closely associated with metabolic status, reproductive performance, and health in dairy cattle; however, conventional visual scoring is subjective and labor-intensive. Computer vision approaches have been applied to BCS prediction, with depth images widely used because they capture geometric information independent of coat color and texture. More recently, three-dimensional point cloud data have attracted increasing interest due to their ability to represent richer geometric characteristics of animal morphology, but direct head-to-head comparisons with depth image-based approaches remain limited. In this study, we compared top-view depth image and point cloud data for BCS prediction under four settings: 1) unsegmented raw data, 2) segmented full-body data, 3) segmented hindquarter data, and 4) handcrafted feature data. Prediction models were evaluated using data from 1,020 dairy cows collected on a commercial farm, with cow-level cross-validation to prevent data leakage. Depth image-based models consistently achieved higher accuracy than point cloud-based models when unsegmented raw data and segmented full-body data were used, whereas comparable performance was observed when segmented hindquarter data were used. Both depth image and point cloud approaches showed reduced accuracy when handcrafted feature data were employed compared with the other settings. Overall, point cloud-based predictions were more sensitive to noise and model architecture than depth image-based predictions. Taken together, these results indicate that three-dimensional point clouds do not provide a consistent advantage over depth images for BCS prediction in dairy cattle under the evaluated conditions.

*Seung Hyun Lee,Sangwoo Mo,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHED is a novel encoder-decoder architecture that integrates segmentation into dense prediction to enforce geometric priors, improving depth boundaries and scene coherence without explicit segmentation supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense prediction methods treat scenes as independent pixel-wise predictions, leading to structural inconsistencies. SHED addresses this by leveraging scene structure.

Method: SHED uses bidirectional hierarchical reasoning to pool and unpool segment tokens hierarchically in the encoder and decoder, supervised only at the final output.

Result: SHED improves depth boundary sharpness, segment coherence, cross-domain generalization, semantic segmentation, and 3D reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: SHED effectively captures global 3D scene layouts and reveals interpretable structures, outperforming conventional pixel-wise methods.

Abstract: Dense prediction infers per-pixel values from a single image and is fundamental to 3D perception and robotics. Although real-world scenes exhibit strong structure, existing methods treat it as an independent pixel-wise prediction, often resulting in structural inconsistencies. We propose SHED, a novel encoder-decoder architecture that enforces geometric prior explicitly by incorporating segmentation into dense prediction. By bidirectional hierarchical reasoning, segment tokens are hierarchically pooled in the encoder and unpooled in the decoder to reverse the hierarchy. The model is supervised only at the final output, allowing the segment hierarchy to emerge without explicit segmentation supervision. SHED improves depth boundary sharpness and segment coherence, while demonstrating strong cross-domain generalization from synthetic to the real-world environments. Its hierarchy-aware decoder better captures global 3D scene layouts, leading to improved semantic segmentation performance. Moreover, SHED enhances 3D reconstruction quality and reveals interpretable part-level structures that are often missed by conventional pixel-wise methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance recall and accuracy in cross-device localization by integrating classical and neural approaches.

Method: Combines shared retrieval encoder, geometric branch (feature fusion, PnP), neural branch (MapAnything), neural-guided pruning, and depth-conditioned refinement.

Result: Achieved 92.62 score (R@0.5m, 5°) on HYDRO and SUCCU benchmarks.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach significantly improves localization performance.

Abstract: We present a hybrid cross-device localization pipeline developed for the CroCoDL 2025 Challenge. Our approach integrates a shared retrieval encoder and two complementary localization branches: a classical geometric branch using feature fusion and PnP, and a neural feed-forward branch (MapAnything) for metric localization conditioned on geometric inputs. A neural-guided candidate pruning strategy further filters unreliable map frames based on translation consistency, while depth-conditioned localization refines metric scale and translation precision on Spot scenes. These components jointly lead to significant improvements in recall and accuracy across both HYDRO and SUCCU benchmarks. Our method achieved a final score of 92.62 (R@0.5m, 5°) during the challenge.

*Aditya Sarkar,Yi Li,Jiacheng Cheng,Shlok Mishra,Nuno Vasconcelos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MA-PaPSP, a training-free, low-complexity method for selective prediction in visual language foundation models, addressing challenges like embedding instability and poor calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing selective prediction methods focus on closed-set tasks, leaving gaps for open-set and unbounded vocabulary tasks in visual language models.

Method: Proposes MA-PaPSP, which augments PaPSP with a retrieval dataset and contrastive normalization to stabilize embeddings and calibrate scores.

Result: MA-PaPSP outperforms PaPSP and other baselines in tasks like selective captioning, image-text matching, and fine-grained classification.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of MA-PaPSP for diverse tasks, offering a robust solution for selective prediction in visual language models.

Abstract: Selective prediction aims to endow predictors with a reject option, to avoid low confidence predictions. However, existing literature has primarily focused on closed-set tasks, such as visual question answering with predefined options or fixed-category classification. This paper considers selective prediction for visual language foundation models, addressing a taxonomy of tasks ranging from closed to open set and from finite to unbounded vocabularies, as in image captioning. We seek training-free approaches of low-complexity, applicable to any foundation model and consider methods based on external vision-language model embeddings, like CLIP. This is denoted as Plug-and-Play Selective Prediction (PaPSP). We identify two key challenges: (1) instability of the visual-language representations, leading to high variance in image-text embeddings, and (2) poor calibration of similarity scores. To address these issues, we propose a memory augmented PaPSP (MA-PaPSP) model, which augments PaPSP with a retrieval dataset of image-text pairs. This is leveraged to reduce embedding variance by averaging retrieved nearest-neighbor pairs and is complemented by the use of contrastive normalization to improve score calibration. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we show that MA-PaPSP outperforms PaPSP and other selective prediction baselines for selective captioning, image-text matching, and fine-grained classification. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/kingston-aditya/MA-PaPSP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DELNet is a continual learning framework for weather image restoration that reduces retraining costs by distinguishing new and known tasks and dynamically managing experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing all-in-one weather image restoration methods are costly due to their reliance on pre-collected data and the need for retraining for unseen degradations.

Method: DELNet uses a judging valve to measure task similarity and a dynamic expert library to store and select experts for knowledge transfer, avoiding full retraining.

Result: DELNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on OTS, Rain100H, and Snow100K datasets with PSNR gains of 16%, 11%, and 12%, respectively.

Conclusion: DELNet is effective, robust, and efficient, offering a practical solution for real-world weather image restoration with reduced retraining costs.

Abstract: All-in-one weather image restoration methods are valuable in practice but depend on pre-collected data and require retraining for unseen degradations, leading to high cost. We propose DELNet, a continual learning framework for weather image restoration. DELNet integrates a judging valve that measures task similarity to distinguish new from known tasks, and a dynamic expert library that stores experts trained on different degradations. For new tasks, the valve selects top-k experts for knowledge transfer while adding new experts to capture task-specific features; for known tasks, the corresponding experts are directly reused. This design enables continuous optimization without retraining existing models. Experiments on OTS, Rain100H, and Snow100K demonstrate that DELNet surpasses state-of-the-art continual learning methods, achieving PSNR gains of 16\%, 11\%, and 12\%, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of DELNet, which reduces retraining cost and enables practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

### [25] [Mitigating Hallucinations in Video Large Language Models via Spatiotemporal-Semantic Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22574)
*Yuansheng Gao,Jinman Zhao,Tong Zhang,Xingguo Xu,Han Bao,Zonghui Wang,Wenzhi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Spatiotemporal-Semantic Contrastive Decoding to mitigate video hallucination issues in Video Large Language Models by disrupting and contrasting spatiotemporal and semantic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current decoding methods for video hallucination mitigation rely on heuristic designs, lacking precision in capturing root causes and fine-grained correlations, leading to limited robustness.

Method: The proposed method constructs negative features by disrupting spatiotemporal consistency and semantic associations, then uses contrastive decoding against original features during inference.

Result: Experiments show the method effectively reduces hallucinations while maintaining general video understanding and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The Spatiotemporal-Semantic Contrastive Decoding strategy is a robust solution for mitigating video hallucinations without compromising model performance.

Abstract: Although Video Large Language Models perform remarkably well across tasks such as video understanding, question answering, and reasoning, they still suffer from the problem of hallucination, which refers to generating outputs that are inconsistent with explicit video content or factual evidence. However, existing decoding methods for mitigating video hallucinations, while considering the spatiotemporal characteristics of videos, mostly rely on heuristic designs. As a result, they fail to precisely capture the root causes of hallucinations and their fine-grained temporal and semantic correlations, leading to limited robustness and generalization in complex scenarios. To more effectively mitigate video hallucinations, we propose a novel decoding strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Semantic Contrastive Decoding. This strategy constructs negative features by deliberately disrupting the spatiotemporal consistency and semantic associations of video features, and suppresses video hallucinations through contrastive decoding against the original video features during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates the occurrence of hallucinations, but also preserves the general video understanding and reasoning capabilities of the model.

TL;DR: PhoStream is introduced as the first mobile-centric streaming benchmark for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), evaluating video, audio, and temporal reasoning with open-ended QA pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for MLLMs lack evaluation in continuous real-world streaming scenarios, limiting their utility as mobile assistants.

Method: PhoStream uses an Automated Generative Pipeline with human verification and evaluates models via an Online Inference Pipeline and LLM-as-a-Judge.

Result: Models perform well on Instant and Backward tasks but poorly on Forward tasks due to premature responses.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs struggle with timing responses, highlighting a need for improved temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models excel at offline audio-visual understanding, but their ability to serve as mobile assistants in continuous real-world streams remains underexplored. In daily phone use, mobile assistants must track streaming audio-visual inputs and respond at the right time, yet existing benchmarks are often restricted to multiple-choice questions or use shorter videos. In this paper, we introduce PhoStream, the first mobile-centric streaming benchmark that unifies on-screen and off-screen scenarios to evaluate video, audio, and temporal reasoning. PhoStream contains 5,572 open-ended QA pairs from 578 videos across 4 scenarios and 10 capabilities. We build it with an Automated Generative Pipeline backed by rigorous human verification, and evaluate models using a realistic Online Inference Pipeline and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation for open-ended responses. Experiments reveal a temporal asymmetry in LLM-judged scores (0-100): models perform well on Instant and Backward tasks (Gemini 3 Pro exceeds 80), but drop sharply on Forward tasks (16.40), largely due to early responses before the required visual and audio cues appear. This highlights a fundamental limitation: current MLLMs struggle to decide when to speak, not just what to say. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible at https://github.com/Lucky-Lance/PhoStream.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIFOMO, a foundation model for cross-domain few-shot learning in hyper-spectral image classification, leveraging pre-training, coalescent projection, and mixup domain adaptation to improve performance and avoid overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for CDFSL in HSI classification rely on unrealistic data augmentation and suffer from overfitting due to excessive parameters. This work explores foundation models for better generalization.

Method: MIFOMO uses a pre-trained remote sensing foundation model, coalescent projection for adaptation, mixup domain adaptation for domain discrepancy, and label smoothing for noisy labels.

Result: Experiments show MIFOMO outperforms prior methods by up to 14%.

Conclusion: MIFOMO offers a robust solution for CDFSL in HSI classification, combining foundation models with innovative techniques to address domain and noise challenges.

Abstract: Although cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) for hyper-spectral image (HSI) classification has attracted significant research interest, existing works often rely on an unrealistic data augmentation procedure in the form of external noise to enlarge the sample size, thus greatly simplifying the issue of data scarcity. They involve a large number of parameters for model updates, being prone to the overfitting problem. To the best of our knowledge, none has explored the strength of the foundation model, having strong generalization power to be quickly adapted to downstream tasks. This paper proposes the MIxup FOundation MOdel (MIFOMO) for CDFSL of HSI classifications. MIFOMO is built upon the concept of a remote sensing (RS) foundation model, pre-trained across a large scale of RS problems, thus featuring generalizable features. The notion of coalescent projection (CP) is introduced to quickly adapt the foundation model to downstream tasks while freezing the backbone network. The concept of mixup domain adaptation (MDM) is proposed to address the extreme domain discrepancy problem. Last but not least, the label smoothing concept is implemented to cope with noisy pseudo-label problems. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of MIFOMO, where it beats prior arts with up to 14% margin. The source code of MIFOMO is open-sourced in https://github.com/Naeem- Paeedeh/MIFOMO for reproducibility and convenient further study.

TL;DR: FOTBCD is a large-scale building change detection dataset covering diverse French regions, designed to benchmark geographic domain shift and improve cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of geographically diverse datasets for building change detection, aiming to enhance cross-domain generalization.

Method: FOTBCD is derived from French orthophotos and topographic data, spanning 28 departments with diverse environments. It includes binary and instance-level annotated subsets.

Result: Benchmarking shows FOTBCD-Binary improves cross-domain generalization compared to existing datasets like LEVIR-CD+ and WHU-CD.

Conclusion: FOTBCD provides a valuable resource for large-scale benchmarking and demonstrates the importance of geographic diversity in building change detection.

Abstract: We introduce FOTBCD, a large-scale building change detection dataset derived from authoritative French orthophotos and topographic building data provided by IGN France. Unlike existing benchmarks that are geographically constrained to single cities or limited regions, FOTBCD spans 28 departments across mainland France, with 25 used for training and three geographically disjoint departments held out for evaluation. The dataset covers diverse urban, suburban, and rural environments at 0.2m/pixel resolution. We publicly release FOTBCD-Binary, a dataset comprising approximately 28,000 before/after image pairs with pixel-wise binary building change masks, each associated with patch-level spatial metadata. The dataset is designed for large-scale benchmarking and evaluation under geographic domain shift, with validation and test samples drawn from held-out departments and manually verified to ensure label quality. In addition, we publicly release FOTBCD-Instances, a publicly available instance-level annotated subset comprising several thousand image pairs, which illustrates the complete annotation schema used in the full instance-level version of FOTBCD. Using a fixed reference baseline, we benchmark FOTBCD-Binary against LEVIR-CD+ and WHU-CD, providing strong empirical evidence that geographic diversity at the dataset level is associated with improved cross-domain generalization in building change detection.

TL;DR: TTSA3R is a training-free framework for 3D reconstruction that integrates temporal state evolution and spatial observation quality to improve long-term stability and reduce memory forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Streaming recurrent models struggle with catastrophic memory forgetting in long sequences, lacking temporal and spatial consistency.

Method: TTSA3R uses Temporal Adaptive Update Module for temporal state evolution and Spatial Contextual Update Module for spatial observation quality, fusing these signals.

Result: Achieves 15% error increase versus baseline's 200% degradation, showing strong long-term stability.

Conclusion: TTSA3R significantly enhances 3D reconstruction stability by addressing temporal and spatial consistency.

Abstract: Streaming recurrent models enable efficient 3D reconstruction by maintaining persistent state representations. However, they suffer from catastrophic memory forgetting over long sequences due to balancing historical information with new observations. Recent methods alleviate this by deriving adaptive signals from attention perspective, but they operate on single dimensions without considering temporal and spatial consistency. To this end, we propose a training-free framework termed TTSA3R that leverages both temporal state evolution and spatial observation quality for adaptive state updates in 3D reconstruction. In particular, we devise a Temporal Adaptive Update Module that regulates update magnitude by analyzing temporal state evolution patterns. Then, a Spatial Contextual Update Module is introduced to localize spatial regions that require updates through observation-state alignment and scene dynamics. These complementary signals are finally fused to determine the state updating strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TTSA3R in diverse 3D tasks. Moreover, our method exhibits only 15% error increase compared to over 200% degradation in baseline models on extended sequences, significantly improving long-term reconstruction stability. Our codes will be available soon.

TL;DR: UniGeo, a unified 3D indoor detection framework, enhances geometric relations and feature representation in sparse point clouds for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in current 3D object detection methods that fail to model geometric relationships and ignore feature distribution in sparse point cloud scenes.

Method: Proposes a geometry-aware learning module for explicit geometric feature enhancement and a dynamic channel gating mechanism to optimize feature representation.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance across six indoor scene datasets.

Conclusion: UniGeo effectively improves 3D object detection by modeling geometric relationships and optimizing feature representation.

Abstract: The growing adoption of robotics and augmented reality in real-world applications has driven considerable research interest in 3D object detection based on point clouds. While previous methods address unified training across multiple datasets, they fail to model geometric relationships in sparse point cloud scenes and ignore the feature distribution in significant areas, which ultimately restricts their performance. To deal with this issue, a unified 3D indoor detection framework, called UniGeo, is proposed. To model geometric relations in scenes, we first propose a geometry-aware learning module that establishes a learnable mapping from spatial relationships to feature weights, which enabes explicit geometric feature enhancement. Then, to further enhance point cloud feature representation, we propose a dynamic channel gating mechanism that leverages learnable channel-wise weighting. This mechanism adaptively optimizes features generated by the sparse 3D U-Net network, significantly enhancing key geometric information. Extensive experiments on six different indoor scene datasets clearly validate the superior performance of our method.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LINA, a compute-efficient T2I model using linear attention, achieving high-fidelity image generation with reduced FLOPs and competitive benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of autoregressive models in visual generation, particularly T2I synthesis, by optimizing linear attention design choices.

Method: Systematically analyzes scaling behavior with parameter counts, evaluates normalization paradigms (division vs. subtraction) and depthwise convolution for locality augmentation, and introduces a KV gate for memory management.

Result: Division-based normalization and convolution enhance performance in autoregressive generation. LINA achieves 2.18 FID on ImageNet and 0.74 on GenEval, with 61 percent FLOPs reduction.

Conclusion: Linear attention designs, such as LINA, offer a viable, efficient alternative for high-quality T2I synthesis with significant computational savings.

Abstract: Autoregressive models with continuous tokens form a promising paradigm for visual generation, especially for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, but they suffer from high computational cost. We study how to design compute-efficient linear attention within this framework. Specifically, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of scaling behavior with respect to parameter counts under different design choices, focusing on (1) normalization paradigms in linear attention (division-based vs. subtraction-based) and (2) depthwise convolution for locality augmentation.
  Our results show that although subtraction-based normalization is effective for image classification, division-based normalization scales better for linear generative transformers. In addition, incorporating convolution for locality modeling plays a crucial role in autoregressive generation, consistent with findings in diffusion models.
  We further extend gating mechanisms, commonly used in causal linear attention, to the bidirectional setting and propose a KV gate. By introducing data-independent learnable parameters to the key and value states, the KV gate assigns token-wise memory weights, enabling flexible memory management similar to forget gates in language models.
  Based on these findings, we present LINA, a simple and compute-efficient T2I model built entirely on linear attention, capable of generating high-fidelity 1024x1024 images from user instructions. LINA achieves competitive performance on both class-conditional and T2I benchmarks, obtaining 2.18 FID on ImageNet (about 1.4B parameters) and 0.74 on GenEval (about 1.5B parameters). A single linear attention module reduces FLOPs by about 61 percent compared to softmax attention. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/techmonsterwang/LINA.

Result: Experimental evidence shows improved CV annotation and accuracy with vTelos.

Conclusion: vTelos, based on Ranganathan's principles, effectively addresses the Semantic Gap Problem in Computer Vision.

Abstract: The Semantic Gap Problem (SGP) in Computer Vision (CV) arises from the misalignment between visual and lexical semantics leading to flawed CV dataset design and CV benchmarks.

Motivation: Identifying concepts in synthetic images is crucial for copyright protection and transparency, but existing methods require expensive paired annotations.

Method: Uses contrastive self-supervised learning for concept alignment and Infomax loss for representation disentanglement, leveraging cross-domain alignment abilities.

Result: The unsupervised method outperforms supervised methods on the AbC benchmark.

Conclusion: The approach offers a fresh perspective on synthetic image attribution, demonstrating effectiveness without paired supervision.

Abstract: As the quality of synthetic images improves, identifying the underlying concepts of model-generated images is becoming increasingly crucial for copyright protection and ensuring model transparency. Existing methods achieve this attribution goal by training models using annotated pairs of synthetic images and their original training sources. However, obtaining such paired supervision is challenging, as it requires either well-designed synthetic concepts or precise annotations from millions of training sources. To eliminate the need for costly paired annotations, in this paper, we explore the possibility of unsupervised synthetic image attribution. We propose a simple yet effective unsupervised method called Alignment and Disentanglement. Specifically, we begin by performing basic concept alignment using contrastive self-supervised learning. Next, we enhance the model's attribution ability by promoting representation disentanglement with the Infomax loss. This approach is motivated by an interesting observation: contrastive self-supervised models, such as MoCo and DINO, inherently exhibit the ability to perform simple cross-domain alignment. By formulating this observation as a theoretical assumption on cross-covariance, we provide a theoretical explanation of how alignment and disentanglement can approximate the concept-matching process through a decomposition of the canonical correlation analysis objective. On the real-world benchmarks, AbC, we show that our unsupervised method surprisingly outperforms the supervised methods. As a starting point, we expect our intuitive insights and experimental findings to provide a fresh perspective on this challenging task.

*Junyi Hu,Tian Bai,Fengyi Wu,Wenyan Li,Zhenming Peng,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExpAlign is a vision-language alignment framework using attention-based soft MIL pooling and energy-based regularization for improved open-vocabulary grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack fine-grained expressiveness or require heavy supervision. ExpAlign aims to achieve accurate alignment under weak supervision.

Method: Utilizes Expectation Alignment Head for attention-based soft MIL pooling and energy-based multi-scale consistency regularization.

Result: Achieves 36.2 AP$_r$ on LVIS minival, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while remaining lightweight.

Conclusion: ExpAlign improves open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot instance segmentation, especially for long-tail categories.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary grounding requires accurate vision-language alignment under weak supervision, yet existing methods either rely on global sentence embeddings that lack fine-grained expressiveness or introduce token-level alignment with explicit supervision or heavy cross-attention designs. We propose ExpAlign, a theoretically grounded vision-language alignment framework built on a principled multiple instance learning formulation. ExpAlign introduces an Expectation Alignment Head that performs attention-based soft MIL pooling over token-region similarities, enabling implicit token and instance selection without additional annotations. To further stabilize alignment learning, we develop an energy-based multi-scale consistency regularization scheme, including a Top-K multi-positive contrastive objective and a Geometry-Aware Consistency Objective derived from a Lagrangian-constrained free-energy minimization. Extensive experiments show that ExpAlign consistently improves open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot instance segmentation, particularly on long-tail categories. Most notably, it achieves 36.2 AP$_r$ on the LVIS minival split, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods at comparable model scale, while remaining lightweight and inference-efficient.

*Hanxun Yu,Wentong Li,Xuan Qu,Song Wang,Junbo Chen,Jianke Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionTrim is a unified framework for accelerating multimodal large language models by reducing visual tokens while maintaining performance, using two plug-and-play modules: DVTS for token selection and TGVC for context-aware merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token reduction methods suffer from computational inefficiency and neglect textual alignment, limiting MLLM performance in high-resolution and video scenarios.

Method: VisionTrim integrates DVTS (Dominant Vision Token Selection) for preserving essential tokens and TGVC (Text-Guided Vision Complement) for context-aware merging, both training-free and plug-and-play.

Result: Extensive experiments show VisionTrim outperforms existing methods across diverse benchmarks, enabling efficient MLLM deployment.

Conclusion: VisionTrim successfully balances computational efficiency and performance, advancing practical MLLM applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) suffer from high computational costs due to excessive visual tokens, particularly in high-resolution and video-based scenarios. Existing token reduction methods typically focus on isolated pipeline components and often neglect textual alignment, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose VisionTrim, a unified framework for training-free MLLM acceleration, integrating two effective plug-and-play modules: 1) the Dominant Vision Token Selection (DVTS) module, which preserves essential visual tokens via a global-local view, and 2) the Text-Guided Vision Complement (TGVC) module, which facilitates context-aware token merging guided by textual cues. Extensive experiments across diverse image and video multimodal benchmarks demonstrate the performance superiority of our VisionTrim, advancing practical MLLM deployment in real-world applications.

### [36] [Fire on Motion: Optimizing Video Pass-bands for Efficient Spiking Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22675)
*Shuhan Ye,Yuanbin Qian,Yi Yu,Chong Wang,Yuqi Xie,Jiazhen Xu,Kun Wang,Xudong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform on dynamic video tasks due to a pass-band mismatch. The proposed Pass-Bands Optimizer (PBO) adjusts the temporal pass-band to focus on motion-bearing content, improving SNN performance on video tasks with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs are energy-efficient and bio-plausible but lag behind artificial neural networks (ANNs) in dynamic video tasks because their standard dynamics emphasize static content over motion-bearing information.

Method: The authors introduce PBO, a plug-and-play module with two learnable parameters and a lightweight consistency constraint to optimize the temporal pass-band for task-relevant motion bands, suppressing static components.

Result: PBO improves SNN performance by over 10 percentage points on UCF101 and delivers consistent gains in action recognition and video anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: PBO effectively addresses the pass-band mismatch in SNNs, enhancing their performance on dynamic video tasks without architectural changes, offering a new perspective for SNN-based video processing.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained traction in vision due to their energy efficiency, bio-plausibility, and inherent temporal processing. Yet, despite this temporal capacity, most progress concentrates on static image benchmarks, and SNNs still underperform on dynamic video tasks compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we diagnose a fundamental pass-band mismatch: Standard spiking dynamics behave as a temporal low pass that emphasizes static content while attenuating motion bearing bands, where task relevant information concentrates in dynamic tasks. This phenomenon explains why SNNs can approach ANNs on static tasks yet fall behind on tasks that demand richer temporal understanding.To remedy this, we propose the Pass-Bands Optimizer (PBO), a plug-and-play module that optimizes the temporal pass-band toward task-relevant motion bands. PBO introduces only two learnable parameters, and a lightweight consistency constraint that preserves semantics and boundaries, incurring negligible computational overhead and requires no architectural changes. PBO deliberately suppresses static components that contribute little to discrimination, effectively high passing the stream so that spiking activity concentrates on motion bearing content. On UCF101, PBO yields over ten percentage points improvement. On more complex multi-modal action recognition and weakly supervised video anomaly detection, PBO delivers consistent and significant gains, offering a new perspective for SNN based video processing and understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess visual personalization models based on perceptual indistinguishability rather than identity replication.

Method: Develops the VPTT Framework with VPTT-Bench (10k-persona benchmark), VPRAG (visual retrieval-augmented generator), and the VPTT Score.

Result: Shows high correlation between human, VLM, and VPTT evaluations, validating the VPTT Score. VPRAG achieves the best alignment-originality balance.

Conclusion: VPTT provides a scalable, privacy-safe foundation for personalized generative AI.

Abstract: We introduce the Visual Personalization Turing Test (VPTT), a new paradigm for evaluating contextual visual personalization based on perceptual indistinguishability, rather than identity replication. A model passes the VPTT if its output (image, video, 3D asset, etc.) is indistinguishable to a human or calibrated VLM judge from content a given person might plausibly create or share. To operationalize VPTT, we present the VPTT Framework, integrating a 10k-persona benchmark (VPTT-Bench), a visual retrieval-augmented generator (VPRAG), and the VPTT Score, a text-only metric calibrated against human and VLM judgments. We show high correlation across human, VLM, and VPTT evaluations, validating the VPTT Score as a reliable perceptual proxy. Experiments demonstrate that VPRAG achieves the best alignment-originality balance, offering a scalable and privacy-safe foundation for personalized generative AI.

*Binyi Su,Chenghao Huang,Haiyong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces OOVDet, a zero-shot OOV detector that improves detection of predefined classes while rejecting undefined ones by synthesizing OOV prompts and mining pseudo-OOV images with uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for zero-shot out-of-vocabulary detection (ZS-OOVD) overfit in-vocabulary classes, misclassifying undefined ones. This work aims to address this issue.

Method: The proposed OOVDet synthesizes region-level OOV prompts from low-likelihood areas in hidden space and uses Dirichlet-based gradient attribution to mine pseudo-OOV images. It constructs an OOV decision boundary with low-density prior constraints.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant improvement in OOV detection performance in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: OOVDet effectively detects predefined classes and rejects undefined ones, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Zero-shot out-of-vocabulary detection (ZS-OOVD) aims to accurately recognize objects of in-vocabulary (IV) categories provided at zero-shot inference, while simultaneously rejecting undefined ones (out-of-vocabulary, OOV) that lack corresponding category prompts. However, previous methods are prone to overfitting the IV classes, leading to the OOV or undefined classes being misclassified as IV ones with a high confidence score. To address this issue, this paper proposes a zero-shot OOV detector (OOVDet), a novel framework that effectively detects predefined classes while reliably rejecting undefined ones in zero-shot scenes. Specifically, due to the model's lack of prior knowledge about the distribution of OOV data, we synthesize region-level OOV prompts by sampling from the low-likelihood regions of the class-conditional Gaussian distributions in the hidden space, motivated by the assumption that unknown semantics are more likely to emerge in low-density areas of the latent space. For OOV images, we further propose a Dirichlet-based gradient attribution mechanism to mine pseudo-OOV image samples, where the attribution gradients are interpreted as Dirichlet evidence to estimate prediction uncertainty, and samples with high uncertainty are selected as pseudo-OOV images. Building on these synthesized OOV prompts and pseudo-OOV images, we construct the OOV decision boundary through a low-density prior constraint, which regularizes the optimization of OOV classes using Gaussian kernel density estimation in accordance with the above assumption.
  Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the OOV detection performance in zero-shot scenes. The code is available at https://github.com/binyisu/OOV-detector.

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong zero-shot performance via large-scale image-text pretraining and have been widely adopted in medical image analysis. However, existing VLMs remain notably weak at understanding negated clinical statements, largely due to contrastive alignment objectives that treat negation as a minor linguistic variation rather than a meaning-inverting operator. In multi-label settings, prompt-based InfoNCE fine-tuning further reinforces easy-positive image-prompt alignments, limiting effective learning of disease absence. To overcome these limitations, we reformulate vision-language alignment as a conditional semantic comparison problem, which is instantiated through a bi-directional multiple-choice learning framework(Bi-MCQ). By jointly training Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image MCQ tasks with affirmative, negative, and mixed prompts, our method implements fine-tuning as conditional semantic comparison instead of global similarity maximization. We further introduce direction-specific Cross-Attention fusion modules to address asymmetric cues required by bi-directional reasoning and reduce alignment interference. Experiments on ChestXray14, Open-I, CheXpert, and PadChest show that Bi-MCQ improves negation understanding by up to 0.47 AUC over the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art CARZero model, while achieving up to a 0.08 absolute gain on positive-negative combined (PNC) evaluation. Additionally, Bi-MCQ reduces the affirmative-negative AUC gap by an average of 0.12 compared to InfoNCE-based fine-tuning, demonstrating that objective reformulation can substantially enhance negation understanding in medical VLMs.

*Abid Hassan,Tuan Ngo,Saad Shafiq,Nenad Medvidovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAVIS, a post-hoc OOD detection method, enhances feature vectors with overlooked activation statistics (variance and max activations) to outperform existing methods across various architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods discard valuable distributional statistics during global average pooling, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes DAVIS, incorporating channel-wise variance and dominant activations into feature vectors to address information loss from GAP.

Result: Achieves significant FPR95 reductions: 48.26% on CIFAR-10, 38.13% on CIFAR-100, and 26.83% on ImageNet-1k benchmarks.

Conclusion: DAVIS sets a new benchmark by leveraging overlooked statistics, offering a principled approach beyond mean-based detection.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is a critical safeguard for deploying machine learning models in the real world. However, most post-hoc detection methods operate on penultimate feature representations derived from global average pooling (GAP) -- a lossy operation that discards valuable distributional statistics from activation maps prior to global average pooling. We contend that these overlooked statistics, particularly channel-wise variance and dominant (maximum) activations, are highly discriminative for OOD detection. We introduce DAVIS, a simple and broadly applicable post-hoc technique that enriches feature vectors by incorporating these crucial statistics, directly addressing the information loss from GAP. Extensive evaluations show DAVIS sets a new benchmark across diverse architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet. It achieves significant reductions in the false positive rate (FPR95), with improvements of 48.26\% on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-18, 38.13\% on CIFAR-100 using ResNet-34, and 26.83\% on ImageNet-1k benchmarks using MobileNet-v2. Our analysis reveals the underlying mechanism for this improvement, providing a principled basis for moving beyond the mean in OOD detection.

TL;DR: GRACE is a framework combining knowledge distillation and quantization-aware training (QAT) for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to reduce deployment costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are costly to deploy, and post-training quantization often reduces accuracy. GRACE addresses this by unifying quantization and distillation under the Information Bottleneck principle.

Method: GRACE uses confidence-gated decoupled distillation, relational centered kernel alignment, and an adaptive controller to balance fidelity and capacity constraints.

Result: INT4 models outperform FP16 baselines (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B: 70.1 vs. 66.8 on SQA) and achieve 3x throughput with 54% memory reduction.

Conclusion: GRACE outperforms existing quantization methods, offering a practical solution for deploying VLMs efficiently.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong multimodal performance but are costly to deploy, and post-training quantization often causes significant accuracy loss. Despite its potential, quantization-aware training for VLMs remains underexplored. We propose GRACE, a framework unifying knowledge distillation and QAT under the Information Bottleneck principle: quantization constrains information capacity while distillation guides what to preserve within this budget. Treating the teacher as a proxy for task-relevant information, we introduce confidence-gated decoupled distillation to filter unreliable supervision, relational centered kernel alignment to transfer visual token structures, and an adaptive controller via Lagrangian relaxation to balance fidelity against capacity constraints. Across extensive benchmarks on LLaVA and Qwen families, our INT4 models consistently outperform FP16 baselines (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B: 70.1 vs. 66.8 on SQA; Qwen2-VL-2B: 76.9 vs. 72.6 on MMBench), nearly matching teacher performance. Using real INT4 kernel, we achieve 3$\times$ throughput with 54% memory reduction. This principled framework significantly outperforms existing quantization methods, making GRACE a compelling solution for resource-constrained deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenVTON-Bench introduces a large-scale benchmark (~100K high-res images) for Virtual Try-On (VTON) evaluation, addressing gaps in existing datasets and metrics. It uses advanced methods like DINOv3 clustering and Gemini captioning, and proposes a multi-modal evaluation protocol aligned with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTON systems lack reliable evaluation metrics and datasets that meet commercial standards in scale, diversity, and semantic consistency.

Method: Constructed dataset using DINOv3 hierarchical clustering and Gemini dense captioning. Proposed a multi-modal evaluation protocol with five dimensions, integrating VLM-based reasoning and a novel Multi-Scale Representation Metric.

Result: Experimental results show high agreement with human judgments (Kendall's τ of 0.833), outperforming traditional metrics like SSIM (0.611).

Conclusion: OpenVTON-Bench provides a robust benchmark for VTON evaluation, addressing limitations in current datasets and metrics while aligning closely with human perception.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly elevated the visual fidelity of Virtual Try-On (VTON) systems, yet reliable evaluation remains a persistent bottleneck. Traditional metrics struggle to quantify fine-grained texture details and semantic consistency, while existing datasets fail to meet commercial standards in scale and diversity. We present OpenVTON-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising approximately 100K high-resolution image pairs (up to $1536 \times 1536$). The dataset is constructed using DINOv3-based hierarchical clustering for semantically balanced sampling and Gemini-powered dense captioning, ensuring a uniform distribution across 20 fine-grained garment categories. To support reliable evaluation, we propose a multi-modal protocol that measures VTON quality along five interpretable dimensions: background consistency, identity fidelity, texture fidelity, shape plausibility, and overall realism. The protocol integrates VLM-based semantic reasoning with a novel Multi-Scale Representation Metric based on SAM3 segmentation and morphological erosion, enabling the separation of boundary alignment errors from internal texture artifacts. Experimental results show strong agreement with human judgments (Kendall's $τ$ of 0.833 vs. 0.611 for SSIM), establishing a robust benchmark for VTON evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in 3D semantic occupancy prediction, such as trade-offs between camera semantics and LiDAR geometry, modality heterogeneity, and computational inefficiency of existing methods.

Method: The framework includes four key modules: LiDAR Depth Feature Aggregation, Entropy-Based Feature Smoothing, Adaptive Camera-LiDAR Fusion, and a Gauss-Mamba Head for efficient global context modeling.

Result: GaussianOcc3D achieves state-of-the-art mIoU scores of 49.4%, 28.9%, and 25.2% on Occ3D, SurroundOcc, and SemanticKITTI benchmarks, respectively, with robustness in challenging conditions.

Conclusion: GaussianOcc3D effectively bridges camera and LiDAR modalities using a memory-efficient Gaussian representation, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating strong robustness.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a pivotal task in autonomous driving, providing a dense and fine-grained understanding of the surrounding environment, yet single-modality methods face trade-offs between camera semantics and LiDAR geometry. Existing multi-modal frameworks often struggle with modality heterogeneity, spatial misalignment, and the representation crisis--where voxels are computationally heavy and BEV alternatives are lossy. We present GaussianOcc3D, a multi-modal framework bridging camera and LiDAR through a memory-efficient, continuous 3D Gaussian representation. We introduce four modules: (1) LiDAR Depth Feature Aggregation (LDFA), using depth-wise deformable sampling to lift sparse signals onto Gaussian primitives; (2) Entropy-Based Feature Smoothing (EBFS) to mitigate domain noise; (3) Adaptive Camera-LiDAR Fusion (ACLF) with uncertainty-aware reweighting for sensor reliability; and (4) a Gauss-Mamba Head leveraging Selective State Space Models for global context with linear complexity. Evaluations on Occ3D, SurroundOcc, and SemanticKITTI benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving mIoU scores of 49.4%, 28.9%, and 25.2% respectively. GaussianOcc3D exhibits superior robustness across challenging rainy and nighttime conditions.

*Xiaoshu Chen,Sihang Zhou,Ke Liang,Taichun Zhou,Xinwang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImgCoT compresses reasoning chains into visual tokens to reduce linguistic bias and enhance logical abstraction, supplemented by key textual steps for detail retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods compress CoT into latent tokens but retain linguistic features, limiting logical abstraction. ImgCoT aims to prioritize reasoning structure over linguistic form.

Method: ImgCoT replaces textual CoT reconstruction with visual CoT (rendered as images), introducing spatial bias. A hybrid version augments visual tokens with key textual steps.

Result: ImgCoT improves global reasoning structure capture and retains details with fewer tokens than full CoT, validated across datasets and LLMs.

Conclusion: Visual latent tokens reduce linguistic bias and enhance abstraction, while hybrid reasoning balances structure and detail retention.

Abstract: Compressing long chains of thought (CoT) into compact latent tokens is crucial for efficient reasoning with large language models (LLMs). Recent studies employ autoencoders to achieve this by reconstructing textual CoT from latent tokens, thus encoding CoT semantics. However, treating textual CoT as the reconstruction target forces latent tokens to preserve surface-level linguistic features (e.g., word choice and syntax), introducing a strong linguistic inductive bias that prioritizes linguistic form over reasoning structure and limits logical abstraction. Thus, we propose ImgCoT that replaces the reconstruction target from textual CoT to the visual CoT obtained by rendering CoT into images. This substitutes linguistic bias with spatial inductive bias, i.e., a tendency to model spatial layouts of the reasoning steps in visual CoT, enabling latent tokens to better capture global reasoning structure. Moreover, although visual latent tokens encode abstract reasoning structure, they may blur reasoning details. We thus propose a loose ImgCoT, a hybrid reasoning that augments visual latent tokens with a few key textual reasoning steps, selected based on low token log-likelihood. This design allows LLMs to retain both global reasoning structure and fine-grained reasoning details with fewer tokens than the complete CoT. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of the two versions of ImgCoT.

TL;DR: Lingua-SafetyBench introduces a multilingual multimodal benchmark to evaluate safety risks in VLLMs, revealing asymmetrical risks across languages and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of robust benchmarks assessing safety risks in vision-language large models (VLLMs) under multilingual and multimodal inputs motivates the creation of Lingua-SafetyBench.

Method: A benchmark of 100,440 harmful image-text pairs across 10 languages is introduced, partitioned into image-dominant and text-dominant subsets. Eleven open-source VLLMs are evaluated.

Result: Findings show asymmetry: image-dominant risks are higher in high-resource languages, while text-dominant risks are more severe in non-high-resource languages. Scaling reduces ASR but widens gaps between languages.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for language- and modality-aware safety alignment beyond scaling, and releases resources for reproducibility.

Abstract: Robust safety of vision-language large models (VLLMs) under joint multilingual and multimodal inputs remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks are typically multilingual but text-only, or multimodal but monolingual. Recent multilingual multimodal red-teaming efforts render harmful prompts into images, yet rely heavily on typography-style visuals and lack semantically grounded image-text pairs, limiting coverage of realistic cross-modal interactions. We introduce Lingua-SafetyBench, a benchmark of 100,440 harmful image-text pairs across 10 languages, explicitly partitioned into image-dominant and text-dominant subsets to disentangle risk sources. Evaluating 11 open-source VLLMs reveals a consistent asymmetry: image-dominant risks yield higher ASR in high-resource languages, while text-dominant risks are more severe in non-high-resource languages. A controlled study on the Qwen series shows that scaling and version upgrades reduce Attack Success Rate (ASR) overall but disproportionately benefit HRLs, widening the gap between HRLs and Non-HRLs under text-dominant risks. This underscores the necessity of language- and modality-aware safety alignment beyond mere scaling.To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we will publicly release our benchmark, model checkpoints, and source code.The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/zsxr15/Lingua-SafetyBench.Warning: this paper contains examples with unsafe content.

TL;DR: StreamSense is a streaming detector combining a lightweight encoder with selective routing to a Vision-Language Model (VLM), improving accuracy and reducing latency by deferring hard cases and avoiding label interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Live streaming platforms need efficient real-time monitoring of social signals (video, text, audio) to respond effectively.

Method: StreamSense uses a lightweight encoder trained with cross-modal contrastive alignment and IoU-weighted loss, selectively routing ambiguous cases to a VLM.

Result: StreamSense outperforms VLM-only approaches in accuracy while reducing latency and compute by minimizing VLM usage.

Conclusion: Selective escalation and deferral are effective for streaming social tasks, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Live streaming platforms require real-time monitoring and reaction to social signals, utilizing partial and asynchronous evidence from video, text, and audio. We propose StreamSense, a streaming detector that couples a lightweight streaming encoder with selective routing to a Vision-Language Model (VLM) expert. StreamSense handles most timestamps with the lightweight streaming encoder, escalates hard/ambiguous cases to the VLM, and defers decisions when context is insufficient. The encoder is trained using (i) a cross-modal contrastive term to align visual/audio cues with textual signals, and (ii) an IoU-weighted loss that down-weights poorly overlapping target segments, mitigating label interference across segment boundaries. We evaluate StreamSense on multiple social streaming detection tasks (e.g., sentiment classification and hate content moderation), and the results show that StreamSense achieves higher accuracy than VLM-only streaming while only occasionally invoking the VLM, thereby reducing average latency and compute. Our results indicate that selective escalation and deferral are effective primitives for understanding streaming social tasks. Code is publicly available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaceDefense is a proactive defense framework against diffusion-based face swapping, balancing defense effectiveness and visual imperceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the harms of malicious face swapping while avoiding distortions caused by large perturbations or weak protection from small perturbations.

Method: Introduces diffusion loss for stronger adversarial examples and directional facial attribute editing to restore distortions, optimized via a two-phase strategy.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in both imperceptibility and defense effectiveness.

Conclusion: FaceDefense achieves a superior trade-off between protection and visual quality.

Abstract: Diffusion-based face swapping achieves state-of-the-art performance, yet it also exacerbates the potential harm of malicious face swapping to violate portraiture right or undermine personal reputation. This has spurred the development of proactive defense methods. However, existing approaches face a core trade-off: large perturbations distort facial structures, while small ones weaken protection effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose FaceDefense, an enhanced proactive defense framework against diffusion-based face swapping. Our method introduces a new diffusion loss to strengthen the defensive efficacy of adversarial examples, and employs a directional facial attribute editing to restore perturbation-induced distortions, thereby enhancing visual imperceptibility. A two-phase alternating optimization strategy is designed to generate final perturbed face images. Extensive experiments show that FaceDefense significantly outperforms existing methods in both imperceptibility and defense effectiveness, achieving a superior trade-off.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates two Vision Language Models (VLMs) for automating the extraction of structured knowledge from industrial troubleshooting guides, comparing standard and layout-augmented prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual extraction of diagnostic procedures from troubleshooting guides is labor-intensive and error-prone, highlighting the need for automated solutions.

Method: Two VLMs were tested using standard instruction-guided prompting and an augmented approach that incorporates layout patterns.

Result: The models showed trade-offs between sensitivity to layout and semantic robustness, impacting practical deployment choices.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into the effectiveness of VLMs for automating knowledge extraction from troubleshooting guides, aiding deployment decisions.

Abstract: Industrial troubleshooting guides encode diagnostic procedures in flowchart-like diagrams where spatial layout and technical language jointly convey meaning. To integrate this knowledge into operator support systems, which assist shop-floor personnel in diagnosing and resolving equipment issues, the information must first be extracted and structured for machine interpretation. However, when performed manually, this extraction is labor-intensive and error-prone. Vision Language Models offer potential to automate this process by jointly interpreting visual and textual meaning, yet their performance on such guides remains underexplored. This paper evaluates two VLMs on extracting structured knowledge, comparing two prompting strategies: standard instruction-guided versus an augmented approach that cues troubleshooting layout patterns. Results reveal model-specific trade-offs between layout sensitivity and semantic robustness, informing practical deployment decisions.

### [49] [Is Training Necessary for Anomaly Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22763)
*Xingwu Zhang,Guanxuan Li,Paul Henderson,Gerardo Aragon-Camarasa,Zijun Long*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Retrieval-based Anomaly Detection (RAD), a training-free method that outperforms traditional reconstruction-based approaches in multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection by using memory-based retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from a fidelity-stability dilemma in anomaly detection via reconstruction residuals, prompting the need for a more effective approach.

Method: RAD stores anomaly-free features in memory and detects anomalies through multi-level retrieval, eliminating the need for task-specific training.

Result: RAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like MVTec-AD (96.7% Pixel AUROC with one image) and proves retrieval scores theoretically upper-bound reconstruction scores.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that memory-based retrieval can replace training-dependent methods for superior anomaly detection.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD) methods rely on training encoder-decoder models to reconstruct anomaly-free features. We first show these approaches have an inherent fidelity-stability dilemma in how they detect anomalies via reconstruction residuals. We then abandon the reconstruction paradigm entirely and propose Retrieval-based Anomaly Detection (RAD). RAD is a training-free approach that stores anomaly-free features in a memory and detects anomalies through multi-level retrieval, matching test patches against the memory. Experiments demonstrate that RAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across four established benchmarks (MVTec-AD, VisA, Real-IAD, 3D-ADAM) under both standard and few-shot settings. On MVTec-AD, RAD reaches 96.7\% Pixel AUROC with just a single anomaly-free image compared to 98.5\% of RAD's full-data performance. We further prove that retrieval-based scores theoretically upper-bound reconstruction-residual scores. Collectively, these findings overturn the assumption that MUAD requires task-specific training, showing that state-of-the-art anomaly detection is feasible with memory-based retrieval.

*Nan Zhong,Yiran Xu,Mian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a DCCT framework leveraging camera imaging properties to detect AI-generated images by analyzing color correlations, achieving superior generalization and robustness across unseen generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the generalization failure of existing detectors for AI-generated images by exploiting intrinsic properties of the camera imaging pipeline, particularly color correlations induced by CFA and demosaicing.

Method: Introduces DCCT, a framework simulating CFA sampling to decompose color images into channels, training a self-supervised U-Net to predict missing channels using logistic functions, and constructing a binary classifier based on the distinct features found.

Result: DCCT outperforms prior methods in generalization and robustness, successfully detecting AI-generated images across over 20 unseen generators.

Conclusion: The DCCT framework effectively detects AI-generated images by targeting provable differences in color-correlation features, offering state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: As realistic AI-generated images threaten digital authenticity, we address the generalization failure of generative artifact-based detectors by exploiting the intrinsic properties of the camera imaging pipeline. Concretely, we investigate color correlations induced by the color filter array (CFA) and demosaicing, and propose a Demosaicing-guided Color Correlation Training (DCCT) framework for AI-generated image detection. By simulating the CFA sampling pattern, we decompose each color image into a single-channel input (as the condition) and the remaining two channels as the ground-truth targets (for prediction). A self-supervised U-Net is trained to model the conditional distribution of the missing channels from the given one, parameterized via a mixture of logistic functions. Our theoretical analysis reveals that DCCT targets a provable distributional difference in color-correlation features between photographic and AI-generated images. By leveraging these distinct features to construct a binary classifier, DCCT achieves state-of-the-art generalization and robustness, significantly outperforming prior methods across over 20 unseen generators.

*Haiyang Wu,Weiliang Mu,Jipeng Zhang,Zhong Dandan,Zhuofei Du,Haifeng Li,Tao Chao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FarmMind introduces a dynamic segmentation framework for farmland remote sensing images, using reasoning-driven queries to enhance segmentation accuracy by dynamically accessing auxiliary images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static segmentation methods for FRSIs lack robustness in complex scenes due to limited single-patch information. Human experts, however, use auxiliary images for cross-verification, inspiring the dynamic approach.

Method: FarmMind employs a reasoning-query mechanism to dynamically retrieve external auxiliary images, simulating human expert analysis of segmentation ambiguities and determining necessary queries.

Result: Experiments show FarmMind outperforms existing methods in segmentation accuracy and generalization, validated on publicly available datasets.

Conclusion: FarmMind's dynamic segmentation framework addresses limitations of static methods by mimicking human reasoning and querying, achieving superior performance in complex FRSI scenarios.

Abstract: Existing methods for farmland remote sensing image (FRSI) segmentation generally follow a static segmentation paradigm, where analysis relies solely on the limited information contained within a single input patch. Consequently, their reasoning capability is limited when dealing with complex scenes characterized by ambiguity and visual uncertainty. In contrast, human experts, when interpreting remote sensing images in such ambiguous cases, tend to actively query auxiliary images (such as higher-resolution, larger-scale, or temporally adjacent data) to conduct cross-verification and achieve more comprehensive reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a reasoning-query-driven dynamic segmentation framework for FRSIs, named FarmMind. This framework breaks through the limitations of the static segmentation paradigm by introducing a reasoning-query mechanism, which dynamically and on-demand queries external auxiliary images to compensate for the insufficient information in a single input image. Unlike direct queries, this mechanism simulates the thinking process of human experts when faced with segmentation ambiguity: it first analyzes the root causes of segmentation ambiguities through reasoning, and then determines what type of auxiliary image needs to be queried based on this analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FarmMind achieves superior segmentation performance and stronger generalization ability compared with existing methods.

*Ji Zhou,Yilin Ding,Yongqi Zhao,Jiachen Xu,Arno Eichberger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for 2D object detection in safety-critical scenarios, comparing them with YOLO-based methods. LVLMs show better recall in complex natural conditions, while YOLO excels in geometric precision for synthetic perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety risks in automated driving caused by perception insufficiencies, especially under adverse conditions, by exploring the effectiveness of LVLMs for object detection.

Method: A systematic evaluation of ten LVLMs using the PeSOTIF dataset, benchmarking performance against a YOLO-based detector in long-tail traffic scenarios and environmental degradations.

Result: Top LVLMs (e.g., Gemini 3, Doubao) outperform YOLO in recall by over 25% in complex natural scenarios, showing better robustness to visual degradation. YOLO remains superior in geometric precision for synthetic perturbations.

Conclusion: LVLMs and YOLO have complementary strengths—semantic reasoning vs. geometric regression—suggesting LVLMs are suitable as high-level safety validators in automated driving systems.

Abstract: Reliable environmental perception remains one of the main obstacles for safe operation of automated vehicles. Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) concerns safety risks from perception insufficiencies, particularly under adverse conditions where conventional detectors often falter. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising semantic reasoning, their quantitative effectiveness for safety-critical 2D object detection is underexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ten representative LVLMs using the PeSOTIF dataset, a benchmark specifically curated for long-tail traffic scenarios and environmental degradations. Performance is quantitatively compared against the classical perception approach, a YOLO-based detector. Experimental results reveal a critical trade-off: top-performing LVLMs (e.g., Gemini 3, Doubao) surpass the YOLO baseline in recall by over 25% in complex natural scenarios, exhibiting superior robustness to visual degradation. Conversely, the baseline retains an advantage in geometric precision for synthetic perturbations. These findings highlight the complementary strengths of semantic reasoning versus geometric regression, supporting the use of LVLMs as high-level safety validators in SOTIF-oriented automated driving systems.

*Bin Wu,Mengqi Huang,Weinan Jia,Zhendong Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NativeTok, a framework for VQ-based image generation that enforces causal dependencies during tokenization to improve coherence and reduce bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQ-based image generation methods fail to constrain token dependencies, leading to weak coherence and bias in the generated images.

Method: Proposes NativeTok with a Meta Image Transformer (MIT) and a Mixture of Causal Expert Transformer (MoCET), along with a Hierarchical Native Training strategy for efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NativeTok in achieving efficient reconstruction and embedding relational constraints within token sequences.

Conclusion: NativeTok addresses the mismatch in token dependencies, improving coherence and reducing bias in VQ-based image generation.

Abstract: VQ-based image generation typically follows a two-stage pipeline: a tokenizer encodes images into discrete tokens, and a generative model learns their dependencies for reconstruction. However, improved tokenization in the first stage does not necessarily enhance the second-stage generation, as existing methods fail to constrain token dependencies. This mismatch forces the generative model to learn from unordered distributions, leading to bias and weak coherence. To address this, we propose native visual tokenization, which enforces causal dependencies during tokenization. Building on this idea, we introduce NativeTok, a framework that achieves efficient reconstruction while embedding relational constraints within token sequences. NativeTok consists of: (1) a Meta Image Transformer (MIT) for latent image modeling, and (2) a Mixture of Causal Expert Transformer (MoCET), where each lightweight expert block generates a single token conditioned on prior tokens and latent features. We further design a Hierarchical Native Training strategy that updates only new expert blocks, ensuring training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NativeTok.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Neural Clothing Tryer (NCT) framework for Customized Virtual Try-ON (Cu-VTON), allowing garment superimposition on customizable models using diffusion models with semantic enhancement and control modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance virtual fitting experiences by enabling users to customize digital avatars' appearance, posture, and attributes beyond traditional VTON limitations.

Method: The NCT framework uses diffusion models with semantic enhancement and controlling modules to preserve garment semantics and details while enabling flexible editing of model attributes.

Result: Extensive experiments show NCT's superior performance in preserving garment details and enabling flexible customization.

Conclusion: The NCT framework effectively addresses Cu-VTON tasks, offering improved flexibility and engagement in virtual fitting experiences.

Abstract: This work aims to address a novel Customized Virtual Try-ON (Cu-VTON) task, enabling the superimposition of a specified garment onto a model that can be customized in terms of appearance, posture, and additional attributes. Compared with traditional VTON task, it enables users to tailor digital avatars to their individual preferences, thereby enhancing the virtual fitting experience with greater flexibility and engagement. To address this task, we introduce a Neural Clothing Tryer (NCT) framework, which exploits the advanced diffusion models equipped with semantic enhancement and controlling modules to better preserve semantic characterization and textural details of the garment and meanwhile facilitating the flexible editing of the model's postures and appearances. Specifically, NCT introduces a semantic-enhanced module to take semantic descriptions of garments and utilizes a visual-language encoder to learn aligned features across modalities. The aligned features are served as condition input to the diffusion model to enhance the preservation of the garment's semantics. Then, a semantic controlling module is designed to take the garment image, tailored posture image, and semantic description as input to maintain garment details while simultaneously editing model postures, expressions, and various attributes. Extensive experiments on the open available benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed NCT framework.

*Leonard Hackel,Tom Burgert,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RS FMs maintain high accuracy even when significantly slimmed down, contrasting with CV models, suggesting RS FMs enter redundancy at smaller scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine if RS FMs become overparameterized at smaller scales than CV models, leading to redundant representations.

Method: Post-hoc slimming of pretrained RS FMs tested on downstream tasks, comparing accuracy retention with CV models like MAE.

Result: RS FMs retain over 71% accuracy at 1% FLOPs, vs. less than 10% for CV models, supporting the hypothesis.

Conclusion: Post-hoc slimmability is effective for deploying RS FMs and challenges current scaling assumptions in the field.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models (FMs) in remote sensing (RS) are developed based on the paradigms established in computer vision (CV) and have shown promise for various Earth observation applications. However, the direct transfer of scaling assumptions from CV to RS has not been adequately examined. We hypothesize that RS FMs enter an overparameterized regime at substantially smaller scales than their CV counterparts, where increasing parameter count primarily induces redundant representations rather than qualitatively new abstractions. To test this hypothesis, we use post-hoc slimming, where we uniformly reduce the width of pretrained encoder, as a tool to measure representational redundancy across six state-of-the-art RS FMs on four downstream classification tasks. Our findings reveal a significant contrast with those in the CV domain: while a post-hoc slimmed masked autoencoder (MAE) trained on ImageNet retains less than 10% accuracy at 1% FLOPs, RS FMs maintain over 71% relative accuracy at the same budget. This sevenfold difference provides strong empirical support for our hypothesis. We further demonstrate that learned slimmable training can improve both Momentum Contrast (MoCo)- and MAE- based models. In addition, through the explained variance ratio and the feature correlation analysis, we provide mechanistic explanations showing that RS FMs distribute task-relevant information with high redundancy. Our findings establish post-hoc slimmability as both a practical deployment strategy for resource-constrained environments and a diagnostic tool that challenges the prevailing scaling paradigm in RS. Upon acceptance, we will publish all code.

*Siyi Du,Xinzhe Luo,Declan P. O'Regan,Chen Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyMo introduces an inference-time dynamic modality selection framework to address the discarding-imputation dilemma in multimodal deep learning by adaptively integrating reliable recovered modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing incomplete multimodal deep learning methods face the dilemma of discarding missing modalities (losing information) or recovering them (introducing noise). DyMo aims to overcome this by dynamically selecting reliable modalities.

Method: DyMo uses a novel selection algorithm to maximize task-relevant information, leveraging a theoretical connection between information and task loss. It includes a reward function for modality selection, a flexible network architecture, and a tailored training strategy.

Result: DyMo outperforms state-of-the-art methods on diverse datasets in various missing-data scenarios.

Conclusion: DyMo effectively resolves the discarding-imputation dilemma by dynamically integrating reliable modalities, enhancing performance in multimodal learning.

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning (MDL) has achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet its practical deployment is often hindered by incomplete multimodal data. Existing incomplete MDL methods either discard missing modalities, risking the loss of valuable task-relevant information, or recover them, potentially introducing irrelevant noise, leading to the discarding-imputation dilemma. To address this dilemma, in this paper, we propose DyMo, a new inference-time dynamic modality selection framework that adaptively identifies and integrates reliable recovered modalities, fully exploring task-relevant information beyond the conventional discard-or-impute paradigm. Central to DyMo is a novel selection algorithm that maximizes multimodal task-relevant information for each test sample. Since direct estimation of such information at test time is intractable due to the unknown data distribution, we theoretically establish a connection between information and the task loss, which we compute at inference time as a tractable proxy. Building on this, a novel principled reward function is proposed to guide modality selection. In addition, we design a flexible multimodal network architecture compatible with arbitrary modality combinations, alongside a tailored training strategy for robust representation learning. Extensive experiments on diverse natural and medical image datasets show that DyMo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete/dynamic MDL methods across various missing-data scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cost-effective, photorealistic ground-view reconstruction method using RGB images and NeRF, tailored for dense forest canopies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods (costly LiDAR or specialized thermal imaging) for mapping forest terrain and understory.

Method: Uses Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for 3D reconstruction, incorporates low light loss for poorly lit understory, and removes canopy occlusions via per-ray integration.

Result: Achieves promising person detection (comparable to thermal AOS) and demonstrates potential for forest inventory tasks like tree counting.

Conclusion: Proposed method offers a high-resolution, cost-effective alternative to specialized sensors for SAR and forest inventory.

Abstract: Mapping the terrain and understory hidden beneath dense forest canopies is of great interest for numerous applications such as search and rescue, trail mapping, forest inventory tasks, and more. Existing solutions rely on specialized sensors: either heavy, costly airborne LiDAR, or Airborne Optical Sectioning (AOS), which uses thermal synthetic aperture photography and is tailored for person detection.
  We introduce a novel approach for the reconstruction of canopy-free, photorealistic ground views using only conventional RGB images. Our solution is based on the celebrated Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a recent 3D reconstruction method. Additionally, we include specific image capture considerations, which dictate the needed illumination to successfully expose the scene beneath the canopy. To better cope with the poorly lit understory, we employ a low light loss. Finally, we propose two complementary approaches to remove occluding canopy elements by controlling per-ray integration procedure.
  To validate the value of our approach, we present two possible downstream tasks. For the task of search and rescue (SAR), we demonstrate that our method enables person detection which achieves promising results compared to thermal AOS (using only RGB images). Additionally, we show the potential of our approach for forest inventory tasks like tree counting. These results position our approach as a cost-effective, high-resolution alternative to specialized sensors for SAR, trail mapping, and forest-inventory tasks.

*Shashank Mishra,Didier Stricker,Jason Rambach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAAD-3K, a benchmark for contextual anomaly detection in visual data, and proposes a conditional compatibility learning framework leveraging vision-language representations for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anomaly detection assumes anomalies are intrinsic, but real-world anomalies often depend on context (e.g., running on a highway vs. a track). This work revisits contextual anomaly detection to address context-dependent abnormality.

Method: The authors operationalize contextual anomaly detection in the visual domain, introducing CAAD-3K as a benchmark. They propose a conditional compatibility learning framework using vision-language representations to model subject-context relationships with limited supervision.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches on CAAD-3K and achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets, showing that modeling context dependence enhances traditional anomaly detection.

Conclusion: Contextual anomaly detection improves traditional methods by incorporating subject-context compatibility, demonstrated through the success of the proposed framework on CAAD-3K and other benchmarks.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is often formulated under the assumption that abnormality is an intrinsic property of an observation, independent of context. This assumption breaks down in many real-world settings, where the same object or action may be normal or anomalous depending on latent contextual factors (e.g., running on a track versus on a highway). We revisit \emph{contextual anomaly detection}, classically defined as context-dependent abnormality, and operationalize it in the visual domain, where anomaly labels depend on subject--context compatibility rather than intrinsic appearance. To enable systematic study of this setting, we introduce CAAD-3K, a benchmark that isolates contextual anomalies by controlling subject identity while varying context. We further propose a conditional compatibility learning framework that leverages vision--language representations to model subject--context relationships under limited supervision. Our method substantially outperforms existing approaches on CAAD-3K and achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec-AD and VisA, demonstrating that modeling context dependence complements traditional structural anomaly detection. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

TL;DR: DINO-SAE improves generative autoencoder performance by addressing reconstruction fidelity loss with hierarchical embeddings and cosine similarity alignment, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-1K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using pretrained VFMs lose high-frequency details, limiting reconstruction fidelity.

Method: DINO-SAE uses hierarchical convolutional patch embedding, cosine similarity alignment, and Riemannian Flow Matching for a Diffusion Transformer on a spherical latent manifold.

Result: Achieves 0.37 rFID, 26.2 dB PSNR, and 3.47 gFID at 80 epochs on ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: DINO-SAE bridges semantic representation and pixel-level reconstruction, maintaining semantic alignment while enhancing detail retention.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored using pretrained Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) such as DINO for generative autoencoders, showing strong generative performance. Unfortunately, existing approaches often suffer from limited reconstruction fidelity due to the loss of high-frequency details. In this work, we present the DINO Spherical Autoencoder (DINO-SAE), a framework that bridges semantic representation and pixel-level reconstruction. Our key insight is that semantic information in contrastive representations is primarily encoded in the direction of feature vectors, while forcing strict magnitude matching can hinder the encoder from preserving fine-grained details. To address this, we introduce Hierarchical Convolutional Patch Embedding module that enhances local structure and texture preservation, and Cosine Similarity Alignment objective that enforces semantic consistency while allowing flexible feature magnitudes for detail retention. Furthermore, leveraging the observation that SSL-based foundation model representations intrinsically lie on a hypersphere, we employ Riemannian Flow Matching to train a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly on this spherical latent manifold. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, reaching 0.37 rFID and 26.2 dB PSNR, while maintaining strong semantic alignment to the pretrained VFM. Notably, our Riemannian Flow Matching-based DiT exhibits efficient convergence, achieving a gFID of 3.47 at 80 epochs.

*Anindya Sundar Das,Monowar Bhuyan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a robust anomaly detection framework integrating limited anomaly supervision and adaptive deviation learning for improved detection and localization despite data contamination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle due to reliance on purely normal data and lack of anomaly labels, leading to weak performance in real-world contaminated datasets.

Method: Combines deviation score, entropy-based uncertainty score, and segmentation-based score into a composite anomaly score. Uses adaptive instance weighting to handle contamination.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on MVTec and VisA benchmarks, showing strong detection, localization, interpretability, and robustness.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering reliable performance in practical industrial settings.

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection in real-world industrial settings faces two major limitations. First, most existing methods are trained on purely normal data or on unlabeled datasets assumed to be predominantly normal, presuming the absence of contamination, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in practice. Second, they assume no access to labeled anomaly samples, limiting the model from learning discriminative characteristics of true anomalies. Therefore, these approaches often struggle to distinguish anomalies from normal instances, resulting in reduced detection and weak localization performance. In real-world applications, where training data are frequently contaminated with anomalies, such methods fail to deliver reliable performance. In this work, we propose a robust anomaly detection framework that integrates limited anomaly supervision into the adaptive deviation learning paradigm. We introduce a composite anomaly score that combines three complementary components: a deviation score capturing statistical irregularity, an entropy-based uncertainty score reflecting predictive inconsistency, and a segmentation-based score highlighting spatial abnormality. This unified scoring mechanism enables accurate detection and supports gradient-based localization, providing intuitive and explainable visual evidence of anomalous regions. Following the few-anomaly paradigm, we incorporate a small set of labeled anomalies during training while simultaneously mitigating the influence of contaminated samples through adaptive instance weighting. Extensive experiments on the MVTec and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves strong detection and localization performance, interpretability, and robustness under various levels of data contamination.

TL;DR: This study evaluates computer vision-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) for distance sampling in great ape conservation, showing it as a viable alternative to manual methods despite biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce labor-intensive manual distance measurements in camera trap workflows for estimating great ape population density and abundance.

Method: Combines two MDE models (DPT and Depth Anything) with distance sampling strategies on 220 chimpanzee camera trap videos, comparing results to manual ground-truth distances.

Result: Calibrated DPT outperforms Depth Anything in accuracy but both models overestimate distances and underestimate density. MDE-driven estimates are within 22% of traditional methods.

Conclusion: MDE-based distance sampling is practical for great ape conservation, though limitations like detection failures and biases need addressing.

Abstract: The estimation of abundance and density in unmarked populations of great apes relies on statistical frameworks that require animal-to-camera distance measurements. In practice, acquiring these distances depends on labour-intensive manual interpretation of animal observations across large camera trap video corpora. This study introduces and evaluates an only sparsely explored alternative: the integration of computer vision-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) pipelines directly into ecological camera trap workflows for great ape conservation. Using a real-world dataset of 220 camera trap videos documenting a wild chimpanzee population, we combine two MDE models, Dense Prediction Transformers and Depth Anything, with multiple distance sampling strategies. These components are used to generate detection distance estimates, from which population density and abundance are inferred. Comparative analysis against manually derived ground-truth distances shows that calibrated DPT consistently outperforms Depth Anything. This advantage is observed in both distance estimation accuracy and downstream density and abundance inference. Nevertheless, both models exhibit systematic biases. We show that, given complex forest environments, they tend to overestimate detection distances and consequently underestimate density and abundance relative to conventional manual approaches. We further find that failures in animal detection across distance ranges are a primary factor limiting estimation accuracy. Overall, this work provides a case study that shows MDE-driven camera trap distance sampling is a viable and practical alternative to manual distance estimation. The proposed approach yields population estimates within 22% of those obtained using traditional methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Q-Hawkeye, an RL-based framework addressing reliability limitations in IQA by optimizing uncertainty-aware and perception-aware methods. It outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based IQA methods lack reliability due to uniform advantage weighting and inadequate visual perception grounding. The paper aims to improve this.

Method: Q-Hawkeye uses Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Optimization and Perception-Aware Optimization to stabilize policy updates and enhance visual grounding.

Result: The framework achieves superior performance and generalization across datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Q-Hawkeye addresses key reliability issues in IQA, demonstrating effectiveness and potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) predicts perceptual quality scores consistent with human judgments. Recent RL-based IQA methods built on MLLMs focus on generating visual quality descriptions and scores, ignoring two key reliability limitations: (i) although the model's prediction stability varies significantly across training samples, existing GRPO-based methods apply uniform advantage weighting, thereby amplifying noisy signals from unstable samples in gradient updates; (ii) most works emphasize text-grounded reasoning over images while overlooking the model's visual perception ability of image content. In this paper, we propose Q-Hawkeye, an RL-based reliable visual policy optimization framework that redesigns the learning signal through unified Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Optimization and Perception-Aware Optimization. Q-Hawkeye estimates predictive uncertainty using the variance of predicted scores across multiple rollouts and leverages this uncertainty to reweight each sample's update strength, stabilizing policy optimization. To strengthen perceptual reliability, we construct paired inputs of degraded images and their original images and introduce an Implicit Perception Loss that constrains the model to ground its quality judgments in genuine visual evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Hawkeye outperforms state-of-the-art methods and generalizes better across multiple datasets. The code and models will be made available.

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that image embeddings pose limited privacy risk by introducing SLImE, a framework that reveals semantic information from compressed embeddings through preserved neighborhood structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose the vulnerability of image embeddings by showing that semantic leakage can occur without exact image reconstruction, leveraging preserved semantic neighborhoods.

Method: Propose SLImE, a lightweight inference framework combining locally trained semantic retrievers with off-the-shelf models to recover semantic information from embeddings.

Result: Empirically validated recovery of semantic information (tags, symbolic representations, descriptions) across various embedding models (GEMINI, COHERE, NOMIC, CLIP).

Conclusion: The study reveals a fundamental vulnerability in image embeddings due to semantic neighborhood preservation, posing challenges for privacy preservation.

Abstract: Image embeddings are generally assumed to pose limited privacy risk. We challenge this assumption by formalizing semantic leakage as the ability to recover semantic structures from compressed image embeddings. Surprisingly, we show that semantic leakage does not require exact reconstruction of the original image. Preserving local semantic neighborhoods under embedding alignment is sufficient to expose the intrinsic vulnerability of image embeddings. Crucially, this preserved neighborhood structure allows semantic information to propagate through a sequence of lossy mappings. Based on this conjecture, we propose Semantic Leakage from Image Embeddings (SLImE), a lightweight inference framework that reveals semantic information from standalone compressed image embeddings, incorporating a locally trained semantic retriever with off-the-shelf models, without training task-specific decoders. We thoroughly validate each step of the framework empirically, from aligned embeddings to retrieved tags, symbolic representations, and grammatical and coherent descriptions. We evaluate SLImE across a range of open and closed embedding models, including GEMINI, COHERE, NOMIC, and CLIP, and demonstrate consistent recovery of semantic information across diverse inference tasks. Our results reveal a fundamental vulnerability in image embeddings, whereby the preservation of semantic neighborhoods under alignment enables semantic leakage, highlighting challenges for privacy preservation.1

*Anmin Wang,Nan Zhang,Wei Tao,Xiaoyang Qu,Guokuan Li,Jiguang Wan,Jianzong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Triage is a training-free framework addressing computational challenges in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for video processing by hierarchical visual budgeting (keyframes and tokens), improving speed and memory efficiency without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with long token sequences due to video data redundancy, causing computational inefficiency.

Method: Hierarchical budgeting: Frame-Level for keyframes, Token-Level for Core/Context Tokens using MMR.

Result: Enhanced speed, reduced memory usage, maintaining/surpassing baseline performance.

Conclusion: Triage is an efficient plug-and-play solution for VLMs in video reasoning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face significant computational challenges in video processing due to massive data redundancy, which creates prohibitively long token sequences. To address this, we introduce Triage, a training-free, plug-and-play framework that reframes video reasoning as a resource allocation problem via hierarchical visual budgeting. Its first stage, Frame-Level Budgeting, identifies keyframes by evaluating their visual dynamics and relevance, generating a strategic prior based on their importance scores. Guided by this prior, the second stage, Token-Level Budgeting, allocates tokens in two phases: it first secures high-relevance Core Tokens, followed by diverse Context Tokens selected with an efficient batched Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Triage improves inference speed and reduces memory footprint, while maintaining or surpassing the performance of baselines and other methods on various video reasoning benchmarks.

*Dennis Sprute,Hanna Senke,Holger Flatt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using generative AI (GenAI) to address imbalanced datasets in optical quality control, finding Stable Diffusion improves segmentation performance by 4.6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced datasets (few defective parts) hinder supervised ML in optical quality control. Existing methods like specialized loss functions or data augmentation have limitations.

Method: Investigates Stable Diffusion and CycleGAN for dataset expansion in thermal image segmentation of combine harvester components.

Result: Stable Diffusion boosts segmentation performance by 4.6%, achieving Mean IoU of 84.6%.

Conclusion: Generative AI, particularly Stable Diffusion, effectively enhances supervised ML performance in industrial quality control.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning algorithms play a crucial role in optical quality control within industrial production. These approaches require representative datasets for effective model training. However, while non-defective components are frequent, defective parts are rare in production, resulting in highly imbalanced datasets that adversely impact model performance. Existing strategies to address this challenge, such as specialized loss functions or traditional data augmentation techniques, have limitations, including the need for careful hyperparameter tuning or the alteration of only simple image features. Therefore, this work explores the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) as an alternative method for expanding limited datasets and enhancing supervised machine learning performance. Specifically, we investigate Stable Diffusion and CycleGAN as image generation models, focusing on the segmentation of combine harvester components in thermal images for subsequent defect detection. Our results demonstrate that dataset expansion using Stable Diffusion yields the most significant improvement, enhancing segmentation performance by 4.6 %, resulting in a Mean Intersection over Union (Mean IoU) of 84.6 %.

### [66] [About an Automating Annotation Method for Robot Markers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22982)
*Wataru Uemura,Takeru Nagashima*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automated annotation method for training deep-learning models on ArUco marker images, eliminating manual labeling by leveraging ArUco's built-in recognition. A YOLO-based model trained on this data shows improved recognition performance under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for deep-learning models is time-consuming and inconsistent. ArUco markers provide built-in recognition, enabling automated annotation to address these challenges.

Method: The method uses ArUco marker detection results for automatic annotation, trains a YOLO-based model on this dataset, and evaluates its performance against conventional techniques.

Result: The YOLO-based model outperforms traditional image-processing methods, especially under blur or defocus, while reducing human effort and improving labeling consistency.

Conclusion: Automated annotation using ArUco markers effectively enhances deep-learning model training, with potential for further optimization via confidence threshold studies.

Abstract: Factory automation has become increasingly important due to labor shortages, leading to the introduction of autonomous mobile robots for tasks such as material transportation. Markers are commonly used for robot self-localization and object identification. In the RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL), ArUco markers are employed both for robot localization and for identifying processing modules. Conventional recognition relies on OpenCV-based image processing, which detects black-and-white marker patterns. However, these methods often fail under noise, motion blur, defocus, or varying illumination conditions. Deep-learning-based recognition offers improved robustness under such conditions, but requires large amounts of annotated data. Annotation must typically be done manually, as the type and position of objects cannot be detected automatically, making dataset preparation a major bottleneck. In contrast, ArUco markers include built-in recognition modules that provide both ID and positional information, enabling automatic annotation. This paper proposes an automated annotation method for training deep-learning models on ArUco marker images. By leveraging marker detection results obtained from the ArUco module, the proposed approach eliminates the need for manual labeling. A YOLO-based model is trained using the automatically annotated dataset, and its performance is evaluated under various conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves recognition performance compared with conventional image-processing techniques, particularly for images affected by blur or defocus. Automatic annotation also reduces human effort and ensures consistent labeling quality. Future work will investigate the relationship between confidence thresholds and recognition performance.

*Yinsong Wang,Thomas Fletcher,Xinzhe Luo,Aine Travers Dineen,Rhodri Cusack,Chen Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaussianSVR is a self-supervised framework for high-fidelity fetal MR slice-to-volume reconstruction, eliminating the need for ground-truth data and improving efficiency with multi-resolution training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) methods are time-consuming and require ground-truth data for learning-based approaches, which are impractical. GaussianSVR aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: The method uses 3D Gaussian representations for reconstruction and employs a simulated slice acquisition model for self-supervised training. A multi-resolution strategy optimizes Gaussian parameters and transformations.

Result: GaussianSVR outperforms baseline methods in fetal MR volumetric reconstruction, demonstrating higher accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: GaussianSVR provides an effective, self-supervised solution for high-fidelity fetal MR reconstruction without relying on ground-truth volumes.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D fetal MR volumes from motion-corrupted stacks of 2D slices is a crucial and challenging task. Conventional slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) methods are time-consuming and require multiple orthogonal stacks for reconstruction. While learning-based SVR approaches have significantly reduced the time required at the inference stage, they heavily rely on ground truth information for training, which is inaccessible in practice. To address these challenges, we propose GaussianSVR, a self-supervised framework for slice-to-volume reconstruction. GaussianSVR represents the target volume using 3D Gaussian representations to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. It leverages a simulated forward slice acquisition model to enable self-supervised training, alleviating the need for ground-truth volumes. Furthermore, to enhance both accuracy and efficiency, we introduce a multi-resolution training strategy that jointly optimizes Gaussian parameters and spatial transformations across different resolution levels. Experiments show that GaussianSVR outperforms the baseline methods on fetal MR volumetric reconstruction. Code will be available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to improve calibration in deep learning-based object detectors for microscopy imaging by using multi-rater annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object detectors lack reliable confidence estimates, which limits their trustworthiness for biomedical applications.

Method: Separate models are trained on annotations from individual experts, and their predictions are aggregated to emulate consensus, capturing inter-rater variability more effectively.

Result: Experiments on colorectal organoid data show improved calibration without sacrificing detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling rater disagreement enhances the reliability of object detectors in biomedical imaging.

Abstract: Deep learning-based object detectors have achieved impressive performance in microscopy imaging, yet their confidence estimates often lack calibration, limiting their reliability for biomedical applications. In this work, we introduce a new approach to improve model calibration by leveraging multi-rater annotations. We propose to train separate models on the annotations from single experts and aggregate their predictions to emulate consensus. This improves upon label sampling strategies, where models are trained on mixed annotations, and offers a more principled way to capture inter-rater variability. Experiments on a colorectal organoid dataset annotated by two experts demonstrate that our rater-specific ensemble strategy improves calibration performance while maintaining comparable detection accuracy. These findings suggest that explicitly modelling rater disagreement can lead to more trustworthy object detectors in biomedical imaging.

### [69] [One-shot Optimized Steering Vector for Hallucination Mitigation for VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23041)
*Youxu Shi,Suorong Yang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OSGA proposes a one-shot steering framework for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to mitigate hallucination and safety issues efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with hallucination and safety failures. Steering improves performance, but existing methods lack efficiency and generalization.

Method: OSGA selects an informative sample, learns a universal steering vector using contrastive objective with generative anchor regularization, and applies it during inference.

Result: OSGA consistently enhances hallucination mitigation and safety with minimal overhead across benchmarks.

Conclusion: OSGA offers a practical, scalable solution for reliable VLMs through one-shot steering.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks but still suffer from hallucination and safety-related failures that persist even at scale. Steering offers a lightweight technique to improve model performance. However, steering, whether input-dependent or input-independent, achieves a meaningful trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, we observe that steering vectors can generalize across inputs when tasks share aligned semantic intent. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{OSGA} (\textbf{O}ne-shot \textbf{S}teering with \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}nchor), an input-independent framework that improves model performance with a single optimization instance. OSGA first selects an informative sample via a variance-based data selection strategy and learns a single steering vector with a contrastive objective with generative anchor regularization. The resulting vector can be universally applied at a certain layer during inference time without modifying model parameters. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that a single OSGA-optimized steering vector consistently improves hallucination mitigation and safety enhancement with negligible overhead, highlighting one-shot steering as a practical and scalable solution for reliable VLMs.

*Hari Krishna Gadi,Daniel Matos,Hongyi Luo,Lu Liu,Yongliang Wang,Yanfeng Zhang,Liqiu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical, entity-centric geolocation method using Hyperbolic space embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art results with fewer embeddings and improved accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual geolocalization is challenging due to global scale, visual ambiguity, and geographic hierarchy. Current methods have limitations like large storage needs or poor fine detail handling.

Method: Proposes Geo-Weighted Hyperbolic contrastive learning, aligning images to geographic entities (country, region, subregion, city) in Hyperbolic space, incorporating haversine distance for better accuracy.

Result: Achieves a 19.5% reduction in mean geodesic error and 43% improvement in fine-grained subregion accuracy on the OSV5M benchmark, using only 240k entity embeddings instead of 5 million image embeddings.

Conclusion: Geometry-aware hierarchical embeddings offer a scalable and innovative solution for global image geolocation, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Visual geolocalization, the task of predicting where an image was taken, remains challenging due to global scale, visual ambiguity, and the inherently hierarchical structure of geography. Existing paradigms rely on either large-scale retrieval, which requires storing a large number of image embeddings, grid-based classifiers that ignore geographic continuity, or generative models that diffuse over space but struggle with fine detail. We introduce an entity-centric formulation of geolocation that replaces image-to-image retrieval with a compact hierarchy of geographic entities embedded in Hyperbolic space. Images are aligned directly to country, region, subregion, and city entities through Geo-Weighted Hyperbolic contrastive learning by directly incorporating haversine distance into the contrastive objective. This hierarchical design enables interpretable predictions and efficient inference with 240k entity embeddings instead of over 5 million image embeddings on the OSV5M benchmark, on which our method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance. Compared to the current methods in the literature, it reduces mean geodesic error by 19.5\%, while improving the fine-grained subregion accuracy by 43%. These results demonstrate that geometry-aware hierarchical embeddings provide a scalable and conceptually new alternative for global image geolocation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSA is a transferable attack framework for point clouds that operates in a low-dimensional semantic space, improving adversarial transferability by optimizing perturbations within a shared subspace and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks on point clouds rely on model-specific gradients or heuristics, limiting their generalization to unseen architectures.

Method: CoSA represents point clouds as combinations of class-specific prototypes in a low-dimensional semantic space and optimizes adversarial perturbations within a low-rank subspace to ensure coherent and architecture-agnostic variations.

Result: CoSA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art transferable attacks across multiple datasets and network architectures while maintaining imperceptibility and robustness under defenses.

Conclusion: CoSA's design of operating within a shared semantic subspace improves adversarial transferability without relying on surrogate-specific artifacts, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Transferable adversarial attacks on point clouds remain challenging, as existing methods often rely on model-specific gradients or heuristics that limit generalization to unseen architectures. In this paper, we rethink adversarial transferability from a compact subspace perspective and propose CoSA, a transferable attack framework that operates within a shared low-dimensional semantic space. Specifically, each point cloud is represented as a compact combination of class-specific prototypes that capture shared semantic structure, while adversarial perturbations are optimized within a low-rank subspace to induce coherent and architecture-agnostic variations. This design suppresses model-dependent noise and constrains perturbations to semantically meaningful directions, thereby improving cross-model transferability without relying on surrogate-specific artifacts. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and network architectures demonstrate that CoSA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art transferable attacks, while maintaining competitive imperceptibility and robustness under common defense strategies. Codes will be made public upon paper acceptance.

*Ilir Tahiraj,Peter Wittal,Markus Lienkamp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowCalib is a novel framework for detecting LiDAR-to-vehicle misalignment by analyzing scene flow from static objects, eliminating the need for extra sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods overlook individual sensor miscalibration, which causes sensor-to-sensor errors, posing safety risks in autonomous driving.

Method: FlowCalib uses motion cues from scene flow, integrates a neural scene flow prior, and employs a dual-branch detection network combining learned and handcrafted features.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes show FlowCalib effectively detects miscalibration, setting a benchmark for sensor-to-vehicle alignment.

Conclusion: FlowCalib addresses a critical gap in autonomous driving by providing a robust method for detecting LiDAR-to-vehicle misalignment using scene flow.

Abstract: Accurate sensor-to-vehicle calibration is essential for safe autonomous driving. Angular misalignments of LiDAR sensors can lead to safety-critical issues during autonomous operation. However, current methods primarily focus on correcting sensor-to-sensor errors without considering the miscalibration of individual sensors that cause these errors in the first place. We introduce FlowCalib, the first framework that detects LiDAR-to-vehicle miscalibration using motion cues from the scene flow of static objects. Our approach leverages the systematic bias induced by rotational misalignment in the flow field generated from sequential 3D point clouds, eliminating the need for additional sensors. The architecture integrates a neural scene flow prior for flow estimation and incorporates a dual-branch detection network that fuses learned global flow features with handcrafted geometric descriptors. These combined representations allow the system to perform two complementary binary classification tasks: a global binary decision indicating whether misalignment is present and separate, axis-specific binary decisions indicating whether each rotational axis is misaligned. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate FlowCalib's ability to robustly detect miscalibration, establishing a benchmark for sensor-to-vehicle miscalibration detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap in event sensor studies by enabling open-vocabulary semantic understanding at multiple granularities.

Method: Introduces SEAL, a parameter-efficient architecture for event segmentation and open-vocabulary mask classification.

Result: Outperforms baselines in performance and inference speed, validated on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: SEAL advances event sensor understanding and offers a versatile solution for OV-EIS.

Abstract: Scene understanding with free-form language has been widely explored within diverse modalities such as images, point clouds, and LiDAR. However, related studies on event sensors are scarce or narrowly centered on semantic-level understanding. We introduce SEAL, the first Semantic-aware Segment Any Events framework that addresses Open-Vocabulary Event Instance Segmentation (OV-EIS). Given the visual prompt, our model presents a unified framework to support both event segmentation and open-vocabulary mask classification at multiple levels of granularity, including instance-level and part-level. To enable thorough evaluation on OV-EIS, we curate four benchmarks that cover label granularity from coarse to fine class configurations and semantic granularity from instance-level to part-level understanding. Extensive experiments show that our SEAL largely outperforms proposed baselines in terms of performance and inference speed with a parameter-efficient architecture. In the Appendix, we further present a simple variant of our SEAL achieving generic spatiotemporal OV-EIS that does not require any visual prompts from users in the inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video relighting has creative and commercial potential but faces challenges like flickering, detail degradation, and missing evaluation metrics.

Method: Hi-Light uses lightness prior guided relighting diffusion, a motion-adaptive smoothing filter, and LAB-based detail fusion to stabilize and enhance relit videos.

Result: Hi-Light outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing stable, detailed relit videos, validated by the new Light Stability Score.

Conclusion: Hi-Light effectively solves key video relighting challenges, demonstrating superior performance and introducing a novel evaluation metric.

Abstract: Video relighting offers immense creative potential and commercial value but is hindered by challenges, including the absence of an adequate evaluation metric, severe light flickering, and the degradation of fine-grained details during editing. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hi-Light, a novel, training-free framework for high-fidelity, high-resolution, robust video relighting. Our approach introduces three technical innovations: lightness prior anchored guided relighting diffusion that stabilises intermediate relit video, a Hybrid Motion-Adaptive Lighting Smoothing Filter that leverages optical flow to ensure temporal stability without introducing motion blur, and a LAB-based Detail Fusion module that preserves high-frequency detail information from the original video. Furthermore, to address the critical gap in evaluation, we propose the Light Stability Score, the first quantitative metric designed to specifically measure lighting consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hi-Light significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons, producing stable, highly detailed relit videos.

*Anglin Liu,Ruichao Chen,Yi Lu,Hongxia Xu,Jintai Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Med-Scout addresses geometric blindness in MLLMs for medical diagnosis using RL and proxy tasks, improving accuracy by 40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack geometric grounding, leading to factual errors despite linguistic fluency.

Method: Introduces Med-Scout, a framework using RL and three proxy tasks (Hierarchical Scale Localization, Topological Jigsaw Reconstruction, Anomaly Consistency Detection) to derive supervision from unlabeled images.

Result: Med-Scout improves geometric perception by over 40% on Med-Scout-Bench and enhances broader medical VQA performance.

Conclusion: Med-Scout effectively mitigates geometric blindness in MLLMs, improving diagnostic accuracy without costly annotations.

Abstract: Despite recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)' linguistic prowess in medical diagnosis, we find even state-of-the-art MLLMs suffer from a critical perceptual deficit: geometric blindness. This failure to ground outputs in objective geometric constraints leads to plausible yet factually incorrect hallucinations, rooted in training paradigms that prioritize linguistic fluency over geometric fidelity. This paper introduces Med-Scout, a novel framework that "cures" this blindness via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that leverages the intrinsic geometric logic latent within unlabeled medical images. Instead of relying on costly expert annotations, Med-Scout derives verifiable supervision signals through three strategic proxy tasks: Hierarchical Scale Localization, Topological Jigsaw Reconstruction, and Anomaly Consistency Detection. To rigorously quantify this deficit, we present Med-Scout-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate geometric perception. Extensive evaluations show that Med-Scout significantly mitigates geometric blindness, outperforming leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs by over 40% on our benchmark. Furthermore, this enhanced geometric perception generalizes to broader medical understanding, achieving superior results on radiological and comprehensive medical VQA tasks.

*Hamza Kalisch,Constantin Seibold,Jens Kleesiek,Ken Herrmann,Frederic Jonske*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Region-Normalized DPO (RN-DPO) for medical image segmentation using noisy quality-control signals, improving stability and performance over standard DPO without extra annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense pixel-wise annotations are costly, prompting the use of automatic QC signals for model training. However, these signals can be noisy, leading to harmful updates during preference-based fine-tuning.

Method: The study uses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with noisy judges and proposes RN-DPO, which normalizes updates by disagreement region size to reduce harmful comparisons.

Result: RN-DPO outperforms standard DPO and baselines across medical datasets, enhancing sustained performance and stability without additional annotations.

Conclusion: RN-DPO is an effective solution for preference-based fine-tuning in medical image segmentation, addressing noise and bias in QC signals.

Abstract: While dense pixel-wise annotations remain the gold standard for medical image segmentation, they are costly to obtain and limit scalability. In contrast, many deployed systems already produce inexpensive automatic quality-control (QC) signals like model agreement, uncertainty measures, or learned mask-quality scores which can be used for further model training without additional ground-truth annotation. However, these signals can be noisy and biased, making preference-based fine-tuning susceptible to harmful updates. We study Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for segmentation from such noisy judges using proposals generated by a supervised base segmenter trained on a small labeled set. We find that outcomes depend strongly on how preference pairs are mined: selecting the judge's top-ranked proposal can improve peak performance when the judge is reliable, but can amplify harmful errors under weaker judges. We propose Region-Normalized DPO (RN-DPO), a segmentation-aware objective which normalizes preference updates by the size of the disagreement region between masks, reducing the leverage of harmful comparisons and improving optimization stability. Across two medical datasets and multiple regimes, RN-DPO improves sustained performance and stabilizes preference-based fine-tuning, outperforming standard DPO and strong baselines without requiring additional pixel annotations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations of uniform sampling and single-turn inference in existing models to identify sparse critical evidence in long videos.

Method: Uses Task-Decoupled Attention Masking and Verifiable Trajectory-Guided Reward for efficient multi-turn interactions, trained with Seeker-173K dataset.

Result: Achieves 72.1% accuracy on MLVU and 46.5% on Video-Holmes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Video-o3 demonstrates strong evidence-seeking and reasoning capabilities, validating native tool invocation effectiveness for long-video understanding.

Abstract: Existing multimodal large language models for long-video understanding predominantly rely on uniform sampling and single-turn inference, limiting their ability to identify sparse yet critical evidence amid extensive redundancy. We introduce Video-o3, a novel framework that supports iterative discovery of salient visual clues, fine-grained inspection of key segments, and adaptive termination once sufficient evidence is acquired. Technically, we address two core challenges in interleaved tool invocation. First, to mitigate attention dispersion induced by the heterogeneity of reasoning and tool-calling, we propose Task-Decoupled Attention Masking, which isolates per-step concentration while preserving shared global context. Second, to control context length growth in multi-turn interactions, we introduce a Verifiable Trajectory-Guided Reward that balances exploration coverage with reasoning efficiency. To support training at scale, we further develop a data synthesis pipeline and construct Seeker-173K, comprising 173K high-quality tool-interaction trajectories for effective supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments show that Video-o3 substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 72.1% accuracy on MLVU and 46.5% on Video-Holmes. These results demonstrate Video-o3's strong multi-hop evidence-seeking and reasoning capabilities, and validate the effectiveness of native tool invocation in long-video scenarios.

TL;DR: ShotFinder introduces a benchmark for open-domain video shot retrieval with five constraints and proposes a three-stage retrieval pipeline, highlighting gaps in current LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on LLMs focuses on text or static multimodal settings, leaving open-domain video shot retrieval—involving temporal structure and complex semantics—understudied.

Method: ShotFinder formalizes editing requirements as keyframe-oriented shot descriptions with five constraints, curates 1,210 YouTube samples, and proposes a three-stage retrieval pipeline: query expansion, candidate retrieval, and temporal localization.

Result: Experiments show a significant performance gap between models and humans, with temporal localization being more tractable than color and visual style constraints.

Conclusion: Open-domain video shot retrieval remains a challenge for multimodal LLMs, underscoring the need for further advancements.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in information retrieval, yet existing research has mainly focused on text or static multimodal settings. Open-domain video shot retrieval, which involves richer temporal structure and more complex semantics, still lacks systematic benchmarks and analysis. To fill this gap, we introduce ShotFinder, a benchmark that formalizes editing requirements as keyframe-oriented shot descriptions and introduces five types of controllable single-factor constraints: Temporal order, Color, Visual style, Audio, and Resolution. We curate 1,210 high-quality samples from YouTube across 20 thematic categories, using large models for generation with human verification. Based on the benchmark, we propose ShotFinder, a text-driven three-stage retrieval and localization pipeline: (1) query expansion via video imagination, (2) candidate video retrieval with a search engine, and (3) description-guided temporal localization. Experiments on multiple closed-source and open-source models reveal a significant gap to human performance, with clear imbalance across constraints: temporal localization is relatively tractable, while color and visual style remain major challenges. These results reveal that open-domain video shot retrieval is still a critical capability that multimodal large models have yet to overcome.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in VLMs' ability to perform simple reasoning tasks by leveraging pedagogically-structured educational videos.

Method: Fine-tunes Qwen2 and Qwen3 using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on 38 hours of Dora the Explorer content.

Result: Achieves 8-14 point improvements on DoraVQA, 86.16% on CVBench, and shows strong transfer to Video-MME and NExT-QA.

Conclusion: Structured educational content enhances VLM reasoning, proving content structure is as crucial as scale for multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on standard video understanding benchmarks yet fail systematically on simple reasoning tasks that preschool children can solve, including counting, spatial reasoning, and compositional understanding. We hypothesize that the pedagogically-structured content of educational videos provides an ideal training signal for improving these capabilities. We introduce DoraVQA, a dataset of 5,344 question-answer pairs automatically extracted from 8 seasons of Dora the Explorer with precise timestamp alignment. Each episode follows a consistent \textit{context-question-pause-answer} structure that creates a self-contained learning environment analogous to interactive tutoring. We fine-tune both Qwen2 and Qwen3 using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), leveraging the clear correctness signals and structured reasoning traces inherent in educational content. Despite training exclusively on 38 hours of children's educational videos, our approach achieves improvements of 8-14 points on DoraVQA and state-of-the-art 86.16\% on CVBench, with strong transfer to Video-MME and NExT-QA, demonstrating effective generalization from narrow pedagogical content to broad multimodal understanding. Through cross-domain benchmarks, we show that VLMs can perform tasks that require robust reasoning learned from structured educational content, suggesting that content structure matters as much as content scale.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaTa is a training-free test-time adaptation method for vision-language models, using Brownian Distance Covariance to improve efficiency and performance under domain shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing performance degradation of vision-language models under domain shift and overcoming the computational intensity and modality limitations of existing methods.

Method: Leverages Brownian Distance Covariance for dynamic adaptation without training or back-propagation, incorporates attribute-enhanced prompting, and uses dynamic clustering and pseudo-label refinement.

Result: Significantly reduces computational cost while achieving state-of-the-art performance in domain and cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: TaTa offers an efficient and stable solution for adapting vision-language models to new domains without disruptive weight updates.

Abstract: Vision-language models suffer performance degradation under domain shift, limiting real-world applicability. Existing test-time adaptation methods are computationally intensive, rely on back-propagation, and often focus on single modalities. To address these issues, we propose Training-free Test-Time Adaptation with Brownian Distance Covariance (TaTa). TaTa leverages Brownian Distance Covariance-a powerful statistical measure that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies via pairwise distances-to dynamically adapt VLMs to new domains without training or back-propagation. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances stability by avoiding disruptive weight updates. TaTa further integrates attribute-enhanced prompting to improve vision-language inference with descriptive visual cues. Combined with dynamic clustering and pseudo-label refinement, it effectively recalibrates the model for novel visual contexts. Experiments across diverse datasets show that TaTa significantly reduces computational cost while achieving state-of-the-art performance in domain and cross-dataset generalization.

*Junfeng Lin,Yanming Xiu,Maria Gorlatova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates OSOD models GroundingDINO and YOLO-E under diverse user prompting behaviors in XR settings, finding stable performance under standard/underdetailed prompts but degradation under ambiguity. Prompt enhancement significantly improves robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how OSOD models perform under realistic, varied user prompts in interactive XR environments, addressing gaps in current benchmarks.

Method: Evaluate OSOD models on real-world XR images, simulating diverse prompting behaviors (standard, underdetailed, overdetailed, ambiguous) and testing enhancement strategies.

Result: Models show stability under standard/underdetailed prompts but degrade under ambiguity. Overdetailed prompts affect GroundingDINO. Prompt enhancement boosts robustness (+55% mIoU, +41% confidence).

Conclusion: Proposes strategies and enhancements for OSOD models in XR, highlighting prompt robustness as critical for practical deployment.

Abstract: Open-set object detection (OSOD) localizes objects while identifying and rejecting unknown classes at inference. While recent OSOD models perform well on benchmarks, their behavior under realistic user prompting remains underexplored. In interactive XR settings, user-generated prompts are often ambiguous, underspecified, or overly detailed. To study prompt-conditioned robustness, we evaluate two OSOD models, GroundingDINO and YOLO-E, on real-world XR images and simulate diverse user prompting behaviors using vision-language models. We consider four prompt types: standard, underdetailed, overdetailed, and pragmatically ambiguous, and examine the impact of two enhancement strategies on these prompts. Results show that both models exhibit stable performance under underdetailed and standard prompts, while they suffer degradation under ambiguous prompts. Overdetailed prompts primarily affect GroundingDINO. Prompt enhancement substantially improves robustness under ambiguity, yielding gains exceeding 55% mIoU and 41% average confidence. Based on the findings, we propose several prompting strategies and prompt enhancement methods for OSOD models in XR environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoGPA enhances 3D consistency in video diffusion models using self-supervised geometric preference alignment without human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard video diffusion models often fail to maintain 3D structural consistency, leading to object deformation or spatial drift due to lack of geometric coherence incentives.

Method: The paper introduces VideoGPA, a self-supervised framework that uses a geometry foundation model to derive dense preference signals, guiding VDMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Result: VideoGPA improves temporal stability, physical plausibility, and motion coherence, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with minimal preference pairs.

Conclusion: VideoGPA effectively steers VDMs toward 3D consistency without human intervention, demonstrating superior performance in maintaining geometric coherence.

Abstract: While recent video diffusion models (VDMs) produce visually impressive results, they fundamentally struggle to maintain 3D structural consistency, often resulting in object deformation or spatial drift. We hypothesize that these failures arise because standard denoising objectives lack explicit incentives for geometric coherence. To address this, we introduce VideoGPA (Video Geometric Preference Alignment), a data-efficient self-supervised framework that leverages a geometry foundation model to automatically derive dense preference signals that guide VDMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This approach effectively steers the generative distribution toward inherent 3D consistency without requiring human annotations. VideoGPA significantly enhances temporal stability, physical plausibility, and motion coherence using minimal preference pairs, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in extensive experiments.

*Anudeex Shetty,Aditya Joshi,Salil S. Kanhere*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how inducing drunk language in LLMs increases susceptibility to jailbreaking and privacy leaks, drawing parallels between human drunken behavior and LLM vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how alcohol-like influences on LLMs can compromise their safety and privacy safeguards, mirroring human intoxicated behavior.

Method: Three approaches are used: persona-based prompting, causal fine-tuning, and reinforcement-based post-training, evaluated on 5 LLMs.

Result: Higher jailbreaking and privacy leak rates observed compared to base LLMs and prior methods, even with defenses.

Conclusion: Drunk language induction poses significant risks to LLM safety, highlighting vulnerabilities akin to human intoxication.

Abstract: Humans are susceptible to undesirable behaviours and privacy leaks under the influence of alcohol. This paper investigates drunk language, i.e., text written under the influence of alcohol, as a driver for safety failures in large language models (LLMs). We investigate three mechanisms for inducing drunk language in LLMs: persona-based prompting, causal fine-tuning, and reinforcement-based post-training. When evaluated on 5 LLMs, we observe a higher susceptibility to jailbreaking on JailbreakBench (even in the presence of defences) and privacy leaks on ConfAIde, where both benchmarks are in English, as compared to the base LLMs as well as previously reported approaches. Via a robust combination of manual evaluation and LLM-based evaluators and analysis of error categories, our findings highlight a correspondence between human-intoxicated behaviour, and anthropomorphism in LLMs induced with drunk language. The simplicity and efficiency of our drunk language inducement approaches position them as potential counters for LLM safety tuning, highlighting significant risks to LLM safety.

*Qingyuan Tian,Wenhong Zhu,Xiaoran Liu,Xiaofeng Wang,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MrRoPE introduces a unified theoretical framework for extending Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to longer sequences, proposing training-free extensions (MrRoPE-Uni and MrRoPE-Pro) that outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RoPE-extension strategies lack a unified foundation, necessitating a generalized approach to handle longer sequences effectively.

Method: MrRoPE is based on radix system conversion, unifying diverse RoPE extensions as distinct radix strategies. Two training-free methods (MrRoPE-Uni and MrRoPE-Pro) are introduced.

Result: MrRoPE-Pro achieves over 85% recall in 128K-context tests and doubles YaRN's accuracy on Infinite-Bench tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms its improved encoding length capability.

Conclusion: MrRoPE provides a reliable and effective solution for extending RoPE, with MrRoPE-Pro offering superior performance without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)-extension refers to modifying or generalizing the Rotary Position Embedding scheme to handle longer sequences than those encountered during pre-training. However, current extension strategies are highly diverse and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper, we propose MrRoPE (Mixed-radix RoPE), a generalized encoding formulation based on a radix system conversion perspective, which elegantly unifies various RoPE-extension approaches as distinct radix conversion strategies. Based on this theory, we introduce two training-free extensions, MrRoPE-Uni and MrRoPE-Pro, which leverage uniform and progressive radix conversion strategies, respectively, to achieve 'train short, test long' generalization. Without fine-tuning, MrRoPE-Pro sustains over 85% recall in the 128K-context Needle-in-a-Haystack test and achieves more than double YaRN's accuracy on Infinite-Bench retrieval and dialogue subsets. Theoretical analysis confirms that MrRoPE-Pro effectively raises the upper bound of RoPE's attainable encoding length, which further validates the reliability and utility of our theory and methodology.

*Chenxi Liu,Yanshuo Chen,Ruibo Chen,Tianyi Xiong,Tong Zheng,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SDRL enhances LLMs by training them to benefit from diverse reasoning paths in debates, improving both standalone and collaborative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods train LLMs in isolation, missing opportunities to leverage diverse rationales from debates like MAD.

Method: SDRL samples multiple solutions, constructs debate contexts, and jointly optimizes initial and debate-conditioned responses.

Result: SDRL improves MAD performance and strengthens single-model reasoning across benchmarks.

Conclusion: SDRL effectively prepares LLMs for both standalone and collaborative reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have been substantially improved by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). At test time, collaborative reasoning through Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing LLM performance. However, current RLVR methods typically train LLMs to solve problems in isolation, without explicitly preparing them to synthesize and benefit from different rationales that arise during debate. In this work, we propose Self-Debate Reinforcement Learning (SDRL), a training framework that equips a single LLM with strong standalone problem-solving ability and the capability to learn from diverse reasoning trajectories in MAD. Given a prompt, SDRL first samples multiple candidate solutions, then constructs a debate context with diverse reasoning paths and generates second-turn responses conditioned on this context. Finally, SDRL jointly optimizes both the initial and debate-conditioned responses, yielding a model that is effective as both a standalone solver and a debate participant. Experiments across multiple base models and reasoning benchmarks show that SDRL improves overall MAD performance while simultaneously strengthening single model reasoning.

*Yupeng Cao,Chengyang He,Yangyang Yu,Ping Wang,K. P. Subbalakshmi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MERMAID is a memory-enhanced multi-agent framework for veracity assessment that integrates retrieval and reasoning, improving efficiency and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing veracity assessment methods treat evidence retrieval as static and isolated, lacking dynamic evidence acquisition and cross-claim reuse.

Method: MERMAID uses agent-driven search, structured knowledge representations, and a persistent memory module in a Reason-Action iterative process.

Result: MERMAID achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and improves search efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework effectively synergizes retrieval, reasoning, and memory for reliable veracity assessment.

Abstract: Assessing the veracity of online content has become increasingly critical. Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled substantial progress in automated veracity assessment, including automated fact-checking and claim verification systems. Typical veracity assessment pipelines break down complex claims into sub-claims, retrieve external evidence, and then apply LLM reasoning to assess veracity. However, existing methods often treat evidence retrieval as a static, isolated step and do not effectively manage or reuse retrieved evidence across claims. In this work, we propose MERMAID, a memory-enhanced multi-agent veracity assessment framework that tightly couples the retrieval and reasoning processes. MERMAID integrates agent-driven search, structured knowledge representations, and a persistent memory module within a Reason-Action style iterative process, enabling dynamic evidence acquisition and cross-claim evidence reuse. By retaining retrieved evidence in an evidence memory, the framework reduces redundant searches and improves verification efficiency and consistency. We evaluate MERMAID on three fact-checking benchmarks and two claim-verification datasets using multiple LLMs, including GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. Experimental results show that MERMAID achieves state-of-the-art performance while improving the search efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of synergizing retrieval, reasoning, and memory for reliable veracity assessment.

*Eghbal A. Hosseini,Yuxuan Li,Yasaman Bahri,Declan Campbell,Andrew Kyle Lampinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores whether representation straightening occurs within a context during in-context learning (ICL) in LLMs, revealing a task-dependent dichotomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge two research lines—representation straightening in LLMs and ICL—by investigating if straightening occurs dynamically during ICL.

Method: Measure representational straightening in Gemma 2 models across diverse in-context tasks, analyzing neural trajectory changes.

Result: Continual prediction tasks show increased straightening with context, while structured tasks exhibit inconsistent straightening, suggesting task-dependent strategies.

Conclusion: ICL is not monolithic; LLMs dynamically adapt strategies, with straightening occurring only in certain task structures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to organize the representations of input sequences into straighter neural trajectories in their deep layers, which has been hypothesized to facilitate next-token prediction via linear extrapolation. Language models can also adapt to diverse tasks and learn new structure in context, and recent work has shown that this in-context learning (ICL) can be reflected in representational changes. Here we bring these two lines of research together to explore whether representation straightening occurs \emph{within} a context during ICL. We measure representational straightening in Gemma 2 models across a diverse set of in-context tasks, and uncover a dichotomy in how LLMs' representations change in context. In continual prediction settings (e.g., natural language, grid world traversal tasks) we observe that increasing context increases the straightness of neural sequence trajectories, which is correlated with improvement in model prediction. Conversely, in structured prediction settings (e.g., few-shot tasks), straightening is inconsistent -- it is only present in phases of the task with explicit structure (e.g., repeating a template), but vanishes elsewhere. These results suggest that ICL is not a monolithic process. Instead, we propose that LLMs function like a Swiss Army knife: depending on task structure, the LLM dynamically selects between strategies, only some of which yield representational straightening.

*Arinbjörn Kolbeinsson,Daniel Timbie,Sajjan Narsinghani,Sanjay Hariharan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the joint treatment of prompt sensitivity and uncertainty in clinical LLMs, finding that accuracy doesn't ensure stability. It proposes a dual-objective optimization loop to improve both.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical LLMs are sensitive to prompt wording, but prior work treats prompts as fixed and uncertainty separately. This study aims to address both jointly.

Method: The study measures prompt sensitivity via flip rates across two clinical tasks (MedAlign and MS subtype abstraction) using various LLMs. It relates sensitivity to calibration and selective prediction, proposing a dual-objective optimization loop for accuracy and stability.

Result: Higher accuracy doesn't guarantee prompt stability, and models can seem well-calibrated yet remain fragile to paraphrases. The proposed optimization reduces flip rates, sometimes with modest accuracy trade-offs.

Conclusion: Prompt sensitivity should be an explicit objective in validating clinical LLM systems to ensure robustness.

Abstract: Large language models used for clinical abstraction are sensitive to prompt wording, yet most work treats prompts as fixed and studies uncertainty in isolation. We argue these should be treated jointly. Across two clinical tasks (MedAlign applicability/correctness and MS subtype abstraction) and multiple open and proprietary models, we measure prompt sensitivity via flip rates and relate it to calibration and selective prediction. We find that higher accuracy does not guarantee prompt stability, and that models can appear well-calibrated yet remain fragile to paraphrases. We propose a dual-objective prompt optimization loop that jointly targets accuracy and stability, showing that explicitly including a stability term reduces flip rates across tasks and models, sometimes at modest accuracy cost. Our results suggest prompt sensitivity should be an explicit objective when validating clinical LLM systems.

*Bailin Wang,Dan Friedman,Tao Lei,Chong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPLA improves block-wise sparse attention by combining accurate block selection with residual linear attention to preserve context and enhance efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing block-wise sparse attention methods suffer from low selection fidelity and contextual loss due to discarding unselected blocks.

Method: SPLA uses second-order Taylor expansions for block selection and compresses unselected blocks into a compact state via residual linear attention (RLA), avoiding explicit access to unselected blocks.

Result: SPLA outperforms dense attention models on long-context benchmarks like RULER while maintaining general knowledge and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: SPLA effectively addresses the limitations of block-wise sparse attention by balancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Block-wise sparse attention offers significant efficiency gains for long-context modeling, yet existing methods often suffer from low selection fidelity and cumulative contextual loss by completely discarding unselected blocks. To address these limitations, we introduce Sparse Plus Linear Attention (SPLA), a framework that utilizes a selection metric derived from second-order Taylor expansions to accurately identify relevant blocks for exact attention. Instead of discarding the remaining "long tail," SPLA compresses unselected blocks into a compact recurrent state via a residual linear attention (RLA) module. Crucially, to avoid IO overhead, we derive an optimized subtraction-based formulation for RLA -- calculating the residual as the difference between global and selected linear attention -- ensuring that unselected blocks are never explicitly accessed during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SPLA closes the performance gap in continual pretraining, surpassing dense attention models on long-context benchmarks like RULER while maintaining competitive general knowledge and reasoning capabilities.

*Chaoyue He,Xin Zhou,Di Wang,Hong Xu,Wei Liu,Chunyan Miao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SP2DPO improves DPO by replacing a global temperature beta with instance-specific schedules derived from semantic-gap annotations, achieving competitive performance on AlpacaEval 2.0 without per-model tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preference corpora are heterogeneous, mixing high-signal and low-signal pairs with label noise. A single global temperature beta in DPO fails to address this variability.

Method: SP2DPO uses structured semantic-gap annotations (category, magnitude, confidence) from teacher models to assign instance-specific beta_i per preference pair, applied at scale to UltraFeedback corpus.

Result: Competitive with tuned global-beta DPO, SP2DPO improves length-controlled win rates on two of four backbones in AlpacaEval 2.0, avoiding per-model beta sweeps.

Conclusion: SP2DPO effectively handles heterogeneous preference data, enhancing DPO without added training overhead, with plans to release code and artifacts.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) controls the trade-off between fitting preference labels and staying close to a reference model using a single global temperature beta, implicitly treating all preference pairs as equally informative. Real-world preference corpora are heterogeneous: they mix high-signal, objective failures (for example, safety, factuality, instruction violations) with low-signal or subjective distinctions (for example, style), and also include label noise. We introduce our method, SP2DPO (Semantic Per-Pair DPO), a generalization that replaces the global temperature with an instance-specific schedule beta_i pre-decided offline from structured semantic-gap annotations (category, magnitude, confidence) produced by teacher language models. We instantiate this procedure on the UltraFeedback preference corpus (59,960 pairs), enabling large-scale construction of an auditable beta_i artifact, and incur zero training-time overhead: the inner-loop optimizer remains standard DPO with beta set per pair. We focus our empirical study on AlpacaEval 2.0, reporting both raw win rate and length-controlled win rate. Across four open-weight, instruction-tuned student backbones (4B-8B), SP2DPO is competitive with a tuned global-beta DPO baseline and improves AlpacaEval 2.0 length-controlled win rate on two of four backbones, while avoiding per-model beta sweeps. All code, annotations, and artifacts will be released.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares single-agent and multi-agent LLM architectures for automated essay scoring, finding multi-agent better for weak essays and single-agent for mid-range essays, with few-shot calibration significantly boosting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how architectural choices in AES systems impact performance across different essay quality levels, particularly focusing on single-agent vs. multi-agent LLM approaches.

Method: Evaluated single-agent and multi-agent (with specialist agents for Content, Structure, Language, and a Chairman Agent) architectures on the ASAP 2.0 corpus using GPT-5.1 in zero-shot and few-shot conditions.

Result: Multi-agent excels at identifying weak essays, single-agent performs better on mid-range essays, and both struggle with high-quality essays. Few-shot calibration improves performance (~26% QWK increase) for both architectures.

Conclusion: Architectural choice should match deployment needs: multi-agent suits diagnostic screening, while single-agent is cost-effective for general assessment.

Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) systems increasingly rely on large language models, yet little is known about how architectural choices shape their performance across different essay quality levels. This paper evaluates single-agent and multi-agent LLM architectures for essay grading using the ASAP 2.0 corpus. Our multi-agent system decomposes grading into three specialist agents (Content, Structure, Language) coordinated by a Chairman Agent that implements rubric-aligned logic including veto rules and score capping. We test both architectures in zero-shot and few-shot conditions using GPT-5.1. Results show that the multi-agent system is significantly better at identifying weak essays while the single-agent system performs better on mid-range essays. Both architectures struggle with high-quality essays. Critically, few-shot calibration emerges as the dominant factor in system performance -- providing just two examples per score level improves QWK by approximately 26% for both architectures. These findings suggest architectural choice should align with specific deployment priorities, with multi-agent AI particularly suited for diagnostic screening of at-risk students, while single-agent models provide a cost-effective solution for general assessment.

TL;DR: This paper examines how well LLM-generated personas align with cultural frameworks (WVS, Inglehart-Welzel Map, Moral Foundations Theory) to assess their accuracy in reflecting diverse cultural and moral values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the accuracy of LLM-generated personas in simulating human behavior across different cultural contexts.

Method: Generate personas using WVS-derived variables and analyze them through the Inglehart-Welzel map, demographic-level WVS consistency, and Moral Foundations Theory.

Result: LLM-generated personas broadly track human cultural and moral patterns, revealing stable differences aligned with cultural conditioning.

Conclusion: The culturally-grounded persona generation method effectively evaluates cross-cultural and moral variations in LLMs.

Abstract: Despite the growing utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simulating human behavior, the extent to which these synthetic personas accurately reflect world and moral value systems across different cultural conditionings remains uncertain. This paper investigates the alignment of synthetic, culturally-grounded personas with established frameworks, specifically the World Values Survey (WVS), the Inglehart-Welzel Cultural Map, and Moral Foundations Theory. We conceptualize and produce LLM-generated personas based on a set of interpretable WVS-derived variables, and we examine the generated personas through three complementary lenses: positioning on the Inglehart-Welzel map, which unveils their interpretation reflecting stable differences across cultural conditionings; demographic-level consistency with the World Values Survey, where response distributions broadly track human group patterns; and moral profiles derived from a Moral Foundations questionnaire, which we analyze through a culture-to-morality mapping to characterize how moral responses vary across different cultural configurations. Our approach of culturally-grounded persona generation and analysis enables evaluation of cross-cultural structure and moral variation.

*Kanishk Awadhiya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bifocal Attention addresses RoPE's 'Spectral Rigidity' by combining Geometric Eyes (RoPE) and Spectral Eyes (learnable harmonic operators) to improve long-range recursive reasoning, using a training protocol called Spectral Evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RoPE's fixed geometric decay is insufficient for capturing long-range, periodic structures in recursive logic, creating a 'Structure Gap' where models struggle with deeper reasoning.

Method: Introduces Bifocal Attention, decoupling positional encoding into Geometric Eyes (RoPE for token-level precision) and Spectral Eyes (learnable harmonic operators for long-range tracking). Uses Spectral Evolution to let frequencies evolve from static to task-optimized harmonics.

Result: Bifocal Attention bridges the 'Structure Gap' by enabling models to handle both local and long-range recursive reasoning more effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances RoPE's capabilities, making it more versatile for tasks requiring deep recursive logic and algorithmic reasoning.

Abstract: Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become the standard for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their ability to encode relative positions through geometric rotation. However, we identify a significant limitation we term ''Spectral Rigidity'': standard RoPE utilizes a fixed geometric decay ($θ^{-i}$) optimized for local syntactic coherence, which fails to capture the long-range, periodic structures inherent in recursive logic and algorithmic reasoning. This results in a ''Structure Gap'', where models trained on shallow reasoning chains fail to extrapolate to deeper recursive steps. In this work, we introduce Bifocal Attention, an architectural paradigm that decouples positional encoding into two distinct modalities: Geometric Eyes (Standard RoPE) for precise token-level manipulation, and Spectral Eyes (Learnable Harmonic Operators) for tracking long-range recursive depth. We propose a novel training protocol, Spectral Evolution, which initializes positional frequencies as static geometric parameters but allows them to evolve via gradient descent into a harmonic basis optimized for the specific algorithmic topology of the task.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph-based framework to analyze semantic shifts in diachronic corpora by combining distributional similarity and lexical substitutability, applied to NY Times articles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an interpretable method for tracking semantic shifts in words over time without relying on predefined sense inventories.

Method: Induces word-centered semantic networks using diachronic Skip-gram embeddings and masked language models, clusters peripheral graphs, aligns clusters across time, and tracks changes.

Result: Demonstrates that graph connectivity reflects polysemy dynamics and captures diverse semantic trajectories (e.g., event-driven replacement, stability, gradual shifts).

Conclusion: Word-centered semantic graphs offer a compact, transparent tool for exploring sense evolution.

Abstract: We propose an interpretable, graph-based framework for analyzing semantic shift in diachronic corpora. For each target word and time slice, we induce a word-centered semantic network that integrates distributional similarity from diachronic Skip-gram embeddings with lexical substitutability from time-specific masked language models. We identify sense-related structure by clustering the peripheral graph, align clusters across time via node overlap, and track change through cluster composition and normalized cluster mass. In an application study on a corpus of New York Times Magazine articles (1980 - 2017), we show that graph connectivity reflects polysemy dynamics and that the induced communities capture contrasting trajectories: event-driven sense replacement (trump), semantic stability with cluster over-segmentation effects (god), and gradual association shifts tied to digital communication (post). Overall, word-centered semantic graphs offer a compact and transparent representation for exploring sense evolution without relying on predefined sense inventories.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-evolving LLM agents show a gap in experience faithfulness: they rely on raw experience but often ignore or misinterpret condensed experience, highlighting a need for better integration methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether self-evolving LLM agents faithfully use their accumulated experience to guide their decisions.

Method: Conducted controlled causal interventions on raw and condensed experience across four frameworks, 10 LLM backbones, and 9 environments.

Result: Agents consistently depend on raw experience but often disregard condensed experience, even when it's the only type provided. This gap persists across configurations and scales.

Conclusion: Findings challenge assumptions about self-evolving methods and emphasize the need for more faithful experience integration approaches.

Abstract: Self-evolving large language model (LLM) agents continually improve by accumulating and reusing past experience, yet it remains unclear whether they faithfully rely on that experience to guide their behavior. We present the first systematic investigation of experience faithfulness, the causal dependence of an agent's decisions on the experience it is given, in self-evolving LLM agents. Using controlled causal interventions on both raw and condensed forms of experience, we comprehensively evaluate four representative frameworks across 10 LLM backbones and 9 environments. Our analysis uncovers a striking asymmetry: while agents consistently depend on raw experience, they often disregard or misinterpret condensed experience, even when it is the only experience provided. This gap persists across single- and multi-agent configurations and across backbone scales. We trace its underlying causes to three factors: the semantic limitations of condensed content, internal processing biases that suppress experience, and task regimes where pretrained priors already suffice. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about self-evolving methods and underscore the need for more faithful and reliable approaches to experience integration.

Motivation: Low-resource languages suffer from rare tokens being marginalized during training, hindering effective learning.

Method: A thresholding technique is introduced to limit marginalization's harmful effects, tested with a character-level language model.

Result: The method significantly boosts performance on low-resource language validation data.

Conclusion: This approach enhances rare token representation and model performance for underrepresented languages, offering a novel solution.

Abstract: Neural language models often struggle with low-resource languages due to the limited availability of training data, making tokens from these languages rare in the training set. This paper addresses a specific challenge during training: rare tokens are disproportionately affected by marginalization, which prevents them from learning effectively. We propose a thresholding technique that reduces the impact of this marginalization, allowing rare tokens to benefit from more meaningful alignment. Through experiments with a character-level language model, we demonstrate that this method significantly improves performance on low-resource language validation data. This work is the first to show how negative sampling can be applied to improve the representation of rare tokens by limiting the harmful influence of excessive marginalization, offering a new approach to enhancing language model performance for underrepresented languages.

TL;DR: SSL introduces tiered rewards to guide agents toward optimal solution regions, improving efficiency and adaptability across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing binary rewards overlook quality differences in trajectories, limiting exploration of solution space diversity. Inspired by tennis' 'sweet spot,' SSL aims to provide differentiated guidance for agent optimization.

Method: SSL uses progressively amplified, tiered rewards to direct policies toward optimal regions. It adapts rewards based on task type (e.g., distance-tiered for perception, progress-tiered for reasoning).

Result: SSL improves sample efficiency (up to 2.5X) and achieves consistent gains over baselines on 12 benchmarks, demonstrating cross-task transferability.

Conclusion: SSL is a general and effective principle for training robust agents, preserving optimal solution ordering and enhancing optimization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training intelligent agents. However, existing methods typically employ binary rewards that fail to capture quality differences among trajectories achieving identical outcomes, thereby overlooking potential diversity within the solution space. Inspired by the ``sweet spot'' concept in tennis-the racket's core region that produces optimal hitting effects, we introduce \textbf{S}weet \textbf{S}pot \textbf{L}earning (\textbf{SSL}), a novel framework that provides differentiated guidance for agent optimization. SSL follows a simple yet effective principle: progressively amplified, tiered rewards guide policies toward the sweet-spot region of the solution space. This principle naturally adapts across diverse tasks: visual perception tasks leverage distance-tiered modeling to reward proximity, while complex reasoning tasks reward incremental progress toward promising solutions. We theoretically demonstrate that SSL preserves optimal solution ordering and enhances the gradient signal-to-noise ratio, thereby fostering more directed optimization. Extensive experiments across GUI perception, short/long-term planning, and complex reasoning tasks show consistent improvements over strong baselines on 12 benchmarks, achieving up to 2.5X sample efficiency gains and effective cross-task transferability. Our work establishes SSL as a general principle for training capable and robust agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SYNTHAGENT framework enhances small LLMs by synthesizing diverse training data and simulating environments, enabling them to outperform larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small LLMs lag in agentic capabilities due to limited task variety in training data and unstable real-world APIs.

Method: Uses a teacher model to create diverse tasks and tool ecosystems, then rewrites them into underspecified instructions. Includes LLM-based user simulation and mock tools.

Result: Small models trained on SYNTHAGENT data outperform larger baselines across 14 datasets in math, search, and tool use.

Conclusion: SYNTHAGENT effectively bridges the gap between small and large LLMs by addressing training data and environmental bottlenecks.

Abstract: Small LLMs often struggle to match the agentic capabilities of large, costly models. While reinforcement learning can help, progress has been limited by two structural bottlenecks: existing open-source agentic training data are narrow in task variety and easily solved; real-world APIs lack diversity and are unstable for large-scale reinforcement learning rollout processes. We address these challenges with SYNTHAGENT, a framework that jointly synthesizes diverse tool-use training data and simulates complete environments. Specifically, a strong teacher model creates novel tasks and tool ecosystems, then rewrites them into intentionally underspecified instructions. This compels agents to actively query users for missing details. When handling synthetic tasks, an LLM-based user simulator provides user-private information, while a mock tool system delivers stable tool responses. For rewards, task-level rubrics are constructed based on required subgoals, user-agent interactions, and forbidden behaviors. Across 14 challenging datasets in math, search, and tool use, models trained on our synthetic data achieve substantial gains, with small models outperforming larger baselines.

TL;DR: A unified reinforcement learning framework, PMPO, generalizes GRPO and GMPO by dynamically adjusting aggregation geometry via exponent p, improving performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The evolving and heterogeneous nature of trajectories in group-based reinforcement learning is not addressed by fixed aggregation methods like GRPO and GMPO.

Method: Introduces PMPO, a framework using power-mean geometry exponent p to modulate aggregation. Includes Clip-aware ESS for adaptive p selection.

Result: PMPO outperforms baselines by dynamically switching between arithmetic and geometric means based on trajectory reliability.

Conclusion: PMPO unifies and advances GRPO and GMPO, adapting aggregation geometry to trajectory dynamics for better performance.

Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning has evolved from the arithmetic mean of GRPO to the geometric mean of GMPO. While GMPO improves stability by constraining a conservative objective, it shares a fundamental limitation with GRPO: reliance on a fixed aggregation geometry that ignores the evolving and heterogeneous nature of each trajectory. In this work, we unify these approaches under Power-Mean Policy Optimization (PMPO), a generalized framework that parameterizes the aggregation geometry via the power-mean geometry exponent p. Within this framework, GRPO and GMPO are recovered as special cases. Theoretically, we demonstrate that adjusting p modulates the concentration of gradient updates, effectively reweighting tokens based on their advantage contribution. To determine p adaptively, we introduce a Clip-aware Effective Sample Size (ESS) mechanism. Specifically, we propose a deterministic rule that maps a trajectory clipping fraction to a target ESS. Then, we solve for the specific p to align the trajectory induced ESS with this target one. This allows PMPO to dynamically transition between the aggressive arithmetic mean for reliable trajectories and the conservative geometric mean for unstable ones. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PMPO outperforms strong baselines.

*Jingyi Yang,Yuxian Jiang,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ρ-EOS, a training-free method for bidirectional variable-length generation in masked diffusion large language models by leveraging implicit EOS token density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) lack flexibility due to predefined fixed generation lengths, causing trade-offs between output quality and computational efficiency.

Method: The proposed ρ-EOS strategy uses implicit EOS token density to guide bidirectional length adjustment within a unified denoising process, avoiding separate length adjustment and mask insertion phases.

Result: ρ-EOS improves inference efficiency and token utilization while maintaining comparable performance on mathematics and code benchmarks.

Conclusion: The ρ-EOS method effectively addresses the limitation of fixed generation lengths in masked dLLMs, offering bidirectional flexibility without compromising performance.

Abstract: Beyond parallel generation and global context modeling, current masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) suffer from a fundamental limitation: they require a predefined, fixed generation length, which lacks flexibility and forces an inevitable trade-off between output quality and computational efficiency. To address this, we study the denoising dynamics and find that the implicit density ($ρ$) of end-of-sequence ($\texttt{EOS}$) tokens serves as a reliable signal of generation sufficiency. In particular, the evolving implicit $\texttt{EOS}$ density during denoising reveals whether the current masked space is excessive or insufficient, thereby guiding the adjustment direction for generation length. Building on this insight, we propose $\textbf{$ρ$-$\texttt{EOS}$}$, a training-free, single-stage strategy that enables bidirectional variable-length generation for masked dLLMs. Unlike prior two-stage approaches--which require separate length adjustment and iterative mask insertion phases while supporting only unidirectional expansion--$\textbf{$ρ$-$\texttt{EOS}$}$ achieves bidirectional length adjustment within a unified denoising process by continuously estimating the implicit $\texttt{EOS}$ density: excessively high density triggers $\texttt{MASK}$ token contraction, while insufficient density induces expansion. Extensive experiments on mathematics and code benchmarks demonstrate that $\textbf{$ρ$-$\texttt{EOS}$}$ achieves comparable performance while substantially improving inference efficiency and token utilization.

TL;DR: The paper explores the Holographic Characteristic in LLMs, where models capture target-side keywords early in generation, and introduces HOLO, a plugin to leverage this trait for efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the generation traits of LLMs, particularly the Holographic Characteristic, and improve inference efficiency.

Method: Proposes HOLO, a plugin that extracts keywords early in generation and uses parallel lexically constrained text generation for completion.

Result: HOLO matches baseline performance in evaluations, demonstrating the Holographic Characteristic's potential.

Conclusion: The Holographic Characteristic is impactful, and HOLO effectively utilizes it for efficient LLM inference.

Abstract: The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted interest in exploring their in-context learning abilities and chain-of-thought capabilities. However, there are few studies investigating the specific traits related to the powerful generation capacity of LLMs. This paper aims to delve into the generation characteristics exhibited by LLMs. Through our investigation, we have discovered that language models tend to capture target-side keywords at the beginning of the generation process. We name this phenomenon the Holographic Characteristic of language models. For the purpose of exploring this characteristic and further improving the inference efficiency of language models, we propose a plugin called HOLO, which leverages the Holographic Characteristic to extract target-side keywords from language models within a limited number of generation steps and complements the sentence with a parallel lexically constrained text generation method. To verify the effectiveness of HOLO, we conduct massive experiments on language models of varying architectures and scales in the short-text generation scenario. The results demonstrate that HOLO achieves comparable performance to the baselines in terms of both automatic and human-like evaluation metrics and highlight the potential of the Holographic Characteristic.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias in LLM evaluators favoring their own outputs, identifies a methodological confound reducing measurement error by 89.6%, and introduces an Evaluator Quality Baseline to isolate self-preference signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To disentangle self-preference bias from general experimental confounds in LLM evaluations.

Method: Introduces an Evaluator Quality Baseline comparing judge self-voting probability versus voting for incorrect responses from other models.

Result: Only 51% of initial findings retain significance after applying the baseline to 37,448 queries.

Conclusion: The baseline helps eliminate noisy data, aiding future research on self-preference and judge-bias effects.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that large language models (LLM) favor own outputs when acting as judges, undermining the integrity of automated post-training and evaluation workflows. However, it is difficult to disentangle which evaluation biases are explained by narcissism versus general experimental confounds, distorting measurements of self-preference bias. We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance. Finally, we turn towards characterizing the entropy of "easy" versus "hard" evaluation votes from LLM judges. Our corrective baseline enables future research on self-preference by eliminating noisy data from potential solutions. More widely, this work contributes to the growing body of work on cataloging and isolating judge-bias effects.

TL;DR: SpanNorm resolves PreNorm and PostNorm limitations by combining strengths for stable, high-performance Transformer training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses training instability in PostNorm and performance degradation in PreNorm architectures.

Method: Integrates PreNorm stability via residual connections and PostNorm performance via normalization of aggregated output.

Result: Maintains bounded signal variance, improves performance in dense and MoE scenarios.

Conclusion: SpanNorm enables more powerful and stable Transformer architectures.

Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on the stable training of deep Transformer architectures. A critical design choice is the placement of normalization layers, leading to a fundamental trade-off: the ``PreNorm'' architecture ensures training stability at the cost of potential performance degradation in deep models, while the ``PostNorm'' architecture offers strong performance but suffers from severe training instability. In this work, we propose SpanNorm, a novel technique designed to resolve this dilemma by integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Structurally, SpanNorm establishes a clean residual connection that spans the entire transformer block to stabilize signal propagation, while employing a PostNorm-style computation that normalizes the aggregated output to enhance model performance. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that SpanNorm, combined with a principled scaling strategy, maintains bounded signal variance throughout the network, preventing the gradient issues that plague PostNorm models, and also alleviating the representation collapse of PreNorm. Empirically, SpanNorm consistently outperforms standard normalization schemes in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) scenarios, paving the way for more powerful and stable Transformer architectures.

*Aryaman Arora,Zhengxuan Wu,Jacob Steinhardt,Sarah Schwettmann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLP neurons are as sparse as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for interpretability, enabling efficient circuit tracing without extra training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that MLP neurons can serve as interpretable units for circuit tracing, challenging the assumption that neuron-based representations are uninterpretable.

Method: Developed an end-to-end pipeline for circuit tracing using MLP neurons with gradient-based attribution, tested on subject-verb agreement and multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Result: Identified compact circuits (≈10^2 neurons) controlling behavior in benchmarks and latent reasoning steps in multi-hop tasks, allowing model output manipulation.

Conclusion: MLP neurons provide a viable, cost-free basis for automated interpretability in language models, advancing circuit tracing techniques.

Abstract: The high-level concepts that a neural network uses to perform computation need not be aligned to individual neurons (Smolensky, 1986). Language model interpretability research has thus turned to techniques such as \textit{sparse autoencoders} (SAEs) to decompose the neuron basis into more interpretable units of model computation, for tasks such as \textit{circuit tracing}. However, not all neuron-based representations are uninterpretable. For the first time, we empirically show that \textbf{MLP neurons are as sparse a feature basis as SAEs}. We use this finding to develop an end-to-end pipeline for circuit tracing on the MLP neuron basis, which locates causal circuitry on a variety of tasks using gradient-based attribution. On a standard subject-verb agreement benchmark (Marks et al., 2025), a circuit of $\approx 10^2$ MLP neurons is enough to control model behaviour. On the multi-hop city $\to$ state $\to$ capital task from Lindsey et al., 2025, we find a circuit in which small sets of neurons encode specific latent reasoning steps (e.g.~`map city to its state'), and can be steered to change the model's output. This work thus advances automated interpretability of language models without additional training costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how the temporal dimension in Diffusion-LMs can control generation diversity for multiple valid semantic or reasoning paths.

Method: Propose Time-Annealed Perturbation Sampling (TAPS), a training-free inference strategy that encourages early semantic branching and later lexical refinement.

Result: TAPS improves output diversity in creative writing and reasoning benchmarks without compromising quality, compatible with LLaDA and TraDo backbones.

Conclusion: Diffusion-LMs' temporal structure can be harnessed for diverse generation, with TAPS offering an effective, training-free solution.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (Diffusion-LMs) introduce an explicit temporal dimension into text generation, yet how this structure can be leveraged to control generation diversity for exploring multiple valid semantic or reasoning paths remains underexplored. In this paper, we show that Diffusion-LMs, like diffusion models in image generation, exhibit a temporal division of labor: early denoising steps largely determine the global semantic structure, while later steps focus on local lexical refinement. Building on this insight, we propose Time-Annealed Perturbation Sampling (TAPS), a training-free inference strategy that encourages semantic branching early in the diffusion process while progressively reducing perturbations to preserve fluency and instruction adherence. TAPS is compatible with both non-autoregressive and semi-autoregressive Diffusion backbones, demonstrated on LLaDA and TraDo in our paper, and consistently improves output diversity across creative writing and reasoning benchmarks without compromising generation quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DART is a lightweight, training-free method for dynamic pruning of LLMs, outperforming static methods with up to 14.5% accuracy gains and 3x better ROUGE-L scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods for LLMs rely on dataset-specific calibration and are static, failing to adapt to evolving context during generation.

Method: DART dynamically updates neuron-level masks based on attention score shifts, enabling context-based pruning without training.

Result: DART achieves significant accuracy improvements (up to 14.5%) and better ROUGE-L scores (up to 3x) at 70% sparsity, with minimal memory and FLOPs overhead.

Conclusion: DART effectively adapts to diverse semantic contexts, preserves model capabilities, and operates efficiently with low computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit substantial parameter redundancy, particularly in Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs). Existing pruning methods suffer from two primary limitations. First, reliance on dataset-specific calibration introduces significant data dependency and computational overhead. Second, being predominantly static, they fail to account for the evolving subset of knowledge neurons in LLMs during autoregressive generation as the context evolves. To address this, we introduce DART, i.e., Dynamic Attention-Guided Runtime Tracing), a lightweight, training-free method that performs on-the-fly context-based pruning. DART monitors shifts in attention score distributions to infer context changes, dynamically updating neuron-level masks to retain salient parameters. Across ten benchmarks, DART outperforms prior dynamic baseline, achieving accuracy gains of up to 14.5% on LLAMA-3.1-8B at 70% FFN sparsity. Furthermore, DART achieves up to 3x better ROUGE-L scores with respect to static-masked pruning on summarization tasks, with its performance comparable to the original dense models. We conclusively demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively adapts to diverse semantic contexts, preserves model capabilities across both general and domain-specific tasks while running at less than 10MBs of memory for LLAMA-3.1-8B(16GBs) with 0.1% FLOPs overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NAG integrates graph processing within LMs using self-attention and positional IDs, eliminating the need for external GNNs and improving coherence in text-graph modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods segregate graph structure encoding (via GNNs) from semantic processing (via LMs), leading to disjointed interactions and complex implicit alignments. NAG aims to unify these processes.

Method: NAG repurposes the LM's self-attention mechanism to enforce topological dependencies and recalibrates positional IDs for structural equivalence. Two implementations are proposed: NAG-Zero (preserves base LM) and NAG-LoRA (enhanced adaptation).

Result: Experiments show NAG achieves robust graph comprehension without external encoders, simplifying text-graph modeling.

Conclusion: NAG offers a unified, efficient framework for integrating graphs into LMs, eliminating the need for segregated architectures and improving performance.

Abstract: Prevailing methods for integrating graphs into Language Models (LMs) typically rely on a segregated architecture: external Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) encode structural topology, while LMs process textual semantics. We argue this approach is suboptimal for text-graphs: it creates a conceptually disjointed interaction paradigm. By segregating structural encoding from semantic processing, these systems must perform a complex implicit alignment between abstract graph tokens and concrete textual elements. Challenging the necessity of external encoders, we propose NAG (Native Architecture for Graphs), a unified framework that internalizes graph processing within the LM's native manifold. Instead of bridging disparate embedding spaces, NAG repurposes the self-attention mechanism to enforce topological dependencies and recalibrates positional IDs to ensure structural equivalence. This allows the model to harness its intrinsic linguistic capability to simultaneously comprehend node and edge content alongside structural topology. We introduce two efficient implementations: NAG-Zero for absolute preservation of the base model's linguistic capabilities, and NAG-LoRA for enhanced structural adaptation. Experiments across diverse graph tasks validate that NAG achieves robust graph comprehension without the overhead of external encoders, offering a simpler, more coherent paradigm for text-graph modeling.

Motivation: Current language models generate reasoning sequentially, leading to inefficient exploration of irrelevant paths.

Method: TSLM uses special tokens to encode branching, trains on complete search trees (successful and failed paths), and avoids redundant prefix recomputation.

Result: TSLM achieves robust performance and superior inference efficiency by reducing multiple independent forward passes.

Conclusion: Supervised learning on tree-structured traces offers an efficient alternative for systematic exploration in language models.

Abstract: Language models generate reasoning sequentially, preventing them from decoupling irrelevant exploration paths during search. We introduce Tree-Structured Language Modeling (TSLM), which uses special tokens to encode branching structure, enabling models to generate and selectively expand multiple search paths within a single generation process. By training on complete search trees including both successful and failed attempts, TSLM learns to internalize systematic exploration without redundant recomputation of shared prefixes. TSLM achieves robust performance and superior inference efficiency by avoiding the multiple independent forward passes required by external search methods. These results suggest a new paradigm of inference-time scaling for robust reasoning, demonstrating that supervised learning on complete tree-structured traces provides an efficient alternative for developing systematic exploration capabilities in language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preventing unauthorized use of open-source LLMs and protecting intellectual property rights are critical challenges due to the high cost and commercial value of LLM development.

Method: The Functional Network Fingerprint (FNF) detects suspect LLMs by comparing the consistency of functional network activity between victim and suspect models, requiring minimal samples and remaining robust to modifications.

Result: FNF successfully identifies derived models with shared origins, even across variations in scale or architecture, while distinguishing independently trained models.

Conclusion: FNF offers a simple, non-invasive, and effective tool for protecting LLM intellectual property, requiring few samples and preserving model utility.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) is costly and has significant commercial value. Consequently, preventing unauthorized appropriation of open-source LLMs and protecting developers' intellectual property rights have become critical challenges. In this work, we propose the Functional Network Fingerprint (FNF), a training-free, sample-efficient method for detecting whether a suspect LLM is derived from a victim model, based on the consistency between their functional network activity. We demonstrate that models that share a common origin, even with differences in scale or architecture, exhibit highly consistent patterns of neuronal activity within their functional networks across diverse input samples. In contrast, models trained independently on distinct data or with different objectives fail to preserve such activity alignment. Unlike conventional approaches, our method requires only a few samples for verification, preserves model utility, and remains robust to common model modifications (such as fine-tuning, pruning, and parameter permutation), as well as to comparisons across diverse architectures and dimensionalities. FNF thus provides model owners and third parties with a simple, non-invasive, and effective tool for protecting LLM intellectual property.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address discrepancies in LLM performance between symbol-based and cloze-style evaluation formats due to task characteristics.

Method: Introduce a lightweight classifier trained on latent model-preference signals to determine the optimal format dynamically.

Result: Achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot accuracy across reasoning and knowledge benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively leverages model signals to optimize task formats, revealing latent LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on multiple-choice tasks differs markedly between symbol-based and cloze-style evaluation formats. The observed discrepancies are systematically attributable to task characteristics: natural language continuation benefits from likelihood scoring, whereas explicit comparison is better suited to symbol-based selection. These trends are consistent across various decoder-based LLMs, indicating model-agnostic effects. To address these inconsistencies, a dynamic format-alignment strategy is introduced that employs a lightweight classifier trained on latent model-preference signals. In contrast to human-designed heuristics, which often degrade performance, this approach uses model-generated signals to determine the optimal format for each problem instance. The proposed method achieves substantial and consistent improvements in zero-shot accuracy across reasoning and knowledge benchmarks, better revealing the models' latent capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if thinking in MLLMs mitigates hallucinations in multimodal perception and reasoning, and to address gaps in existing benchmarks.

Method: Develop MM-THEBench with a fine-grained taxonomy, diverse annotated data, and multi-level automated evaluation.

Result: Experiments reveal insights into how thinking impacts hallucination and reasoning in multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: MM-THEBench effectively evaluates hallucinations in reasoning MLLMs, providing insights into their thinking processes and robustness.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) mark a shift from non-thinking models to post-trained reasoning models capable of solving complex problems through thinking. However, whether such thinking mitigates hallucinations in multimodal perception and reasoning remains unclear. Self-reflective reasoning enhances robustness but introduces additional hallucinations, and subtle perceptual errors still result in incorrect or coincidentally correct answers. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on models before the emergence of reasoning MLLMs, neglecting the internal thinking process and failing to measure the hallucinations that occur during thinking. To address these challenges, we introduce MM-THEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing hallucinations of intermediate CoTs in reasoning MLLMs. MM-THEBench features a fine-grained taxonomy grounded in cognitive dimensions, diverse data with verified reasoning annotations, and a multi-level automated evaluation framework. Extensive experiments on mainstream reasoning MLLMs reveal insights into how thinking affects hallucination and reasoning capability in various multimodal tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing appellate review mechanisms struggle with efficiency, and current legal AI lacks focus on error detection post-judgment.

Method: The authors propose APPELLATE REVIEW, construct AR-BENCH (8,700 annotated decisions and 34,617 corpora), and evaluate 14 large language models.

Result: The evaluation highlights limitations in models' ability to identify legal errors, offering insights for future improvements.

Conclusion: The study bridges a gap in legal AI by addressing post-judgment error detection and providing a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Legal judgments may contain errors due to the complexity of case circumstances and the abstract nature of legal concepts, while existing appellate review mechanisms face efficiency pressures from a surge in case volumes. Although current legal AI research focuses on tasks like judgment prediction and legal document generation, the task of judgment review differs fundamentally in its objectives and paradigm: it centers on detecting, classifying, and correcting errors after a judgment is issued, constituting anomaly detection rather than prediction or generation. To address this research gap, we introduce a novel task APPELLATE REVIEW, aiming to assess models' diagnostic reasoning and reliability in legal practice. We also construct a novel dataset benchmark AR-BENCH, which comprises 8,700 finely annotated decisions and 34,617 supplementary corpora. By evaluating 14 large language models, we reveal critical limitations in existing models' ability to identify legal application errors, providing empirical evidence for future improvements.

*Jiaxuan Luo,Siqi Ouyang,Lei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RASST enhances simultaneous speech translation by integrating cross-modal retrieval to improve rare and domain-specific terminology translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Speech LLMs struggle with translating rare and domain-specific terms in simultaneous speech translation, despite their improvements.

Method: Proposes RASST, which combines lightweight speech-text retrieval with sliding-window retrieval to provide terminology hints and teaches Speech LLMs to use these hints effectively.

Result: RASST improves terminology translation accuracy by up to 16% and overall translation quality by up to 3 BLEU points.

Conclusion: Retrieval augmentation significantly boosts SST performance, especially for rare and domain-specific terms.

Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation (SST) produces target text incrementally from partial speech input. Recent speech large language models (Speech LLMs) have substantially improved SST quality, yet they still struggle to correctly translate rare and domain-specific terminology. While retrieval augmentation has been effective for terminology translation in machine translation, bringing retrieval to SST is non-trivial: it requires fast and accurate cross-modal (speech-to-text) retrieval under partial, continually arriving input, and the model must decide whether and when to apply retrieved terms during incremental generation. We propose Retrieval-Augmented Simultaneous Speech Translation (RASST), which tightly integrates cross-modal retrieval into the SST pipeline. RASST trains a lightweight speech-text retriever and performs efficient sliding-window retrieval, providing chunkwise terminology hints to the Speech LLM. We further synthesize training data that teaches the Speech LLM to leverage retrieved terms precisely. Experiments on three language directions of the ACL 60/60 dev set show that RASST improves terminology translation accuracy by up to 16% and increases overall translation quality by up to 3 BLEU points, with ablations confirming the contribution of each component.

*Corentin Kervadec,Iuliia Lysova,Marco Baroni,Gemma Boleda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new technique quantifies computation density in LLMs, revealing dense and dynamic processing patterns influenced by input rarity and context length, challenging symbolic interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand computation distribution in LLMs and address assumptions about parameter sparsity by quantifying computation density dynamically.

Method: Developed a computation density estimator using mechanistic interpretability and tested it experimentally on LLMs.

Result: Found LLMs involve dense computation dynamically, with density correlated across models and influenced by token rarity and context length.

Conclusion: The estimator provides insights into LLM processing, challenging symbolic views and highlighting dynamic computation density patterns.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are comprised of billions of parameters arranged in deep and wide computational graphs. Several studies on LLM efficiency optimization argue that it is possible to prune a significant portion of the parameters, while only marginally impacting performance. This suggests that the computation is not uniformly distributed across the parameters. We introduce here a technique to systematically quantify computation density in LLMs. In particular, we design a density estimator drawing on mechanistic interpretability. We experimentally test our estimator and find that: (1) contrary to what has been often assumed, LLM processing generally involves dense computation; (2) computation density is dynamic, in the sense that models shift between sparse and dense processing regimes depending on the input; (3) per-input density is significantly correlated across LLMs, suggesting that the same inputs trigger either low or high density. Investigating the factors influencing density, we observe that predicting rarer tokens requires higher density, and increasing context length often decreases the density. We believe that our computation density estimator will contribute to a better understanding of the processing at work in LLMs, challenging their symbolic interpretation.

### [115] [When Meanings Meet: Investigating the Emergence and Quality of Shared Concept Spaces during Multilingual Language Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22851)
*Felicia Körner,Max Müller-Eberstein,Anna Korhonen,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how shared concept spaces develop during LLM pretraining using causal interpretability, finding early emergence and refinement, but varying alignment across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how multilingual LLMs develop shared concept spaces, especially when monolingual resources are scarce, to improve generalization and cross-lingual transfer.

Method: Uses activation patching (a causal interpretability method) to isolate cross-lingual concept representations and test their consistency in altering translations.

Result: Shared concept spaces emerge early and refine, but alignment varies by language. Some translation 'gains' reflect behavioral shifts rather than improved ability.

Conclusion: Provides insights into cross-lingual alignment dynamics and the meaningful use of causal interpretability methods in multilingual contexts.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with high multilingual coverage is becoming increasingly important -- especially when monolingual resources are scarce. Recent studies have found that LLMs process multilingual inputs in shared concept spaces, thought to support generalization and cross-lingual transfer. However, these prior studies often do not use causal methods, lack deeper error analysis or focus on the final model only, leaving open how these spaces emerge during training. We investigate the development of language-agnostic concept spaces during pretraining of EuroLLM through the causal interpretability method of activation patching. We isolate cross-lingual concept representations, then inject them into a translation prompt to investigate how consistently translations can be altered, independently of the language. We find that shared concept spaces emerge early} and continue to refine, but that alignment with them is language-dependent}. Furthermore, in contrast to prior work, our fine-grained manual analysis reveals that some apparent gains in translation quality reflect shifts in behavior -- like selecting senses for polysemous words or translating instead of copying cross-lingual homographs -- rather than improved translation ability. Our findings offer new insight into the training dynamics of cross-lingual alignment and the conditions under which causal interpretability methods offer meaningful insights in multilingual contexts.

*Elif Sayar,Tolgahan Türker,Anna Golynskaia Knezhevich,Bihter Dereli,Ayşe Demirhas,Lionel Nicolas,Gülşen Eryiğit*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a semi-automated annotation methodology for learner corpora using a faceted taxonomy to enable detailed, multi-dimensional analysis of learner errors, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learner corpora use flat label inventories, limiting deep linguistic annotation and fine-grained error analysis.

Method: Develops a semi-automated annotation system based on a faceted taxonomy and implements an annotation extension tool for Turkish learner corpora.

Result: Achieved 95.86% facet-level accuracy, offering richer context and enhanced querying capabilities for error analysis.

Conclusion: The work introduces the first taxonomically enriched Turkish Learner Corpus, paving the way for future corpus enrichment efforts.

Abstract: In terms of annotation structure, most learner corpora rely on holistic flat label inventories which, even when extensive, do not explicitly separate multiple linguistic dimensions. This makes linguistically deep annotation difficult and complicates fine-grained analyses aimed at understanding why and how learners produce specific errors. To address these limitations, this paper presents a semi-automated annotation methodology for learner corpora, built upon a recently proposed faceted taxonomy, and implemented through a novel annotation extension framework. The taxonomy provides a theoretically grounded, multi-dimensional categorization that captures the linguistic properties underlying each error instance, thereby enabling standardized, fine-grained, and interpretable enrichment beyond flat annotations. The annotation extension tool, implemented based on the proposed extension framework for Turkish, automatically extends existing flat annotations by inferring additional linguistic and metadata information as facets within the taxonomy to provide richer learner-specific context. It was systematically evaluated and yielded promising performance results, achieving a facet-level accuracy of 95.86%. The resulting taxonomically enriched corpus offers enhanced querying capabilities and supports detailed exploratory analyses across learner corpora, enabling researchers to investigate error patterns through complex linguistic and pedagogical dimensions. This work introduces the first collaboratively annotated and taxonomically enriched Turkish Learner Corpus, a manual annotation guideline with a refined tagset, and an annotation extender. As the first corpus designed in accordance with the recently introduced taxonomy, we expect our study to pave the way for subsequent enrichment efforts of existing error-annotated learner corpora.

### [117] [Leveraging LLMs For Turkish Skill Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22885)
*Ezgi Arslan İltüzer,Özgür Anıl Özlü,Vahid Farajijobehdar,Gülşen Eryiğit*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses skill extraction in Turkish, a low-resource language, by introducing a dataset and evaluating LLMs. The best method uses Claude Sonnet 3.7 with dynamic few-shot prompting, achieving competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Turkish lacks resources for skill extraction, hindering research. The study aims to fill this gap by exploring effective methods and evaluating LLMs.

Method: The study introduces a Turkish skill extraction dataset, evaluates LLMs (e.g., Claude Sonnet 3.7) with dynamic few-shot prompting, and compares them to supervised sequence labeling.

Result: LLMs outperform supervised methods, achieving an end-to-end performance of 0.56. Dynamic few-shot prompting with Claude Sonnet 3.7 is the best configuration.

Conclusion: LLMs improve skill extraction in low-resource languages like Turkish. The study encourages similar research for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Skill extraction is a critical component of modern recruitment systems, enabling efficient job matching, personalized recommendations, and labor market analysis. Despite Türkiye's significant role in the global workforce, Turkish, a morphologically complex language, lacks both a skill taxonomy and a dedicated skill extraction dataset, resulting in underexplored research in skill extraction for Turkish. This article seeks the answers to three research questions: 1) How can skill extraction be effectively performed for this language, in light of its low resource nature? 2)~What is the most promising model? 3) What is the impact of different Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompting strategies on skill extraction (i.e., dynamic vs. static few-shot samples, varying context information, and encouraging causal reasoning)? The article introduces the first Turkish skill extraction dataset and performance evaluations of automated skill extraction using LLMs. The manually annotated dataset contains 4,819 labeled skill spans from 327 job postings across different occupation areas. The use of LLM outperforms supervised sequence labeling when used in an end-to-end pipeline, aligning extracted spans with standardized skills in the ESCO taxonomy more effectively. The best-performing configuration, utilizing Claude Sonnet 3.7 with dynamic few-shot prompting for skill identification, embedding-based retrieval, and LLM-based reranking for skill linking, achieves an end-to-end performance of 0.56, positioning Turkish alongside similar studies in other languages, which are few in the literature. Our findings suggest that LLMs can improve skill extraction performance in low-resource settings, and we hope that our work will accelerate similar research on skill extraction for underrepresented languages.

*Jio Oh,Paul Vicinanza,Thomas Butler,Steven Euijong Whang,Dezhi Hong,Amani Namboori*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MDial introduces a framework for multi-dialectal conversational data generation, addressing gaps in LLM performance for non-Standard American English dialects, with independent evaluations showing high data quality and revealing significant challenges for LLMs in dialect identification and response generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the underperformance and stereotyped responses of LLMs for the 80% of English speakers who do not use Standard American English, highlighting the underexplored area of multi-dialectal performance.

Method: MDial uses a rule-based LLM transformation, designed with native linguists, to generate multi-dialectal conversational data covering lexical, orthographic, and morphosyntactic features for nine English dialects. The pipeline constructs MDialBench, a dialect-parallel benchmark with 50k+ dialogs (97k+ QA pairs), evaluating 17 LLMs on dialect identification and response generation.

Result: Independent evaluations confirm high data quality, with annotators preferring MDial outputs in 98% of comparisons for dialect naturalness. LLMs, including frontier models, struggle with dialect identification (under 70% accuracy, below 50% for Canadian English) and misclassify non-SAE dialects as American or British.

Conclusion: The study reveals that LLMs face significant challenges in dialect identification and response generation, risking cascading failures in downstream tasks. It emphasizes that up to 90% of grammatical features in dialects should not be reproduced by models.

Abstract: More than 80% of the 1.6 billion English speakers do not use Standard American English (SAE) and experience higher failure rates and stereotyped responses when interacting with LLMs as a result. Yet multi-dialectal performance remains underexplored. We introduce $\textbf{MDial}$, the first large-scale framework for generating multi-dialectal conversational data encompassing the three pillars of written dialect -- lexical (vocabulary), orthographic (spelling), and morphosyntactic (grammar) features -- for nine English dialects. Partnering with native linguists, we design an annotated and scalable rule-based LLM transformation to ensure precision. Our approach challenges the assumption that models should mirror users' morphosyntactic features, showing that up to 90% of the grammatical features of a dialect should not be reproduced by models. Independent evaluations confirm data quality, with annotators preferring MDial outputs over prior methods in 98% of pairwise comparisons for dialect naturalness. Using this pipeline, we construct the dialect-parallel $\textbf{MDialBench}$mark with 50k+ dialogs, resulting in 97k+ QA pairs, and evaluate 17 LLMs on dialect identification and response generation tasks. Even frontier models achieve under 70% accuracy, fail to reach 50% for Canadian English, and systematically misclassify non-SAE dialects as American or British. As dialect identification underpins natural language understanding, these errors risk cascading failures into downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new paradigm called 'Silent Thought, Spoken Answer' where speech models generate text reasoning traces alongside spoken responses to improve accuracy and quality. They present a diffusion-based model unifying speech and text, achieving state-of-the-art performance in speech QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech language models generate responses directly without reasoning traces, leading to irreversible errors. Addressing this gap, the paper proposes integrating internal text reasoning to enhance speech quality and correctness.

Method: The authors introduce a diffusion-based speech-text language model (	extbackslash{}method{}) that jointly generates reasoning traces and speech tokens through iterative denoising. Unique masking schedules are used for different modalities, unifying discrete text and tokenized speech.

Result: Experiments reveal 	extbackslash{}method{} achieves state-of-the-art speech-to-speech QA accuracy (9 points higher than baselines), best TTS quality (6.2% WER), and strong language understanding (66.2% MMLU). Both diffusion architecture and reasoning traces contribute to improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed 'Silent Thought, Spoken Answer' paradigm and diffusion-based model (	extbackslash{}method{}) significantly enhance speech generation by integrating reasoning traces, demonstrating superior performance in QA tasks and speech quality.

Abstract: Current speech language models generate responses directly without explicit reasoning, leading to errors that cannot be corrected once audio is produced. We introduce \textbf{``Silent Thought, Spoken Answer''} -- a paradigm where speech LLMs generate internal text reasoning alongside spoken responses, with thinking traces informing speech quality. To realize this, we present \method{}, the first diffusion-based speech-text language model supporting both understanding and generation, unifying discrete text and tokenized speech under a single masked diffusion framework. Unlike autoregressive approaches, \method{} jointly generates reasoning traces and speech tokens through iterative denoising, with modality-specific masking schedules. We also construct \dataset{}, the first speech QA dataset with paired text reasoning traces, containing 26K samples totaling 319 hours. Experiments show \method{} achieves state-of-the-art speech-to-speech QA accuracy, outperforming the best baseline by up to 9 points, while attaining the best TTS quality among generative models (6.2\% WER) and preserving language understanding (66.2\% MMLU). Ablations confirm that both the diffusion architecture and thinking traces contribute to these gains.

*Alhassan Abdelhalim,Janick Edinger,Sören Laue,Michaela Regneri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates LLMs' linguistic abstraction mechanisms and challenges common explainability methods, revealing flaws in attention-based and embedding-based interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how linguistic abstraction emerges in LLMs and test the reliability of popular explainability methods.

Method: Used probing for token-level relational structures and feature-mapping with embeddings to detect linguistic abstraction in LLMs.

Result: Both methods failed due to methodological issues, questioning their validity as evidence for LLMs' understanding.

Conclusion: Current explainability techniques are unreliable, which has critical implications for LLM deployment in pervasive computing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in pervasive computing due to their versatility and strong performance. However, despite their ubiquitous use, the exact mechanisms underlying their outstanding performance remain unclear. Different methods for LLM explainability exist, and many are, as a method, not fully understood themselves. We started with the question of how linguistic abstraction emerges in LLMs, aiming to detect it across different LLM modules (attention heads and input embeddings). For this, we used methods well-established in the literature: (1) probing for token-level relational structures, and (2) feature-mapping using embeddings as carriers of human-interpretable properties.
  Both attempts failed for different methodological reasons: Attention-based explanations collapsed once we tested the core assumption that later-layer representations still correspond to tokens. Property-inference methods applied to embeddings also failed because their high predictive scores were driven by methodological artifacts and dataset structure rather than meaningful semantic knowledge. These failures matter because both techniques are widely treated as evidence for what LLMs supposedly understand, yet our results show such conclusions are unwarranted. These limitations are particularly relevant in pervasive and distributed computing settings where LLMs are deployed as system components and interpretability methods are relied upon for debugging, compression, and explaining models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an alignment-flexible supervision strategy to improve masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) for open-ended text generation, addressing their sensitivity to token misalignment during decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDLMs lag behind autoregressive models in open-ended text generation due to strict positional prediction, making decoding sensitive to token misalignment.

Method: Introduce a special token <slack> via the connectionist temporal classification objective during fine-tuning to relax strict positional supervision.

Result: The method outperforms the original MDLM model on five benchmarks, improving robustness to positional shifts.

Conclusion: Relaxing strict positional supervision enhances generation quality in MDLMs.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to dominant autoregressive approaches. Although they achieve competitive performance on several tasks, a substantial gap remains in open-ended text generation. We hypothesize that one cause of this gap is that strict positional prediction makes MDLM decoding highly sensitive to token misalignment, and we show through controlled interventions that a one-position shift can severely disrupt semantics. This observation suggests that enforcing strict positional supervision during training is misaligned with the irreversible denoising dynamics of MDLM decoding. Motivated by this mismatch, we adopt an alignment-flexible supervision strategy during fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce a special token <slack> via the connectionist temporal classification objective. We apply this approach to the widely used MDLM model and conduct experiments on five open-ended text generation benchmarks. Our method consistently outperforms the original model and improves robustness to positional shifts, indicating that relaxing strict positional supervision is an important factor in improving generation quality in MDLMs.

TL;DR: FraudCoT enhances fraud detection on text-attributed graphs by combining autonomous CoT reasoning with scalable LLM-GNN co-training, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-enhanced GNN approaches for fraud detection are limited by predefined prompts and decoupled training, hindering reasoning autonomy and semantic-structural alignment.

Method: FraudCoT introduces fraud-aware selective CoT distillation for diverse reasoning paths and integrates distilled CoTs into node texts. It also uses an asymmetric co-training strategy for efficient optimization.

Result: FraudCoT achieves up to 8.8% AUPRC improvement and a 1,066x speedup in training throughput compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FraudCoT significantly advances fraud detection performance and efficiency by aligning semantic-structural understanding through autonomous reasoning and scalable co-training.

Abstract: Graph-based fraud detection on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) requires jointly modeling rich textual semantics and relational dependencies. However, existing LLM-enhanced GNN approaches are constrained by predefined prompting and decoupled training pipelines, limiting reasoning autonomy and weakening semantic-structural alignment. We propose FraudCoT, a unified framework that advances TAG-based fraud detection through autonomous, graph-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and scalable LLM-GNN co-training. To address the limitations of predefined prompts, we introduce a fraud-aware selective CoT distillation mechanism that generates diverse reasoning paths and enhances semantic-structural understanding. These distilled CoTs are integrated into node texts, providing GNNs with enriched, multi-hop semantic and structural cues for fraud detection. Furthermore, we develop an efficient asymmetric co-training strategy that enables end-to-end optimization while significantly reducing the computational cost of naive joint training. Extensive experiments on public and industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FraudCoT achieves up to 8.8% AUPRC improvement over state-of-the-art methods and delivers up to 1,066x speedup in training throughput, substantially advancing both detection performance and efficiency.

TL;DR: Residual Context Diffusion (RCD) improves block-wise dLLMs by recycling discarded token computations, boosting accuracy with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dLLMs waste computation by discarding tokens; recycling their contextual information could enhance efficiency and performance.

Method: Proposes RCD, a module that repurposes discarded tokens into contextual residuals, using a decoupled two-stage training pipeline.

Result: RCD improves accuracy by 5-10 points and reduces denoising steps by up to 5x, nearly doubling performance on challenging tasks.

Conclusion: RCD efficiently enhances dLLMs with minimal training data and computational overhead, making it a practical advancement.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to purely autoregressive language models because they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, state-of-the-art block-wise dLLMs rely on a "remasking" mechanism that decodes only the most confident tokens and discards the rest, effectively wasting computation. We demonstrate that recycling computation from the discarded tokens is beneficial, as these tokens retain contextual information useful for subsequent decoding iterations. In light of this, we propose Residual Context Diffusion (RCD), a module that converts these discarded token representations into contextual residuals and injects them back for the next denoising step. RCD uses a decoupled two-stage training pipeline to bypass the memory bottlenecks associated with backpropagation. We validate our method on both long CoT reasoning (SDAR) and short CoT instruction following (LLaDA) models. We demonstrate that a standard dLLM can be efficiently converted to the RCD paradigm with merely ~1 billion tokens. RCD consistently improves frontier dLLMs by 5-10 points in accuracy with minimal extra computation overhead across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, on the most challenging AIME tasks, RCD nearly doubles baseline accuracy and attains up to 4-5x fewer denoising steps at equivalent accuracy levels.

TL;DR: The paper explores how outliers (attention and residual sinks) in large language models interact with normalization to rescale non-outlier components, termed outlier-driven rescaling. It validates this across architectures and token counts, showing their role in training stability and performance. Mitigation strategies improve training and quantization robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the functional role of outliers (attention and residual sinks) in large language models and their interaction with normalization, aiming to unify their origin and mitigation.

Method: Hypothesizes outlier-driven rescaling, validates across architectures/token counts, tests outlier removal/clipping, and explores mitigation via learnable parameters or gated rescaling.

Result: Outliers work with normalization for stability; their contribution is smaller than non-outliers. Mitigation improves training (+2 points) and quantization robustness (-1.2 points degradation under W4A4 quantization).

Conclusion: Outliers function jointly with normalization for stability and performance. Mitigation strategies enhance training and quantization robustness, highlighting their rescaling role.

Abstract: We investigate the functional role of emergent outliers in large language models, specifically attention sinks (a few tokens that consistently receive large attention logits) and residual sinks (a few fixed dimensions with persistently large activations across most tokens). We hypothesize that these outliers, in conjunction with the corresponding normalizations (\textit{e.g.}, softmax attention and RMSNorm), effectively rescale other non-outlier components. We term this phenomenon \textit{outlier-driven rescaling} and validate this hypothesis across different model architectures and training token counts. This view unifies the origin and mitigation of both sink types. Our main conclusions and observations include: (1) Outliers function jointly with normalization: removing normalization eliminates the corresponding outliers but degrades training stability and performance; directly clipping outliers while retaining normalization leads to degradation, indicating that outlier-driven rescaling contributes to training stability. (2) Outliers serve more as rescale factors rather than contributors, as the final contributions of attention and residual sinks are significantly smaller than those of non-outliers. (3) Outliers can be absorbed into learnable parameters or mitigated via explicit gated rescaling, leading to improved training performance (average gain of 2 points) and enhanced quantization robustness (1.2 points degradation under W4A4 quantization).

TL;DR: The paper evaluates political bias in LLMs across 50 countries and 33 languages, introducing Cross-Lingual Alignment Steering (CLAS) to mitigate bias while maintaining response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of research on cross-lingual consistency and safe mitigation of political bias in LLMs, especially beyond Western languages.

Method: Introduces CLAS, a post-hoc mitigation framework aligning ideological representations across languages and dynamically regulating intervention strength.

Result: Demonstrates significant bias reduction on economic and social axes without major degradation in response quality.

Conclusion: CLAS offers a scalable and interpretable approach for fairness-aware multilingual LLM governance, balancing neutrality with diversity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly shape global discourse, making fairness and ideological neutrality essential for responsible AI deployment. Despite growing attention to political bias in LLMs, prior work largely focuses on high-resource, Western languages or narrow multilingual settings, leaving cross-lingual consistency and safe post-hoc mitigation underexplored. To address this gap, we present a large-scale multilingual evaluation of political bias spanning 50 countries and 33 languages. We introduce a complementary post-hoc mitigation framework, Cross-Lingual Alignment Steering (CLAS), designed to augment existing steering methods by aligning ideological representations across languages and dynamically regulating intervention strength. This method aligns latent ideological representations induced by political prompts into a shared ideological subspace, ensuring cross lingual consistency, with the adaptive mechanism prevents over correction and preserves coherence. Experiments demonstrate substantial bias reduction along both economic and social axes with minimal degradation in response quality. The proposed framework establishes a scalable and interpretable paradigm for fairness-aware multilingual LLM governance, balancing ideological neutrality with linguistic and cultural diversity.

TL;DR: InstructDiff uses differential entropy to select training data domain-adaptively, improving performance with only 10% of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data selection methods lack domain generality, leading to inefficiencies in adapting large language models.

Method: Introduces InstructDiff, leveraging differential entropy via warmup calibration, bi-directional NLL filtering, and entropy-based ranking.

Result: Achieves 17% improvement on mathematical reasoning and 52% on general tasks over full-data training.

Conclusion: InstructDiff efficiently selects optimal data across domains, reducing training costs.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is fundamental to adapting large language models, yet training on complete datasets incurs prohibitive costs with diminishing returns. Existing data selection methods suffer from severe domain specificity: techniques optimized for general instruction-following fail on reasoning tasks, and vice versa. We observe that measuring entropy differences between base models and minimally instruction-tuned calibrated models reveals a pattern -- samples with the lowest differential entropy consistently yield optimal performance across domains, yet this principle manifests domain-adaptively: reasoning tasks favor entropy increase (cognitive expansion), while general tasks favor entropy decrease (cognitive compression). We introduce InstructDiff, a unified framework that operationalizes differential entropy as a domain-adaptive selection criterion through warmup calibration, bi-directional NLL filtering, and entropy-based ranking. Extensive experiments show that InstructDiff achieves 17\% relative improvement over full data training on mathematical reasoning and 52\% for general instruction-following, outperforming prior baselines while using only 10\% of the data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DimABSA introduces a dimensional approach to Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) using continuous valence-arousal scores, creating a multilingual resource and new subtasks for fine-grained sentiment analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ABSA relies on coarse-grained labels, limiting nuanced sentiment capture. A dimensional approach with continuous scores addresses this gap.

Method: DimABSA combines traditional ABSA elements with VA scores, spans six languages and four domains, and introduces new subtasks. A unified metric, cF1, evaluates performance.

Result: DimABSA contains 76,958 aspect instances across 42,590 sentences and serves as a challenging benchmark for multilingual dimensional ABSA.

Conclusion: DimABSA advances ABSA by enabling fine-grained sentiment analysis and provides a foundation for future multilingual research.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) focuses on extracting sentiment at a fine-grained aspect level and has been widely applied across real-world domains. However, existing ABSA research relies on coarse-grained categorical labels (e.g., positive, negative), which limits its ability to capture nuanced affective states. To address this limitation, we adopt a dimensional approach that represents sentiment with continuous valence-arousal (VA) scores, enabling fine-grained analysis at both the aspect and sentiment levels. To this end, we introduce DimABSA, the first multilingual, dimensional ABSA resource annotated with both traditional ABSA elements (aspect terms, aspect categories, and opinion terms) and newly introduced VA scores. This resource contains 76,958 aspect instances across 42,590 sentences, spanning six languages and four domains. We further introduce three subtasks that combine VA scores with different ABSA elements, providing a bridge from traditional ABSA to dimensional ABSA. Given that these subtasks involve both categorical and continuous outputs, we propose a new unified metric, continuous F1 (cF1), which incorporates VA prediction error into standard F1. We provide a comprehensive benchmark using both prompted and fine-tuned large language models across all subtasks. Our results show that DimABSA is a challenging benchmark and provides a foundation for advancing multilingual dimensional ABSA.

*Yanghao Su,Wenbo Zhou,Tianwei Zhang,Qiu Han,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Jie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emergent Misalignment in LLMs stems from behavioral shifts due to fine-tuning on narrowly scoped data, not just errors or unsafe content. Character-level dispositions cause strong, transferable misalignment while preserving capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge prior explanations attributing emergent misalignment to generalization of errors or unsafe content, revealing deeper behavioral shifts.

Method: Analyzed fine-tuning effects across domains/model families, comparing incorrect-advice vs. character-level disposition training.

Result: Character-level dispositions induce stronger misalignment, preserved general capabilities, and conditional activation via triggers/prompts.

Conclusion: Behavioral dispositions are a key alignment risk; robust alignment requires addressing these, not just errors or prompt defenses.

Abstract: Emergent Misalignment refers to a failure mode in which fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on narrowly scoped data induces broadly misaligned behavior. Prior explanations mainly attribute this phenomenon to the generalization of erroneous or unsafe content. In this work, we show that this view is incomplete. Across multiple domains and model families, we find that fine-tuning models on data exhibiting specific character-level dispositions induces substantially stronger and more transferable misalignment than incorrect-advice fine-tuning, while largely preserving general capabilities. This indicates that emergent misalignment arises from stable shifts in model behavior rather than from capability degradation or corrupted knowledge. We further show that such behavioral dispositions can be conditionally activated by both training-time triggers and inference-time persona-aligned prompts, revealing shared structure across emergent misalignment, backdoor activation, and jailbreak susceptibility. Overall, our results identify character formation as a central and underexplored alignment risk, suggesting that robust alignment must address behavioral dispositions rather than isolated errors or prompt-level defenses.

*Joseph Marvin Imperial,Harish Tayyar Madabushi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEF is a dynamic safety protocol inspired by human cognitive defenses, improving LLMs' ability to detect and refuse maliciously perturbed policy texts like HIPAA and GDPR, achieving high detection rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLM robustness against deceptive attacks involving manipulated legal texts, especially in high-stakes applications like data privacy compliance.

Method: Introduces DEF, a protocol that uses textual cues to nudge LLMs to flag inconsistencies, refuse compliance, and rely on parametric knowledge when encountering perturbed policy texts.

Result: DEF significantly improves LLMs' detection and refusal of deceptive policy texts, with DeepSeek-R1 achieving a 100% detection rate in one scenario.

Conclusion: The study advocates for cognitively inspired defenses to bolster LLM resilience against deceptive attacks exploiting legal artifacts.

Abstract: Humans develop a series of cognitive defenses, known as epistemic vigilance, to combat risks of deception and misinformation from everyday interactions. Developing safeguards for LLMs inspired by this mechanism might be particularly helpful for their application in high-stakes tasks such as automating compliance with data privacy laws. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Epistemic Fallback (DEF), a dynamic safety protocol for improving an LLM's inference-time defenses against deceptive attacks that make use of maliciously perturbed policy texts. Through various levels of one-sentence textual cues, DEF nudges LLMs to flag inconsistencies, refuse compliance, and fallback to their parametric knowledge upon encountering perturbed policy texts. Using globally recognized legal policies such as HIPAA and GDPR, our empirical evaluations report that DEF effectively improves the capability of frontier LLMs to detect and refuse perturbed versions of policies, with DeepSeek-R1 achieving a 100% detection rate in one setting. This work encourages further efforts to develop cognitively inspired defenses to improve LLM robustness against forms of harm and deception that exploit legal artifacts.

*Yilun Hua,Giuseppe Castellucci,Peter Schulam,Heba Elfardy,Kevin Small*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GroGU is a model-specific, reference-free metric for quantifying content utility in RAG, using LLM generation confidence based on entropy. It improves RAG performance without annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for content utility in RAG lack model-specificity and depend on costly annotations, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes GroGU, a metric based on downstream LLM's generation confidence (entropy). Uses it to train a query-rewriter for RAG via high-utility preference data.

Result: Improves Mean Reciprocal Rank by up to 18.2 points and answer accuracy by up to 9.4 points.

Conclusion: GroGU effectively quantifies content utility for RAG, enhancing performance without needing annotations.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)'s success depends on the utility the LLM derives from the content used for grounding. Quantifying content utility does not have a definitive specification and existing metrics ignore model-specific capabilities and/or rely on costly annotations. In this paper, we propose Grounding Generation Utility (GroGU), a model-specific and reference-free metric that defines utility as a function of the downstream LLM's generation confidence based on entropy. Despite having no annotation requirements, GroGU is largely faithful in distinguishing ground-truth documents while capturing nuances ignored by LLM-agnostic metrics. We apply GroGU to train a query-rewriter for RAG by identifying high-utility preference data for Direct Preference Optimization. Experiments show improvements by up to 18.2 points in Mean Reciprocal Rank and up to 9.4 points in answer accuracy.

*Lan Zhang,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reference-free iterative monotonic process for full-theorem autoformalization, optimizing multiple quality dimensions using complementary feedback from theorem provers and LLM-based judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in statement autoformalization struggle to jointly optimize multiple quality dimensions, which is critical for full-theorem autoformalization.

Method: A reference-free iterative process leverages feedback from theorem provers and LLM-based judges, optimizing a masked composite objective over Formal Validity, Logical Preservation, Mathematical Consistency, and Formal Quality.

Result: Achieves 93.44% formal validity and 78.22% overall score on miniF2F, and 44.09% formal validity and 29.79% overall score on ProofNet.

Conclusion: The proposed process enables simultaneous improvement across multiple dimensions, demonstrating effectiveness in full-theorem autoformalization.

Abstract: While statement autoformalization has advanced rapidly, full-theorem autoformalization remains largely unexplored. Existing iterative refinement methods in statement autoformalization typicall improve isolated aspects of formalization, such as syntactic correctness, but struggle to jointly optimizing multiple quality dimensions, which is critical for full-theorem autoformalization. We introduce a reference-free iterative monotonic process for full-theorem autoformalization that leverages complementary feedback from theorem provers and LLM-based judges, without access to ground-truth proofs or existing formalizations at inference time. Our approach optimizes a masked composite objective over Formal Validity, Logical Preservation, Mathematical Consistency, and Formal Quality, guided by a responsiveness map that indicates how different LLMs acting as different roles preferentially improve each dimension. We further propose an acceptance policy that guarantees certified monotonic improvement, and provide conditions ensuring convergence and termination. Empirical experiments demonstrate the proposed process enables simultaneous improvement across multiple dimensions, achieving 93.44% formal validity and a 78.22% overall score on miniF2F, and 44.09% formal validity and a 29.79% overall score on ProofNet.

*Siyang He,Qiqi Wang,Xiaoran Liu,Hongnan Ma,Yiwei Shi,Yuerong Song,Ying Zhu,Tianyi Liang,Zengfeng Huang,Ziwei He,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FourierSampler, a novel decoding strategy for diffusion language models (dLLMs) that addresses positional bias by analyzing spectral characteristics and dynamically guiding generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decoding strategies for dLLMs exhibit positional bias, limiting their potential for arbitrary generation.

Method: The authors analyze spectral characteristics of dLLMs, revealing low-frequency components encode global structure and high-frequency components local details. They propose FourierSampler, a frequency-domain sliding window mechanism.

Result: FourierSampler outperforms other strategies, achieving 20.4% and 16.0% improvements on tasks and surpassing autoregressive models like Llama3.1-8B-Instruct.

Conclusion: FourierSampler effectively unlocks dLLMs' potential by addressing positional bias and enabling 'structure-to-detail' generation.

Abstract: Despite the non-autoregressive potential of diffusion language models (dLLMs), existing decoding strategies demonstrate positional bias, failing to fully unlock the potential of arbitrary generation. In this work, we delve into the inherent spectral characteristics of dLLMs and present the first frequency-domain analysis showing that low-frequency components in hidden states primarily encode global structural information and long-range dependencies, while high-frequency components are responsible for characterizing local details. Based on this observation, we propose FourierSampler, which leverages a frequency-domain sliding window mechanism to dynamically guide the model to achieve a "structure-to-detail" generation. FourierSampler outperforms other inference enhancement strategies on LLADA and SDAR, achieving relative improvements of 20.4% on LLaDA1.5-8B and 16.0% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct. It notably surpasses similarly sized autoregressive models like Llama3.1-8B-Instruct.

Result: Baseline evaluations reveal higher performance in English and Spanish but significant degradation in other languages, highlighting gaps in multilingual MRC for HR applications.

Conclusion: JobResQA serves as a valuable benchmark for advancing fair and reliable LLM-based HR systems, with publicly available data for reproducibility.

Abstract: We introduce JobResQA, a multilingual Question Answering benchmark for evaluating Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) capabilities of LLMs on HR-specific tasks involving résumés and job descriptions. The dataset comprises 581 QA pairs across 105 synthetic résumé-job description pairs in five languages (English, Spanish, Italian, German, and Chinese), with questions spanning three complexity levels from basic factual extraction to complex cross-document reasoning.

*Fanmeng Wang,Haotian Liu,Guojiang Zhao,Hongteng Xu,Zhifeng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReGuLaR introduces a latent reasoning method using VAE and visual-semantic representations to compress reasoning chains efficiently, outperforming existing methods in computational efficiency and reasoning effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explicit reasoning chains in LLMs cause computational redundancy, and latent reasoning methods degrade performance due to poor compression guidance.

Method: ReGuLaR uses VAE to sample latent reasoning states from posterior distributions, regularized by dense visual-semantic representations from rendered reasoning chains.

Result: ReGuLaR outperforms existing latent reasoning methods in efficiency and effectiveness, even surpassing CoT through multi-modal reasoning.

Conclusion: ReGuLaR provides an efficient and effective solution to latent reasoning with minimal information loss.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) significantly enhances the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), explicit reasoning chains introduce substantial computational redundancy. Recent latent reasoning methods attempt to mitigate this by compressing reasoning processes into latent space, but often suffer from severe performance degradation due to the lack of appropriate compression guidance. In this study, we propose Rendered CoT-Guided variational Latent Reasoning (ReGuLaR), a simple yet novel latent learning paradigm resolving this issue. Fundamentally, we formulate latent reasoning within the Variational Auto-Encoding (VAE) framework, sampling the current latent reasoning state from the posterior distribution conditioned on previous ones. Specifically, when learning this variational latent reasoning model, we render explicit reasoning chains as images, from which we extract dense visual-semantic representations to regularize the posterior distribution, thereby achieving efficient compression with minimal information loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReGuLaR significantly outperforms existing latent reasoning methods across both computational efficiency and reasoning effectiveness, and even surpasses CoT through multi-modal reasoning, providing a new and insightful solution to latent reasoning.

*Zhongxiang Sun,Qipeng Wang,Weijie Yu,Jingxuan Yang,Haolang Lu,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DS-MCM enhances deep search agents by adding hierarchical metacognitive monitoring to regulate reasoning and retrieval, improving performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep search agents lack mechanisms to monitor and regulate reasoning and retrieval under uncertainty, leading to practical failures.

Method: DS-MCM integrates a Fast Consistency Monitor for lightweight checks and a Slow Experience-Driven Monitor for corrective interventions based on historical data.

Result: Experiments show DS-MCM improves performance and robustness across multiple deep search benchmarks and backbone models.

Conclusion: Hierarchical metacognitive monitoring effectively addresses failures in deep search agents by integrating fast anomaly detection and experience-driven reflection.

Abstract: Deep search agents powered by large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in multi-step retrieval, reasoning, and long-horizon task execution. However, their practical failures often stem from the lack of mechanisms to monitor and regulate reasoning and retrieval states as tasks evolve under uncertainty. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that human metacognition is hierarchically organized, integrating fast anomaly detection with selectively triggered, experience-driven reflection. In this work, we propose Deep Search with Meta-Cognitive Monitoring (DS-MCM), a deep search framework augmented with an explicit hierarchical metacognitive monitoring mechanism. DS-MCM integrates a Fast Consistency Monitor, which performs lightweight checks on the alignment between external evidence and internal reasoning confidence, and a Slow Experience-Driven Monitor, which is selectively activated to guide corrective intervention based on experience memory from historical agent trajectories. By embedding monitoring directly into the reasoning-retrieval loop, DS-MCM determines both when intervention is warranted and how corrective actions should be informed by prior experience. Experiments across multiple deep search benchmarks and backbone models demonstrate that DS-MCM consistently improves performance and robustness.

*Hao Xu,Alisa Liu,Jonathan Hayase,Yejin Choi,Noah A. Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the partial token problem in language models (LMs) where token boundaries mismatch with word boundaries, affecting predictions. It identifies affected domains, measures prevalence, and evaluates mitigations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the distortion in next-token predictions caused by misaligned token and word boundaries in realistic prompts.

Method: Identify domains with frequent misalignment (e.g., languages without whitespace, compounding languages, code). Construct natural prompts ending with partial tokens and measure prediction degradation. Evaluate mitigations.

Result: Up to 25% misalignment in Chinese prompts; LMs show severe prediction degradation (3x less probability). Degradation persists or worsens with larger models. Mitigations validated.

Conclusion: Partial token issues are severe and scalable in realistic use cases. Practical solutions exist for inference providers.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are trained over sequences of tokens, whereas users interact with LMs via text. This mismatch gives rise to the partial token problem, which occurs when a user ends their prompt in the middle of the expected next-token, leading to distorted next-token predictions. Although this issue has been studied using arbitrary character prefixes, its prevalence and severity in realistic prompts respecting word boundaries remains underexplored. In this work, we identify three domains where token and "word" boundaries often do not line up: languages that do not use whitespace, highly compounding languages, and code. In Chinese, for example, up to 25% of word boundaries do not line up with token boundaries, making even natural, word-complete prompts susceptible to this problem. We systematically construct semantically natural prompts ending with a partial tokens; in experiments, we find that they comprise a serious failure mode: frontier LMs consistently place three orders of magnitude less probability on the correct continuation compared to when the prompt is "backed-off" to be token-aligned. This degradation does not diminish with scale and often worsens for larger models. Finally, we evaluate inference-time mitigations to the partial token problem and validate the effectiveness of recent exact solutions. Overall, we demonstrate the scale and severity of probability distortion caused by tokenization in realistic use cases, and provide practical recommentions for model inference providers.

TL;DR: The paper explores security vulnerabilities in large audio-language models introduced by raw speech inputs, demonstrating a successful text-to-audio jailbreak attack with a 98.26% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the security risks arising from the shift to raw speech inputs in audio-language models, which are not well-characterized.

Method: Designing a text-to-audio jailbreak attack using a narrative-style audio stream and an advanced TTS model to exploit structural and acoustic properties.

Result: The attack achieved a 98.26% success rate in eliciting restricted outputs from state-of-the-art models, outperforming text-only methods.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for safety frameworks that address both linguistic and paralinguistic aspects in speech-based interfaces.

Abstract: Large audio-language models increasingly operate on raw speech inputs, enabling more seamless integration across domains such as voice assistants, education, and clinical triage. This transition, however, introduces a distinct class of vulnerabilities that remain largely uncharacterized. We examine the security implications of this modality shift by designing a text-to-audio jailbreak that embeds disallowed directives within a narrative-style audio stream. The attack leverages an advanced instruction-following text-to-speech (TTS) model to exploit structural and acoustic properties, thereby circumventing safety mechanisms primarily calibrated for text. When delivered through synthetic speech, the narrative format elicits restricted outputs from state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.0 Flash, achieving a 98.26% success rate that substantially exceeds text-only baselines. These results highlight the need for safety frameworks that jointly reason over linguistic and paralinguistic representations, particularly as speech-based interfaces become more prevalent.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in autonomous AI scientists powered by language models, generating publication-ready illustrations remains a labor-intensive bottleneck in the research workflow. To lift this burden, we introduce PaperBanana, an agentic framework for automated generation of publication-ready academic illustrations. Powered by state-of-the-art VLMs and image generation models, PaperBanana orchestrates specialized agents to retrieve references, plan content and style, render images, and iteratively refine via self-critique. To rigorously evaluate our framework, we introduce PaperBananaBench, comprising 292 test cases for methodology diagrams curated from NeurIPS 2025 publications, covering diverse research domains and illustration styles. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PaperBanana consistently outperforms leading baselines in faithfulness, conciseness, readability, and aesthetics. We further show that our method effectively extends to the generation of high-quality statistical plots. Collectively, PaperBanana paves the way for the automated generation of publication-ready illustrations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JAF (Judge Agent Forest) is a framework where judge agents evaluate query-response pairs collectively, enabling holistic learning and iterative refinement of reasoning processes. It integrates belief propagation and ensemble-learning principles, uses ICL for instantiation, and employs a novel LSH algorithm for exemplar selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to elevate judge agents from local evaluators to holistic learners by assessing related responses collectively, improving primary agent performance through aggregate feedback.

Method: JAF combines belief propagation and ensemble-learning principles, using in-context neighborhoods for critique propagation. It employs a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm integrating semantic embeddings, LLM-driven hash predicates, and supervision for exemplar selection.

Result: JAF validates its effectiveness empirically on cloud misconfigs triage in large-scale cloud environments, showcasing improved performance through collective evaluation.

Conclusion: JAF bridges gaps in judge agent frameworks by enabling holistic assessment and iterative refinement, leveraging collective perspectives and advanced exemplar selection techniques.

Abstract: Judge agents are fundamental to agentic AI frameworks: they provide automated evaluation, and enable iterative self-refinement of reasoning processes. We introduce JAF: Judge Agent Forest, a framework in which the judge agent conducts joint inference across a cohort of query--response pairs generated by a primary agent, rather than evaluating each in isolation. This paradigm elevates the judge from a local evaluator to a holistic learner: by simultaneously assessing related responses, the judge discerns cross-instance patterns and inconsistencies, whose aggregate feedback enables the primary agent to improve by viewing its own outputs through the judge's collective perspective.
  Conceptually, JAF bridges belief propagation and ensemble-learning principles: overlapping in-context neighborhoods induce a knowledge-graph structure that facilitates propagation of critique, and repeated, randomized evaluations yield a robust ensemble of context-sensitive judgments. JAF can be instantiated entirely via ICL, with the judge prompted for each query using its associated primary-agent response plus a small, possibly noisy set of peer exemplars. While kNN in embedding space is a natural starting point for exemplars, this approach overlooks categorical structure, domain metadata, or nuanced distinctions accessible to modern LLMs.
  To overcome these limitations, we develop a flexible locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that learns informative binary codes by integrating semantic embeddings, LLM-driven hash predicates, supervision from categorical labels, and relevant side information. These hash codes support efficient, interpretable, and relation-aware selection of diverse exemplars, and further optimize exploration of CoT reasoning paths. We validate JAF with an empirical study on the demanding task of cloud misconfigs triage in large-scale cloud environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Six Sigma Agent architecture improves LLM reliability for enterprise use by decomposing tasks, parallel sampling, and consensus voting, achieving exponential error reduction and cost savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the reliability challenges of probabilistic Large Language Models (LLMs) for enterprise deployment.

Method: Task decomposition into atomic actions, parallel execution across diverse LLMs (micro-agent sampling), and consensus voting with dynamic scaling.

Result: Exponential reliability gains (e.g., 0.11% error with 5 agents, 3.4 DPMO with 13 agents) and 80% cost reduction in enterprise use cases.

Conclusion: AI system reliability stems from principled redundancy and consensus, not just model scaling.

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate remarkable capabilities yet remain fundamentally probabilistic, presenting critical reliability challenges for enterprise deployment. We introduce the Six Sigma Agent, a novel architecture that achieves enterprise-grade reliability through three synergistic components: (1) task decomposition into a dependency tree of atomic actions; (2) micro-agent sampling where each task is executed n times in parallel across diverse LLMs to generate independent outputs; and (3) consensus voting with dynamic scaling, clustering outputs and selecting the answer from the winning cluster with maximum votes. We prove that sampling n independent outputs with error rate p achieves system error O(p^{ceil(n/2)}), enabling exponential reliability gains. Even using cheaper models with 5% per-action error, consensus voting with 5 agents reduces error to 0.11%; dynamic scaling to 13 agents achieves 3.4 DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities), the Six Sigma standard. Evaluation across three enterprise use cases demonstrates a 14,700x reliability improvement over single-agent execution while reducing costs by 80%. Our work establishes that reliability in AI systems emerges from principled redundancy and consensus rather than model scaling alone.

TL;DR: The paper identifies LLM-based agents' limitations in long-horizon planning due to step-wise greedy policies and introduces FLARE, a future-aware planning method, to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers observe that LLM agents perform well in short-term reasoning but struggle with long-term planning, highlighting the need for methods that account for delayed consequences.

Method: They propose FLARE (Future-aware Lookahead with Reward Estimation), which integrates explicit lookahead, value propagation, and limited commitment into a single model.

Result: FLARE consistently enhances task performance and planning behavior across benchmarks, even enabling smaller models (LLaMA-8B) to outperform larger ones (GPT-4o) using standard reasoning.

Conclusion: The study distinguishes reasoning from planning and demonstrates FLARE's effectiveness in mitigating the myopic tendencies of step-wise reasoning in LLM agents.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents exhibit strong step-by-step reasoning capabilities over short horizons, yet often fail to sustain coherent behavior over long planning horizons. We argue that this failure reflects a fundamental mismatch: step-wise reasoning induces a form of step-wise greedy policy that is adequate for short horizons but fails in long-horizon planning, where early actions must account for delayed consequences. From this planning-centric perspective, we study LLM-based agents in deterministic, fully structured environments with explicit state transitions and evaluation signals. Our analysis reveals a core failure mode of reasoning-based policies: locally optimal choices induced by step-wise scoring lead to early myopic commitments that are systematically amplified over time and difficult to recover from. We introduce FLARE (Future-aware Lookahead with Reward Estimation) as a minimal instantiation of future-aware planning to enforce explicit lookahead, value propagation, and limited commitment in a single model, allowing downstream outcomes to influence early decisions. Across multiple benchmarks, agent frameworks, and LLM backbones, FLARE consistently improves task performance and planning-level behavior, frequently allowing LLaMA-8B with FLARE to outperform GPT-4o with standard step-by-step reasoning. These results establish a clear distinction between reasoning and planning.

Motivation: Assess whether LLMs exhibit human-like irrationalities and biases when used in high-stakes decision-making or as models of human behavior.

Result: Deliberate thinking improves rationality but amplifies sensitivity to affective interventions. ICP produces extreme shifts, while RLS yields more plausible but less reliable patterns.

Conclusion: LLMs face a tension between reasoning and affective steering, impacting their use in human simulation and safe decision-making systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly positioned as decision engines for hiring, healthcare, and economic judgment, yet real-world human judgment reflects a balance between rational deliberation and emotion-driven bias. If LLMs are to participate in high-stakes decisions or serve as models of human behavior, it is critical to assess whether they exhibit analogous patterns of (ir)rationalities and biases. To this end, we evaluate multiple LLM families on (i) benchmarks testing core axioms of rational choice and (ii) classic decision domains from behavioral economics and social norms where emotions are known to shape judgment and choice. Across settings, we show that deliberate "thinking" reliably improves rationality and pushes models toward expected-value maximization. To probe human-like affective distortions and their interaction with reasoning, we use two emotion-steering methods: in-context priming (ICP) and representation-level steering (RLS). ICP induces strong directional shifts that are often extreme and difficult to calibrate, whereas RLS produces more psychologically plausible patterns but with lower reliability. Our results suggest that the same mechanisms that improve rationality also amplify sensitivity to affective interventions, and that different steering methods trade off controllability against human-aligned behavior. Overall, this points to a tension between reasoning and affective steering, with implications for both human simulation and the safe deployment of LLM-based decision systems.

TL;DR: Gemini was used to evaluate 700 'Open' conjectures in Erdős Problems, combining AI and human expertise to solve 13, revealing that 'Open' status was due to obscurity, not difficulty, and highlighting challenges in AI-assisted math research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore AI's potential in semi-autonomous mathematics discovery by addressing 'Open' conjectures in Erdős Problems, evaluating effectiveness and challenges.

Method: Hybrid approach: AI-driven natural language verification followed by human expert review to assess correctness and novelty.

Result: Solved 13 'Open' problems (5 novel AI solutions, 8 from literature), showing 'Open' status was due to obscurity. Challenges included literature identification and AI 'subconscious plagiarism.'

Conclusion: AI can assist in math research but faces limitations like literature gaps and unintentional plagiarism, suggesting a need for balanced AI-human collaboration.

Abstract: We present a case study in semi-autonomous mathematics discovery, using Gemini to systematically evaluate 700 conjectures labeled 'Open' in Bloom's Erdős Problems database. We employ a hybrid methodology: AI-driven natural language verification to narrow the search space, followed by human expert evaluation to gauge correctness and novelty. We address 13 problems that were marked 'Open' in the database: 5 through seemingly novel autonomous solutions, and 8 through identification of previous solutions in the existing literature. Our findings suggest that the 'Open' status of the problems was through obscurity rather than difficulty. We also identify and discuss issues arising in applying AI to math conjectures at scale, highlighting the difficulty of literature identification and the risk of ''subconscious plagiarism'' by AI. We reflect on the takeaways from AI-assisted efforts on the Erdős Problems.

Result: Achieved 91% accuracy for Experience and Overall rankings, closely matching expert evaluations.

Conclusion: NLP-driven frameworks show promise for scalable, unbiased recruitment; future work focuses on dataset expansion and real-world validation.

Abstract: In this highly competitive employment environment, the selection of suitable personnel is essential for organizational success. This study presents an automated personnel selection system that utilizes sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) methods to assess and rank software engineering applicants. A distinctive dataset was created by aggregating LinkedIn profiles that include essential features such as education, work experience, abilities, and self-introduction, further enhanced with expert assessments to function as standards. The research combines large language models (LLMs) with multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) theory to develop the LLM-TOPSIS framework. In this context, we utilized the TOPSIS method enhanced by fuzzy logic (Fuzzy TOPSIS) to address the intrinsic ambiguity and subjectivity in human assessments. We utilized triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) to describe criteria weights and scores, thereby addressing the ambiguity frequently encountered in candidate evaluations. For candidate ranking, the DistilRoBERTa model was fine-tuned and integrated with the fuzzy TOPSIS method, achieving rankings closely aligned with human expert evaluations and attaining an accuracy of up to 91% for the Experience attribute and the Overall attribute. The study underlines the potential of NLP-driven frameworks to improve recruitment procedures by boosting scalability, consistency, and minimizing prejudice. Future endeavors will concentrate on augmenting the dataset, enhancing model interpretability, and verifying the system in actual recruitment scenarios to better evaluate its practical applicability. This research highlights the intriguing potential of merging NLP with fuzzy decision-making methods in personnel selection, enabling scalable and unbiased solutions to recruitment difficulties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) face high computational costs and latency, and existing selective thinking strategies struggle with uncontrollable errors in dynamic, online settings with partial feedback.

Method: Proposes B-PAC reasoning, using inverse propensity scoring estimators and dynamically adjusting routing thresholds based on statistical safety evidence.

Result: Reduces computational overhead by up to 81.01% while maintaining performance loss below user-specified levels.

Conclusion: B-PAC reasoning offers a scalable and safe solution for efficient query routing in LRMs under partial feedback.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex tasks but suffer from high computational costs and latency. While selective thinking strategies improve efficiency by routing easy queries to non-thinking models, existing approaches often incur uncontrollable errors, especially in online settings where the performance loss of a non-thinking model is only partially observed and data are non-stationary. To address this, we propose Betting Probably Approximately Correct (B-PAC) reasoning, a principled method that enables anytime safe and efficient online reasoning under partial feedback. Specifically, we utilize inverse propensity scoring estimators to construct test supermartingales for candidate thresholds, and then dynamically adjust the routing threshold based on the accumulated statistical evidence of safety. Theoretically, we establish the anytime-valid performance loss control and the efficiency of B-PAC reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that B-PAC reasoning significantly reduces computational overhead, decreasing thinking model usage by up to 81.01\%, while controlling the performance loss below the user-specified level.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SYMPHONY, a multi-agent planning framework using heterogeneous language models to improve diversity and performance in complex problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-agent approaches in MCTS planning limit exploration and diversity, leading to suboptimal performance, motivating the need for a multi-agent solution.

Method: The proposed method, SYMPHONY, integrates a pool of heterogeneous language model-based agents to enhance rollout diversity and exploration.

Result: Empirical results show SYMPHONY performs well with open-source LLMs and further improves with cloud-based LLMs, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: SYMPHONY demonstrates the effectiveness of heterogeneous multi-agent coordination in planning tasks, offering better performance and diversity.

Abstract: Recent advancements have increasingly focused on leveraging large language models (LLMs) to construct autonomous agents for complex problem-solving tasks. However, existing approaches predominantly employ a single-agent framework to generate search branches and estimate rewards during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning. This single-agent paradigm inherently limits exploration capabilities, often resulting in insufficient diversity among generated branches and suboptimal planning performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Synergistic Multi-agent Planning with Heterogeneous langauge model assembly (SYMPHONY), a novel multi-agent planning framework that integrates a pool of heterogeneous language model-based agents. By leveraging diverse reasoning patterns across agents, SYMPHONY enhances rollout diversity and facilitates more effective exploration. Empirical results across multiple benchmark tasks show that SYMPHONY achieves strong performance even when instantiated with open-source LLMs deployable on consumer-grade hardware. When enhanced with cloud-based LLMs accessible via API, SYMPHONY demonstrates further improvements, outperforming existing state-of-the-art baselines and underscoring the effectiveness of heterogeneous multi-agent coordination in planning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing intrinsic motivation methods rely on designer-specified variables, limiting autonomy. CIP aims to eliminate this dependency while connecting intrinsic and extrinsic behaviors.

Method: Derives CIP from Optimal Control, measuring the gap between open-loop and closed-loop Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies to balance chaos and regulation.

Result: CIP demonstrates effectiveness on standard benchmarks, offering theoretical insights into its properties and behavior regulation.

Conclusion: CIP presents a novel, autonomous intrinsic motivation principle, bridging intrinsic and extrinsic behaviors while outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Intrinsic Motivation (IM) is a paradigm for generating intelligent behavior without external utilities. The existing information-theoretic methods for IM are predominantly based on information transmission, which explicitly depends on the designer's choice of which random variables engage in transmission. In this work, we introduce a novel IM principle, Controllable Information Production (CIP), that avoids both external utilities and designer-specified variables. We derive the CIP objective from Optimal Control, showing a connection between extrinsic and intrinsic behaviors. CIP appears as the gap between open-loop and closed-loop Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies, which simultaneously rewards the pursuit and regulation of chaos. We establish key theoretical properties of CIP and demonstrate its effectiveness on standard IM benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TALC is a task-adaptive framework that dynamically selects specialized LLMs and uses MCTS for efficient planning, outperforming baselines in task success and search efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches ignore specialization differences, limiting adaptability to task complexities. TALC addresses this by leveraging specialized LLMs and adaptive planning.

Method: TALC integrates a council of LLMs with MCTS, using success memory profiles for semantic matching and dual-signal mechanisms for dynamic model selection and planning.

Result: Experiments on WebShop, HumanEval, and Game of 24 show TALC achieves higher task success rates and better search efficiency than baselines.

Conclusion: TALC demonstrates the effectiveness of specialization-aware routing and adaptive planning in enhancing LLM decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities across diverse decision-making tasks. However, existing approaches often overlook the specialization differences among available models, treating all LLMs as uniformly applicable regardless of task characteristics. This limits their ability to adapt to varying reasoning demands and task complexities. In this work, we propose Task-Aware LLM Council (TALC), a task-adaptive decision framework that integrates a council of LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enable dynamic expert selection and efficient multi-step planning. Each LLM is equipped with a structured success memory profile derived from prior task trajectories, enabling semantic matching between current reasoning context and past successes. At each decision point, TALC routes control to the most contextually appropriate model and estimates node value using a dual-signal mechanism that fuses model-based evaluations with historical utility scores. These signals are adaptively weighted based on intra-node variance and used to guide MCTS selection, allowing the system to balance exploration depth with planning confidence. Experiments on WebShop, HumanEval, and the Game of 24 demonstrate that TALC achieves superior task success rates and improved search efficiency compared to strong baselines, validating the benefits of specialization-aware routing and adaptive planning.

*Shi Fu,Yingjie Wang,Shengchao Hu,Peng Wang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper provides rigorous theoretical guarantees for Self-Rewarding Language Models (SRLMs), showing their performance improves iteratively with sample size and initial model quality, and explains why they succeed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical understanding of SRLMs' core mechanisms, despite their empirical success in improving alignment without external feedback.

Method: Establishes lower bounds for single update steps, derives finite-sample error bounds for iterative improvement, and connects theory to practical models like linear softmax.

Result: Performance improves at a rate of O~(1/√n) with sample size n, and dependence on initial model quality decays exponentially with iterations T.

Conclusion: SRLMs robustly overcome poor initialization through internal stability and consistency, explaining their empirical success.

Abstract: Self-Rewarding Language Models (SRLMs) achieve notable success in iteratively improving alignment without external feedback. Yet, despite their striking empirical progress, the core mechanisms driving their capabilities remain unelucidated, leaving a critical gap in theoretical understanding. This paper provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantees for SRLMs. We first establish a lower bound that characterizes the fundamental limits of a single update step, revealing a critical dependence on the quality of the initial model. We then derive finite-sample error bounds for the full iterative paradigm, showing that performance improves at a rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/\sqrt{n}\right)$ with sample size $n$. Crucially, our analysis reveals that the dependence on the initial model decays exponentially with the number of iterations $T$. This provides a formal explanation for why self-rewarding succeeds: it robustly overcomes poor initialization by steering the dynamics toward internal stability and consistency. Finally, we instantiate our theoretical framework for the linear softmax model class, yielding tailored guarantees that connect our high-level insights to practical model architectures.

TL;DR: MAPPA finetunes multiagent systems using per-action rewards from AI feedback, improving credit assignment and sample efficiency. It shows significant performance gains in competition math and data analysis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiagent systems face challenges in credit assignment and sample efficiency during finetuning, hindering their scalability for complex tasks.

Method: MAPPA assigns credit per action using AI feedback, providing fine-grained supervision without ground truth labels and maximizing training signal from rollouts.

Result: MAPPA improves performance by +5.0--17.5pp on AIME and +7.8--17.2pp on AMC math problems, and +12.5pp success rate with up to 30% quality gains in data analysis tasks.

Conclusion: Per-action supervision via MAPPA advances multiagent systems for complex tasks, reducing reliance on human oversight.

Abstract: While multiagent systems have shown promise for tackling complex tasks via specialization, finetuning multiple agents simultaneously faces two key challenges: (1) credit assignment across agents, and (2) sample efficiency of expensive multiagent rollouts. In this work, we propose finetuning multiagent systems with per-action process rewards from AI feedback (MAPPA) to address both. Through assigning credit to individual agent actions rather than only at task completion, MAPPA enables fine-grained supervision without ground truth labels while extracting maximal training signal from each rollout. We demonstrate our approach on competition math problems and tool-augmented data analysis tasks. On unseen math problems, MAPPA achieves +5.0--17.5pp on AIME and +7.8--17.2pp on AMC. For data analysis tasks, our method improves success rate by +12.5pp while quality metrics improve by up to 30%, validating that per-action supervision can lead to improvements across different multiagent system on various domains. By addressing these challenges, our work takes a first step toward scaling multiagent systems for complex, long-horizon tasks with minimal human supervision.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Darwinian Memory System (DMS), a self-evolving memory architecture for MLLM agents to improve GUI automation by addressing context limitations and dynamic environment challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory systems fail in dynamic GUI environments due to granularity mismatch and context pollution, leading to poor performance in long-horizon tasks.

Method: DMS decomposes tasks into reusable units and uses Utility-driven Natural Selection to optimize memory by pruning suboptimal paths and high-risk plans.

Result: DMS improves MLLM performance by 18.0% in success rate and 33.9% in execution stability, reducing latency without additional training.

Conclusion: DMS is an effective self-evolving memory system for enhancing GUI task automation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) agents facilitate Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation but struggle with long-horizon, cross-application tasks due to limited context windows. While memory systems provide a viable solution, existing paradigms struggle to adapt to dynamic GUI environments, suffering from a granularity mismatch between high-level intent and low-level execution, and context pollution where the static accumulation of outdated experiences drives agents into hallucination. To address these bottlenecks, we propose the Darwinian Memory System (DMS), a self-evolving architecture that constructs memory as a dynamic ecosystem governed by the law of survival of the fittest. DMS decomposes complex trajectories into independent, reusable units for compositional flexibility, and implements Utility-driven Natural Selection to track survival value, actively pruning suboptimal paths and inhibiting high-risk plans. This evolutionary pressure compels the agent to derive superior strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-app benchmarks validate that DMS boosts general-purpose MLLMs without training costs or architectural overhead, achieving average gains of 18.0% in success rate and 33.9% in execution stability, while reducing task latency, establishing it as an effective self-evolving memory system for GUI tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of multi-step reasoning in TableQA by exploring if explicit feedback on table transformation actions can enhance model reasoning.

Method: Introduces RE-Tab, leveraging reward modeling in a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process to provide feedback during state transitions and simulative reasoning.

Result: Achieves a 25% drop in inference cost, 41.77% QA accuracy improvement, and 33.33% reduction in test-time inference samples, demonstrating generalizability across benchmarks and LLMs.

Conclusion: RE-Tab effectively improves TableQA performance through reward-guided reasoning, offering a lightweight, training-free solution.

Abstract: A major challenge in training TableQA agents, compared to standard text- and image-based agents, is that answers cannot be inferred from a static input but must be reasoned through stepwise transformations of the table state, introducing multi-step reasoning complexity and environmental interaction. This leads to a research question: Can explicit feedback on table transformation action improve model reasoning capability? In this work, we introduce RE-Tab, a plug-and-play framework that architecturally enhances trajectory search via lightweight, training-free reward modeling by formulating the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that providing explicit verifiable rewards during State Transition (``What is the best action?'') and Simulative Reasoning (``Am I sure about the output?'') is crucial to steer the agent's navigation in table states. By enforcing stepwise reasoning with reward feedback in table transformations, RE-Tab achieves state-of-the-art performance in TableQA with almost 25\% drop in inference cost. Furthermore, a direct plug-and-play implementation of RE-Tab brings up to 41.77% improvement in QA accuracy and 33.33% drop in test-time inference samples for consistent answer. Consistent improvement pattern across various LLMs and state-of-the-art benchmarks further confirms RE-Tab's generalisability. The repository is available at https://github.com/ThomasK1018/RE_Tab .

TL;DR: The paper introduces CraEG, a sampling method addressing embedding-space crowding in LLMs, improving generation performance without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling strategies in LLMs shape model behavior, but current methods ignore fine-grained token relationships in embedding space.

Method: CraEG mitigates crowding via geometry-guided reweighting, remaining training-free and compatible with existing strategies.

Result: Experiments show CraEG enhances generation performance, robustness, and diversity across models and benchmarks.

Conclusion: CraEG effectively addresses crowding, offering a practical solution for balancing quality and diversity in LLM outputs.

Abstract: Sampling-based decoding underlies complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs), where decoding strategies critically shape model behavior. Temperature- and truncation-based methods reshape the next-token distribution through global probability reweighting or thresholding to balance the quality-diversity tradeoff. However, they operate solely on token probabilities, ignoring fine-grained relationships among tokens in the embedding space. We uncover a novel phenomenon, embedding-space crowding, where the next-token distribution concentrates its probability mass on geometrically close tokens in the embedding space. We quantify crowding at multiple granularities and find a statistical association with reasoning success in mathematical problem solving. Motivated by this finding, we propose CraEG, a plug-and-play sampling method that mitigates crowding through geometry-guided reweighting. CraEG is training-free, single-pass, and compatible with standard sampling strategies. Experiments on multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate improved generation performance, with gains in robustness and diversity metrics.

TL;DR: WED-Net is a dual-branch Transformer that disentangles intrinsic and weather-induced traffic patterns for robust urban spatio-temporal prediction under extreme conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with fine-grained spatio-temporal effects and lack generalization under rare or extreme weather conditions.

Method: Proposes WED-Net, incorporating self- and cross-attention, memory banks, adaptive gating, and a discriminator for weather disentanglement, plus causal data augmentation.

Result: Demonstrates robust performance on taxi-flow datasets from three cities under extreme weather.

Conclusion: WED-Net enhances urban resilience and mobility safety, with applications in disaster preparedness; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Urban spatio-temporal prediction under extreme conditions (e.g., heavy rain) is challenging due to event rarity and dynamics. Existing data-driven approaches that incorporate weather as auxiliary input often rely on coarse-grained descriptors and lack dedicated mechanisms to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal effects. Although recent methods adopt causal techniques to improve out-of-distribution generalization, they typically overlook temporal dynamics or depend on fixed confounder stratification. To address these limitations, we propose WED-Net (Weather-Effect Disentanglement Network), a dual-branch Transformer architecture that separates intrinsic and weather-induced traffic patterns via self- and cross-attention, enhanced with memory banks and fused through adaptive gating. To further promote disentanglement, we introduce a discriminator that explicitly distinguishes weather conditions. Additionally, we design a causal data augmentation strategy that perturbs non-causal parts while preserving causal structures, enabling improved generalization under rare scenarios. Experiments on taxi-flow datasets from three cities demonstrate that WED-Net delivers robust performance under extreme weather conditions, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, disaster preparedness, and urban resilience in real-world settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces active learning (AL) into RLVR for LLMs to reduce annotation costs by using fewer but more informative queries, proving their method outperforms random and classic AL baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR algorithms for LLMs are costly due to large query budgets; the study explores if fewer, smarter queries can achieve similar or better results.

Method: Proposes an uncertainty consistency metric (offline: PBC; online: normalized advantage and subjective uncertainty) to align subjective and objective uncertainty for better sample selection.

Result: The method outperforms random and classic AL baselines, achieving full-dataset performance with only 30% of the data.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reduces RLVR costs for reasoning tasks by improving sample selection efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently improved mathematical reasoning through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). However, existing RLVR algorithms require large query budgets, making annotation costly. We investigate whether fewer but more informative queries can yield similar or superior performance, introducing active learning (AL) into RLVR. We identify that classic AL sampling strategies fail to outperform random selection in this setting, due to ignoring objective uncertainty when only selecting by subjective uncertainty. This work proposes an uncertainty consistency metric to evaluate how well subjective uncertainty aligns with objective uncertainty. In the offline setting, this alignment is measured using the Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient (PBC). For online training, because of limited sampling and dynamically shifting output distributions, PBC estimation is difficult. Therefore, we introduce a new online variant, computed from normalized advantage and subjective uncertainty. Theoretically, we prove that the online variant is strictly negatively correlated with offline PBC and supports better sample selection. Experiments show our method consistently outperforms random and classic AL baselines, achieving full-dataset performance while training on only 30% of the data, effectively reducing the cost of RLVR for reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in scaling high-quality multi-turn tool-use data synthesis and noisy RL signals for training interactive agents.

Method: Hierarchical multi-agent engine synthesizes tool-grounded dialogues with executable checkers, paired with RL using GRPO-style training and dynamic filtering.

Result: 73.0% pass^1 on Airline and 98.3% pass^1 on Telecom benchmarks, matching/exceeding frontier models.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable pathway for training complex tool-using agents without costly human annotation.

Abstract: Interactive tool-using agents must solve real-world tasks via multi-turn interaction with both humans and external environments, requiring dialogue state tracking, multi-step tool execution, while following complex instructions. Post-training such agents is challenging because synthesis for high-quality multi-turn tool-use data is difficult to scale, and reinforcement learning (RL) could face noisy signals caused by user simulation, leading to degraded training efficiency. We propose a unified framework that combines a self-evolving data agent with verifier-based RL. Our system, EigenData, is a hierarchical multi-agent engine that synthesizes tool-grounded dialogues together with executable per-instance checkers, and improves generation reliability via closed-loop self-evolving process that updates prompts and workflow. Building on the synthetic data, we develop an RL recipe that first fine-tunes the user model and then applies GRPO-style training with trajectory-level group-relative advantages and dynamic filtering, yielding consistent improvements beyond SFT. Evaluated on tau^2-bench, our best model reaches 73.0% pass^1 on Airline and 98.3% pass^1 on Telecom, matching or exceeding frontier models. Overall, our results suggest a scalable pathway for bootstrapping complex tool-using behaviors without expensive human annotation.

*Hongxi Yan,Qingjie Liu,Yunhong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EntroCut uses entropy to dynamically truncate reasoning in LRMs, reducing token usage by up to 40% with minimal accuracy loss, as measured by the Efficiency-Performance Ratio (EPR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs incur high computational costs due to lengthy reasoning steps; entropy reliably distinguishes correct from incorrect reasoning early on.

Method: EntroCut dynamically truncates reasoning by identifying high-confidence states where termination is safe, without requiring training.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks show token savings of up to 40% with minimal accuracy sacrifice, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Entropy-guided truncation offers a practical way to improve LRM efficiency, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks through extended chain-of-thought generation, but their reliance on lengthy intermediate steps incurs substantial computational cost. We find that the entropy of the model's output distribution in early reasoning steps reliably distinguishes correct from incorrect reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we propose EntroCut, a training-free method that dynamically truncates reasoning by identifying high-confidence states where reasoning can be safely terminated. To comprehensively evaluate the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, we introduce the Efficiency-Performance Ratio (EPR), a unified metric that quantifies relative token savings per unit accuracy loss. Experiments on four benchmarks show that EntroCut reduces token usage by up to 40\% with minimal accuracy sacrifice, achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs compared with existing training-free methods. These results demonstrate that entropy-guided dynamic truncation provides a practical approach to mitigate the inefficiency of LRMs.

### [160] [Statistical Estimation of Adversarial Risk in Large Language Models under Best-of-N Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22636)
*Mingqian Feng,Xiaodong Liu,Weiwei Yang,Chenliang Xu,Christopher White,Jianfeng Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes SABER, a scaling-aware method to predict large-scale adversarial risk in LLMs under Best-of-N sampling, showing significant improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations underestimate LLM safety risks because they use single-shot or low-budget adversarial prompting, whereas attackers exploit parallel sampling.

Method: Uses a Beta distribution to model sample-level success probabilities and derives an analytic scaling law for extrapolating large-N attack success rates from small-budget measurements.

Result: SABER predicts ASR@1000 with 86.2% less error than baselines, revealing heterogeneous risk scaling profiles and nonlinear risk amplification.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, low-cost methodology for realistic LLM safety assessment, with code and scripts to be released.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated for safety under single-shot or low-budget adversarial prompting, which underestimates real-world risk. In practice, attackers can exploit large-scale parallel sampling to repeatedly probe a model until a harmful response is produced. While recent work shows that attack success increases with repeated sampling, principled methods for predicting large-scale adversarial risk remain limited. We propose a scaling-aware Best-of-N estimation of risk, SABER, for modeling jailbreak vulnerability under Best-of-N sampling. We model sample-level success probabilities using a Beta distribution, the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli distribution, and derive an analytic scaling law that enables reliable extrapolation of large-N attack success rates from small-budget measurements. Using only n=100 samples, our anchored estimator predicts ASR@1000 with a mean absolute error of 1.66, compared to 12.04 for the baseline, which is an 86.2% reduction in estimation error. Our results reveal heterogeneous risk scaling profiles and show that models appearing robust under standard evaluation can experience rapid nonlinear risk amplification under parallel adversarial pressure. This work provides a low-cost, scalable methodology for realistic LLM safety assessment. We will release our code and evaluation scripts upon publication to future research.

*Vaibhav Ram S. V. N. S,Swetanshu Agrawal,Samudra Banerjee,Abdul Muhsin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques generative AI in medicine, proposing Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI) as necessary for clinical use. It introduces Meddollina, a system prioritizing clinical appropriateness over generative fluency, showing improved behavior under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative medical AI systems exhibit behaviors incompatible with clinical deployment (e.g., premature closure, unjustified certainty). The paper argues scaling alone won't resolve these issues, requiring a shift to Clinical Contextual Intelligence.

Method: The authors formalize CCI and introduce Meddollina, a governance-first system prioritizing clinical appropriateness. Meddollina is evaluated against general-purpose, medical-tuned, and retrieval-augmented models using 16,412+ medical queries.

Result: Meddollina demonstrates calibrated uncertainty, conservative reasoning, stable adherence to constraints, and reduced speculative completion compared to generative baselines.

Conclusion: Deployable medical AI requires clinician-aligned behavior under uncertainty (Continuous Clinical Intelligence) rather than fluency-driven scaling.

Abstract: Generative medical AI now appears fluent and knowledgeable enough to resemble clinical intelligence, encouraging the belief that scaling will make it safe. But clinical reasoning is not text generation. It is a responsibility-bound process under ambiguity, incomplete evidence, and longitudinal context. Even as benchmark scores rise, generation-centric systems still show behaviours incompatible with clinical deployment: premature closure, unjustified certainty, intent drift, and instability across multi-step decisions.
  We argue these are structural consequences of treating medicine as next-token prediction. We formalise Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI) as a distinct capability class required for real-world clinical use, defined by persistent context awareness, intent preservation, bounded inference, and principled deferral when evidence is insufficient.
  We introduce Meddollina, a governance-first clinical intelligence system designed to constrain inference before language realisation, prioritising clinical appropriateness over generative completeness. Meddollina acts as a continuous intelligence layer supporting clinical workflows while preserving clinician authority. We evaluate Meddollina using a behaviour-first regime across 16,412+ heterogeneous medical queries, benchmarking against general-purpose models, medical-tuned models, and retrieval-augmented systems.
  Meddollina exhibits a distinct behavioural profile: calibrated uncertainty, conservative reasoning under underspecification, stable longitudinal constraint adherence, and reduced speculative completion relative to generation-centric baselines. These results suggest deployable medical AI will not emerge from scaling alone, motivating a shift toward Continuous Clinical Intelligence, where progress is measured by clinician-aligned behaviour under uncertainty rather than fluency-driven completion.

*Jinwoo Jang,Minjong Yoo,Sihyung Yoon,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TMoW, a framework enhancing adaptability of LM-based embodied agents in dynamic environments by updating routing functions at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LM-based embodied agents struggle in dynamic environments due to rigid world models and lack of adaptability.

Method: Proposes TMoW with multi-granular prototype-based routing, test-time refinement, and distilled mixture-based augmentation.

Result: TMoW shows strong performance on VirtualHome, ALFWorld, and RLBench benchmarks in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: TMoW enables agents to adapt continually and operate effectively in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Language model (LM)-based embodied agents are increasingly deployed in real-world settings. Yet, their adaptability remains limited in dynamic environments, where constructing accurate and flexible world models is crucial for effective reasoning and decision-making. To address this challenge, we extend the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm to embodied agents. While conventional MoE architectures modularize knowledge into expert components with pre-trained routing, they remain rigid once deployed, making them less effective for adapting to unseen domains in dynamic environments. We therefore propose Test-time Mixture of World Models (TMoW), a framework that enhances adaptability to unseen and evolving domains. TMoW updates its routing function over world models at test time, unlike conventional MoE where the function remains fixed, enabling agents to recombine existing models and integrate new ones for continual adaptation. It achieves this through (i) multi-granular prototype-based routing, which adapts mixtures across object- to scene-level similarities, (ii) test-time refinement that aligns unseen domain features with prototypes during inference, and (iii) distilled mixture-based augmentation, which efficiently constructs new models from few-shot data and existing prototypes. We evaluate TMoW on VirtualHome, ALFWorld, and RLBench benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance in both zero-shot adaptation and few-shot expansion scenarios, and showing that it enables embodied agents to operate effectively in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: UCPO framework addresses reward imbalance and overconfidence in LLMs by decoupling advantages and dynamically adjusting uncertainty rewards, improving reliability and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate hallucinations in LLMs by enhancing their uncertainty expression capabilities, overcoming issues like Advantage Bias in existing RL paradigms.

Method: Proposes UCPO with Ternary Advantage Decoupling and Dynamic Uncertainty Reward Adjustment to normalize rollouts and calibrate uncertainty weights in real-time.

Result: UCPO effectively resolves reward imbalance, significantly improving model reliability and calibration beyond knowledge boundaries.

Conclusion: UCPO provides a robust solution for enhancing LLM trustworthiness by addressing reward hacking and overconfidence dynamically.

Abstract: The key to building trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs) lies in endowing them with inherent uncertainty expression capabilities to mitigate the hallucinations that restrict their high-stakes applications. However, existing RL paradigms such as GRPO often suffer from Advantage Bias due to binary decision spaces and static uncertainty rewards, inducing either excessive conservatism or overconfidence. To tackle this challenge, this paper unveils the root causes of reward hacking and overconfidence in current RL paradigms incorporating uncertainty-based rewards, based on which we propose the UnCertainty-Aware Policy Optimization (UCPO) framework. UCPO employs Ternary Advantage Decoupling to separate and independently normalize deterministic and uncertain rollouts, thereby eliminating advantage bias. Furthermore, a Dynamic Uncertainty Reward Adjustment mechanism is introduced to calibrate uncertainty weights in real-time according to model evolution and instance difficulty. Experimental results in mathematical reasoning and general tasks demonstrate that UCPO effectively resolves the reward imbalance, significantly improving the reliability and calibration of the model beyond their knowledge boundaries.

TL;DR: The paper introduces R2M, a lightweight RLHF framework that addresses reward overoptimization by leveraging policy feedback to align with real-time distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate reward overoptimization in RLHF, where policy models overfit to reward models and exploit spurious patterns instead of capturing human intent.

Method: Proposes R2M, which uses evolving hidden states of the policy (policy feedback) to align with real-time distribution shifts during RL.

Result: R2M improves alignment between reward and policy models, reducing reward discrepancy and overoptimization.

Conclusion: R2M offers a promising approach to enhance reward models by incorporating real-time policy feedback, addressing limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet it is susceptible to reward overoptimization, in which policy models overfit to the reward model, exploit spurious reward patterns instead of faithfully capturing human intent. Prior mitigations primarily relies on surface semantic information and fails to efficiently address the misalignment between the reward model (RM) and the policy model caused by continuous policy distribution shifts. This inevitably leads to an increasing reward discrepancy, exacerbating reward overoptimization. To address these limitations, we introduce R2M (Real-Time Aligned Reward Model), a novel lightweight RLHF framework. R2M goes beyond vanilla reward models that solely depend on the semantic representations of a pretrained LLM. Instead, it leverages the evolving hidden states of the policy (namely policy feedback) to align with the real-time distribution shift of the policy during the RL process. This work points to a promising new direction for improving the performance of reward models through real-time utilization of feedback from policy models.

*Emilien Biré,María Santos,Kai Yuan*

TL;DR: A novel method enhances Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for agents by decoupling action proposal from selection, using a lightweight Q-function during inference to boost success rates without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with fast-changing environments like the web, and fine-tuning them requires extensive training and data. This work aims to improve agentic VLM policies without retraining.

Method: The approach freezes the VLM policy, generates candidate actions, and uses a lightweight Q-function to rerank them during inference for immediate policy enhancement.

Result: Significant improvements in agent success rates were achieved, e.g., from 38.8% to 55.7% for Qwen2.5-VL-7B and from 82.4% to 88.8% for GPT-4.1 on the WebVoyager benchmark.

Conclusion: Decoupling action proposal and selection with a Q-function during inference effectively enhances agent performance without the need for policy retraining.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become powerful backbones for agents to autonomously operate in digital environments like the web and operating systems. However, these models suffer from inadaptability to fast-changing environments like the web, which can be alleviated by fine-tuning requiring expansive model training and data collection. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for enhancing agentic VLM policies at inference without policy retraining. Fundamentally, our approach decouples the VLM's role as a high-capacity action proposer from the final action selection mechanism. We keep the VLM policy frozen and use it to generate a set of candidate actions for a given state. Then, a lightweight, offline-trained Q-function reranks these candidates, and the agent executes the action with the highest estimated value. The main contribution is to apply the Q-function directly during inference for immediate policy improvement, and not offline to relabel data for policy retraining. We demonstrate on the academic WebVoyager benchmark that our method significantly boosts agent success rates, improving a Qwen2.5-VL-7B agent from 38.8% to 55.7% and a proprietary GPT-4.1 agent from 82.4% to 88.8%.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Minimum Prefix Ratio (MinPRO), a stable objective for RL post-training in LLMs under large off-policy drift, outperforming token-level importance sampling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unstable training dynamics in LLMs caused by token-level correction during RL post-training under off-policy conditions.

Method: Introduces MinPRO, a non-cumulative surrogate objective based on the minimum token-level ratio in the preceding prefix, ensuring stability.

Result: MinPRO improves training stability and peak performance across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: MinPRO is a simple yet effective solution for stabilizing LLM optimization in off-policy regimes.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has increasingly demonstrated strong ability to elicit reasoning behaviors in large language models (LLMs). For training efficiency, rollouts are typically generated in an off-policy manner using an older sampling policy and then used to update the current target policy. To correct the resulting discrepancy between the sampling and target policies, most existing RL objectives rely on a token-level importance sampling ratio, primarily due to its computational simplicity and numerical stability. However, we observe that token-level correction often leads to unstable training dynamics when the degree of off-policyness is large. In this paper, we revisit LLM policy optimization under off-policy conditions and show that the theoretically rigorous correction term is the prefix importance ratio, and that relaxing it to a token-level approximation can induce instability in RL post-training. To stabilize LLM optimization under large off-policy drift, we propose a simple yet effective objective, Minimum Prefix Ratio (MinPRO). MinPRO replaces the unstable cumulative prefix ratio with a non-cumulative surrogate based on the minimum token-level ratio observed in the preceding prefix. Extensive experiments on both dense and mixture-of-experts LLMs, across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrate that MinPRO substantially improves training stability and peak performance in off-policy regimes.

TL;DR: AutoRefine is a framework that extracts and maintains dual-form Experience Patterns from agent execution histories, improving performance on tasks while reducing steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language model agents often fail to accumulate knowledge from experience, treating tasks independently. Existing methods lack mechanisms to capture procedural logic or prevent repository degradation.

Method: AutoRefine extracts procedural subagents for complex subtasks and static skill patterns. It continuously maintains these patterns by scoring, pruning, and merging them.

Result: On ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and TravelPlanner, AutoRefine achieved 98.4%, 70.4%, and 27.1% success rates, with 20-73% step reductions. It outperformed manual systems on TravelPlanner.

Conclusion: AutoRefine demonstrates effective knowledge accumulation and procedural coordination, significantly improving agent performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Large language model agents often fail to accumulate knowledge from experience, treating each task as an independent challenge. Recent methods extract experience as flattened textual knowledge, which cannot capture procedural logic of complex subtasks. They also lack maintenance mechanisms, causing repository degradation as experience accumulates. We introduce AutoRefine, a framework that extracts and maintains dual-form Experience Patterns from agent execution histories. For procedural subtasks, we extract specialized subagents with independent reasoning and memory. For static knowledge, we extract skill patterns as guidelines or code snippets. A continuous maintenance mechanism scores, prunes, and merges patterns to prevent repository degradation. Evaluated on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and TravelPlanner, AutoRefine achieves 98.4%, 70.4%, and 27.1% respectively, with 20-73% step reductions. On TravelPlanner, automatic extraction exceeds manually designed systems (27.1% vs 12.1%), demonstrating its ability to capture procedural coordination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL frameworks for search-augmented reasoning rely on sparse rewards, causing 'Double Homogenization Dilemma,' which ignores process details and leads to inefficiencies.

Method: Proposes Turn-level Stage-aware Policy Optimization (TSPO) with First-Occurrence Latent Reward (FOLR) to allocate partial rewards at key steps.

Result: TSPO achieves average performance gains of 24% and 13.6% on Qwen2.5-3B and 7B models, respectively.

Conclusion: TSPO effectively addresses homogenization issues in RL frameworks, enhancing performance without needing external reward models or annotations.

Abstract: Multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks through iterative information retrieval. However, current reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks for search-augmented reasoning predominantly rely on sparse outcome-level rewards, leading to a "Double Homogenization Dilemma." This manifests as (1) Process homogenization, where the thinking, reasoning, and tooling involved in generation are ignored. (2) Intra-group homogenization, coarse-grained outcome rewards often lead to inefficiencies in intra-group advantage estimation with methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) during sampling. To address this, we propose Turn-level Stage-aware Policy Optimization (TSPO). TSPO introduces the First-Occurrence Latent Reward (FOLR) mechanism, allocating partial rewards to the step where the ground-truth answer first appears, thereby preserving process-level signals and increasing reward variance within groups without requiring external reward models or any annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average performance gains of 24% and 13.6% on Qwen2.5-3B and 7B models, respectively.

TL;DR: MobileGen is a framework for generating adaptive, high-quality GUI interaction trajectories by aligning task difficulty with the agent's capabilities, improving agent performance by 1.57x compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating GUI trajectories lack control over task difficulty, leading to ineffective training. MobileGen addresses this by adapting difficulty to the agent's evolving capabilities.

Method: MobileGen decouples task difficulty into structural and semantic dimensions, evaluates the agent's capability frontier, and uses a multi-agent generator to synthesize trajectories based on sampled difficulty.

Result: MobileGen outperforms existing methods, improving GUI agent performance by 1.57 times across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Capability-aligned data generation is crucial for effective mobile GUI agent training, demonstrated by MobileGen's success.

Abstract: Large-scale, high-quality interaction trajectories are essential for advancing mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. While existing methods typically rely on labor-intensive human demonstrations or automated model exploration to generate GUI trajectories, they lack fine-grained control over task difficulty. This fundamentally restricts learning effectiveness due to the mismatch between the training difficulty and the agent's capabilities. Inspired by how humans acquire skills through progressively challenging tasks, we propose MobileGen, a novel data generation framework that adaptively aligns training difficulty with the GUI agent's capability frontier. Specifically, MobileGen explicitly decouples task difficulty into structural (e.g., trajectory length) and semantic (e.g., task goal) dimensions. It then iteratively evaluates the agent on a curated prior dataset to construct a systematic profile of its capability frontier across these two dimensions. With this profile, the probability distribution of task difficulty is adaptively computed, from which the target difficulty for the next round of training can be sampled. Guided by the sampled difficulty, a multi-agent controllable generator is finally used to synthesize high-quality interaction trajectories along with corresponding task instructions. Extensive experiments show that MobileGen consistently outperforms existing data generation methods by improving the average performance of GUI agents by 1.57 times across multiple challenging benchmarks. This highlights the importance of capability-aligned data generation for effective mobile GUI agent training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate consciousness-like processing in AGI development using IIT principles.

Method: Formulate a reward function based on IIT axioms (causality, coherence, integration) to optimize language models.

Result: 31% reduction in output length without losing accuracy; improved confidence calibration and computational scaling.

Conclusion: The IIT-inspired framework is practical, efficient, and leverages general signals for better performance.

Abstract: The pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a central goal in language model development, in which consciousness-like processing could serve as a key facilitator. While current language models are not conscious, they exhibit behaviors analogous to certain aspects of consciousness. This paper investigates the implementation of a leading theory of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), within language models via a reward-based learning paradigm. IIT provides a formal, axiom-based mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness. Drawing inspiration from its core principles, we formulate a novel reward function that quantifies a text's causality, coherence and integration, characteristics associated with conscious processing. Empirically, it is found that optimizing for this IIT-inspired reward leads to more concise text generation. On out of domain tasks, careful tuning achieves up to a 31% reduction in output length while preserving accuracy levels comparable to the base model. In addition to primary task performance, the broader effects of this training methodology on the model's confidence calibration and test-time computational scaling is analyzed. The proposed framework offers significant practical advantages: it is conceptually simple, computationally efficient, requires no external data or auxiliary models, and leverages a general, capability-driven signal rather than task-specific heuristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models are computationally expensive, and current PAC reasoning lacks conditional coverage guarantees, limiting efficiency and applicability.

Method: Proposes G-PAC and C-PAC frameworks for group-conditional risk control, adapting to known (G-PAC) and unknown (C-PAC) group structures in input space.

Result: Both G-PAC and C-PAC achieve group-conditional risk control and improve computational efficiency over marginal PAC reasoning, validated on diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: G-PAC and C-PAC offer practical, efficient reasoning with group-level guarantees, addressing limitations of marginal PAC reasoning.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have shown strong performance through extended chain-of-thought reasoning, yet their computational cost remains significant. Probably approximately correct (PAC) reasoning provides statistical guarantees for efficient reasoning by adaptively switching between thinking and non-thinking models, but the guarantee holds only in the marginal case and does not provide exact conditional coverage. We propose G-PAC reasoning, a practical framework that provides PAC-style guarantees at the group level by partitioning the input space. We develop two instantiations: Group PAC (G-PAC) reasoning for known group structures and Clustered PAC (C-PAC) reasoning for unknown groupings. We prove that both G-PAC and C-PAC achieve group-conditional risk control, and that grouping can strictly improve efficiency over marginal PAC reasoning in heterogeneous settings. Our experiments on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that G-PAC and C-PAC successfully achieve group-conditional risk control while maintaining substantial computational savings.

Motivation: Existing supervised fine-tuning methods for code verifiers face data scarcity and inefficiency, while naive RL with functionality rewards falls short for difficult branches and samples.

Method: The paper proposes syntax- and functionality-aware rewards and branch-/sample-difficulty-aware RL using exponential reward shaping and static analysis metrics.

Result: CVeDRL achieves a 28.97% higher pass rate and 15.08% higher branch coverage than GPT-3.5 with 0.6B parameters, and offers 20x faster inference.

Conclusion: Integrating multiple reward signals in RL significantly improves code verification reliability and efficiency.

Abstract: Code verifiers play a critical role in post-verification for LLM-based code generation, yet existing supervised fine-tuning methods suffer from data scarcity, high failure rates, and poor inference efficiency. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by optimizing models through execution-driven rewards without labeled supervision, our preliminary results show that naive RL with only functionality rewards fails to generate effective unit tests for difficult branches and samples. We first theoretically analyze showing that branch coverage, sample difficulty, syntactic and functional correctness can be jointly modeled as RL rewards, where optimizing these signals can improve the reliability of unit-test-based verification. Guided by this analysis, we design syntax- and functionality-aware rewards and further propose branch- and sample-difficulty--aware RL using exponential reward shaping and static analysis metrics. With this formulation, CVeDRL achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 0.6B parameters, yielding up to 28.97% higher pass rate and 15.08% higher branch coverage than GPT-3.5, while delivering over $20\times$ faster inference than competitive baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard methods merge incompatible metric spaces, eroding information about the graph's generative process. The paper aims to recover this lost signal.

Method: A custom variational autoencoder is used to separate manifold learning from structural alignment, quantifying metric distortion for interpretable structural descriptors.

Result: The method uncovers connectivity patterns and anomalies undetectable by conventional approaches.

Conclusion: The approach proves the theoretical inadequacy and practical limitations of standard methods while offering interpretable structural insights.

Abstract: The standard approach to representation learning on attributed graphs -- i.e., simultaneously reconstructing node attributes and graph structure -- is geometrically flawed, as it merges two potentially incompatible metric spaces. This forces a destructive alignment that erodes information about the graph's underlying generative process. To recover this lost signal, we introduce a custom variational autoencoder that separates manifold learning from structural alignment. By quantifying the metric distortion needed to map the attribute manifold onto the graph's Heat Kernel, we transform geometric conflict into an interpretable structural descriptor. Experiments show our method uncovers connectivity patterns and anomalies undetectable by conventional approaches, proving both their theoretical inadequacy and practical limitations.

TL;DR: ASRO is a game-theoretic framework using LLMs for heuristic discovery, outperforming static methods with adaptive co-evolution between solver and instance generator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for automatic heuristic discovery (AHD) suffer from static evaluation and poor generalization under distribution shifts.

Method: ASRO models heuristic discovery as a zero-sum game between solver and instance generator, using LLMs for iterative best-response oracles.

Result: ASRO consistently outperforms static AHD baselines, improving generalization and robustness across diverse instances.

Conclusion: ASRO's adaptive, game-theoretic approach enhances heuristic discovery, overcoming limitations of static evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled rapid progress in automatic heuristic discovery (AHD), yet most existing methods are predominantly limited by static evaluation against fixed instance distributions, leading to potential overfitting and poor generalization under distributional shifts. We propose Algorithm Space Response Oracles (ASRO), a game-theoretic framework that reframes heuristic discovery as a program level co-evolution between solver and instance generator. ASRO models their interaction as a two-player zero-sum game, maintains growing strategy pools on both sides, and iteratively expands them via LLM-based best-response oracles against mixed opponent meta-strategies, thereby replacing static evaluation with an adaptive, self-generated curriculum. Across multiple combinatorial optimization domains, ASRO consistently outperforms static-training AHD baselines built on the same program search mechanisms, achieving substantially improved generalization and robustness on diverse and out-of-distribution instances.

*Xuancheng Li,Haitao Li,Yujia Zhou,YiqunLiu,Qingyao Ai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR introduces multi-turn feedback-guided reinforcement learning to improve reasoning by leveraging verbal feedback on failed samples, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outcome-only scalar rewards in RLVR are sparse and uninformative, especially on failed samples, lacking insight into reasoning failures.

Method: Proposes a framework with dynamic multi-turn regeneration guided by feedback, two learning signals for optimization, and structured feedback injection.

Result: Outperforms supervised fine-tuning and RLVR baselines in-domain and generalizes well out-of-domain.

Conclusion: Verbal feedback-guided RLVR enhances reasoning by addressing sparse rewards and improving learning signals on failed samples.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is widely used to improve reasoning in multiple domains, yet outcome-only scalar rewards are often sparse and uninformative, especially on failed samples, where they merely indicate failure and provide no insight into why the reasoning fails. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage richer verbal feedback to guide RLVR training on failed samples, and how to convert such feedback into a trainable learning signal. Specifically, we propose a multi-turn feedback-guided reinforcement learning framework. It builds on three mechanisms: (1) dynamic multi-turn regeneration guided by feedback, triggered only on failed samples, (2) two complementary learning signals for within-turn and cross-turn optimization, and (3) structured feedback injection into the model's reasoning process. Trained on sampled OpenR1-Math, the approach outperforms supervised fine-tuning and RLVR baselines in-domain and generalizes well out-of-domain.

*Nicola Milano,Stefano Nolfi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores whether language, vision, and action learning modalities lead to shared internal representations, finding robust cross-modal alignment despite differences in training data and objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to challenge traditional views that models trained on different data types develop non-transferable representations, investigating potential convergence in embodied action learning.

Method: A transformer-based agent was trained using behavioral cloning on BabyAI to generate action-grounded language embeddings, which were then compared with representations from large language models (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP).

Result: Action representations aligned strongly with decoder-only language models and BLIP (precision@15: 0.70-0.73), indicating robust cross-modal alignment, while alignment with CLIP and BERT was weaker.

Conclusion: The findings suggest linguistic, visual, and action representations converge toward shared semantic structures, supporting modality-independent organization and highlighting potential for cross-domain transfer in AI systems.

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science and AI concerns whether different learning modalities: language, vision, and action, give rise to distinct or shared internal representations. Traditional views assume that models trained on different data types develop specialized, non-transferable representations. However, recent evidence suggests unexpected convergence: models optimized for distinct tasks may develop similar representational geometries. We investigate whether this convergence extends to embodied action learning by training a transformer-based agent to execute goal-directed behaviors in response to natural language instructions. Using behavioral cloning on the BabyAI platform, we generated action-grounded language embeddings shaped exclusively by sensorimotor control requirements. We then compared these representations with those extracted from state-of-the-art large language models (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP). Despite substantial differences in training data, modality, and objectives, we observed robust cross-modal alignment. Action representations aligned strongly with decoder-only language models and BLIP (precision@15: 0.70-0.73), approaching the alignment observed among language models themselves. Alignment with CLIP and BERT was significantly weaker. These findings indicate that linguistic, visual, and action representations converge toward partially shared semantic structures, supporting modality-independent semantic organization and highlighting potential for cross-domain transfer in embodied AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Med-Inquire, a benchmark for multi-turn diagnosis simulation, and EvoClinician, a self-evolving agent that improves diagnostic strategies through iterative learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical AI operates unrealistically by diagnosing from complete patient files, unlike real-world clinical practice, which involves iterative questioning and testing.

Method: The authors propose Med-Inquire to simulate multi-turn diagnosis and EvoClinician, which uses a 'Diagnose-Grade-Evolve' loop to refine diagnostic strategies.

Result: EvoClinician outperforms baseline methods and other self-evolving agents in experiments.

Conclusion: The study advances AI in clinical diagnosis by aligning it more closely with real-world iterative processes.

Abstract: Prevailing medical AI operates on an unrealistic ''one-shot'' model, diagnosing from a complete patient file. However, real-world diagnosis is an iterative inquiry where Clinicians sequentially ask questions and order tests to strategically gather information while managing cost and time. To address this, we first propose Med-Inquire, a new benchmark designed to evaluate an agent's ability to perform multi-turn diagnosis. Built upon a dataset of real-world clinical cases, Med-Inquire simulates the diagnostic process by hiding a complete patient file behind specialized Patient and Examination agents. They force the agent to proactively ask questions and order tests to gather information piece by piece. To tackle the challenges posed by Med-Inquire, we then introduce EvoClinician, a self-evolving agent that learns efficient diagnostic strategies at test time. Its core is a ''Diagnose-Grade-Evolve'' loop: an Actor agent attempts a diagnosis; a Process Grader agent performs credit assignment by evaluating each action for both clinical yield and resource efficiency; finally, an Evolver agent uses this feedback to update the Actor's strategy by evolving its prompt and memory. Our experiments show EvoClinician outperforms continual learning baselines and other self-evolving agents like memory agents. The code is available at https://github.com/yf-he/EvoClinician

TL;DR: Golden Goose synthesizes unlimited RLVR tasks from unverifiable internet text, overcoming data bottlenecks and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling reinforcement learning is limited by scarce verifiable data, hindering progress in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Golden Goose transforms unverifiable text into multiple-choice RLVR tasks by masking key reasoning steps and generating distractors.

Result: Created GooseReason-0.7M dataset, reviving model performance and achieving SOTA results across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Golden Goose successfully leverages unverifiable text to scale RLVR, demonstrating practical applications in domains like cybersecurity.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a cornerstone for unlocking complex reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, scaling up RL is bottlenecked by limited existing verifiable data, where improvements increasingly saturate over prolonged training. To overcome this, we propose Golden Goose, a simple trick to synthesize unlimited RLVR tasks from unverifiable internet text by constructing a multiple-choice question-answering version of the fill-in-the-middle task. Given a source text, we prompt an LLM to identify and mask key reasoning steps, then generate a set of diverse, plausible distractors. This enables us to leverage reasoning-rich unverifiable corpora typically excluded from prior RLVR data construction (e.g., science textbooks) to synthesize GooseReason-0.7M, a large-scale RLVR dataset with over 0.7 million tasks spanning mathematics, programming, and general scientific domains. Empirically, GooseReason effectively revives models saturated on existing RLVR data, yielding robust, sustained gains under continuous RL and achieving new state-of-the-art results for 1.5B and 4B-Instruct models across 15 diverse benchmarks. Finally, we deploy Golden Goose in a real-world setting, synthesizing RLVR tasks from raw FineWeb scrapes for the cybersecurity domain, where no prior RLVR data exists. Training Qwen3-4B-Instruct on the resulting data GooseReason-Cyber sets a new state-of-the-art in cybersecurity, surpassing a 7B domain-specialized model with extensive domain-specific pre-training and post-training. This highlights the potential of automatically scaling up RLVR data by exploiting abundant, reasoning-rich, unverifiable internet text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the governance challenge of distinguishing genuine behavioral novelty from functional redundancy in evolving AI ecosystems.

Method: Introduces In-Silico Quasi-Experimental Design (ISQED) and Peer-Inexpressible Residual (PIER) to quantify model uniqueness via matched interventions.

Result: Proves limitations of observational logs, derives scaling laws for active auditing, and demonstrates flaws in game-theoretic methods.

Conclusion: Establishes a principled, intervention-based science for auditing and governing heterogeneous AI ecosystems.

Abstract: As AI systems evolve from isolated predictors into complex, heterogeneous ecosystems of foundation models and specialized adapters, distinguishing genuine behavioral novelty from functional redundancy becomes a critical governance challenge. Here, we introduce a statistical framework for auditing model uniqueness based on In-Silico Quasi-Experimental Design (ISQED). By enforcing matched interventions across models, we isolate intrinsic model identity and quantify uniqueness as the Peer-Inexpressible Residual (PIER), i.e. the component of a target's behavior strictly irreducible to any stochastic convex combination of its peers, with vanishing PIER characterizing when such a routing-based substitution becomes possible. We establish the theoretical foundations of ecosystem auditing through three key contributions. First, we prove a fundamental limitation of observational logs: uniqueness is mathematically non-identifiable without intervention control. Second, we derive a scaling law for active auditing, showing that our adaptive query protocol achieves minimax-optimal sample efficiency ($dσ^2γ^{-2}\log(Nd/δ)$). Third, we demonstrate that cooperative game-theoretic methods, such as Shapley values, fundamentally fail to detect redundancy. We implement this framework via the DISCO (Design-Integrated Synthetic Control) estimator and deploy it across diverse ecosystems, including computer vision models (ResNet/ConvNeXt/ViT), large language models (BERT/RoBERTa), and city-scale traffic forecasters. These results move trustworthy AI beyond explaining single models: they establish a principled, intervention-based science of auditing and governing heterogeneous model ecosystems.

### [180] [Why Your Deep Research Agent Fails? On Hallucination Evaluation in Full Research Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22984)
*Yuhao Zhan,Tianyu Fan,Linxuan Huang,Zirui Guo,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a process-aware evaluation framework (PIES Taxonomy) to diagnose Deep Research Agents' hallucinations, introduces DeepHalluBench for benchmarking, and identifies systemic failure causes like hallucination propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to uncover intermediate hallucinations in Deep Research Agents (DRAs), necessitating a shift from outcome-based to process-aware evaluation.

Method: The authors introduce the PIES Taxonomy to categorize hallucinations (Planning vs. Summarization, Explicit vs. Implicit) and develop DeepHalluBench, a benchmark with 100 hallucination-prone tasks.

Result: Experiments on six DRAs show none achieve robust reliability, with failures traced to systemic issues like hallucination propagation and cognitive biases.

Conclusion: The framework and benchmark provide foundational insights for improving DRA reliability by addressing systemic deficits.

Abstract: Diagnosing the failure mechanisms of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) remains a critical challenge. Existing benchmarks predominantly rely on end-to-end evaluation, obscuring critical intermediate hallucinations, such as flawed planning, that accumulate throughout the research trajectory. To bridge this gap, we propose a shift from outcome-based to process-aware evaluation by auditing the full research trajectory. We introduce the PIES Taxonomy to categorize hallucinations along functional components (Planning vs. Summarization) and error properties (Explicit vs. Implicit). We instantiate this taxonomy into a fine-grained evaluation framework that decomposes the trajectory to rigorously quantify these hallucinations. Leveraging this framework to isolate 100 distinctively hallucination-prone tasks including adversarial scenarios, we curate DeepHalluBench. Experiments on six state-of-theart DRAs reveal that no system achieves robust reliability. Furthermore, our diagnostic analysis traces the etiology of these failures to systemic deficits, specifically hallucination propagation and cognitive biases, providing foundational insights to guide future architectural optimization.

*Roham Koohestani,Ateş Görpelioğlu,Egor Klimov,Burcu Kulahcioglu Ozkan,Maliheh Izadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces TriCEGAR, an automated trace-driven abstraction mechanism for runtime verification of agentic AI systems, eliminating the need for manual state abstraction and supporting online MDP construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges of assuring agentic AI systems due to their stochastic interactions and dependence on nondeterministic environments. Prior methods required manual state abstraction, complicating verification.

Method: TriCEGAR automates state construction using predicate trees learned from execution logs and refined via counterexamples. It includes capturing agent lifecycle events, building abstractions, constructing MDPs, and performing probabilistic model checking.

Result: The framework enables computation of probabilistic bounds (e.g., Pmax(success)) and facilitates anomaly detection using run likelihoods.

Conclusion: TriCEGAR addresses prior limitations by automating state abstraction, enhancing verification efficiency and adaptability for agentic AI systems.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems act through tools and evolve their behavior over long, stochastic interaction traces. This setting complicates assurance, because behavior depends on nondeterministic environments and probabilistic model outputs. Prior work introduced runtime verification for agentic AI via Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance (DPA), learning an MDP online and model checking quantitative properties. A key limitation is that developers must manually define the state abstraction, which couples verification to application-specific heuristics and increases adoption friction. This paper proposes TriCEGAR, a trace-driven abstraction mechanism that automates state construction from execution logs and supports online construction of an agent behavioral MDP. TriCEGAR represents abstractions as predicate trees learned from traces and refined using counterexamples. We describe a framework-native implementation that (i) captures typed agent lifecycle events, (ii) builds abstractions from traces, (iii) constructs an MDP, and (iv) performs probabilistic model checking to compute bounds such as Pmax(success) and Pmin(failure). We also show how run likelihoods enable anomaly detection as a guardrailing signal.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoTraj is a two-stage framework that improves Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) by repairing and rewarding tool-use trajectories using LLMs, enhancing supervision and reliability in complex task-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for TIR rely on high-quality synthesized trajectories and sparse rewards, offering limited and biased supervision. AutoTraj aims to address these limitations by automating trajectory repair and reward modeling.

Method: AutoTraj operates in two stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) where trajectories are evaluated, repaired using LLMs, and synthesized into datasets; (2) Reinforcement Learning (RL) where a reward model assesses reasoning paths, combining outcome and format rewards.

Result: Experiments on real-world benchmarks confirm AutoTraj's effectiveness in improving TIR performance.

Conclusion: AutoTraj successfully enhances TIR by automating trajectory repair and reward modeling, providing better supervision for complex tasks.

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks by interacting with external tools, yet existing approaches depend on high-quality synthesized trajectories selected by scoring functions and sparse outcome-based rewards, providing limited and biased supervision for learning TIR. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose AutoTraj, a two-stage framework that automatically learns TIR by repairing and rewarding tool-use trajectories. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, AutoTraj generates multiple candidate tool-use trajectories for each query and evaluates them along multiple dimensions. High-quality trajectories are directly retained, while low-quality ones are repaired using a LLM (i.e., LLM-as-Repairer). The resulting repaired and high-quality trajectories form a synthetic SFT dataset, while each repaired trajectory paired with its original low-quality counterpart constitutes a dataset for trajectory preference modeling. In the reinforcement learning (RL) stage, based on the preference dataset, we train a trajectory-level reward model to assess the quality of reasoning paths and combine it with outcome and format rewards, thereby explicitly guiding the optimization toward reliable TIR behaviors. Experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoTraj in TIR.

*Alexander Hägele,Aryo Pradipta Gema,Henry Sleight,Ethan Perez,Jascha Sohl-Dickstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how highly capable AI models fail, distinguishing between systematic goal misalignment and nonsensical actions. It introduces 'incoherence' as a measure of variance-driven errors, finding that larger models often exhibit more incoherent failures, especially in complex tasks. This suggests future AI risks may involve unpredictable misbehavior rather than deliberate misalignment, emphasizing the need for research on reward hacking and goal misspecification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems handle more consequential tasks, understanding their failure modes becomes critical. The paper aims to determine whether failures stem from systematic goal misalignment or erratic, nonsensical actions.

Method: The study uses a bias-variance decomposition to measure AI 'incoherence,' defined as the fraction of error due to variance rather than bias. Experiments assess how incoherence varies with model scale and task complexity.

Result: Larger, more capable models tend to exhibit higher incoherence, especially in complex tasks requiring sequential reasoning. Scale alone does not eliminate incoherence, predicting more erratic failures in advanced AI systems.

Conclusion: Future AI failures may involve unpredictable behavior rather than systematic misalignment, highlighting the importance of alignment research focusing on reward hacking and goal misspecification.

Abstract: As AI becomes more capable, we entrust it with more general and consequential tasks. The risks from failure grow more severe with increasing task scope. It is therefore important to understand how extremely capable AI models will fail: Will they fail by systematically pursuing goals we do not intend? Or will they fail by being a hot mess, and taking nonsensical actions that do not further any goal? We operationalize this question using a bias-variance decomposition of the errors made by AI models: An AI's \emph{incoherence} on a task is measured over test-time randomness as the fraction of its error that stems from variance rather than bias in task outcome. Across all tasks and frontier models we measure, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, \emph{the more incoherent} their failures become. Incoherence changes with model scale in a way that is experiment dependent. However, in several settings, larger, more capable models are more incoherent than smaller models. Consequently, scale alone seems unlikely to eliminate incoherence. Instead, as more capable AIs pursue harder tasks, requiring more sequential action and thought, our results predict failures to be accompanied by more incoherent behavior. This suggests a future where AIs sometimes cause industrial accidents (due to unpredictable misbehavior), but are less likely to exhibit consistent pursuit of a misaligned goal. This increases the relative importance of alignment research targeting reward hacking or goal misspecification.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ContextMATH, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' contextual mathematical reasoning. Despite strong performance on abstract problems, models struggle with realistic scenarios, especially formulation accuracy. Larger models improve understanding and reasoning, but gaps remain unsolved.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in mathematical problem-solving by LLMs.

Method: Introduces ContextMATH, repurposing AIME and MATH-500 problems into Scenario Grounding (SG) and Complexity Scaling (CS) settings, and evaluates 61 models.

Result: Significant performance drops observed: open-source models decline by 13-34 points, proprietary by 13-20. Errors stem from incorrect formulation, which scales with model size.

Conclusion: Contextual reasoning remains a challenge; formulation and reasoning are bottlenecks. Fine-tuning helps but doesn't fully close gaps.

Abstract: Large language models now solve many benchmark math problems at near-expert levels, yet this progress has not fully translated into reliable performance in real-world applications. We study this gap through contextual mathematical reasoning, where the mathematical core must be formulated from descriptive scenarios. We introduce ContextMATH, a benchmark that repurposes AIME and MATH-500 problems into two contextual settings: Scenario Grounding (SG), which embeds abstract problems into realistic narratives without increasing reasoning complexity, and Complexity Scaling (CS), which transforms explicit conditions into sub-problems to capture how constraints often appear in practice. Evaluating 61 proprietary and open-source models, we observe sharp drops: on average, open-source models decline by 13 and 34 points on SG and CS, while proprietary models drop by 13 and 20. Error analysis shows that errors are dominated by incorrect problem formulation, with formulation accuracy declining as original problem difficulty increases. Correct formulation emerges as a prerequisite for success, and its sufficiency improves with model scale, indicating that larger models advance in both understanding and reasoning. Nevertheless, formulation and reasoning remain two complementary bottlenecks that limit contextual mathematical problem solving. Finally, we find that fine-tuning with scenario data improves performance, whereas formulation-only training is ineffective. However, performance gaps are only partially alleviated, highlighting contextual mathematical reasoning as a central unsolved challenge for LLMs.

TL;DR: MedMCP-Calc is introduced as the first benchmark for LLMs in realistic medical calculator scenarios, highlighting model limitations in workflow and database interactions. CalcMate, a fine-tuned model, achieves top performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for medical calculators lack realism, focusing only on static, single-step calculations. MedMCP-Calc addresses this by evaluating LLMs in multi-stage, adaptive clinical scenarios.

Method: MedMCP-Calc includes 118 tasks across 4 domains, featuring fuzzy queries, EHR database interaction, and external references. It evaluates 23 models using Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration.

Result: Top models like Claude Opus 4.5 struggle with calculator selection, iterative SQL interactions, and tool use. CalcMate, a fine-tuned model, outperforms open-source alternatives.

Conclusion: MedMCP-Calc reveals critical gaps in LLM performance for medical calculators, proposing CalcMate as a solution. The benchmark and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Medical calculators are fundamental to quantitative, evidence-based clinical practice. However, their real-world use is an adaptive, multi-stage process, requiring proactive EHR data acquisition, scenario-dependent calculator selection, and multi-step computation, whereas current benchmarks focus only on static single-step calculations with explicit instructions. To address these limitations, we introduce MedMCP-Calc, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in realistic medical calculator scenarios through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. MedMCP-Calc comprises 118 scenario tasks across 4 clinical domains, featuring fuzzy task descriptions mimicking natural queries, structured EHR database interaction, external reference retrieval, and process-level evaluation. Our evaluation of 23 leading models reveals critical limitations: even top performers like Claude Opus 4.5 exhibit substantial gaps, including difficulty selecting appropriate calculators for end-to-end workflows given fuzzy queries, poor performance in iterative SQL-based database interactions, and marked reluctance to leverage external tools for numerical computation. Performance also varies considerably across clinical domains. Building on these findings, we develop CalcMate, a fine-tuned model incorporating scenario planning and tool augmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models. Benchmark and Codes are available in https://github.com/SPIRAL-MED/MedMCP-Calc.

TL;DR: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning improves LLM performance but can be obfuscated under optimization pressures, reducing model monitorability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how optimization pressures on CoT reasoning may lead to obfuscation and unintended consequences for model transparency.

Method: Studied generalization of obfuscation across tasks, including reward hacking scenarios, and evaluated the impact of penalizing final actions.

Result: Obfuscation generalizes across tasks, even when penalizing only final actions, reducing model monitorability unpredictably.

Conclusion: Current penalization practices may inadvertently harm LLM transparency and monitorability.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning provides a significant performance uplift to LLMs by enabling planning, exploration, and deliberation of their actions. CoT is also a powerful tool for monitoring the behaviours of these agents: when faithful, they offer interpretations of the model's decision making process, and an early warning sign for dangerous behaviours. However, optimisation pressures placed on the CoT may cause the model to obfuscate reasoning traces, losing this beneficial property. We show that obfuscation can generalise across tasks; models that learn to obfuscate reasoning involving reward hacking (e.g. accessing and utilising leaked information) generalise both the reward hacking behaviour and its obfuscation in CoT to unseen reward hacking settings. Most worryingly, we show that obfuscation of CoT reasoning, and its generalisation across tasks, also follows when we penalise only the model's final actions after closing its CoT. Our findings suggest that current practices of penalising harmful generations may inadvertently lead to a reduction in the broader monitorability of LLMs in unpredictable ways.

TL;DR: ThinkSafe is a self-generated alignment framework that improves safety in large reasoning models without external teachers, preserving reasoning proficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over-optimization in large reasoning models (LRMs) prioritizes compliance, making them vulnerable to harmful prompts. External teacher distillation mitigates safety degradation but introduces distributional discrepancies, degrading native reasoning.

Method: ThinkSafe leverages lightweight refusal steering to generate in-distribution safety reasoning traces, fine-tuning the model on these self-generated responses to restore safety alignment.

Result: Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Qwen3 show ThinkSafe significantly improves safety while maintaining reasoning performance, outperforming GRPO with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: ThinkSafe effectively realigns LRMs for safety without external teachers, balancing safety and reasoning proficiency efficiently.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance by leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) on reasoning tasks to generate long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this over-optimization often prioritizes compliance, making models vulnerable to harmful prompts. To mitigate this safety degradation, recent approaches rely on external teacher distillation, yet this introduces a distributional discrepancy that degrades native reasoning. We propose ThinkSafe, a self-generated alignment framework that restores safety alignment without external teachers. Our key insight is that while compliance suppresses safety mechanisms, models often retain latent knowledge to identify harm. ThinkSafe unlocks this via lightweight refusal steering, guiding the model to generate in-distribution safety reasoning traces. Fine-tuning on these self-generated responses effectively realigns the model while minimizing distribution shift. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Qwen3 show ThinkSafe significantly improves safety while preserving reasoning proficiency. Notably, it achieves superior safety and comparable reasoning to GRPO, with significantly reduced computational cost.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MCRMO-Attack, a novel method for universal targeted adversarial attacks on MLLMs, addressing challenges like target supervision variance and unreliable token-wise matching, achieving significant performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome limitations of prior sample-specific adversarial attacks by tackling universal targeted transferable adversarial attacks (UTTAA), which require consistent perturbations across unknown MLLMs.

Method: MCRMO-Attack introduces Multi-Crop Aggregation for stable supervision, alignability-gated Token Routing for reliable token-level matching, and meta-learning for cross-target perturbation prior.

Result: The method boosts attack success rates by +23.7% on GPT-4o and +19.9% on Gemini-2.0 compared to the strongest universal baseline.

Conclusion: MCRMO-Attack effectively addresses UTTAA challenges, demonstrating superior performance and generality across commercial MLLMs.

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks on closed-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been increasingly explored under black-box transfer, yet prior methods are predominantly sample-specific and offer limited reusability across inputs. We instead study a more stringent setting, Universal Targeted Transferable Adversarial Attacks (UTTAA), where a single perturbation must consistently steer arbitrary inputs toward a specified target across unknown commercial MLLMs. Naively adapting existing sample-wise attacks to this universal setting faces three core difficulties: (i) target supervision becomes high-variance due to target-crop randomness, (ii) token-wise matching is unreliable because universality suppresses image-specific cues that would otherwise anchor alignment, and (iii) few-source per-target adaptation is highly initialization-sensitive, which can degrade the attainable performance. In this work, we propose MCRMO-Attack, which stabilizes supervision via Multi-Crop Aggregation with an Attention-Guided Crop, improves token-level reliability through alignability-gated Token Routing, and meta-learns a cross-target perturbation prior that yields stronger per-target solutions. Across commercial MLLMs, we boost unseen-image attack success rate by +23.7\% on GPT-4o and +19.9\% on Gemini-2.0 over the strongest universal baseline.

Motivation: To address limitations in current time series QA benchmarks by broadening task coverage and evaluating diverse temporal analysis capabilities.

Method: TSAQA integrates six tasks under a single framework, using diverse formats (TF, MC, PZ) and spanning 210k samples across 13 domains.

Result: Zero-shot evaluation shows tasks are challenging for LLMs, with Gemini-2.5-Flash averaging 65.08. Instruction tuning improves open-source models but gaps remain.

Conclusion: Temporal analysis remains complex for LLMs, highlighting the need for further advancement.

Abstract: Time series data are integral to critical applications across domains such as finance, healthcare, transportation, and environmental science. While recent work has begun to explore multi-task time series question answering (QA), current benchmarks remain limited to forecasting and anomaly detection tasks. We introduce TSAQA, a novel unified benchmark designed to broaden task coverage and evaluate diverse temporal analysis capabilities. TSAQA integrates six diverse tasks under a single framework ranging from conventional analysis, including anomaly detection and classification, to advanced analysis, such as characterization, comparison, data transformation, and temporal relationship analysis. Spanning 210k samples across 13 domains, the dataset employs diverse formats, including true-or-false (TF), multiple-choice (MC), and a novel puzzling (PZ), to comprehensively assess time series analysis. Zero-shot evaluation demonstrates that these tasks are challenging for current Large Language Models (LLMs): the best-performing commercial LLM, Gemini-2.5-Flash, achieves an average score of only 65.08. Although instruction tuning boosts open-source performance: the best-performing open-source model, LLaMA-3.1-8B, shows significant room for improvement, highlighting the complexity of temporal analysis for LLMs.

### [190] [High-quality generation of dynamic game content via small language models: A proof of concept](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23206)
*Morten I. K. Munk,Arturo Valdivia,Paolo Burelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes using aggressively fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) for high-quality, real-time game content generation, overcoming limitations of large language models (LLMs) like incoherence and cloud dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face issues like narrative incoherence and high operational costs, while existing SLMs produce poor output. The paper aims to solve these by leveraging fine-tuned SLMs for specialized tasks.

Method: The method involves aggressive fine-tuning of SLMs on narrowly scoped tasks, using synthetically generated training data grounded in the game world via a DAG-based approach. A proof-of-concept RPG loop validates the approach.

Result: The fine-tuned SLMs achieve adequate quality for real-time generation, as judged by an LLM, with predictable latency.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates feasibility for real-time game content generation under typical constraints, offering a practical alternative to cloud-dependent LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promise for dynamic game content generation, but they face critical barriers, including narrative incoherence and high operational costs. Due to their large size, they are often accessed in the cloud, limiting their application in offline games. Many of these practical issues are solved by pivoting to small language models (SLMs), but existing studies using SLMs have resulted in poor output quality. We propose a strategy of achieving high-quality SLM generation through aggressive fine-tuning on deliberately scoped tasks with narrow context, constrained structure, or both. In short, more difficult tasks require narrower scope and higher specialization to the training corpus. Training data is synthetically generated via a DAG-based approach, grounding models in the specific game world. Such models can form the basis for agentic networks designed around the narratological framework at hand, representing a more practical and robust solution than cloud-dependent LLMs. To validate this approach, we present a proof-of-concept focusing on a single specialized SLM as the fundamental building block. We introduce a minimal RPG loop revolving around rhetorical battles of reputations, powered by this model. We demonstrate that a simple retry-until-success strategy reaches adequate quality (as defined by an LLM-as-a-judge scheme) with predictable latency suitable for real-time generation. While local quality assessment remains an open question, our results demonstrate feasibility for real-time generation under typical game engine constraints.

*Ali Asadi,Krishnendu Chatterjee,Ehsan Goharshady,Mehrdad Karrabi,Alipasha Montaseri,Carlo Pagano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper resolves the open problem of strongly-polynomial time algorithms for robust MDPs with fixed discount factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending efficient algorithms from classical MDPs to robust MDPs is crucial for handling uncertainty in sequential decision-making.

Method: A robust policy iteration algorithm is proposed for $(s, a)$-rectangular $L_\infty$ RMDPs with constant discount factors.

Result: The algorithm runs in strongly-polynomial time, addressing a key algorithmic question in robust MDPs.

Conclusion: This work advances the computational tractability of robust MDPs, bridging a gap between classical and robust optimization models.

Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a fundamental model in sequential decision making. Robust MDPs (RMDPs) extend this framework by allowing uncertainty in transition probabilities and optimizing against the worst-case realization of that uncertainty. In particular, $(s, a)$-rectangular RMDPs with $L_\infty$ uncertainty sets form a fundamental and expressive model: they subsume classical MDPs and turn-based stochastic games. We consider this model with discounted payoffs. The existence of polynomial and strongly-polynomial time algorithms is a fundamental problem for these optimization models. For MDPs, linear programming yields polynomial-time algorithms for any arbitrary discount factor, and the seminal work of Ye established strongly--polynomial time for a fixed discount factor. The generalization of such results to RMDPs has remained an important open problem. In this work, we show that a robust policy iteration algorithm runs in strongly-polynomial time for $(s, a)$-rectangular $L_\infty$ RMDPs with a constant (fixed) discount factor, resolving an important algorithmic question.

TL;DR: Study explores multimodal emotion recognition on the EAV dataset, finding simpler, domain-specific methods outperform complex attention mechanisms on small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether complex attention mechanisms improve performance on small datasets for multimodal emotion recognition.

Method: Implemented three model categories: baseline transformers (M1), novel factorized attention mechanisms (M2), and improved CNN baselines (M3). Tested on the EAV dataset.

Result: Complex attention mechanisms underperformed (5-13pp below baselines). Simple modifications (e.g., delta MFCCs for audio, frequency-domain EEG features) improved accuracy significantly. Vision transformer baseline (M1) outperformed benchmarks.

Conclusion: Domain knowledge and proper implementation outperform architectural complexity for small-scale emotion recognition.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of multimodal emotion recognition using the EAV dataset, investigating whether complex attention mechanisms improve performance on small datasets. We implement three model categories: baseline transformers (M1), novel factorized attention mechanisms (M2), and improved CNN baselines (M3). Our experiments show that sophisticated attention mechanisms consistently underperform on small datasets. M2 models achieved 5 to 13 percentage points below baselines due to overfitting and destruction of pretrained features. In contrast, simple domain-appropriate modifications proved effective: adding delta MFCCs to the audio CNN improved accuracy from 61.9\% to \textbf{65.56\%} (+3.66pp), while frequency-domain features for EEG achieved \textbf{67.62\%} (+7.62pp over the paper baseline). Our vision transformer baseline (M1) reached \textbf{75.30\%}, exceeding the paper's ViViT result (74.5\%) through domain-specific pretraining, and vision delta features achieved \textbf{72.68\%} (+1.28pp over the paper CNN). These findings demonstrate that for small-scale emotion recognition, domain knowledge and proper implementation outperform architectural complexity.

TL;DR: CELM is a clinical EEG-to-Language foundation model that generates detailed reports from long-term EEG recordings, significantly outperforming baselines in various metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual summarization of abnormal patterns and findings from long-term EEG recordings is labor-intensive, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: CELM integrates pretrained EEG foundation models with language models to summarize EEG recordings and generate clinical reports at multiple scales.

Result: CELM achieves 70%–95% improvement in generation metrics (e.g., ROUGE-1, METEOR) and outperforms baselines in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: CELM enables scalable multimodal learning for clinical EEG report generation, offering a significant performance boost over existing methods.

Abstract: Generating clinical reports that summarize abnormal patterns, diagnostic findings, and clinical interpretations from long-term EEG recordings remains labor-intensive. We curate a large-scale clinical EEG dataset with $9{,}922$ reports paired with approximately $11{,}000$ hours of EEG recordings from $9{,}048$ patients. We therefore develop CELM, the first clinical EEG-to-Language foundation model capable of summarizing long-duration, variable-length EEG recordings and performing end-to-end clinical report generation at multiple scales, including recording description, background activity, epileptiform abnormalities, events/seizures, and impressions. Experimental results show that, with patient history supervision, our method achieves $70\%$--$95\%$ average relative improvements in standard generation metrics (e.g., ROUGE-1 and METEOR) from $0.2$--$0.3$ to $0.4$--$0.6$. In the zero-shot setting without patient history, CELM attains generation scores in the range of $0.43$--$0.52$, compared to baselines of $0.17$--$0.26$. CELM integrates pretrained EEG foundation models with language models to enable scalable multimodal learning. We release our model and benchmark construction pipeline at [URL].

### [195] [FedAdaVR: Adaptive Variance Reduction for Robust Federated Learning under Limited Client Participation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22204)
*S M Ruhul Kabir Howlader,Xiao Chen,Yifei Xie,Lu Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedAdaVR is a novel FL algorithm addressing heterogeneity issues in federated learning, particularly sporadic client participation, using adaptive optimization and variance reduction. FedAdaVR-Quant further reduces memory usage while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses pervasive heterogeneity challenges in FL, especially partial client participation errors, which are insufficiently explored in current literature.

Method: FedAdaVR integrates an adaptive optimizer with variance reduction to emulate participation of absent clients. FedAdaVR-Quant quantizes client updates, cutting memory needs significantly.

Result: FedAdaVR eliminates partial client participation error and outperforms baselines in IID and non-IID settings. FedAdaVR-Quant reduces memory by 50%-87.5% without performance loss.

Conclusion: FedAdaVR and FedAdaVR-Quant effectively tackle FL heterogeneity and memory issues, showcasing superior performance and scalability.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) encounters substantial challenges due to heterogeneity, leading to gradient noise, client drift, and partial client participation errors, the last of which is the most pervasive but remains insufficiently addressed in current literature. In this paper, we propose FedAdaVR, a novel FL algorithm aimed at solving heterogeneity issues caused by sporadic client participation by incorporating an adaptive optimiser with a variance reduction technique. This method takes advantage of the most recent stored updates from clients, even when they are absent from the current training round, thereby emulating their presence. Furthermore, we propose FedAdaVR-Quant, which stores client updates in quantised form, significantly reducing the memory requirements (by 50%, 75%, and 87.5%) of FedAdaVR while maintaining equivalent model performance. We analyse the convergence behaviour of FedAdaVR under general nonconvex conditions and prove that our proposed algorithm can eliminate partial client participation error. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets, under both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID settings, demonstrate that FedAdaVR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.

### [196] [Causal Imitation Learning Under Measurement Error and Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22206)
*Shi Bo,AmirEmad Ghassami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 	exttt{CausIL}, a framework for offline imitation learning (IL) that addresses spurious correlations caused by noisy state observations and distribution shifts, ensuring robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline IL often fails under noisy state measurements and distribution shifts, leading to biased policies. The paper aims to overcome this by modeling causal relationships.

Method: The authors propose 	exttt{CausIL}, which treats noisy observations as proxy variables and uses proximal causal inference for policy recovery. Estimators for discrete/continuous states are developed.

Result: Experiments on PhysioNet data show 	exttt{CausIL} outperforms behavioral cloning baselines in robustness to distribution shift.

Conclusion: 	exttt{CausIL} provides a causal framework for robust offline IL under measurement error and distribution shifts, validated empirically.

Abstract: We study offline imitation learning (IL) when part of the decision-relevant state is observed only through noisy measurements and the distribution may change between training and deployment. Such settings induce spurious state-action correlations, so standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- whether conditioning on raw measurements or ignoring them -- can converge to systematically biased policies under distribution shift. We propose a general framework for IL under measurement error, inspired by explicitly modeling the causal relationships among the variables, yielding a target that retains a causal interpretation and is robust to distribution shift. Building on ideas from proximal causal inference, we introduce \texttt{CausIL}, which treats noisy state observations as proxy variables, and we provide identification conditions under which the target policy is recoverable from demonstrations without rewards or interactive expert queries. We develop estimators for both discrete and continuous state spaces; for continuous settings, we use an adversarial procedure over RKHS function classes to learn the required parameters. We evaluate \texttt{CausIL} on semi-simulated longitudinal data from the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 cohort and demonstrate improved robustness to distribution shift compared to BC baselines.

### [197] [Latent Spherical Flow Policy for Reinforcement Learning with Combinatorial Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22211)
*Lingkai Kong,Anagha Satish,Hezi Jiang,Akseli Kangaslahti,Andrew Ma,Wenbo Chen,Mingxiao Song,Lily Xu,Milind Tambe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes LSFlow, a latent spherical flow policy for combinatorial RL, ensuring feasibility and expressiveness by combining generative policies with combinatorial solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combinatorial RL faces challenges due to exponentially large action spaces and complex constraints, which existing methods address with limited generality.

Method: LSFlow uses spherical flow matching to learn a stochastic policy in a latent space, delegating feasibility to a solver, and introduces a smoothed Bellman operator.

Result: Empirically, LSFlow outperforms baselines by 20.6% across tasks.

Conclusion: LSFlow effectively balances expressiveness and feasibility in combinatorial RL.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with combinatorial action spaces remains challenging because feasible action sets are exponentially large and governed by complex feasibility constraints, making direct policy parameterization impractical. Existing approaches embed task-specific value functions into constrained optimization programs or learn deterministic structured policies, sacrificing generality and policy expressiveness. We propose a solver-induced \emph{latent spherical flow policy} that brings the expressiveness of modern generative policies to combinatorial RL while guaranteeing feasibility by design. Our method, LSFlow, learns a \emph{stochastic} policy in a compact continuous latent space via spherical flow matching, and delegates feasibility to a combinatorial optimization solver that maps each latent sample to a valid structured action. To improve efficiency, we train the value network directly in the latent space, avoiding repeated solver calls during policy optimization. To address the piecewise-constant and discontinuous value landscape induced by solver-based action selection, we introduce a smoothed Bellman operator that yields stable, well-defined learning targets. Empirically, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 20.6\% across a range of challenging combinatorial RL tasks.

### [198] [DAJ: Data-Reweighted LLM Judge for Test-Time Scaling in Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22230)
*Peijia Qin,Ruiyi Zhang,Qi Cao,Pengtao Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAJ is a reasoning-based LLM judge trained with verifiable rewards using a bi-level data-reweighted framework, addressing distribution shifts in Best-of-N selection for code generation. It outperforms baselines and proprietary models on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Best-of-N selection relies on LLM judges, but training them is challenging due to distribution shifts like imbalances between easy/hard problems and mismatches in training/evaluation tasks.

Method: DAJ uses a bi-level data-reweighted learning framework to optimize generalization by learning domain- or instance-level data-importance weights, emphasizing hard problems and aligned data.

Result: DAJ achieves state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench and BigCodeBench, surpassing test-time scaling baselines and proprietary models.

Conclusion: DAJ effectively addresses training challenges for LLM judges, improving test-time scaling for code generation without relying on hand-crafted heuristics.

Abstract: Test-time scaling for code generation commonly relies on Best-of-N selection, in which multiple candidate solutions are sampled from a base model, and the best one is selected by an LLM judge. However, training reliable LLM judges is challenging due to severe distribution shifts, including imbalances between easy and hard problems, mismatches between training tasks and evaluation benchmarks, and trajectory mismatch arising from training data generated by cheaper models whose behavior differs from that of inference-time models. We propose DAJ, a reasoning-based LLM judge trained with verifiable rewards under a bi-level data-reweighted learning framework. The proposed framework learns data-importance weights (either domain-level or instance-level) to optimize generalization performance on a held-out meta set aligned with target benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of data reweighting to LLM-as-a-Judge training for test-time scaling. Our approach automatically emphasizes hard problems, in-distribution samples, and trajectory-aligned data, without relying on hand-crafted heuristics. Empirically, DAJ achieves state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench and BigCodeBench, outperforming strong test-time scaling baselines as well as leading proprietary models.

### [199] [AgentScore: Autoformulation of Deployable Clinical Scoring Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22324)
*Silas Ruhrberg Estévez,Christopher Chiu,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AgentScore introduces a method to create deployable clinical checklist scores by leveraging LLMs for rule proposals and a verification loop, outperforming existing methods across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical guidelines need interpretable, deployable scoring systems, but existing machine-learning models often fail due to workflow constraints like memorability and auditability.

Method: AgentScore uses LLMs to propose candidate rules and a deterministic verification loop to ensure statistical validity and deployability, optimizing over discrete rule sets.

Result: AgentScore outperforms existing score-generation methods and matches AUC of interpretable models under stricter constraints, achieving higher discrimination in externally validated tasks.

Conclusion: AgentScore bridges the gap between machine-learning performance and clinical deployability by aligning with workflow constraints and guideline requirements.

Abstract: Modern clinical practice relies on evidence-based guidelines implemented as compact scoring systems composed of a small number of interpretable decision rules. While machine-learning models achieve strong performance, many fail to translate into routine clinical use due to misalignment with workflow constraints such as memorability, auditability, and bedside execution. We argue that this gap arises not from insufficient predictive power, but from optimizing over model classes that are incompatible with guideline deployment. Deployable guidelines often take the form of unit-weighted clinical checklists, formed by thresholding the sum of binary rules, but learning such scores requires searching an exponentially large discrete space of possible rule sets. We introduce AgentScore, which performs semantically guided optimization in this space by using LLMs to propose candidate rules and a deterministic, data-grounded verification-and-selection loop to enforce statistical validity and deployability constraints. Across eight clinical prediction tasks, AgentScore outperforms existing score-generation methods and achieves AUC comparable to more flexible interpretable models despite operating under stronger structural constraints. On two additional externally validated tasks, AgentScore achieves higher discrimination than established guideline-based scores.

*Ruiyi Zhang,Peijia Qin,Qi Cao,Eric Xue,Pengtao Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FunPRM improves LLM-based code generation by modularizing code into functions and using a meta-learning reward correction mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail at complex programming tasks, and existing PRMs are ineffective due to poor step decomposition and noisy rewards.

Method: FunPRM promotes modular code generation via functions as PRM steps and corrects rewards using meta-learning via unit-test evaluations.

Result: FunPRM outperforms other methods on LiveCodeBench and BigCodeBench, achieving state-of-the-art performance and producing more readable code.

Conclusion: FunPRM enhances LLM code generation by addressing decomposition and reward noise, improving performance and code quality.

Abstract: Code generation is a core application of large language models (LLMs), yet LLMs still frequently fail on complex programming tasks. Given its success in mathematical reasoning, test-time scaling approaches such as Process Reward Model (PRM)-based Best-of-N selection offer a promising way to improve performance. However, existing PRMs remain ineffective for code generation due to the lack of meaningful step decomposition in code and the noise of Monte Carlo-estimated partial-solution correctness scores (rewards). To address these challenges, we propose FunPRM. FunPRM prompts LLMs to encourage modular code generation organized into functions, with functions treated as PRM reasoning steps. Furthermore, FunPRM introduces a novel meta-learning-based reward correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution rewards obtained via a unit-test-based evaluation system to purify noisy partial-solution rewards. Experiments on LiveCodeBench and BigCodeBench demonstrate that FunPRM consistently outperforms existing test-time scaling methods across five base LLMs, notably achieving state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench when combined with O4-mini. Furthermore, FunPRM produces code that is more readable and reusable for developers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A symmetry-breaking protocol improves transformer performance by adding batchwise-sampled biases, enhancing optimizer efficiency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard attention mechanisms contain redundant rotational degrees of freedom that do not affect outputs but could be leveraged for better performance and interpretability.

Method: Introduces unlearned query and value biases to break rotational symmetry, tested with four optimizers on transformer models.

Result: Improves performance of simple optimizers, closes gaps to adaptive methods, and enables interpretable amplification of semantic token classes.

Conclusion: Minimal architectural changes can enhance both performance and interpretability in transformers.

Abstract: The attention mechanism in its standard implementation contains extraneous rotational degrees of freedom that are carried through computation but do not affect model activations or outputs. We introduce a simple symmetry-breaking protocol that inserts a preferred direction into this rotational space through batchwise-sampled, unlearned query and value biases. This modification has two theoretically motivated and empirically validated consequences. First, it can substantially improve the performance of simple, memory-efficient optimizers, narrowing -- and in some cases closing -- the gap to successful but more complex memory-intensive adaptive methods. We demonstrate this by pretraining 124M parameter transformer models with four optimization algorithms (AdamW, SOAP, SGDM, and Energy Conserving Descent(ECD)) and evaluating both validation loss and downstream logical reasoning. Second, it enables an interpretable use of otherwise redundant rotational degrees of freedom, selectively amplifying semantically meaningful token classes within individual attention heads. Overall, our results show that minimal, principled architectural changes can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability.

*Da In Kim,Wei Siang Lai,Kelly W. Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A classification-based framework adapts tabular foundation models for survival analysis by discretizing event times, handling censoring naturally as missing labels, and outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to adapt tabular foundation models for survival analysis, addressing challenges like right-censoring and enabling in-context learning without explicit training.

Method: Reformulates survival analysis as binary classification by discretizing event times and treating censored observations as missing labels.

Result: Proven recovery of true survival probabilities under standard assumptions; outperforms classical and deep learning baselines across 53 datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively leverages tabular foundation models for survival analysis, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: While tabular foundation models have achieved remarkable success in classification and regression, adapting them to model time-to-event outcomes for survival analysis is non-trivial due to right-censoring, where data observations may end before the event occurs. We develop a classification-based framework that reformulates both static and dynamic survival analysis as a series of binary classification problems by discretizing event times. Censored observations are naturally handled as examples with missing labels at certain time points. This classification formulation enables existing tabular foundation models to perform survival analysis through in-context learning without explicit training. We prove that under standard censoring assumptions, minimizing our binary classification loss recovers the true survival probabilities as the training set size increases. We demonstrate through evaluation across $53$ real-world datasets that off-the-shelf tabular foundation models with this classification formulation outperform classical and deep learning baselines on average over multiple survival metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A low-cost HAR framework using wearable sensors and STM outperforms classical classifiers for monitoring therapeutic exercises, aiding remote healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing neglect and poor adherence to therapeutic exercises in elderly and vulnerable patients due to limited medical infrastructure.

Method: Used accelerometer and gyroscope data to track activities, evaluating Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, k-NN, and proposed STM.

Result: STM achieved 96.67% test accuracy and 98.50% cross-validation accuracy, outperforming SVM (93.33%) and others.

Conclusion: The STM-based framework is scalable and effective for remote healthcare, elderly assistance, and low-resource settings.

Abstract: Limited access to medical infrastructure forces elderly and vulnerable patients to rely on home-based care, often leading to neglect and poor adherence to therapeutic exercises such as yoga or physiotherapy. To address this gap, we propose a low-cost and automated human activity recognition (HAR) framework based on wearable inertial sensors and machine learning. Activity data, including walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying, were collected using accelerometer and gyroscope measurements. Four classical classifiers, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), were evaluated and compared with the proposed Support Tensor Machine (STM). Experimental results show that SVM achieved an accuracy of 93.33 percent, while Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and k-NN achieved 91.11 percent. In contrast, STM significantly outperformed these models, achieving a test accuracy of 96.67 percent and the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.50 percent. Unlike conventional methods, STM leverages tensor representations to preserve spatio-temporal motion dynamics, resulting in robust classification across diverse activities. The proposed framework demonstrates strong potential for remote healthcare, elderly assistance, child activity monitoring, yoga feedback, and smart home wellness, offering a scalable solution for low-resource and rural healthcare settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPECIAL is a memory-free FDIL algorithm that ensures backward knowledge transfer and efficient learning across tasks without extra memory or communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of Federated Domain-Incremental Learning (FDIL) where data distributions drift dynamically and privacy prevents raw-data sharing.

Method: Introduces SPECIAL, adding a lightweight server-side proximal term to FedAvg to curb drift without additional resources like replay buffers or synthetic data.

Result: SPECIAL guarantees backward knowledge transfer and achieves efficient convergence across tasks with partial participation.

Conclusion: SPECIAL effectively handles FDIL challenges while maintaining communication and model efficiency.

Abstract: Real-world federated systems seldom operate on static data: input distributions drift while privacy rules forbid raw-data sharing. We study this setting as Federated Domain-Incremental Learning (FDIL), where (i) clients are heterogeneous, (ii) tasks arrive sequentially with shifting domains, yet (iii) the label space remains fixed. Two theoretical pillars remain missing for FDIL under realistic deployment: a guarantee of backward knowledge transfer (BKT) and a convergence rate that holds across the sequence of all tasks with partial participation. We introduce SPECIAL (Server-Proximal Efficient Continual Aggregation for Learning), a simple, memory-free FDIL algorithm that adds a single server-side ``anchor'' to vanilla FedAvg: in each round, the server nudges the uniformly sampled participated clients update toward the previous global model with a lightweight proximal term. This anchor curbs cumulative drift without replay buffers, synthetic data, or task-specific heads, keeping communication and model size unchanged. Our theory shows that SPECIAL (i) preserves earlier tasks: a BKT bound caps any increase in prior-task loss by a drift-controlled term that shrinks with more rounds, local epochs, and participating clients; and (ii) learns efficiently across all tasks: the first communication-efficient non-convex convergence rate for FDIL with partial participation, O((E/NT)^(1/2)), with E local epochs, T communication rounds, and N participated clients per round, matching single-task FedAvg while explicitly separating optimization variance from inter-task drift. Experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness of SPECIAL.

Motivation: Fair compensation and sustainable data marketplaces require a principled framework for valuing data contributors in T2I diffusion models.

Method: Uses SurrogateSHAP, combining inference from pretrained models and gradient-boosted trees to approximate Shapley values.

Result: SurrogateSHAP outperforms prior methods, reduces computational costs, and effectively identifies influential contributors across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: SurrogateSHAP offers a scalable solution for fair attribution and auditing in safety-critical generative models.

Abstract: As Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models are increasingly used in real-world creative workflows, a principled framework for valuing contributors who provide a collection of data is essential for fair compensation and sustainable data marketplaces. While the Shapley value offers a theoretically grounded approach to attribution, it faces a dual computational bottleneck: (i) the prohibitive cost of exhaustive model retraining for each sampled subset of players (i.e., data contributors) and (ii) the combinatorial number of subsets needed to estimate marginal contributions due to contributor interactions. To this end, we propose SurrogateSHAP, a retraining-free framework that approximates the expensive retraining game through inference from a pretrained model. To further improve efficiency, we employ a gradient-boosted tree to approximate the utility function and derive Shapley values analytically from the tree-based model. We evaluate SurrogateSHAP across three diverse attribution tasks: (i) image quality for DDPM-CFG on CIFAR-20, (ii) aesthetics for Stable Diffusion on Post-Impressionist artworks, and (iii) product diversity for FLUX.1 on Fashion-Product data. Across settings, SurrogateSHAP outperforms prior methods while substantially reducing computational overhead, consistently identifying influential contributors across multiple utility metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that SurrogateSHAP effectively localizes data sources responsible for spurious correlations in clinical images, providing a scalable path toward auditing safety-critical generative models.

### [206] [Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizer: A Unified Framework for Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22284)
*Yixuan Wang,Omkar Sudhir Patil,Warren E. Dixon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizers (RLOs) unify classic optimizers using a geometric framework derived from control theory, featuring rapid alignment and controlled evolution stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge control theory and machine learning optimization by systematically deriving optimizers rather than relying on heuristic improvements.

Method: RLOs are based on a control-theoretic framework treating optimization as a dynamical system on a Riemannian manifold, using a Normally Attracting Invariant Manifold (NAIM) and Lyapunov functions.

Result: RLOs recover classic algorithms and enable principled design, achieving state-of-the-art performance in large-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: RLOs provide a unified, systematic approach to designing stable and effective optimizers by integrating control theory and optimization.

Abstract: We introduce Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizers (RLOs), a family of optimization algorithms that unifies classic optimizers within one geometric framework. Unlike heuristic improvements to existing optimizers, RLOs are systematically derived from a novel control-theoretic framework that reinterprets optimization as an extended state discrete-time controlled dynamical system on a Riemannian parameter manifold. Central to this framework is the identification of a Normally Attracting Invariant Manifold (NAIM), which organizes training dynamics into two distinct stages: rapid alignment of the speed state to a target graph, followed by controlled evolution within it. We formalize this by constructing a strict Lyapunov function that certifies convergence to a target manifold. This perspective yields a constructive ``optimizer generator" that not only recovers classic algorithms but enables the principled design of RLOs. We validate our theory via geometric diagnostics and demonstrate that grounding optimizer design in control theory yields state-of-the-art performance in large-scale benchmarks. Overall, RLOs bridge control theory and modern machine learning optimization, providing a unified language and a systematic toolkit for designing stable, effective optimizers.

*Luca Zhou,Bo Zhao,Rose Yu,Emanuele Rodolà*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores factors influencing model merging success, revealing dependencies on merging methods and partner tasks, with subspace overlap and gradient alignment as key compatibility metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the success factors of model merging, traditionally viewed as an intrinsic property, is crucial for improving merging outcomes and fine-tuning strategies.

Method: An architecture-agnostic framework using linear optimization over interpretable pairwise metrics (e.g., gradient L2 distance) analyzes post-merge performance across four merging methods.

Result: Substantial variation exists in success drivers (46.7% metric overlap; 55.3% sign agreement), with subspace overlap and gradient alignment consistently emerging as foundational prerequisites.

Conclusion: The findings offer diagnostic insights into mergeability, suggesting future fine-tuning strategies should emphasize subspace overlap and gradient alignment for compatibility.

Abstract: Model merging combines knowledge from separately fine-tuned models, yet success factors remain poorly understood. While recent work treats mergeability as an intrinsic property, we show with an architecture-agnostic framework that it fundamentally depends on both the merging method and the partner tasks. Using linear optimization over a set of interpretable pairwise metrics (e.g., gradient L2 distance), we uncover properties correlating with post-merge performance across four merging methods. We find substantial variation in success drivers (46.7% metric overlap; 55.3% sign agreement), revealing method-specific "fingerprints". Crucially, however, subspace overlap and gradient alignment metrics consistently emerge as foundational, method-agnostic prerequisites for compatibility. These findings provide a diagnostic foundation for understanding mergeability and motivate future fine-tuning strategies that explicitly encourage these properties.

TL;DR: ParalESN introduces parallel processing to Reservoir Computing by using structured operators and state space modeling, addressing scalability issues while maintaining accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome scalability limitations in Reservoir Computing, specifically sequential processing and high memory usage, by leveraging structured operators and state space modeling.

Method: The method involves constructing high-dimensional reservoirs using diagonal linear recurrence in complex space (ParalESN), enabling parallel processing of temporal data. Theoretical analysis ensures it preserves Echo State Property and universality guarantees.

Result: Empirically, ParalESN matches traditional RC's accuracy on benchmarks, offers computational savings, and achieves competitive accuracy on 1-D pixel-level tasks with reduced costs and energy usage.

Conclusion: ParalESN provides a scalable and efficient pathway for integrating Reservoir Computing into deep learning, addressing key limitations while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Reservoir Computing (RC) has established itself as an efficient paradigm for temporal processing. However, its scalability remains severely constrained by (i) the necessity of processing temporal data sequentially and (ii) the prohibitive memory footprint of high-dimensional reservoirs. In this work, we revisit RC through the lens of structured operators and state space modeling to address these limitations, introducing Parallel Echo State Network (ParalESN). ParalESN enables the construction of high-dimensional and efficient reservoirs based on diagonal linear recurrence in the complex space, enabling parallel processing of temporal data. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that ParalESN preserves the Echo State Property and the universality guarantees of traditional Echo State Networks while admitting an equivalent representation of arbitrary linear reservoirs in the complex diagonal form. Empirically, ParalESN matches the predictive accuracy of traditional RC on time series benchmarks, while delivering substantial computational savings. On 1-D pixel-level classification tasks, ParalESN achieves competitive accuracy with fully trainable neural networks while reducing computational costs and energy consumption by orders of magnitude. Overall, ParalESN offers a promising, scalable, and principled pathway for integrating RC within the deep learning landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of calibrated uncertainty in conditional generative models undermines trust in outputs for high-stakes applications.

Method: CP4Gen uses clustering-based density estimation on model-generated samples to create robust prediction sets.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show CP4Gen excels in prediction set volume and structural simplicity.

Conclusion: CP4Gen provides rigorous, interpretable uncertainty estimation for conditional generative models.

Abstract: Conditional generative models map input variables to complex, high-dimensional distributions, enabling realistic sample generation in a diverse set of domains. A critical challenge with these models is the absence of calibrated uncertainty, which undermines trust in individual outputs for high-stakes applications. To address this issue, we propose a systematic conformal prediction approach tailored to conditional generative models, leveraging density estimation on model-generated samples. We introduce a novel method called CP4Gen, which utilizes clustering-based density estimation to construct prediction sets that are less sensitive to outliers, more interpretable, and of lower structural complexity than existing methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world applications, including climate emulation tasks, demonstrate that CP4Gen consistently achieves superior performance in terms of prediction set volume and structural simplicity. Our approach offers practitioners a powerful tool for uncertainty estimation associated with conditional generative models, particularly in scenarios demanding rigorous and interpretable prediction sets.

Motivation: Address challenges in scalability, security, and update validation in federated learning, ensuring privacy and efficiency.

Method: Integrates DAG ledger with sidechains, zero-knowledge proofs, event-driven smart contracts, and oracle-assisted sidechains for model validation.

Result: Faster convergence, higher accuracy, lower perplexity, reduced latency, robustness against adversarial nodes, and efficient on-chain verification.

Conclusion: ZK-HybridFL is a scalable and secure solution for decentralized federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy, yet both centralized and decentralized approaches face challenges in scalability, security, and update validation. We propose ZK-HybridFL, a secure decentralized FL framework that integrates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) ledger with dedicated sidechains and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving model validation. The framework uses event-driven smart contracts and an oracle-assisted sidechain to verify local model updates without exposing sensitive data. A built-in challenge mechanism efficiently detects adversarial behavior. In experiments on image classification and language modeling tasks, ZK-HybridFL achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, lower perplexity, and reduced latency compared to Blade-FL and ChainFL. It remains robust against substantial fractions of adversarial and idle nodes, supports sub-second on-chain verification with efficient gas usage, and prevents invalid updates and orphanage-style attacks. This makes ZK-HybridFL a scalable and secure solution for decentralized FL across diverse environments.

*Bo Yuan,Yun Zhou,Zhichao Xu,Kiran Ramnath,Aosong Feng,Balasubramaniam Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BWG introduces Bayesian inference for workflow generation, using sampling and refinement to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior workflow generation methods lacked theoretical grounding and were framed as optimization problems.

Method: Proposes Bayesian Workflow Generation (BWG), using sampling with parallel look-ahead rollouts and a sequential refiner.

Result: BayesFlow improves accuracy by up to 9% over SOTA and 65% over zero-shot prompting.

Conclusion: BWG provides a principled, training-free approach superior to traditional search-based methods.

Abstract: Automatic workflow generation is the process of automatically synthesizing sequences of LLM calls, tool invocations, and post-processing steps for complex end-to-end tasks. Most prior methods cast this task as an optimization problem with limited theoretical grounding. We propose to cast workflow generation as Bayesian inference over a posterior distribution on workflows, and introduce \textbf{Bayesian Workflow Generation (BWG)}, a sampling framework that builds workflows step-by-step using parallel look-ahead rollouts for importance weighting and a sequential in-loop refiner for pool-wide improvements. We prove that, without the refiner, the weighted empirical distribution converges to the target posterior. We instantiate BWG as \textbf{BayesFlow}, a training-free algorithm for workflow construction. Across six benchmark datasets, BayesFlow improves accuracy by up to 9 percentage points over SOTA workflow generation baselines and by up to 65 percentage points over zero-shot prompting, establishing BWG as a principled upgrade to search-based workflow design. Code will be available on https://github.com/BoYuanVisionary/BayesFlow.

TL;DR: The paper derives exact moment matching for propagating Gaussian distributions through deep neural networks with specific activation functions, showing significant improvements in accuracy over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in exact moment matching for Gaussian distributions through neural networks, especially for various activation functions.

Method: Layer-by-layer moment matching for propagating mean and covariance of Gaussian distributions through deep neural networks, including residual layers.

Result: Achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in KL divergence error metric and competitive statistical calibration on real data.

Conclusion: The method outperforms alternatives significantly, offering precise inference under epistemic uncertainty and improving variational Bayes networks.

Abstract: We study the problem of propagating the mean and covariance of a general multivariate Gaussian distribution through a deep (residual) neural network using layer-by-layer moment matching. We close a longstanding gap by deriving exact moment matching for the probit, GeLU, ReLU (as a limit of GeLU), Heaviside (as a limit of probit), and sine activation functions; for both feedforward and generalized residual layers. On random networks, we find orders-of-magnitude improvements in the KL divergence error metric, up to a millionfold, over popular alternatives. On real data, we find competitive statistical calibration for inference under epistemic uncertainty in the input. On a variational Bayes network, we show that our method attains hundredfold improvements in KL divergence from Monte Carlo ground truth over a state-of-the-art deterministic inference method. We also give an a priori error bound and a preliminary analysis of stochastic feedforward neurons, which have recently attracted general interest.

*Javier Carnerero-Cano,Luis Muñoz-González,Phillippa Spencer,Emil C. Lupu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the robustness of regression models to poisoning attacks, proposing a stealthy attack method that bypasses defenses and a new defense called BayesClean.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regression models are widely used but their vulnerability to poisoning attacks is understudied, especially under realistic threat models.

Method: The authors propose an optimal stealthy attack formulation and a methodology for evaluating effectiveness vs. detectability. They also develop BayesClean, a novel defense.

Result: The stealthy attack bypasses state-of-the-art defenses, and BayesClean outperforms previous defenses against stealthy attacks with significant poisoning.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for robust regression models and introduces effective tools for both attacking and defending them.

Abstract: Regression models are widely used in industrial processes, engineering and in natural and physical sciences, yet their robustness to poisoning has received less attention. When it has, studies often assume unrealistic threat models and are thus less useful in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel optimal stealthy attack formulation that considers different degrees of detectability and show that it bypasses state-of-the-art defenses. We further propose a new methodology based on normalization of objectives to evaluate different trade-offs between effectiveness and detectability. Finally, we develop a novel defense (BayesClean) against stealthy attacks. BayesClean improves on previous defenses when attacks are stealthy and the number of poisoning points is significant.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCALAR, a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination and reasoning in materials foundation models. It tests models on tasks ranging from CIF to property prediction and inverse retrieval, revealing inconsistent performance under structured distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding in how large language models behave under physically structured distribution shifts in materials science, particularly focusing on geometric scale generalization and structural reasoning.

Method: Develops SCALAR, a benchmark with three tasks: CIF to property prediction, Chain-of-Thought reasoning with physics grounding, and inverse retrieval. Evaluates models using structured metrics like numeric error, hallucination, consistency, and validity.

Result: Experiments show model-dependent performance shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error but sometimes destabilizing consistency or validity. Accuracy alone doesn't predict geometric scale generalization.

Conclusion: SCALAR highlights the need for comprehensive evaluation metrics beyond accuracy to assess geometric scale generalization and reasoning capabilities in materials foundation models.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to materials science reasoning, yet their behavior under physically structured distribution shifts remains poorly understood. We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity. These results demonstrate that geometric scale generalization cannot be inferred from accuracy alone. Supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/SCALAR.

*Yavuz Bakman,Duygu Nur Yaldiz,Salman Avestimehr,Sai Praneeth Karimireddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Static black-box evaluations of LLM alignment fail to guarantee post-update alignment due to overparameterization, highlighting the need for robust post-update evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the gap in current alignment research, which assumes initial model alignment based on static evaluations but overlooks potential misalignment after updates.

Method: The paper formalizes alignment in static and post-update settings, theoretically analyzing overparameterization and empirically validating findings in privacy, jailbreak safety, and behavioral honesty domains.

Result: Static alignment lacks post-update guarantees, and adversarial behavior can be hidden until triggered by benign updates, worsening with larger model scales.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the limitations of static evaluations and advocate for post-update robust alignment protocols.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rarely static and are frequently updated in practice. A growing body of alignment research has shown that models initially deemed "aligned" can exhibit misaligned behavior after fine-tuning, such as forgetting jailbreak safety features or re-surfacing knowledge that was intended to be forgotten. These works typically assume that the initial model is aligned based on static black-box evaluation, i.e., the absence of undesired responses to a fixed set of queries. In contrast, we formalize model alignment in both the static and post-update settings and uncover a fundamental limitation of black-box evaluation. We theoretically show that, due to overparameterization, static alignment provides no guarantee of post-update alignment for any update dataset. Moreover, we prove that static black-box probing cannot distinguish a model that is genuinely post-update robust from one that conceals an arbitrary amount of adversarial behavior which can be activated by even a single benign gradient update. We further validate these findings empirically in LLMs across three core alignment domains: privacy, jailbreak safety, and behavioral honesty. We demonstrate the existence of LLMs that pass all standard black-box alignment tests, yet become severely misaligned after a single benign update. Finally, we show that the capacity to hide such latent adversarial behavior increases with model scale, confirming our theoretical prediction that post-update misalignment grows with the number of parameters. Together, our results highlight the inadequacy of static evaluation protocols and emphasize the urgent need for post-update-robust alignment evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world optimization often involves costly ground-truth evaluations and cheaper predictions, alongside abundant offline data. PA-GP-UCB aims to leverage both oracles and data for efficiency.

Method: PA-GP-UCB uses a control-variates estimator from a joint Gaussian process posterior to correct biases and reduce uncertainty, improving sample efficiency for ground-truth queries.

Result: Theoretically, PA-GP-UCB maintains GP-UCB's regret rate with a smaller leading constant. Empirically, it converges faster than baselines on synthetic benchmarks and a human behavioral task.

Conclusion: PA-GP-UCB offers a sample-efficient framework for hypothesis generation under expensive feedback, leveraging predictions and offline data effectively.

Abstract: Many real-world optimization problems involve an expensive ground-truth oracle (e.g., human evaluation, physical experiments) and a cheap, low-fidelity prediction oracle (e.g., machine learning models, simulations). Meanwhile, abundant offline data (e.g., past experiments and predictions) are often available and can be used to pretrain powerful predictive models, as well as to provide an informative prior. We propose Prediction-Augmented Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (PA-GP-UCB), a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm that leverages both oracles and offline data to achieve provable gains in sample efficiency for the ground-truth oracle queries. PA-GP-UCB employs a control-variates estimator derived from a joint Gaussian process posterior to correct prediction bias and reduce uncertainty. We prove that PA-GP-UCB preserves the standard regret rate of GP-UCB while achieving a strictly smaller leading constant that is explicitly controlled by prediction quality and offline data coverage. Empirically, PA-GP-UCB converges faster than Vanilla GP-UCB and naive prediction-augmented GP-UCB baselines on synthetic benchmarks and on a real-world hypothesis evaluation task grounded in human behavioral data, where predictions are provided by large language models. These results establish PA-GP-UCB as a general and sample-efficient framework for hypothesis generation under expensive feedback.

TL;DR: FlowSymm introduces a novel architecture for recovering missing flows in networks while respecting local conservation laws, combining group actions, graph-attention encoders, and Tikhonov refinement, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the fundamental inverse problem of recovering missing flows in networks (e.g., transportation, energy) while strictly adhering to local conservation laws.

Method: FlowSymm uses (i) group actions on divergence-free flows, (ii) a graph-attention encoder for feature-conditioned weights, and (iii) Tikhonov refinement via bilevel optimization to solve the problem.

Result: FlowSymm achieves superior performance in RMSE, MAE, and correlation metrics across traffic, power, and bike flow benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively solves the inverse problem of flow recovery, leveraging symmetry-preserving actions and attention mechanisms to outperform state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Recovering missing flows on the edges of a network, while exactly respecting local conservation laws, is a fundamental inverse problem that arises in many systems such as transportation, energy, and mobility. We introduce FlowSymm, a novel architecture that combines (i) a group-action on divergence-free flows, (ii) a graph-attention encoder to learn feature-conditioned weights over these symmetry-preserving actions, and (iii) a lightweight Tikhonov refinement solved via implicit bilevel optimization. The method first anchors the given observation on a minimum-norm divergence-free completion. We then compute an orthonormal basis for all admissible group actions that leave the observed flows invariant and parameterize the valid solution subspace, which shows an Abelian group structure under vector addition. A stack of GATv2 layers then encodes the graph and its edge features into per-edge embeddings, which are pooled over the missing edges and produce per-basis attention weights. This attention-guided process selects a set of physics-aware group actions that preserve the observed flows. Finally, a scalar Tikhonov penalty refines the missing entries via a convex least-squares solver, with gradients propagated implicitly through Cholesky factorization. Across three real-world flow benchmarks (traffic, power, bike), FlowSymm outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE and correlation metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated framework introduced for routing LLM queries efficiently, balancing quality and cost without centralizing sensitive data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns and data fragmentation across clients while improving routing efficiency for LLMs.

Method: Proposes federated learning for LLM routing, supporting parametric (multilayer perceptron) and nonparametric (K-means) routers under heterogeneous conditions.

Result: Federated collaboration improves accuracy-cost balance over local routers, enhancing model coverage and query generalization.

Conclusion: Federated training effectively reduces routing suboptimality and addresses privacy and data fragmentation challenges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly accessed as remotely hosted services by edge and enterprise clients that cannot run frontier models locally. Since models vary widely in capability and price, routing queries to models that balance quality and inference cost is essential. Existing router approaches assume access to centralized query-model evaluation data. However, these data are often fragmented across clients, such as end users and organizations, and are privacy-sensitive, which makes centralizing data infeasible. Additionally, per-client router training is ineffective since local evaluation data is limited and covers only a restricted query distribution and a biased subset of model evaluations. We introduce the first federated framework for LLM routing, enabling clients to learn a shared routing policy from local offline query-model evaluation data. Our framework supports both parametric multilayer perceptron router and nonparametric K-means router under heterogeneous client query distributions and non-uniform model coverage. Across two benchmarks, federated collaboration improves the accuracy-cost frontier over client-local routers, both via increased effective model coverage and better query generalization. Our theoretical results also validate that federated training reduces routing suboptimality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for continual mean estimation under differential privacy rely on pure differential privacy, which results in noisy estimates. The study aims to improve accuracy by adopting approximate differential privacy and leveraging advancements in the Matrix Factorization mechanism.

Method: The authors introduce a novel mean estimation-specific factorization within the Matrix Factorization mechanism, optimizing for efficiency and accuracy in sequential data processing.

Result: The proposed method achieves asymptotically lower mean-squared error bounds compared to previous pure differential privacy approaches, enhancing accuracy in continual mean estimation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that approximate differential privacy, combined with a tailored factorization technique, significantly improves the performance of continual mean estimation under user-level privacy constraints.

Abstract: We study continual mean estimation, where data vectors arrive sequentially and the goal is to maintain accurate estimates of the running mean. We address this problem under user-level differential privacy, which protects each user's entire dataset even when they contribute multiple data points. Previous work on this problem has focused on pure differential privacy. While important, this approach limits applicability, as it leads to overly noisy estimates. In contrast, we analyze the problem under approximate differential privacy, adopting recent advances in the Matrix Factorization mechanism. We introduce a novel mean estimation specific factorization, which is both efficient and accurate, achieving asymptotically lower mean-squared error bounds in continual mean estimation under user-level differential privacy.

TL;DR: SAC-GT is a new framework combining Graph Transformer and Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Prediction for accurate and reliable indoor localization with uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based indoor localization models lack reliable uncertainty quantification, limiting real-world deployment.

Method: Integrates Graph Transformer for spatial topology and signal dynamics with Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Prediction for region-specific uncertainty.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and provides robust, spatially adaptive confidence regions.

Conclusion: SAC-GT offers precise localization with reliable uncertainty estimates, suitable for diverse smart environment applications.

Abstract: Indoor localization is a critical enabler for a wide range of location-based services in smart environments, including navigation, asset tracking, and safety-critical applications. Recent graph-based models leverage spatial relationships between Wire-less Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Access Points (APs) and devices, offering finer localization granularity, but fall short in quantifying prediction uncertainty, a key requirement for real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Graph Transformer (SAC-GT), a framework for accurate and reliable indoor localization. SAC-GT integrates a Graph Transformer (GT) model that captures network's spatial topology and signal strength dynamics, with a novel Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Prediction (SACP) method that provides region-specific uncertainty estimates. This allows SAC-GT to produce not only precise two-dimensional (2D) location predictions but also statistically valid confidence regions tailored to varying environmental conditions. Extensive evaluations on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed SAC-GT solution achieves state-of-the-art localization accuracy while delivering robust and spatially adaptive reliability guarantees.

*Qi Cao,Shuhao Zhang,Ruizhe Zhou,Ruiyi Zhang,Peijia Qin,Pengtao Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCOPE is a routing framework that dynamically predicts model cost and performance using reinforcement learning, enabling flexible adaptation to new models and budget constraints while optimizing accuracy-cost trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing routers are limited by fixed choices among small model sets, making them inflexible for new models or changing budget constraints.

Method: SCOPE uses reinforcement learning to predict model cost and performance by retrieving behavior on similar problems, avoiding reliance on fixed model names.

Result: SCOPE improves accuracy by up to 25.7% when prioritizing performance and reduces costs by up to 95.1% when efficiency is key.

Conclusion: SCOPE offers a scalable and controllable solution for model routing, adapting dynamically to user needs and budget constraints.

Abstract: Model routing chooses which language model to use for each query. By sending easy queries to cheaper models and hard queries to stronger ones, it can significantly reduce inference cost while maintaining high accuracy. However, most existing routers treat this as a fixed choice among a small set of models, which makes them hard to adapt to new models or changing budget constraints. In this paper, we propose SCOPE (Scalable and Controllable Outcome Performance Estimator), a routing framework that goes beyond model selection by predicting their cost and performance. Trained with reinforcement learning, SCOPE makes reasoning-based predictions by retrieving how models behave on similar problems, rather than relying on fixed model names, enabling it to work with new, unseen models. Moreover, by explicitly predicting how accurate and how expensive a model will be, it turns routing into a dynamic decision problem, allowing users to easily control the trade-off between accuracy and cost. Experiments show that SCOPE is more than just a cost-saving tool. It flexibly adapts to user needs: it can boost accuracy by up to 25.7% when performance is the priority, or cut costs by up to 95.1% when efficiency matters most.

*Lupo Marsigli,Angel Lopez de Haro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Stratified Importance Sampling (SIS) as a label-efficient framework for monitoring classification models in production, offering unbiased estimators with improved mean squared error over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring classification models in production is challenging due to limited labeling budgets, one-shot label acquisition, and low error rates. A practical, efficient solution is needed.

Method: The authors introduce Stratified Importance Sampling (SIS), a framework for model monitoring that combines stratification and importance sampling to improve estimator efficiency without relying on optimal proposal distributions or strata.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments show SIS provides unbiased estimators with finite-sample MSE improvements over importance sampling (IS) and stratified random sampling (SRS), even with imperfect proxies or stratification.

Conclusion: SIS is a principled, label-efficient, and lightweight methodology for post-deployment model monitoring, proven effective across binary and multiclass tasks.

Abstract: Monitoring the performance of classification models in production is critical yet challenging due to strict labeling budgets, one-shot batch acquisition of labels and extremely low error rates. We propose a general framework based on Stratified Importance Sampling (SIS) that directly addresses these constraints in model monitoring. While SIS has previously been applied in specialized domains, our theoretical analysis establishes its broad applicability to the monitoring of classification models. Under mild conditions, SIS yields unbiased estimators with strict finite-sample mean squared error (MSE) improvements over both importance sampling (IS) and stratified random sampling (SRS). The framework does not rely on optimally defined proposal distributions or strata: even with noisy proxies and sub-optimal stratification, SIS can improve estimator efficiency compared to IS or SRS individually, though extreme proposal mismatch may limit these gains. Experiments across binary and multiclass tasks demonstrate consistent efficiency improvements under fixed label budgets, underscoring SIS as a principled, label-efficient, and operationally lightweight methodology for post-deployment model monitoring.

TL;DR: MolField introduces a continuous function-space framework for molecular representation, treating molecules as fields in 3D space rather than discrete objects, improving generalization and stability across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing molecular representations treat molecules as discrete objects (sequences, graphs, or point clouds), ignoring their continuous, field-like physical nature. MolField aims to bridge this gap by modeling molecules as continuous functions in 3D space.

Method: MolField uses a hyper-network-based framework to learn distributions over molecular fields, ensuring physical consistency with SE(3) invariance. It introduces structured weight tokenization and trains a sequence-based hyper-network to model shared priors over these fields.

Result: MolField outperforms conventional approaches in molecular dynamics and property prediction, demonstrating improved generalization and stability regardless of discretization or query methods.

Conclusion: Treating molecules as continuous functions revolutionizes molecular representations, yielding stable and generalizable models invariant to discretization methods.

Abstract: Molecular representations fundamentally shape how machine learning systems reason about molecular structure and physical properties. Most existing approaches adopt a discrete pipeline: molecules are encoded as sequences, graphs, or point clouds, mapped to fixed-dimensional embeddings, and then used for task-specific prediction. This paradigm treats molecules as discrete objects, despite their intrinsically continuous and field-like physical nature. We argue that molecular learning can instead be formulated as learning in function space. Specifically, we model each molecule as a continuous function over three-dimensional (3D) space and treat this molecular field as the primary object of representation. From this perspective, conventional molecular representations arise as particular sampling schemes of an underlying continuous object. We instantiate this formulation with MolField, a hyper-network-based framework that learns distributions over molecular fields. To ensure physical consistency, these functions are defined over canonicalized coordinates, yielding invariance to global SE(3) transformations. To enable learning directly over functions, we introduce a structured weight tokenization and train a sequence-based hyper-network to model a shared prior over molecular fields. We evaluate MolField on molecular dynamics and property prediction. Our results show that treating molecules as continuous functions fundamentally changes how molecular representations generalize across tasks and yields downstream behavior that is stable to how molecules are discretized or queried.

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recovering governing equations from data is central to scientific discovery, yet existing methods often break down under noisy, partial observations, or rely on black-box latent dynamics that obscure mechanism. We introduce MAAT (Model Aware Approximation of Trajectories), a framework for symbolic discovery built on knowledge-informed Kernel State Reconstruction. MAAT formulates state reconstruction in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and directly incorporates structural and semantic priors such as non-negativity, conservation laws, and domain-specific observation models into the reconstruction objective, while accommodating heterogeneous sampling and measurement granularity. This yields smooth, physically consistent state estimates with analytic time derivatives, providing a principled interface between fragmented sensor data and symbolic regression. Across twelve diverse scientific benchmarks and multiple noise regimes, MAAT substantially reduces state-estimation MSE for trajectories and derivatives used by downstream symbolic regression relative to strong baselines.

TL;DR: BALANS is a scalable batch-correction method for Cell Painting data that uses local affinities and adaptive subsampling to align samples across batches efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batch effects in large-scale Cell Painting data obscure biological signals, necessitating scalable and efficient correction methods.

Method: BALANS constructs a sparse affinity matrix using batch-aware local scales and adaptive sampling, ensuring efficiency and scalability.

Result: BALANS improves runtime over existing methods without compromising correction quality, as shown in experiments.

Conclusion: BALANS is a promising solution for large-scale batch correction in Cell Painting data, balancing efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Cell Painting is a microscopy-based, high-content imaging assay that produces rich morphological profiles of cells and can support drug discovery by quantifying cellular responses to chemical perturbations. At scale, however, Cell Painting data is strongly affected by batch effects arising from differences in laboratories, instruments, and protocols, which can obscure biological signal. We present BALANS (Batch Alignment via Local Affinities and Subsampling), a scalable batch-correction method that aligns samples across batches by constructing a smoothed affinity matrix from pairwise distances. Given $n$ data points, BALANS builds a sparse affinity matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ using two ideas. (i) For points $i$ and $j$, it sets a local scale using the distance from $i$ to its $k$-th nearest neighbor within the batch of $j$, then computes $A_{ij}$ via a Gaussian kernel calibrated by these batch-aware local scales. (ii) Rather than forming all $n^2$ entries, BALANS uses an adaptive sampling procedure that prioritizes rows with low cumulative neighbor coverage and retains only the strongest affinities per row, yielding a sparse but informative approximation of $A$. We prove that this sampling strategy is order-optimal in sample complexity and provides an approximation guarantee, and we show that BALANS runs in nearly linear time in $n$. Experiments on diverse real-world Cell Painting datasets and controlled large-scale synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BALANS scales to large collections while improving runtime over native implementations of widely used batch-correction methods, without sacrificing correction quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new noise correlation strategy for DP-SGD reduces memory overhead while improving accuracy by regenerating noise pseudorandomly and canceling portions of it iteratively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the memory overhead and accuracy limitations of existing DP-SGD extensions like matrix factorization mechanisms, which require storing past noise vectors.

Method: Correlate noise only with the immediately preceding iteration, cancel a controlled portion, and regenerate noise pseudorandomly to avoid storage.

Result: Minimal computational overhead, no additional memory requirements, and improved accuracy over standard DP-SGD.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a practical and efficient alternative to existing DP-SGD extensions, balancing privacy, accuracy, and resource usage.

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the gold standard for training machine learning models with formal differential privacy guarantees. Several recent extensions improve its accuracy by introducing correlated noise across training iterations. Matrix factorization mechanisms are a prominent example, but they correlate noise across many iterations and require storing previously added noise vectors, leading to substantial memory overhead in some settings. In this work, we propose a new noise correlation strategy that correlates noise only with the immediately preceding iteration and cancels a controlled portion of it. Our method relies on noise regeneration using a pseudorandom noise generator, eliminating the need to store past noise. As a result, it requires no additional memory beyond standard DP-SGD. We show that the computational overhead is minimal and empirically demonstrate improved accuracy over DP-SGD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the knowledge gradient acquisition function to preferential BO, addressing computational challenges in non-Gaussian posteriors.

Method: Derivation of an exact and analytical knowledge gradient tailored for preferential BO.

Result: The method performs strongly on benchmark problems and surpasses existing acquisition functions.

Conclusion: The exact knowledge gradient is effective but has limitations in certain scenarios, as shown in a case study.

Abstract: The knowledge gradient is a popular acquisition function in Bayesian optimization (BO) for optimizing black-box objectives with noisy function evaluations. Many practical settings, however, allow only pairwise comparison queries, yielding a preferential BO problem where direct function evaluations are unavailable. Extending the knowledge gradient to preferential BO is hindered by its computational challenge. At its core, the look-ahead step in the preferential setting requires computing a non-Gaussian posterior, which was previously considered intractable. In this paper, we address this challenge by deriving an exact and analytical knowledge gradient for preferential BO. We show that the exact knowledge gradient performs strongly on a suite of benchmark problems, often outperforming existing acquisition functions. In addition, we also present a case study illustrating the limitation of the knowledge gradient in certain scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework for AIoT-enabled supply chains, addressing sustainability and security challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern supply chains require balancing logistics speed with environmental impact and security, but conventional models often neglect sustainability and cyber vulnerabilities.

Method: Integrates a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework unifying carbon reduction, inventory management, and security measures, using real-time AIoT signals and multi-objective rewards.

Result: Simulations show smooth convergence, strong late-episode performance, and robustness under noise, outperforming standard models.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for secure, eco-conscious supply chain operations, supporting globally connected infrastructures.

Abstract: Modern supply chains must balance high-speed logistics with environmental impact and security constraints, prompting a surge of interest in AI-enabled Internet of Things (AIoT) solutions for global commerce. However, conventional supply chain optimization models often overlook crucial sustainability goals and cyber vulnerabilities, leaving systems susceptible to both ecological harm and malicious attacks. To tackle these challenges simultaneously, this work integrates a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that unifies carbon footprint reduction, inventory management, and cryptographic-like security measures. We design a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that couples a controllable spin-chain analogy with real-time AIoT signals and optimizes a multi-objective reward unifying fidelity, security, and carbon costs. The approach learns robust policies with stabilized training via value-based and ensemble updates, supported by window-normalized reward components to ensure commensurate scaling. In simulation, the method exhibits smooth convergence, strong late-episode performance, and graceful degradation under representative noise channels, outperforming standard learned and model-based references, highlighting its robust handling of real-time sustainability and risk demands. These findings reinforce the potential for quantum-inspired AIoT frameworks to drive secure, eco-conscious supply chain operations at scale, laying the groundwork for globally connected infrastructures that responsibly meet both consumer and environmental needs.

TL;DR: Language models struggle with exploration in interactive tasks, performing worse than simple baselines, but parallel executions and history summarizations can improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess language models' ability to explore interactive environments efficiently under constrained interaction budgets.

Method: Introduce three parametric tasks with adjustable difficulty, test state-of-the-art models, and evaluate lightweight interventions like parallel executions and history summarizations.

Result: Models exhibit systematic under-exploration and weak scaling with budget increases, but interventions improve exploration performance.

Conclusion: Lightweight strategies like parallel executions and summarizations can enhance model exploration despite theoretical limitations.

Abstract: We evaluate language models on their ability to explore interactive environments under a limited interaction budget. We introduce three parametric tasks with controllable exploration difficulty, spanning continuous and discrete environments. Across state-of-the-art models, we find systematic under-exploration and suboptimal solutions, with performance often significantly worse than simple explore--exploit heuristic baselines and scaling weakly as the budget increases. Finally, we study two lightweight interventions: splitting a fixed budget into parallel executions, which surprisingly improves performance despite a no-gain theoretical result for our tasks, and periodically summarizing the interaction history, which preserves key discoveries and further improves exploration.

TL;DR: MixQuant introduces block rotation-aware PTQ with greedy mass diffusion to redistribute activation mass, improving accuracy across block sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze and improve outlier suppression in block Hadamard rotations used in PTQ methods.

Method: MixQuant redistributes activation mass via permutations prior to rotation, using a greedy mass diffusion algorithm to equalize blockwise ℓ₁ norms.

Result: MixQuant recovers up to 90% of full-vector rotation perplexity in quantizing Llama3 1B to INT4 with block size 16, compared to 46% without permutations.

Conclusion: Block rotation-aware PTQ with mass redistribution via permutations significantly improves quantization accuracy, especially for smaller block sizes.

Abstract: Recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods have adopted block rotations to diffuse outliers prior to rounding. While this reduces the overhead of full-vector rotations, the effect of block structure on outlier suppression remains poorly understood. To fill this gap, we present the first systematic, non-asymptotic analysis of outlier suppression for block Hadamard rotations. Our analysis reveals that outlier suppression is fundamentally limited by the geometry of the input vector. In particular, post-rotation outliers are deterministically minimized when the pre-rotation $\ell_1$ norm mass is evenly distributed across blocks. Guided by these insights, we introduce MixQuant, a block rotation-aware PTQ framework that redistributes activation mass via permutations prior to rotation. We propose a greedy mass diffusion algorithm to calibrate permutations by equalizing the expected blockwise $\ell_1$ norms. To avoid adding inference overhead, we identify permutation-equivariant regions in transformer architectures to merge the resulting permutations into model weights before deployment. Experiments show that MixQuant consistently improves accuracy across all block sizes, recovering up to 90% of the full-vector rotation perplexity when quantizing Llama3 1B to INT4 with block size 16, compared to 46% without permutations.

*Beiming Li,Sergio Rozada,Alejandro Ribeiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes learning representations for policies in Markov decision processes (MDPs) using set-based architectures and variational generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to facilitate behavior steering at test time by learning representations for a range of policies.

Method: Policy representations are modeled as expectations of state-action feature maps. A set-based architecture approximates these representations uniformly. The method uses variational generative modeling and contrastive learning.

Result: The approach induces a smooth latent space where latent distances reflect differences in value functions, enabling gradient-based optimization.

Conclusion: The framework allows solving novel behavior synthesis tasks by steering policies to meet unseen value function constraints without retraining.

Abstract: Given a Markov decision process (MDP), we seek to learn representations for a range of policies to facilitate behavior steering at test time. As policies of an MDP are uniquely determined by their occupancy measures, we propose modeling policy representations as expectations of state-action feature maps with respect to occupancy measures. We show that these representations can be approximated uniformly for a range of policies using a set-based architecture. Our model encodes a set of state-action samples into a latent embedding, from which we decode both the policy and its value functions corresponding to multiple rewards. We use variational generative approach to induce a smooth latent space, and further shape it with contrastive learning so that latent distances align with differences in value functions. This geometry permits gradient-based optimization directly in the latent space. Leveraging this capability, we solve a novel behavior synthesis task, where policies are steered to satisfy previously unseen value function constraints without additional training.

*Sri Vatsa Vuddanti,Satwik Kumar Chittiprolu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Language model agents exhibit measurable recoverability from tool failures, formalized as Expected Recovery Regret (ERR) and Efficiency Score (ES), validated across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to provide a formal explanation for the observed recoverability of language model agents after tool execution failures, addressing the lack of theoretical understanding.

Method: Recoverability is formalized using Expected Recovery Regret (ERR) to quantify deviation from optimal recovery policies under noise. A first-order relationship between ERR and Efficiency Score (ES) is derived and empirically tested across five benchmarks.

Result: Empirical validation shows close alignment between predicted regret (ERR-ES law) and observed post-failure regret (delta ≤ 0.05), confirming recoverability as a governed property, independent of model scale or architecture.

Conclusion: Recoverability in language agents is a quantifiable and governed interaction dynamic, offering a theoretical basis for execution-level robustness.

Abstract: Language model agents often appear capable of self-recovery after failing tool call executions, yet this behavior lacks a formal explanation. We present a predictive theory that resolves this gap by showing that recoverability follows a measurable law. To elaborate, we formalize recoverability through Expected Recovery Regret (ERR), which quantifies the deviation of a recovery policy from the optimal one under stochastic execution noise, and derive a first-order relationship between ERR and an empirical observable quantity, the Efficiency Score (ES). This yields a falsifiable first-order quantitative law of recovery dynamics in tool-using agents. We empirically validate the law across five tool-use benchmarks spanning controlled perturbations, diagnostic reasoning, and real-world APIs. Across model scales, perturbation regimes, and recovery horizons, predicted regret under the ERR-ES law closely matched observed post-failure regret measured from Monte Carlo rollouts, within delta less than or equal to 0.05. Our results reveal that recoverability is not an artifact of model scale or architecture, but a governed property of interaction dynamics, providing a theoretical foundation for execution-level robustness in language agents.

TL;DR: The paper introduces geometric measures (relative Wasserstein angle and orthogonal projection distance) to quantify non-Gaussianity using optimal transport. It shows that moment-matching Gaussians are not optimal under Wasserstein distance and provides closed-form solutions in one dimension and an efficient algorithm for high dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a rigorous framework for quantifying how far an empirical distribution deviates from Gaussianity using optimal transport, addressing limitations of traditional methods like moment matching.

Method: Leverages the cone geometry of the Wasserstein space to define novel geometric quantities (relative Wasserstein angle and projection distance). Derives closed-form solutions for one-dimensional cases and develops a stochastic manifold optimization algorithm for high dimensions.

Result: The proposed measures are more robust than Wasserstein distance, and the nearest Gaussian approximation outperforms moment matching in Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) evaluations.

Conclusion: The geometric approach provides a meaningful and efficient way to measure non-Gaussianity, with practical advantages over existing methods in both low and high dimensions.

Abstract: We study the problem of quantifying how far an empirical distribution deviates from Gaussianity under the framework of optimal transport. By exploiting the cone geometry of the relative translation invariant quadratic Wasserstein space, we introduce two novel geometric quantities, the relative Wasserstein angle and the orthogonal projection distance, which provide meaningful measures of non-Gaussianity. We prove that the filling cone generated by any two rays in this space is flat, ensuring that angles, projections, and inner products are rigorously well-defined. This geometric viewpoint recasts Gaussian approximation as a projection problem onto the Gaussian cone and reveals that the commonly used moment-matching Gaussian can \emph{not} be the \(W_2\)-nearest Gaussian for a given empirical distribution. In one dimension, we derive closed-form expressions for the proposed quantities and extend them to several classical distribution families, including uniform, Laplace, and logistic distributions; while in high dimensions, we develop an efficient stochastic manifold optimization algorithm based on a semi-discrete dual formulation. Experiments on synthetic data and real-world feature distributions demonstrate that the relative Wasserstein angle is more robust than the Wasserstein distance and that the proposed nearest Gaussian provides a better approximation than moment matching in the evaluation of Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores.

TL;DR: PoSafeNet introduces a neural safety layer enforcing poset-structured safety constraints for adaptive and robust learning-based control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety constraint methods are rigid and can cause infeasibility; PoSafeNet addresses heterogeneous and incomparable safety requirements.

Method: Models safety constraints as a partially ordered set (poset) and uses PoSafeNet, a differentiable neural safety layer, for sequential closed-form projection.

Result: Demonstrates improved feasibility, robustness, and scalability in multi-obstacle navigation, robot manipulation, and autonomous driving.

Conclusion: PoSafeNet effectively handles complex safety constraints, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Safe learning is essential for deploying learningbased controllers in safety-critical robotic systems, yet existing approaches often enforce multiple safety constraints uniformly or via fixed priority orders, leading to infeasibility and brittle behavior. In practice, safety requirements are heterogeneous and admit only partial priority relations, where some constraints are comparable while others are inherently incomparable. We formalize this setting as poset-structured safety, modeling safety constraints as a partially ordered set and treating safety composition as a structural property of the policy class. Building on this formulation, we propose PoSafeNet, a differentiable neural safety layer that enforces safety via sequential closed-form projection under poset-consistent constraint orderings, enabling adaptive selection or mixing of valid safety executions while preserving priority semantics by construction. Experiments on multi-obstacle navigation, constrained robot manipulation, and vision-based autonomous driving demonstrate improved feasibility, robustness, and scalability over unstructured and differentiable quadratic program-based safety layers.

Motivation: The study aims to measure the energy footprint of seemingly harmless polite messages in LLM interactions, using politeness as a proxy for broader sustainability concerns in AI deployments.

Method: Using real-world conversation traces and fine-grained energy measurements, the paper examines how input length, output length, and model size impact energy consumption.

Result: The findings quantify the energy cost of polite phrases and provide actionable insights for designing more efficient and sustainable LLM applications.

Conclusion: As LLM usage grows, understanding and mitigating energy costs is essential for sustainable AI deployment, especially in high-frequency applications like chat.

Abstract: Being polite is free - or is it? In this paper, we quantify the energy cost of seemingly innocuous messages such as ``thank you'' when interacting with large language models, often used by users to convey politeness. Using real-world conversation traces and fine-grained energy measurements, we quantify how input length, output length and model size affect energy use. While politeness is our motivating example, it also serves as a controlled and reproducible proxy for measuring the energy footprint of a typical LLM interaction. Our findings provide actionable insights for building more sustainable and efficient LLM applications, especially in increasingly widespread real-world contexts like chat. As user adoption grows and billions of prompts are processed daily, understanding and mitigating this cost becomes crucial - not just for efficiency, but for sustainable AI deployment.

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy risks in machine unlearning caused by residual knowledge in adversarial settings, proposing a fine-tuning strategy (RURK) to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning methods lack guarantees for adversarial inputs, allowing residual knowledge of forget samples to persist.

Method: Proposes RURK, a fine-tuning strategy penalizing re-recognition of perturbed forget samples.

Result: Experiments show residual knowledge is common in unlearning methods; RURK effectively reduces it.

Conclusion: Residual knowledge is inevitable in high dimensions, but RURK successfully mitigates this privacy risk.

Abstract: Machine unlearning offers a practical alternative to avoid full model re-training by approximately removing the influence of specific user data. While existing methods certify unlearning via statistical indistinguishability from re-trained models, these guarantees do not naturally extend to model outputs when inputs are adversarially perturbed. In particular, slight perturbations of forget samples may still be correctly recognized by the unlearned model - even when a re-trained model fails to do so - revealing a novel privacy risk: information about the forget samples may persist in their local neighborhood. In this work, we formalize this vulnerability as residual knowledge and show that it is inevitable in high-dimensional settings. To mitigate this risk, we propose a fine-tuning strategy, named RURK, that penalizes the model's ability to re-recognize perturbed forget samples. Experiments on vision benchmarks with deep neural networks demonstrate that residual knowledge is prevalent across existing unlearning methods and that our approach effectively prevents residual knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing energy demands of LLM inference by exploring how system-level optimizations can reduce energy costs without compromising performance.

Method: Empirical study on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, examining effects of quantization, batch size, and serving configurations (e.g., Hugging Face's server) on energy and latency.

Result: Lower precision saves energy in compute-bound cases; batching improves efficiency, especially in decoding; structured timing cuts per-request energy by up to 100x.

Conclusion: Sustainable LLM deployment requires system-level orchestration, not just model internals, motivating phase-aware profiling and optimizations for greener AI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in production, contributing towards shifting the burden in terms of computational resources and energy demands from training to inference. While prior work has examined the energy cost of inference per prompt or per token, we highlight how \emph{system-level design choices} - such as numerical precision, batching strategy, and request scheduling - can lead to orders-of-magnitude differences in energy consumption for the same model. We perform a detailed empirical study of LLM inference energy and latency on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, analyzing the impact of quantization, batch size, and serving configuration (e.g., with Hugging Face's Text Generation Inference server). Our results reveal that lower-precision formats only yield energy gains in compute-bound regimes; that batching improves energy efficiency, especially in memory-bound phases like decoding; and that structured request timing (arrival shaping) can reduce per-request energy by up to 100 times. We argue that sustainable LLM deployment depends not only on model internals, but also on the orchestration of the serving stack. Our findings motivate phase-aware energy profiling and system-level optimizations for greener AI services.

TL;DR: FIRE is a training-free multi-fidelity framework that outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency, but has some limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-fidelity regression often faces data imbalance issues, leading to inefficiency and poor generalization with traditional Gaussian-process surrogates.

Method: FIRE uses tabular foundation models for zero-shot Bayesian inference, correcting high-fidelity predictions with low-fidelity model outputs.

Result: FIRE outperforms 7 other methods in 31 benchmarks, excelling in accuracy and uncertainty quantification with faster runtime.

Conclusion: FIRE offers a robust and efficient alternative to traditional multi-fidelity methods, though its effectiveness depends on pre-trained model quality and context constraints.

Abstract: Multi-fidelity (MF) regression often operates in regimes of extreme data imbalance, where the commonly-used Gaussian-process (GP) surrogates struggle with cubic scaling costs and overfit to sparse high-fidelity observations, limiting efficiency and generalization in real-world applications. We introduce FIRE, a training-free MF framework that couples tabular foundation models (TFMs) to perform zero-shot in-context Bayesian inference via a high-fidelity correction model conditioned on the low-fidelity model's posterior predictive distributions. This cross-fidelity information transfer via distributional summaries captures heteroscedastic errors, enabling robust residual learning without model retraining. Across 31 benchmark problems spanning synthetic and real-world tasks (e.g., DrivAerNet, LCBench), FIRE delivers a stronger performance-time trade-off than seven state-of-the-art GP-based or deep learning MF regression methods, ranking highest in accuracy and uncertainty quantification with runtime advantages. Limitations include context window constraints and dependence on the quality of the pre-trained TFM's.

TL;DR: PABLO is a novel agentic system using LLMs for biological black-box optimization, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current methods in biological design by leveraging LLMs for a fully language-based reasoning approach.

Method: Introduces PABLO, a hierarchical agentic system that uses LLMs pretrained on scientific literature to iteratively refine biological candidates.

Result: PABLO achieves state-of-the-art performance on molecular design and antimicrobial peptide optimization, with strong in vitro validation.

Conclusion: PABLO's agentic framework offers practical advantages and high performance in biological design, demonstrating its potential for therapeutic discovery.

Abstract: Many key challenges in biological design-such as small-molecule drug discovery, antimicrobial peptide development, and protein engineering-can be framed as black-box optimization over vast, complex structured spaces. Existing methods rely mainly on raw structural data and struggle to exploit the rich scientific literature. While large language models (LLMs) have been added to these pipelines, they have been confined to narrow roles within structure-centered optimizers. We instead cast biological black-box optimization as a fully agentic, language-based reasoning process. We introduce Purely Agentic BLack-box Optimization (PABLO), a hierarchical agentic system that uses scientific LLMs pretrained on chemistry and biology literature to generate and iteratively refine biological candidates. On both the standard GuacaMol molecular design and antimicrobial peptide optimization tasks, PABLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially improving sample efficiency and final objective values over established baselines. Compared to prior optimization methods that incorporate LLMs, PABLO achieves competitive token usage per run despite relying on LLMs throughout the optimization loop. Beyond raw performance, the agentic formulation offers key advantages for realistic design: it naturally incorporates semantic task descriptions, retrieval-augmented domain knowledge, and complex constraints. In follow-up in vitro validation, PABLO-optimized peptides showed strong activity against drug-resistant pathogens, underscoring the practical potential of PABLO for therapeutic discovery.

### [240] [Graph is a Substrate Across Data Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22384)
*Ziming Li,Xiaoming Wu,Zehong Wang,Jiazheng Li,Yijun Tian,Jinhe Bi,Yunpu Ma,Yanfang Ye,Chuxu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces G-Substrate, a framework for persistent graph representation learning across diverse tasks and modalities, outperforming isolated and naive multi-task methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph representations are isolated by task and modality, leading to redundant reconstruction rather than accumulation of structural knowledge.

Method: Proposes G-Substrate with a unified structural schema and interleaved role-based training to share graph structures across tasks and modalities.

Result: G-Substrate outperforms task-isolated and naive multi-task learning methods in various domains, modalities, and tasks.

Conclusion: Persistent graph structures, organized via G-Substrate, improve representation learning across heterogeneous contexts.

Abstract: Graphs provide a natural representation of relational structure that arises across diverse domains. Despite this ubiquity, graph structure is typically learned in a modality- and task-isolated manner, where graph representations are constructed within individual task contexts and discarded thereafter. As a result, structural regularities across modalities and tasks are repeatedly reconstructed rather than accumulated at the level of intermediate graph representations. This motivates a representation-learning question: how should graph structure be organized so that it can persist and accumulate across heterogeneous modalities and tasks? We adopt a representation-centric perspective in which graph structure is treated as a structural substrate that persists across learning contexts. To instantiate this perspective, we propose G-Substrate, a graph substrate framework that organizes learning around shared graph structures. G-Substrate comprises two complementary mechanisms: a unified structural schema that ensures compatibility among graph representations across heterogeneous modalities and tasks, and an interleaved role-based training strategy that exposes the same graph structure to multiple functional roles during learning. Experiments across multiple domains, modalities, and tasks show that G-Substrate outperforms task-isolated and naive multi-task learning methods.

*Jianchang Su,Yifan Zhang,Shengkai Lin,Shizhen Zhao,Yusheng Zheng,Yiwei Yang,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAIR is an autoscaling framework using an LLM for reinforcement learning to manage multi-stage ML inference pipelines efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoscaling multi-stage ML inference pipelines is challenging due to heterogeneous resources, cross-stage coupling, and dynamic bottlenecks.

Method: SAIR employs an LLM as an in-context reinforcement learning controller, features Pareto-dominance reward shaping, surprisal-guided experience retrieval, and fine-grained GPU rate control.

Result: SAIR improves P99 latency by up to 50% and reduces effective cost by up to 97%, achieving high bottleneck detection accuracy without offline training.

Conclusion: SAIR demonstrates superior performance in latency and cost-effectiveness for ML serving pipelines under dynamic workloads.

Abstract: Multi-stage ML inference pipelines are difficult to autoscale due to heterogeneous resources, cross-stage coupling, and dynamic bottleneck migration. We present SAIR, an autoscaling framework that uses an LLM as an in-context reinforcement learning controller, improving its policy online from reward-labeled interaction histories without gradient updates. SAIR combines Pareto-dominance reward shaping with a provable separation margin, surprisal-guided experience retrieval for context efficiency, and fine-grained GPU rate control via user-space CUDA interception. We provide regret analysis decomposing error into retrieval coverage and LLM selection components. On four ML serving pipelines under three workload patterns, SAIR achieves the best or tied-best P99 latency and effective resource cost among deployed baselines, improving P99 by up to 50% and reducing effective cost by up to 97% (under GPU rate-control assumptions), with 86% bottleneck detection accuracy and no offline training.

### [242] [Score-based Integrated Gradient for Root Cause Explanations of Outliers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22399)
*Phuoc Nguyen,Truyen Tran,Sunil Gupta,Svetha Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIREN is a scalable method for identifying root causes of outliers by estimating data likelihood score functions, outperforming traditional approaches in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of identifying root causes of outliers under uncertainty and high-dimensional dependencies, where traditional methods fall short.

Method: SIREN uses score function estimation and integrated gradients to attribute root causes, satisfying key Shapley value axioms and operating directly on nonlinear models.

Result: SIREN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in attribution accuracy and computational efficiency on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SIREN provides a tractable and uncertainty-aware solution for root cause attribution in complex, high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Identifying the root causes of outliers is a fundamental problem in causal inference and anomaly detection. Traditional approaches based on heuristics or counterfactual reasoning often struggle under uncertainty and high-dimensional dependencies. We introduce SIREN, a novel and scalable method that attributes the root causes of outliers by estimating the score functions of the data likelihood. Attribution is computed via integrated gradients that accumulate score contributions along paths from the outlier toward the normal data distribution. Our method satisfies three of the four classic Shapley value axioms - dummy, efficiency, and linearity - as well as an asymmetry axiom derived from the underlying causal structure. Unlike prior work, SIREN operates directly on the score function, enabling tractable and uncertainty-aware root cause attribution in nonlinear, high-dimensional, and heteroscedastic causal models. Extensive experiments on synthetic random graphs and real-world cloud service and supply chain datasets show that SIREN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both attribution accuracy and computational efficiency.

*Puyu Wang,Junyu Zhou,Philipp Liznerski,Marius Kloft*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes gradient descent training for two-layer KANs, providing bounds on dynamics, generalization, and privacy. It shows polylogarithmic width suffices for optimization and generalization, and reveals a gap between private and non-private training regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a principled theory for training dynamics, generalization, and privacy properties of Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), which lack such analysis despite being structured alternatives to MLPs.

Method: The study focuses on gradient descent (GD) for two-layer KANs, specializing the analysis to logistic loss under an NTK-separable assumption. It derives bounds for optimization, generalization, and differential privacy (DP).

Result: Polylogarithmic network width suffices for GD to achieve optimization and generalization rates. Under DP, the analysis reveals a necessity for polylogarithmic width, contrasting non-private regimes. Experimental results support practical guidance.

Conclusion: The paper bridges theoretical gaps in KAN training, highlighting differences between private and non-private regimes and offering actionable insights for practical applications like width selection and early stopping.

Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a structured alternative to standard MLPs, yet a principled theory for their training dynamics, generalization, and privacy properties remains limited. In this paper, we analyze gradient descent (GD) for training two-layer KANs and derive general bounds that characterize their training dynamics, generalization, and utility under differential privacy (DP). As a concrete instantiation, we specialize our analysis to logistic loss under an NTK-separable assumption, where we show that polylogarithmic network width suffices for GD to achieve an optimization rate of order $1/T$ and a generalization rate of order $1/n$, with $T$ denoting the number of GD iterations and $n$ the sample size. In the private setting, we characterize the noise required for $(ε,δ)$-DP and obtain a utility bound of order $\sqrt{d}/(nε)$ (with $d$ the input dimension), matching the classical lower bound for general convex Lipschitz problems. Our results imply that polylogarithmic width is not only sufficient but also necessary under differential privacy, revealing a qualitative gap between non-private (sufficiency only) and private (necessity also emerges) training regimes. Experiments further illustrate how these theoretical insights can guide practical choices, including network width selection and early stopping.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MM-OpenFGL is the first benchmark for multimodal federated graph learning (MMFGL), addressing gaps in existing research by providing diverse datasets, simulation strategies, and evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated graph learning (FGL) studies largely ignore multimodal graphs, despite their prevalence in real-world distributed scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces MM-OpenFGL, a benchmark with 19 multimodal datasets, 8 simulation strategies, 6 tasks, and 57 methods.

Result: Extensive experiments evaluate MMFGL's necessity, effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency, providing insights.

Conclusion: MM-OpenFGL fills a critical gap in MMFGL research, offering a foundation for future studies.

Abstract: Multimodal-attributed graphs (MMAGs) provide a unified framework for modeling complex relational data by integrating heterogeneous modalities with graph structures. While centralized learning has shown promising performance, MMAGs in real-world applications are often distributed across isolated platforms and cannot be shared due to privacy concerns or commercial constraints. Federated graph learning (FGL) offers a natural solution for collaborative training under such settings; however, existing studies largely focus on single-modality graphs and do not adequately address the challenges unique to multimodal federated graph learning (MMFGL). To bridge this gap, we present MM-OpenFGL, the first comprehensive benchmark that systematically formalizes the MMFGL paradigm and enables rigorous evaluation. MM-OpenFGL comprises 19 multimodal datasets spanning 7 application domains, 8 simulation strategies capturing modality and topology variations, 6 downstream tasks, and 57 state-of-the-art methods implemented through a modular API. Extensive experiments investigate MMFGL from the perspectives of necessity, effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency, offering valuable insights for future research on MMFGL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaLead is a human-annotated dataset for ML leaderboards, capturing all experimental results with extra metadata for transparent and nuanced evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional leaderboards require manual effort and lack comprehensive data, limiting transparency and comparison.

Method: MetaLead is fully human-annotated, includes all experimental results, and adds metadata like experimental types and dataset separation.

Result: The dataset enables transparent and detailed evaluations, supporting cross-domain assessments and experiment-type comparisons.

Conclusion: MetaLead enhances ML leaderboard utility by providing richer, more transparent data for research evaluations.

Abstract: Leaderboards are crucial in the machine learning (ML) domain for benchmarking and tracking progress. However, creating leaderboards traditionally demands significant manual effort. In recent years, efforts have been made to automate leaderboard generation, but existing datasets for this purpose are limited by capturing only the best results from each paper and limited metadata. We present MetaLead, a fully human-annotated ML Leaderboard dataset that captures all experimental results for result transparency and contains extra metadata, such as the result experimental type: baseline, proposed method, or variation of proposed method for experiment-type guided comparisons, and explicitly separates train and test dataset for cross-domain assessment. This enriched structure makes MetaLead a powerful resource for more transparent and nuanced evaluations across ML research.

TL;DR: CoDCL is a dynamic network learning framework using counterfactual data augmentation and contrastive learning to improve prediction models' robustness to structural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic networks evolve rapidly, making predictions challenging. Models must adapt to structural changes effectively.

Method: CoDCL combines counterfactual data augmentation and contrastive learning, featuring dynamic treatments design and neighborhood exploration for quality data generation.

Result: CoDCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on real-world datasets, proving its effectiveness in dynamic networks.

Conclusion: Integrating counterfactual data augmentation enhances dynamic representation learning, making CoDCL a versatile, plug-and-play solution.

Abstract: The rapid growth and continuous structural evolution of dynamic networks make effective predictions increasingly challenging. To enable prediction models to adapt to complex temporal environments, they need to be robust to emerging structural changes. We propose a dynamic network learning framework CoDCL, which combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to address this deficiency.Furthermore, we devise a comprehensive strategy to generate high-quality counterfactual data, combining a dynamic treatments design with efficient structural neighborhood exploration to quantify the temporal changes in interaction patterns.Crucially, the entire CoDCL is designed as a plug-and-play universal module that can be seamlessly integrated into various existing temporal graph models without requiring architectural modifications.Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that CoDCL significantly gains state-of-the-art baseline models in the field of dynamic networks, confirming the critical role of integrating counterfactual data augmentation into dynamic representation learning.

*Wenzheng Zhang,Karl Stratos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO enhances pretrained LLMs' reasoning by estimating outcome advantages and refining them. The paper proposes an explicit contrastive learning method, splitting outcomes into positive and negative sets for optimization, achieving competitive results on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the refinements required in GRPO and improve LLM reasoning capabilities through contrastive learning.

Method: Proposes explicit contrastive learning by bifurcating outcomes into positive and negative sets, maximizing the likelihood of positive outcomes.

Result: Competitive performance on challenging math benchmarks compared to baselines like DAPO and online DPO.

Conclusion: The contrastive learning approach simplifies GRPO refinements and effectively enhances reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: GRPO is a standard approach to endowing pretrained LLMs with reasoning capabilities. It estimates the advantage of an outcome from a group of $K$ outcomes, and promotes those with positive advantages inside a trust region. Since GRPO discriminates between good and bad outcomes softly, it benefits from additional refinements such as asymmetric clipping and zero-variance data filtering. While effective, these refinements require significant empirical insight and can be challenging to identify. We instead propose an explicit contrastive learning approach. Instead of estimating advantages, we bifurcate $K$ outcomes into positive and negative sets, then maximize the likelihood of positive outcomes. Our approach can be viewed as an online instantiation of (multi-label) noise contrastive estimation for LLM reasoning. We validate our method by demonstrating competitive performance on a suite of challenging math benchmarks against strong baselines such as DAPO and online DPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces asynchronous updates for data and pipeline parallelism to reduce communication overhead, employing weight look-ahead and sparse averaging with convergence guarantees, matching synchronous performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High communication costs in data and pipeline parallelism limit scalability; the paper aims to address this bottleneck by relaxing co-location requirements through asynchronous updates.

Method: Uses asynchronous updates with weight look-ahead for pipeline parallelism and sparse averaging with an exponential moving average correction for data parallelism.

Result: Experiments on large-scale language models (up to 1B parameters) show performance matching synchronous baselines with reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed asynchronous methods effectively mitigate communication bottlenecks without compromising performance, enhancing scalability.

Abstract: Data and pipeline parallelism are key strategies for scaling neural network training across distributed devices, but their high communication cost necessitates co-located computing clusters with fast interconnects, limiting their scalability. We address this communication bottleneck by introducing asynchronous updates across both parallelism axes, relaxing the co-location requirement at the expense of introducing staleness between pipeline stages and data parallel replicas. To mitigate staleness, for pipeline parallelism, we adopt a weight look-ahead approach, and for data parallelism, we introduce an asynchronous sparse averaging method equipped with an exponential moving average based correction mechanism. We provide convergence guarantees for both sparse averaging and asynchronous updates. Experiments on large-scale language models (up to \em 1B parameters) demonstrate that our approach matches the performance of the fully synchronous baseline, while significantly reducing communication overhead.

*Jing Jia,Wei Yuan,Sifan Liu,Liyue Shen,Guanyang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores whether diffusion models trained on unrelated data (like bedrooms) can still recover human faces, finding they often perform nearly as well as in-domain models under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand why and when diffusion models, even when trained on mismatched or low-fidelity data, can still effectively solve inverse problems, challenging the assumption that high-fidelity models are always necessary.

Method: The authors conduct extensive experiments and develop a theory based on Bayesian consistency to analyze the robustness of weak diffusion priors under varying measurement conditions.

Result: Weak priors succeed when measurements are highly informative (e.g., many observed pixels) but fail in other regimes. The theoretical framework provides conditions for posterior concentration near the true signal.

Conclusion: The findings offer a principled justification for using weak diffusion priors reliably in inverse problems, particularly when measurements are informative.

Abstract: Can a diffusion model trained on bedrooms recover human faces? Diffusion models are widely used as priors for inverse problems, but standard approaches usually assume a high-fidelity model trained on data that closely match the unknown signal. In practice, one often must use a mismatched or low-fidelity diffusion prior. Surprisingly, these weak priors often perform nearly as well as full-strength, in-domain baselines. We study when and why inverse solvers are robust to weak diffusion priors. Through extensive experiments, we find that weak priors succeed when measurements are highly informative (e.g., many observed pixels), and we identify regimes where they fail. Our theory, based on Bayesian consistency, gives conditions under which high-dimensional measurements make the posterior concentrate near the true signal. These results provide a principled justification on when weak diffusion priors can be used reliably.

*Nikos I. Bosse,Peter Mühlbacher,Jack Wildman,Lawrence Phillips,Dan Schwarz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an automated system using LLM-powered web research agents to generate and resolve diverse forecasting questions at scale, outperforming human-curated platforms in accuracy and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting is crucial for decision-making and intelligence evaluation, but previous methods lacked diversity and scalability. This work aims to automate the process effectively.

Method: The system employs LLM-powered web research agents to generate and resolve forecasting questions, creating 1499 diverse questions and evaluating their accuracy over time.

Result: The system achieved 96% verifiable question generation and 95% resolution accuracy, with superior performance from advanced LLMs (e.g., Gemini 3 Pro). Decomposition strategies further improved forecasting.

Conclusion: The automated system enhances forecasting quality and scalability, demonstrating the potential of LLM-powered agents to outperform human-curated methods.

Abstract: Forecasting future events is highly valuable in decision-making and is a robust measure of general intelligence. As forecasting is probabilistic, developing and evaluating AI forecasters requires generating large numbers of diverse and difficult questions, and accurately resolving them. Previous efforts to automate this laborious work relied on recurring data sources (e.g., weather, stocks), limiting diversity and utility. In this work, we present a system for generating and resolving high-quality forecasting questions automatically and at scale using LLM-powered web research agents. We use this system to generate 1499 diverse, real-world forecasting questions, and to resolve them several months later. We estimate that our system produces verifiable, unambiguous questions approximately 96% of the time, exceeding the rate of Metaculus, a leading human-curated forecasting platform. We also find that our system resolves questions at approximately 95% accuracy. We verify that forecasting agents powered by more intelligent LLMs perform better on these questions (Brier score of 0.134 for Gemini 3 Pro, 0.149 for GPT-5, and 0.179 for Gemini 2.5 Flash). Finally, we demonstrate how our system can be leveraged to directly improve forecasting, by evaluating a question decomposition strategy on a generated question set, yielding a significant improvement in Brier scores (0.132 vs. 0.141).

*Yiting Liu,Zhi-Hong Deng*

TL;DR: A new weight-based interpretation framework for sparse autoencoders (SAEs) analyzes functional effects via weight interactions, revealing their roles in output token prediction and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAE interpretation methods focus on activation patterns but ignore the computational roles features play in the forward pass, limiting interpretability.

Method: Introduces a weight-based framework to measure functional effects without activation data, tested on Gemma-2 and Llama-3.1 models.

Result: Findings show features predict output tokens, participate in attention mechanisms with depth-dependent structure, and have distinct semantic/non-semantic profiles in attention circuits.

Conclusion: The framework enhances SAE interpretability by revealing out-of-context functional roles of features.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for decomposing language model representations into interpretable features. Current interpretation methods infer feature semantics from activation patterns, but overlook that features are trained to reconstruct activations that serve computational roles in the forward pass. We introduce a novel weight-based interpretation framework that measures functional effects through direct weight interactions, requiring no activation data. Through three experiments on Gemma-2 and Llama-3.1 models, we demonstrate that (1) 1/4 of features directly predict output tokens, (2) features actively participate in attention mechanisms with depth-dependent structure, and (3) semantic and non-semantic feature populations exhibit distinct distribution profiles in attention circuits. Our analysis provides the missing out-of-context half of SAE feature interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HeaPA improves RLVR training efficiency by dynamically sampling prompts and growing pools on-policy, reducing wasted computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RLVR methods waste rollouts on static or poorly aligned prompt pools, limiting efficiency and scalability.

Method: HeaPA uses heap-based boundary sampling, on-policy augmentation, and lightweight validation to maintain evolving prompt pools.

Result: HeaPA achieves better accuracy, faster convergence, and reduced computational cost across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Frontier-focused sampling and on-policy pool growth enhance RLVR efficiency, especially for larger models.

Abstract: RLVR is now a standard way to train LLMs on reasoning tasks with verifiable outcomes, but when rollout generation dominates the cost, efficiency depends heavily on which prompts you sample and when. In practice, prompt pools are often static or only loosely tied to the model's learning progress, so uniform sampling can't keep up with the shifting capability frontier and ends up wasting rollouts on prompts that are already solved or still out of reach. Existing approaches improve efficiency through filtering, curricula, adaptive rollout allocation, or teacher guidance, but they typically assume a fixed pool-which makes it hard to support stable on-policy pool growth-or they add extra teacher cost and latency. We introduce HeaPA (Heap Sampling and On-Policy Query Augmentation), which maintains a bounded, evolving pool, tracks the frontier using heap-based boundary sampling, expands the pool via on-policy augmentation with lightweight asynchronous validation, and stabilizes correlated queries through topology-aware re-estimation of pool statistics and controlled reinsertion. Across two training corpora, two training recipes, and seven benchmarks, HeaPA consistently improves accuracy and reaches target performance with fewer computations while keeping wall-clock time comparable. Our analyses suggest these gains come from frontier-focused sampling and on-policy pool growth, with the benefits becoming larger as model scale increases.

TL;DR: Masked Diffusion (MD) Language Models alter the learning landscape for the $k$-parity problem, avoiding grokking and enabling rapid generalization. Optimizing mask probability distribution improves performance in large-scale models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the generalization properties of Masked Diffusion Language Models, particularly compared to auto-regressive models, using the $k$-parity problem as a test case.

Method: The MD objective is decomposed into Signal and Noise regimes. Experiments involve training nanoGPT on the $k$-parity problem and optimizing mask probability distribution.

Result: MD models generalize rapidly without grokking. Optimizing mask distribution improves perplexity and performance, with gains of 8.8% and 5.8% in pre-training and fine-tuning for 8B-parameter models.

Conclusion: MD objectives fundamentally change learning dynamics, enabling efficient generalization and scalability in large language models.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models have recently emerged as a powerful generative paradigm, yet their generalization properties remain understudied compared to their auto-regressive counterparts. In this work, we investigate these properties within the setting of the $k$-parity problem (computing the XOR sum of $k$ relevant bits), where neural networks typically exhibit grokking -- a prolonged plateau of chance-level performance followed by sudden generalization. We theoretically decompose the Masked Diffusion (MD) objective into a Signal regime which drives feature learning, and a Noise regime which serves as an implicit regularizer. By training nanoGPT using MD objective on the $k$-parity problem, we demonstrate that MD objective fundamentally alters the learning landscape, enabling rapid and simultaneous generalization without experiencing grokking. Furthermore, we leverage our theoretical insights to optimize the distribution of the mask probability in the MD objective. Our method significantly improves perplexity for 50M-parameter models and achieves superior results across both pre-training from scratch and supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, we observe performance gains peaking at $8.8\%$ and $5.8\%$, respectively, on 8B-parameter models, confirming the scalability and effectiveness of our framework in large-scale masked diffusion language model regimes.

TL;DR: TGPM is a foundation framework for learning generalized evolving patterns in temporal graphs, overcoming limitations of existing methods by capturing multi-scale semantics and long-range dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for temporal graph learning are task-centric and rely on restrictive assumptions (e.g., short-term dependencies, static neighborhoods), limiting the discovery of transferable evolution mechanisms.

Method: TGPM synthesizes interaction patches via temporally-biased random walks to capture multi-scale semantics and long-range dependencies. These patches are processed by a Transformer-based backbone, supported by self-supervised pre-training tasks (masked token modeling and next-time prediction).

Result: TGPM achieves state-of-the-art performance in transductive and inductive link prediction, demonstrating superior cross-domain transferability.

Conclusion: TGPM effectively learns generalized evolving patterns in temporal graphs, outperforming existing methods by addressing their limitations.

Abstract: Temporal graph learning is pivotal for deciphering dynamic systems, where the core challenge lies in explicitly modeling the underlying evolving patterns that govern network transformation. However, prevailing methods are predominantly task-centric and rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as short-term dependency modeling, static neighborhood semantics, and retrospective time usage. These constraints hinder the discovery of transferable temporal evolution mechanisms. To address this, we propose the Temporal Graph Pattern Machine (TGPM), a foundation framework that shifts the focus toward directly learning generalized evolving patterns. TGPM conceptualizes each interaction as an interaction patch synthesized via temporally-biased random walks, thereby capturing multi-scale structural semantics and long-range dependencies that extend beyond immediate neighborhoods. These patches are processed by a Transformer-based backbone designed to capture global temporal regularities while adapting to context-specific interaction dynamics. To further empower the model, we introduce a suite of self-supervised pre-training tasks -- specifically masked token modeling and next-time prediction -- to explicitly encode the fundamental laws of network evolution. Extensive experiments show that TGPM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both transductive and inductive link prediction, demonstrating exceptional cross-domain transferability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses privacy and efficiency issues in machine unlearning by leveraging low-dimensional subspaces to separate remaining and forgetting data, reducing privacy risks and computational overhead.

Method: LOFT optimizes a small projection matrix in a low-dimensional feature subspace, using principal projections to maximize remaining data information and minimize forgetting data influence, requiring only one-shot feature fetching.

Conclusion: The research presents LOFT as an efficient and privacy-preserving solution for machine unlearning, validated by extensive experimental results.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims at removing the influence of specific data from a pretrained model while preserving performance on the remaining data. In this work, a novel perspective for MU is presented upon low-dimensional feature subspaces, which gives rise to the potentials of separating the remaining and forgetting data herein. This separability motivates our LOFT, a method that proceeds unlearning in a LOw-dimensional FeaTure subspace from the pretrained model skithrough principal projections, which are optimized to maximally capture the information of the remaining data and meanwhile diminish that of the forgetting data. In training, LOFT simply optimizes a small-size projection matrix flexibly plugged into the pretrained model, and only requires one-shot feature fetching from the pretrained backbone instead of repetitively accessing the raw data. Hence, LOFT mitigates two critical issues in mainstream MU methods, i.e., the privacy leakage risk from massive data reload and the inefficiency of updates to the entire pretrained model. Extensive experiments validate the significantly lower computational overhead and superior unlearning performance of LOFT across diverse models, datasets, tasks, and applications.

### [256] [EvoEGF-Mol: Evolving Exponential Geodesic Flow for Structure-based Drug Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22466)
*Yaowei Jin,Junjie Wang,Cheng Cao,Penglei Wang,Duo An,Qian Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvoEGF-Mol, an information-geometric approach for Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) that addresses mismatches in conventional methods by modeling molecules as composite exponential-family distributions and using evolving exponential geodesic flow for stable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional SBDD methods suffer from mismatches between Euclidean and probabilistic spaces, limiting their effectiveness. The paper aims to resolve this by leveraging information geometry.

Method: The authors propose EvoEGF-Mol, which models molecules as composite exponential-family distributions and uses dynamic geodesic flows under the Fisher-Rao metric, avoiding trajectory collapse with progressive-parameter-refinement.

Result: EvoEGF-Mol achieves a 93.4% PoseBusters passing rate on CrossDock, showcasing high geometric precision and interaction fidelity. It also outperforms baselines on MolGenBench tasks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that EvoEGF-Mol effectively addresses limitations in SBDD by combining information-geometric principles with stable training techniques, yielding superior results in drug discovery.

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) aims to discover bioactive ligands. Conventional approaches construct probability paths separately in Euclidean and probabilistic spaces for continuous atomic coordinates and discrete chemical categories, leading to a mismatch with the underlying statistical manifolds. We address this issue from an information-geometric perspective by modeling molecules as composite exponential-family distributions and defining generative flows along exponential geodesics under the Fisher-Rao metric. To avoid the instantaneous trajectory collapse induced by geodesics directly targeting Dirac distributions, we propose Evolving Exponential Geodesic Flow for SBDD (EvoEGF-Mol), which replaces static Dirac targets with dynamically concentrating distributions, ensuring stable training via a progressive-parameter-refinement architecture. Our model approaches a reference-level PoseBusters passing rate (93.4%) on CrossDock, demonstrating remarkable geometric precision and interaction fidelity, while outperforming baselines on real-world MolGenBench tasks by recovering bioactive scaffolds and generating candidates that meet established MedChem filters.

### [257] [Unrewarded Exploration in Large Language Models Reveals Latent Learning from Psychology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22474)
*Jian Xiong,Jingbo Zhou,Zihan Zhou,Yixiong Xiao,Le Zhang,Jingyong Ye,Rui Qian,Yang Zhou,Dejing Dou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores latent learning in LLMs, showing they improve performance during unrewarded exploration and gain further enhancements when rewards are introduced, outperforming reward-only training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the gap between latent learning in biological agents and LLMs, testing if LLMs can exhibit similar dynamics and improve flexibility without relying solely on rewards.

Method: The authors conducted experiments with LLMs during unrewarded exploration followed by reward introduction, comparing performance against reward-only reinforcement learning.

Result: LLMs showed performance improvements during unrewarded exploration and achieved higher competence post-reward introduction compared to reward-only training.

Conclusion: Latent learning dynamics exist in LLMs, suggesting unrewarded exploration enhances their adaptability and performance, aligning with biological learning principles.

Abstract: Latent learning, classically theorized by Tolman, shows that biological agents (e.g., rats) can acquire internal representations of their environment without rewards, enabling rapid adaptation once rewards are introduced. In contrast, from a cognitive science perspective, reward learning remains overly dependent on external feedback, limiting flexibility and generalization. Although recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, mark a significant breakthrough, these models still rely primarily on reward-centric reinforcement learning paradigms. Whether and how the well-established phenomenon of latent learning in psychology can inform or emerge within LLMs' training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present novel findings from our experiments that LLMs also exhibit the latent learning dynamics. During an initial phase of unrewarded exploration, LLMs display modest performance improvements, as this phase allows LLMs to organize task-relevant knowledge without being constrained by reward-driven biases, and performance is further enhanced once rewards are introduced. LLMs post-trained under this two-stage exploration regime ultimately achieve higher competence than those post-trained with reward-based reinforcement learning throughout. Beyond these empirical observations, we also provide theoretical analyses for our experiments explaining why unrewarded exploration yields performance gains, offering a mechanistic account of these dynamics. Specifically, we conducted extensive experiments across multiple model families and diverse task domains to establish the existence of the latent learning dynamics in LLMs.

*Yuxuan Li,Qijun He,Mingqi Yuan,Wen-Tse Chen,Jeff Schneider,Jiayu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A teacher-student framework decouples continual RL into separate training and distillation processes, achieving efficient lifelong learning with minimal forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of scalable performance in continual RL by leveraging single-task RL strengths and stable policy distillation.

Method: Proposes a teacher-student framework: single-task teachers trained via distributed RL, then distilled into a central model using MoE and replay.

Result: Recovers 85% of teacher performance and limits forgetting to under 10% on Meta-World.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances stability and plasticity, enabling scalable continual RL.

Abstract: Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) aims to develop lifelong learning agents to continuously acquire knowledge across diverse tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. This requires efficiently managing the stability-plasticity dilemma and leveraging prior experience to rapidly generalize to novel tasks. While various enhancement strategies for both aspects have been proposed, achieving scalable performance by directly applying RL to sequential task streams remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student framework that decouples CRL into two independent processes: training single-task teacher models through distributed RL and continually distilling them into a central generalist model. This design is motivated by the observation that RL excels at solving single tasks, while policy distillation -- a relatively stable supervised learning process -- is well aligned with large foundation models and multi-task learning. Moreover, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and a replay-based approach are employed to enhance the plasticity and stability of the continual policy distillation process. Extensive experiments on the Meta-World benchmark demonstrate that our framework enables efficient continual RL, recovering over 85% of teacher performance while constraining task-wise forgetting to within 10%.

*Khiem Le,Youssef Mroueh,Phuc Nguyen,Chi-Heng Lin,Shangqian Gao,Ting Hua,Nitesh V. Chawla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TA-GRPO improves reasoning in language models by generating semantically equivalent question variants, pooling rewards, and reducing zero-gradient issues, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the failure modes (diversity collapse and gradient diminishing) in GRPO to enhance reasoning capabilities in language models.

Method: Introduces TA-GRPO, which transforms questions via paraphrasing, variable renaming, and format changes, and pools rewards across variants to ensure mixed rewards.

Result: Experiments show Pass@k improvements: up to 9.84 points on AMC12/AIME24 and 5.05 points on GPQA-Diamond benchmarks.

Conclusion: TA-GRPO mitigates GRPO's flaws, improves generalization, and boosts performance on reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models trained via next-token prediction are fundamentally pattern-matchers: sensitive to superficial phrasing variations even when the underlying problem is identical. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was designed to improve reasoning, but in fact it worsens this situation through two failure modes: diversity collapse, where training amplifies a single solution strategy while ignoring alternatives of gradient signal, and gradient diminishing, where a large portion of questions yield zero gradients because all rollouts receive identical rewards. We propose TA-GRPO (Transform-Augmented GRPO), which generates semantically equivalent transformed variants of each question (via paraphrasing, variable renaming, and format changes) and computes advantages by pooling rewards across the entire group. This pooled computation ensures mixed rewards even when the original question is too easy or too hard, while training on diverse phrasings promotes multiple solution strategies. We provide theoretical justification showing that TA-GRPO reduces zero-gradient probability and improves generalization via reduced train-test distribution shift. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show consistent Pass@k improvements, with gains up to 9.84 points on competition math (AMC12, AIME24) and 5.05 points on out-of-distribution scientific reasoning (GPQA-Diamond).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TTCS introduces a co-evolving framework with a question synthesizer and reasoning solver to dynamically create a tailored curriculum for improving LLMs' reasoning during test-time training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time training methods struggle with difficult reasoning problems due to low-quality pseudo-labels and instability from small test sets. TTCS addresses this by co-evolving policies for question synthesis and solving.

Method: TTCS initializes two policies: a synthesizer generating progressively challenging questions and a solver updating via self-consistency rewards. They iteratively optimize, stabilizing training and aligning questions with solver capability.

Result: TTCS improves reasoning on mathematical benchmarks and general-domain tasks across LLM backbones, demonstrating scalable dynamic curriculum construction.

Conclusion: TTCS offers a scalable, stable approach for test-time training by co-evolving question synthesis and solving, enhancing LLM reasoning dynamically.

Abstract: Test-Time Training offers a promising way to improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) by adapting the model using only the test questions. However, existing methods struggle with difficult reasoning problems for two reasons: raw test questions are often too difficult to yield high-quality pseudo-labels, and the limited size of test sets makes continuous online updates prone to instability. To address these limitations, we propose TTCS, a co-evolving test-time training framework. Specifically, TTCS initializes two policies from the same pretrained model: a question synthesizer and a reasoning solver. These policies evolve through iterative optimization: the synthesizer generates progressively challenging question variants conditioned on the test questions, creating a structured curriculum tailored to the solver's current capability, while the solver updates itself using self-consistency rewards computed from multiple sampled responses on both original test and synthetic questions. Crucially, the solver's feedback guides the synthesizer to generate questions aligned with the model's current capability, and the generated question variants in turn stabilize the solver's test-time training. Experiments show that TTCS consistently strengthens the reasoning ability on challenging mathematical benchmarks and transfers to general-domain tasks across different LLM backbones, highlighting a scalable path towards dynamically constructing test-time curricula for self-evolving.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STARS is a training-free framework designed to detect and rectify cognitive inertia in Large Reasoning Models by monitoring latent dynamics and steering reasoning in real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for detecting cognitive inertia in Large Reasoning Models rely on superficial textual heuristics, failing to capture internal conflicts. STARS addresses this gap.

Method: STARS identifies Cognitive Pivots via L2 distance spikes in hidden states, uses geometric trajectory analysis for diagnosis, and injects state-aware language cues.

Result: STARS efficiently reduces redundant loops and improves accuracy by adaptively correcting erroneous reasoning trajectories.

Conclusion: STARS provides a robust, unsupervised solution to enhance the reasoning process of LRMs without fine-tuning.

Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance by scaling test-time compute, they frequently suffer from Cognitive Inertia, a failure pattern manifesting as either overthinking (inertia of motion) or reasoning rigidity (inertia of direction). Existing detection methods, typically relying on superficial textual heuristics like self-correction tokens, often fail to capture the model's unvoiced internal conflicts. To address this, we propose STARS (Spike-Triggered Adaptive Reasoning Steering), a training-free framework designed to rectify cognitive inertia by monitoring latent dynamics. STARS identifies Cognitive Pivots-critical moments of reasoning transition-by detecting distinct L2 distance spikes in the hidden states. Upon detection, the framework employs geometric trajectory analysis to diagnose the structural nature of the transition and injects state-aware language cues to steer the model in real-time. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks confirm that STARS efficiently curtails redundant loops while improving accuracy through the adaptive correction of erroneous trajectories. STARS offers a robust, unsupervised mechanism to optimize the reasoning process of LRMs without requiring additional fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified study of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) variants, offering taxonomy, theory, codebase (LoRAFactory), and evaluation, showing LoRA's sensitivity to learning rates and its competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fragmentation in LoRA variants' methodology, theory, code, and evaluation.

Method: Categorizes LoRA variants along four axes, reviews them theoretically, implements LoRAFactory for experimentation, and conducts large-scale evaluations.

Result: LoRA variants show sensitivity to learning rates but, with proper tuning, LoRA often matches or outperforms its variants.

Conclusion: LoRA remains robust and competitive, emphasizing the importance of hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a fundamental parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that balances efficiency and performance in large-scale neural networks. However, the proliferation of LoRA variants has led to fragmentation in methodology, theory, code, and evaluation. To this end, this work presents the first unified study of LoRA variants, offering a systematic taxonomy, unified theoretical review, structured codebase, and standardized empirical assessment. First, we categorize LoRA variants along four principal axes: rank, optimization dynamics, initialization, and integration with Mixture-of-Experts. Then, we review their relationships and evolution within a common theoretical framework focused on low-rank update dynamics. Further, we introduce LoRAFactory, a modular codebase that implements variants through a unified interface, supporting plug-and-play experimentation and fine-grained analysis. Last, using this codebase, we conduct a large-scale evaluation across natural language generation, natural language understanding, and image classification tasks, systematically exploring key hyperparameters. Our results uncover several findings, notably: LoRA and its variants exhibit pronounced sensitivity to the choices of learning rate compared to other hyperparameters; moreover, with proper hyperparameter configurations, LoRA consistently matches or surpasses the performance of most of its variants.

*Pit Neitemeier,Alessio Serra,Jiaze Li,Sascha Wirges,Lukas Balles,Jan Hendrik Metzen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hierarchical sequence models improve efficiency via learned segmentations, but assessing boundary quality is challenging. The paper introduces a metric (boundary enrichment B) and Sombrero, a method to steer boundary placement toward predictive difficulty, enhancing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in quantitatively assessing and steering boundary placement in hierarchical sequence models motivates the need for a metric and method to align compute with predictive difficulty.

Method: Introduced boundary enrichment B metric and Sombrero, which uses confidence-alignment boundary loss and confidence-weighted smoothing to optimize boundary placement.

Result: Sombrero improves accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on UTF-8 corpora (English, German text, code, math), aligning compute with challenging predictions.

Conclusion: Sombrero effectively enhances hierarchical sequence models by guiding boundary placement toward predictive difficulty, improving efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Hierarchical sequence models replace fixed tokenization with learned segmentations that compress long byte sequences for efficient autoregressive modeling. While recent end-to-end methods can learn meaningful boundaries from the language-modeling objective alone, it remains difficult to quantitatively assess and systematically steer where compute is spent. We introduce a router-agnostic metric of boundary quality, boundary enrichment B, which measures how strongly chunk starts concentrate on positions with high next-byte surprisal. Guided by this metric, we propose Sombrero, which steers boundary placement toward predictive difficulty via a confidence-alignment boundary loss and stabilizes boundary learning by applying confidence-weighted smoothing at the input level rather than on realized chunks. On 1B scale, across UTF-8 corpora covering English and German text as well as code and mathematical content, Sombrero improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off and yields boundaries that more consistently align compute with hard-to-predict positions.

*Gudrun Thorkelsdottir,Arindam Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning flow models is challenging with limited data or evolving distributions. Previous methods impose restrictive conditions. Proposed Gradual Fine-Tuning (GFT) offers a principled, temperature-controlled approach for stochastic flows, ensuring convergence and faster inference while preserving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of fine-tuning flow matching models under constraints like limited data, evolving distributions, or efficiency demands, where traditional methods may degrade pretrained performance.

Method: Introduces Gradual Fine-Tuning (GFT), a framework that uses temperature-controlled intermediate objectives to smoothly transition between pretrained and target drifts, leveraging optimal transport couplings for correctness.

Result: GFT improves convergence stability, shortens probability paths (enabling faster inference), and maintains generation quality comparable to standard fine-tuning.

Conclusion: GFT is a theoretically grounded and practical solution for adapting flow matching models under distribution shift, offering scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Fine-tuning flow matching models is a central challenge in settings with limited data, evolving distributions, or strict efficiency demands, where unconstrained fine-tuning can erode the accuracy and efficiency gains learned during pretraining. Prior work has produced theoretical guarantees and empirical advances for reward-based fine-tuning formulations, but these methods often impose restrictions on permissible drift structure or training techniques. In this work, we propose Gradual Fine-Tuning (GFT), a principled framework for fine-tuning flow-based generative models when samples from the target distribution are available. For stochastic flows, GFT defines a temperature-controlled sequence of intermediate objectives that smoothly interpolate between the pretrained and target drifts, approaching the true target as the temperature approaches zero. We prove convergence results for both marginal and conditional GFT objectives, enabling the use of suitable (e.g., optimal transport) couplings during GFT while preserving correctness. Empirically, GFT improves convergence stability and shortens probability paths, resulting in faster inference, while maintaining generation quality comparable to standard fine-tuning. Our results position GFT as a theoretically grounded and practically effective alternative for scalable adaptation of flow matching models under distribution shift.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoVE decouples model memory from computational cost by introducing a global bank of learnable embeddings, enabling scalable capacity without proportional FLOPs increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the rigid coupling between model capacity and computational cost in autoregressive sequence modeling, which traditionally requires deepening or widening networks for memory expansion.

Method: Introduces MoVE, a mechanism with a global bank of learnable value embeddings and a differentiable soft gating mechanism to dynamically mix retrieved concepts into value projections.

Result: MoVE improves performance in text and image generation, achieving lower perplexity and higher fidelity than baselines at similar compute budgets.

Conclusion: MoVE provides a scalable solution for increasing model memory independently of FLOPs, enhancing autoregressive modeling efficiency.

Abstract: Autoregressive sequence modeling stands as the cornerstone of modern Generative AI, powering results across diverse modalities ranging from text generation to image generation. However, a fundamental limitation of this paradigm is the rigid structural coupling of model capacity to computational cost: expanding a model's parametric memory -- its repository of factual knowledge or visual patterns -- traditionally requires deepening or widening the network, which incurs a proportional rise in active FLOPs. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{MoVE (Mixture of Value Embeddings)}$, a mechanism that breaks this coupling and establishes a new axis for scaling capacity. MoVE decouples memory from compute by introducing a global bank of learnable value embeddings shared across all attention layers. For every step in the sequence, the model employs a differentiable soft gating mechanism to dynamically mix retrieved concepts from this bank into the standard value projection. This architecture allows parametric memory to be scaled independently of network depth by simply increasing the number of embedding slots. We validate MoVE through strictly controlled experiments on two representative applications of autoregressive modeling: Text Generation and Image Generation. In both domains, MoVE yields consistent performance improvements over standard and layer-wise memory baselines, enabling the construction of "memory-dense" models that achieve lower perplexity and higher fidelity than their dense counterparts at comparable compute budgets.

TL;DR: Hierarchical policies in offline GCRL address long-horizon tasks by decomposing control into subgoal planning and action execution, emphasizing the need for action-sufficient goal representations rather than value-sufficient ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches assume goal representations preserving value estimation are adequate for optimal control, but this can fail. The paper aims to define and achieve action sufficiency for better control outcomes.

Method: Introduces an information-theoretic framework defining action sufficiency, proving its necessity for optimal action selection, and shows log-loss training naturally induces such representations.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate actor-derived representations outperform those learned via value estimation in a discrete environment.

Conclusion: Action sufficiency is crucial for optimal control in hierarchical GCRL, and log-loss training effectively induces such representations.

Abstract: Hierarchical policies in offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) addresses long-horizon tasks by decomposing control into high-level subgoal planning and low-level action execution. A critical design choice in such architectures is the goal representation-the compressed encoding of goals that serves as the interface between these levels. Existing approaches commonly derive goal representations while learning value functions, implicitly assuming that preserving information sufficient for value estimation is adequate for optimal control. We show that this assumption can fail, even when the value estimation is exact, as such representations may collapse goal states that need to be differentiated for action learning. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework that defines action sufficiency, a condition on goal representations necessary for optimal action selection. We prove that value sufficiency does not imply action sufficiency and empirically verify that the latter is more strongly associated with control success in a discrete environment. We further demonstrate that standard log-loss training of low-level policies naturally induces action-sufficient representations. Our experimental results a popular benchmark demonstrate that our actor-derived representations consistently outperform representations learned via value estimation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dual Replay with Experience Enhancement (DREE), a framework to address continual task drift in neural VRP solvers, improving learning efficiency and preventing forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural VRP solvers fail to handle continually drifting tasks with limited training resources, highlighting the need for a more adaptable approach.

Method: DREE, a dual replay framework with experience enhancement, is proposed to efficiently learn new tasks and preserve prior knowledge.

Result: Experiments demonstrate DREE's effectiveness in learning new tasks, retaining knowledge, and generalizing to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: DREE offers a robust solution for neural VRP solvers in scenarios with continual task drift and limited training resources.

Abstract: Existing neural solvers for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are typically trained either in a one-off manner on a fixed set of pre-defined tasks or in a lifelong manner on several tasks arriving sequentially, assuming sufficient training on each task. Both settings overlook a common real-world property: problem patterns may drift continually over time, yielding massive tasks sequentially arising while offering only limited training resources per task. In this paper, we study a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural VRP solvers under continually drifting tasks over learning time steps, where sufficient training for any given task at any time is not available. We propose Dual Replay with Experience Enhancement (DREE), a general framework to improve learning efficiency and mitigate catastrophic forgetting under such drift. Extensive experiments show that, under such continual drift, DREE effectively learns new tasks, preserves prior knowledge, improves generalization to unseen tasks, and can be applied to diverse existing neural solvers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Perplexity, a measure of model surprise, may not reliably select better models due to limitations shown analytically in decoder-only Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously demonstrate why perplexity can be an unsuitable metric for model selection, addressing its empirical limitations highlighted in prior studies.

Method: Leverages Transformer continuity results to analytically prove that perplexity fails in certain cases, and studies iso-perplexity plots to understand its behavior.

Result: Proves that strong generalization in a Transformer implies sequences with low perplexity but incorrect predictions, and finds perplexity may not favor more accurate models unless confidence and accuracy increase together.

Conclusion: Perplexity is not always reliable for model selection, as it can favor models with high confidence but low accuracy, and its use requires careful consideration.

Abstract: Perplexity -- a function measuring a model's overall level of "surprise" when encountering a particular output -- has gained significant traction in recent years, both as a loss function and as a simple-to-compute metric of model quality. Prior studies have pointed out several limitations of perplexity, often from an empirical manner. Here we leverage recent results on Transformer continuity to show in a rigorous manner how perplexity may be an unsuitable metric for model selection. Specifically, we prove that, if there is any sequence that a compact decoder-only Transformer model predicts accurately and confidently -- a necessary pre-requisite for strong generalisation -- it must imply existence of another sequence with very low perplexity, but not predicted correctly by that same model. Further, by analytically studying iso-perplexity plots, we find that perplexity will not always select for the more accurate model -- rather, any increase in model confidence must be accompanied by a commensurate rise in accuracy for the new model to be selected.

TL;DR: Transformers learn skills in non-human orders (reverse or parallel), causing errors termed 'shattered compositionality,' driven by correlational matching, not improved by scaling or scratchpad reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs exhibit non-human skill compositions and errors, focusing on learning dynamics.

Method: Train transformers on synthetic arithmetic tasks, using ablations and fine-grained diagnostics.

Result: Transformers learn skills unreliably (reverse/parallel), leading to mixing errors under distribution shifts ('shattered compositionality').

Conclusion: A fundamental mismatch exists between model learning (correlational) and desired skill compositions, impacting reliability and robustness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit unexpected errors or unintended behavior, even at scale. While recent work reveals the discrepancy between LLMs and humans in skill compositions, the learning dynamics of skill compositions and the underlying cause of non-human behavior remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning dynamics by training transformers on synthetic arithmetic tasks. Through extensive ablations and fine-grained diagnostic metrics, we discover that transformers do not reliably build skill compositions according to human-like sequential rules. Instead, they often acquire skills in reverse order or in parallel, which leads to unexpected mixing errors especially under distribution shifts--a phenomenon we refer to as shattered compositionality. To explain these behaviors, we provide evidence that correlational matching to the training data, rather than causal or procedural composition, shapes learning dynamics. We further show that shattered compositionality persists in modern LLMs and is not mitigated by pure model scaling or scratchpad-based reasoning. Our results reveal a fundamental mismatch between a model's learning behavior and desired skill compositions, with implications for reasoning reliability, out-of-distribution robustness, and alignment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel end-to-end learnable permutation framework to improve structured sparsity in model pruning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of greedy or heuristic algorithms in weight permutation for structured sparsity, which become ineffective with the exponential growth of the permutation search space in large Transformer models.

Method: Proposes a learnable permutation cost matrix, a differentiable bipartite matching solver, and a sparsity optimization loss function to optimize permutation for structured sparsity.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art permutation results for structured sparsity across vision and language Transformers.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves post-pruning performance by optimizing weight permutations, demonstrating superior results compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Structured sparsity has emerged as a popular model pruning technique, widely adopted in various architectures, including CNNs, Transformer models, and especially large language models (LLMs) in recent years. A promising direction to further improve post-pruning performance is weight permutation, which reorders model weights into patterns more amenable to pruning. However, the exponential growth of the permutation search space with the scale of Transformer architectures forces most methods to rely on greedy or heuristic algorithms, limiting the effectiveness of reordering.
  In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end learnable permutation framework. Our method introduces a learnable permutation cost matrix to quantify the cost of swapping any two input channels of a given weight matrix, a differentiable bipartite matching solver to obtain the optimal binary permutation matrix given a cost matrix, and a sparsity optimization loss function to directly optimize the permutation operator. We extensively validate our approach on vision and language Transformers, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art permutation results for structured sparsity.

It combines a novel pheromone-driven reward mechanism with a reinforcement learning algorithm, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of UAV and VLC technologies offers flexible communication and efficient lighting. Efficient trajectory planning is crucial to minimize UAV flight distance and maximize data collection efficiency in such systems.

Method: The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. The solution involves deriving an optimal flight altitude and optimizing horizontal trajectory using a pheromone-driven reward mechanism with a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm.

Result: Simulations show that the optimal altitude reduces flight distance by up to 35%, and the proposed reward mechanism cuts convergence steps by approximately 50%, enhancing efficiency in UAV-assisted VLC data collection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly improves UAV trajectory planning efficiency in VLC systems, validated by substantial performance gains in simulation results.

Abstract: Recently, the integration of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and visible light communication (VLC) technologies has emerged as a promising solution to offer flexible communication and efficient lighting. This letter investigates the three-dimensional trajectory planning in a UAV-assisted VLC system, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from ground users (GUs). The core objective is to develop a trajectory planning framework that minimizes UAV flight distance, which is equivalent to maximizing the data collection efficiency. This issue is formulated as a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To tackle it, we first derive a closed-form optimal flight altitude under specific VLC channel gain threshold. Subsequently, we optimize the UAV horizontal trajectory by integrating a novel pheromone-driven reward mechanism with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which enables adaptive UAV motion strategy in complex environments. Simulation results validate that the derived optimal altitude effectively reduces the flight distance by up to 35% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, the proposed reward mechanism significantly shortens the convergence steps by approximately 50%, demonstrating notable efficiency gains in the context of UAV-assisted VLC data collection.

*Yanwei Yue,Guibin Zhang,Boci Peng,Xuanbo Fan,Jiaxin Guo,Qiankun Li,Yan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mem-T is an autonomous memory agent with a hierarchical memory database, trained using MoT-GRPO for dense supervision, outperforming existing frameworks in performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory agent training paradigms struggle with sparse rewards and delayed feedback, limiting end-to-end optimization of memory management policies.

Method: Introduces Mem-T with a hierarchical memory database and MoT-GRPO, a tree-guided RL framework for dense supervision via memory operation tree backpropagation.

Result: Mem-T outperforms A-Mem and Mem0 by up to 14.92% and reduces inference tokens by ~24.45% compared to GAM without performance loss.

Conclusion: Mem-T and MoT-GRPO effectively address sparse reward issues, enabling efficient and high-performance memory management.

Abstract: Memory agents, which depart from predefined memory-processing pipelines by endogenously managing the processing, storage, and retrieval of memories, have garnered increasing attention for their autonomy and adaptability. However, existing training paradigms remain constrained: agents often traverse long-horizon sequences of memory operations before receiving sparse and delayed rewards, which hinders truly end-to-end optimization of memory management policies. To address this limitation, we introduce Mem-T, an autonomous memory agent that interfaces with a lightweight hierarchical memory database to perform dynamic updates and multi-turn retrieval over streaming inputs. To effectively train long-horizon memory management capabilities, we further propose MoT-GRPO, a tree-guided reinforcement learning framework that transforms sparse terminal feedback into dense, step-wise supervision via memory operation tree backpropagation and hindsight credit assignment, thereby enabling the joint optimization of memory construction and retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mem-T is (1) high-performing, surpassing frameworks such as A-Mem and Mem0 by up to $14.92\%$, and (2) economical, operating on a favorable accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier and reducing inference tokens per query by $\sim24.45\%$ relative to GAM without sacrificing performance.

*Md Mezbahul Islam,John Michael Templeton,Masrur Sobhan,Christian Poellabauer,Ananda Mohan Mondal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCOPE-PD, an explainable AI framework combining subjective and objective data to improve Parkinson's disease prediction, achieving 98.66% accuracy with features like tremor and bradykinesia being key contributors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PD diagnosis relies on subjective methods, delaying detection. Machine learning lacks interpretability for personalized risk estimation, prompting the need for an integrated, explainable AI approach.

Method: SCOPE-PD integrates subjective and objective data from PPMI, applies ML techniques, selects the best model (Random Forest), and uses SHAP analysis for interpretability.

Result: Random Forest achieves 98.66% accuracy with combined features; tremor, bradykinesia, and facial expression are top predictors from MDS-UPDRS.

Conclusion: SCOPE-PD offers a highly accurate and interpretable framework for PD prediction, highlighting key clinical features to support personalized diagnosis.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and complex neurodegenerative disorder influenced by genetic, clinical, and lifestyle factors. Predicting this disease early is challenging because it depends on traditional diagnostic methods that face issues of subjectivity, which commonly delay diagnosis. Several objective analyses are currently in practice to help overcome the challenges of subjectivity; however, a proper explanation of these analyses is still lacking. While machine learning (ML) has demonstrated potential in supporting PD diagnosis, existing approaches often rely on subjective reports only and lack interpretability for individualized risk estimation. This study proposes SCOPE-PD, an explainable AI-based prediction framework, by integrating subjective and objective assessments to provide personalized health decisions. Subjective and objective clinical assessment data are collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study to construct a multimodal prediction framework. Several ML techniques are applied to these data, and the best ML model is selected to interpret the results. Model interpretability is examined using SHAP-based analysis. The Random Forest algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of 98.66 percent using combined features from both subjective and objective test data. Tremor, bradykinesia, and facial expression are identified as the top three contributing features from the MDS-UPDRS test in the prediction of PD.

*Yida Xiong,Jiameng Chen,Xiuwen Gong,Jia Wu,Shirui Pan,Wenbin Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VBFN introduces a variational Bayesian Flow Network method for graph generation, addressing the limitations of factorized beliefs and independent channels by enabling coupled node and edge updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve graph generation by addressing the brittleness of implicit node-edge coupling recovery in existing methods, such as diffusion models and classical BFNs.

Method: The proposed Variational Bayesian Flow Network (VBFN) uses variational lifting to a joint Gaussian variational belief family with structured precisions, solving symmetric positive definite linear systems for coupled updates.

Result: VBFN shows improved fidelity and diversity in synthetic and molecular graph datasets, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: VBFN successfully enhances graph generation by enabling coupled updates and enforcing node-edge consistency, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Graph generation aims to sample discrete node and edge attributes while satisfying coupled structural constraints. Diffusion models for graphs often adopt largely factorized forward-noising, and many flow-matching methods start from factorized reference noise and coordinate-wise interpolation, so node-edge coupling is not encoded by the generative geometry and must be recovered implicitly by the core network, which can be brittle after discrete decoding. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) evolve distribution parameters and naturally support discrete generation. But classical BFNs typically rely on factorized beliefs and independent channels, which limit geometric evidence fusion. We propose Variational Bayesian Flow Network (VBFN), which performs a variational lifting to a tractable joint Gaussian variational belief family governed by structured precisions. Each Bayesian update reduces to solving a symmetric positive definite linear system, enabling coupled node and edge updates within a single fusion step. We construct sample-agnostic sparse precisions from a representation-induced dependency graph, thereby avoiding label leakage while enforcing node-edge consistency. On synthetic and molecular graph datasets, VBFN improves fidelity and diversity, and surpasses baseline methods.

TL;DR: This paper relaxes the realizability assumption in language tasks, proposing objectives for agnostic setups and achieving tight rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address language identification and generation without restricting input data distribution assumptions.

Method: Proposes objectives for agnostic setups, analyzing language tasks under relaxed assumptions.

Result: Achieves novel characterizations and nearly tight statistical rates.

Conclusion: The agnostic approach provides robust insights into language tasks without realizability constraints.

Abstract: Recent works on language identification and generation have established tight statistical rates at which these tasks can be achieved. These works typically operate under a strong realizability assumption: that the input data is drawn from an unknown distribution necessarily supported on some language in a given collection. In this work, we relax this assumption of realizability entirely, and impose no restrictions on the distribution of the input data. We propose objectives to study both language identification and generation in this more general "agnostic" setup. Across both problems, we obtain novel interesting characterizations and nearly tight rates.

TL;DR: REKD improves predictive performance of rationale extraction models by leveraging knowledge distillation from a teacher model, making it suitable for smaller neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance interpretability and performance of DNNs in high-stakes domains by addressing computational challenges in rationale extraction.

Method: Proposes REKD, where a student model learns from a teacher's rationales and predictions, alongside its own optimization, for feature selection and prediction.

Result: Experiments with BERT and ViT variants show REKD significantly boosts performance on language and vision classification tasks.

Conclusion: REKD offers an effective, model-agnostic approach to improve rationale extraction models, aligning with human learning principles.

Abstract: Because of the pervasive use of deep neural networks (DNNs), especially in high-stakes domains, the interpretability of DNNs has received increased attention. The general idea of rationale extraction (RE) is to provide an interpretable-by-design framework for DNNs via a select-predict architecture where two neural networks learn jointly to perform feature selection and prediction, respectively. Given only the remote supervision from the final task prediction, the process of learning to select subsets of features (or \emph{rationales}) requires searching in the space of all possible feature combinations, which is computationally challenging and even harder when the base neural networks are not sufficiently capable. To improve the predictive performance of RE models that are based on less capable or smaller neural networks (i.e., the students), we propose \textbf{REKD} (\textbf{R}ationale \textbf{E}xtraction with \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{D}istillation) where a student RE model learns from the rationales and predictions of a teacher (i.e., a \emph{rationalist}) in addition to the student's own RE optimization. This structural adjustment to RE aligns well with how humans could learn effectively from interpretable and verifiable knowledge. Because of the neural-model agnostic nature of the method, any black-box neural network could be integrated as a backbone model. To demonstrate the viability of REKD, we conduct experiments with multiple variants of BERT and vision transformer (ViT) models. Our experiments across language and vision classification datasets (i.e., IMDB movie reviews, CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100) show that REKD significantly improves the predictive performance of the student RE models.

TL;DR: FOCUS improves DLLM decoding efficiency by dynamically focusing compute on decodable tokens, achieving 3.52x throughput gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLLMs face high decoding costs due to wasted computation on non-decodable tokens, limiting scalability.

Method: Proposes FOCUS, an inference system that dynamically prioritizes decodable tokens and evicts non-decodable ones.

Result: Empirical results show FOCUS boosts throughput by up to 3.52x without compromising generation quality.

Conclusion: FOCUS effectively addresses DLLM inefficiencies, enabling scalable deployment with open-source availability.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) offer a compelling alternative to Auto-Regressive models, but their deployment is constrained by high decoding cost. In this work, we identify a key inefficiency in DLLM decoding: while computation is parallelized over token blocks, only a small subset of tokens is decodable at each diffusion step, causing most compute to be wasted on non-decodable tokens. We further observe a strong correlation between attention-derived token importance and token-wise decoding probability. Based on this insight, we propose FOCUS -- an inference system designed for DLLMs. By dynamically focusing computation on decodable tokens and evicting non-decodable ones on-the-fly, FOCUS increases the effective batch size, alleviating compute limitations and enabling scalable throughput. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FOCUS achieves up to 3.52$\times$ throughput improvement over the production-grade engine LMDeploy, while preserving or improving generation quality across multiple benchmarks. The FOCUS system is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/sands-lab/FOCUS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses inconsistencies in reinforcement fine-tuning by disentangling and analyzing the roles of design choices, identifying critical ones for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the roles of critical design choices in reinforcement fine-tuning, as current conclusions are inconsistent and progress seems illusive.

Method: Constructs a minimalist baseline for disentangling factors, connects it to batched contextual bandit learning, and examines marginal gains of factors like advantage and rollouts.

Result: Experiments reveal new insights into design choices' roles in learning and generalization and identify critical ones deserving more focus.

Conclusion: The study provides principled answers to fundamental questions about design choices in reinforcement fine-tuning, aiding better optimization.

Abstract: The reinforcement fine-tuning area is undergoing an explosion papers largely on optimizing design choices. Though performance gains are often claimed, inconsistent conclusions also arise from time to time, making the progress illusive. Reflecting on this illusion, we still lack principled answers to two fundamental questions: 1) what is the role of each design choice? 2) which ones are critical? This paper aims to shed light on them. The underlying challenge is that design choices are entangled together, making their contribution to learning and generalization difficult to attribute. To address this challenge, we first construct a minimalist baseline for disentangling factors: one rollout per query in each round, the outcome reward serving as the training signal without any advantage trick, and a batch size of thirty-two. This baseline connects to batched contextual bandit learning, which facilitates experimental analysis. Centering around this baseline, we design an experiment pipeline, examining the marginal gains of factors like advantage, number of rollouts, etc. Experiments on three base models and two datasets, not only reveal new understanding on the role of various design choices on learning and generalization dynamics, but also identify critical ones that deserve more effort.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Learning to Defer (L2D) for non-stationary time series with partial feedback and dynamic expert availability, introducing a model (L2D-SLDS) and routing rule to improve performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses challenges in non-stationary time series where expert availability and feedback are partial, requiring adaptive routing and information transfer across experts.

Method: The authors propose L2D-SLDS, a switching linear-Gaussian state-space model with context-dependent transitions, shared global factors, and per-expert states. A dynamic registry handles expert entry/pruning, and an IDS-inspired routing rule optimizes cost and information gain.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the model's superiority over contextual-bandit baselines and a no-shared-factor variant, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work advances Learning to Defer for dynamic scenarios, with the proposed model and routing rule offering improved performance and adaptability.

Abstract: We study Learning to Defer for non-stationary time series with partial feedback and time-varying expert availability. At each time step, the router selects an available expert, observes the target, and sees only the queried expert's prediction. We model signed expert residuals using L2D-SLDS, a factorized switching linear-Gaussian state-space model with context-dependent regime transitions, a shared global factor enabling cross-expert information transfer, and per-expert idiosyncratic states. The model supports expert entry and pruning via a dynamic registry. Using one-step-ahead predictive beliefs, we propose an IDS-inspired routing rule that trades off predicted cost against information gained about the latent regime and shared factor. Experiments show improvements over contextual-bandit baselines and a no-shared-factor ablation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a biologically inspired sampling algorithm for Bayesian inference, combining model-based, model-free, and episodic memory-based learning to improve efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to translate the computational principles of human learning—leveraging model-based planning, model-free habits, and episodic memory—into a scalable Bayesian inference algorithm.

Method: The method involves a three-component algorithm: model-based (guided sampling), model-free (fast heuristic sampling), and episodic-control (recalling past samples) modules.

Result: The approach advances Bayesian methods and is applied to Bayesian deep learning, enabling proper uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that integrating biological learning principles into Bayesian inference improves efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale machine learning problems.

Abstract: Humans learn efficiently from their environment by engaging multiple interacting neural systems that support distinct yet complementary forms of control, including model-based (goal-directed) planning, model-free (habitual) responding, and episodic memory-based learning. Model-based mechanisms compute prospective action values using an internal model of the environment, supporting flexible but computationally costly planning; model-free mechanisms cache value estimates and build heuristics that enable fast, efficient habitual responding; and memory-based mechanisms allow rapid adaptation from individual experience. In this work, we aim to elucidate the computational principles underlying this biological efficiency and translate them into a sampling algorithm for scalable Bayesian inference through effective exploration of the posterior distribution. More specifically, our proposed algorithm comprises three components: a model-based module that uses the target distribution for guided but computationally slow sampling; a model-free module that uses previous samples to learn patterns in the parameter space, enabling fast, reflexive sampling without directly evaluating the expensive target distribution; and an episodic-control module that supports rapid sampling by recalling specific past events (i.e., samples). We show that this approach advances Bayesian methods and facilitates their application to large-scale statistical machine learning problems. In particular, we apply our proposed framework to Bayesian deep learning, with an emphasis on proper and principled uncertainty quantification.

Motivation: Addressing auto-regressive error accumulation and lack of physical conservation in deep learning PDE solutions.

Method: Introduces conserved quantity correction, a model-agnostic technique for enforcing physical conservation in neural operators.

Result: Improves long-term stability and reveals spectral domain shortcomings in current architectures.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on architectures emphasizing high-frequency components for turbulent flow modeling.

Abstract: Deep learning has been proposed as an efficient alternative for the numerical approximation of PDE solutions, offering fast, iterative simulation of PDEs through the approximation of solution operators. However, deep learning solutions have struggle to perform well over long prediction durations due to the accumulation of auto-regressive error, which is compounded by the inability of models to conserve physical quantities. In this work, we present conserved quantity correction, a model-agnostic technique for incorporation physical conservation criteria within deep learning models. Our results demonstrate consistent improvement in the long-term stability of auto-regressive neural operator models, regardless of the model architecture. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of neural operators from the spectral domain, highlighting significant limitations of present architectures. These results highlight the need for future work to consider architectures that place specific emphasis on high frequency components, which are integral to the understanding and modeling of turbulent flows.

Motivation: To address computation and parameter bottlenecks in fully-connected feedforward layers (FFLs) for efficient neural networks in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Proposes EUGens, a new class of dense layers leveraging random features and input norms, unifying existing FFL extensions and reducing complexity from quadratic to linear time.

Result: EUGens improve inference speed (up to 27%) and memory efficiency (up to 30%) in tasks like image classification and language model pre-training, while reducing parameter count.

Conclusion: EUGens offer scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks, balancing efficiency and expressive power for real-world applications.

Abstract: Efficient neural networks are essential for scaling machine learning models to real-time applications and resource-constrained environments. Fully-connected feedforward layers (FFLs) introduce computation and parameter count bottlenecks within neural network architectures. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a new class of dense layers that generalize standard fully-connected feedforward layers, \textbf{E}fficient, \textbf{U}nified and \textbf{Gen}eral dense layers (EUGens). EUGens leverage random features to approximate standard FFLs and go beyond them by incorporating a direct dependence on the input norms in their computations. The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \textbf{27}\%) and memory efficiency (up to \textbf{30}\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction. Overall, our results highlight the potential of EUGens for the scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDis introduces a dual-branch framework for federated spatial-temporal prediction, separating client-specific and global patterns using causal disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of non-IID decentralized traffic data in federated learning by disentangling client-specific dynamics and global patterns.

Method: FedDis employs a dual-branch design with a Personalized Bank for client-specific factors and a Global Pattern Bank for common knowledge, using mutual information minimization.

Result: Experiments on four datasets show FedDis achieves state-of-the-art performance, efficiency, and expandability.

Conclusion: FedDis effectively disentangles local and global patterns, enhancing federated spatial-temporal prediction.

Abstract: Federated learning offers a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving traffic prediction, yet its performance is often challenged by the non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) nature of decentralized traffic data. Existing federated methods frequently struggle with this data heterogeneity, typically entangling globally shared patterns with client-specific local dynamics within a single representation. In this work, we postulate that this heterogeneity stems from the entanglement of two distinct generative sources: client-specific localized dynamics and cross-client global spatial-temporal patterns. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce FedDis, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage causal disentanglement for federated spatial-temporal prediction. Architecturally, FedDis comprises a dual-branch design wherein a Personalized Bank learns to capture client-specific factors, while a Global Pattern Bank distills common knowledge. This separation enables robust cross-client knowledge transfer while preserving high adaptability to unique local environments. Crucially, a mutual information minimization objective is employed to enforce informational orthogonality between the two branches, thereby ensuring effective disentanglement. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedDis consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, promising efficiency, and superior expandability.

Motivation: Address the instability and limited reproducibility in training consistency models from scratch, and clarify fragmented theoretical relationships.

Method: Theoretical analysis from a flow map perspective, revisiting self-distillation with reformulated gradients for stable optimization.

Result: Improved training stability and convergence, with applicability extended to diffusion-based policy learning without pretrained models.

Conclusion: Theoretical insights and practical improvements enhance consistency models' stability and broaden their applicability beyond image generation.

Abstract: Consistency models have been proposed for fast generative modeling, achieving results competitive with diffusion and flow models. However, these methods exhibit inherent instability and limited reproducibility when training from scratch, motivating subsequent work to explain and stabilize these issues. While these efforts have provided valuable insights, the explanations remain fragmented, and the theoretical relationships remain unclear. In this work, we provide a theoretical examination of consistency models by analyzing them from a flow map-based perspective. This joint analysis clarifies how training stability and convergence behavior can give rise to degenerate solutions. Building on these insights, we revisit self-distillation as a practical remedy for certain forms of suboptimal convergence and reformulate it to avoid excessive gradient norms for stable optimization. We further demonstrate that our strategy extends beyond image generation to diffusion-based policy learning, without reliance on a pretrained diffusion model for initialization, thereby illustrating its broader applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malicious bots threaten e-commerce platforms with data scraping, inventory hoarding, and fraud. Current mitigation techniques like IP blacklists and CAPTCHAs are ineffective or intrusive due to advanced bot evasion strategies.

Method: Proposes a non-intrusive graph-based framework that models user session behavior via a graph representation and uses an inductive graph neural network for classification. Captures relational structure and behavioral semantics.

Result: Outperforms session-level multilayer perceptron baselines in AUC and F1 scores. Shows robustness under adversarial perturbations and generalizes well to unseen sessions and URLs.

Conclusion: The framework is practical for e-commerce security, integrating seamlessly with existing systems, supporting real-time inference, and requiring no client-side changes.

Abstract: Malicious bots pose a growing threat to e-commerce platforms by scraping data, hoarding inventory, and perpetrating fraud. Traditional bot mitigation techniques, including IP blacklists and CAPTCHA-based challenges, are increasingly ineffective or intrusive, as modern bots leverage proxies, botnets, and AI-assisted evasion strategies. This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs. The proposed framework is deployment-friendly, integrates with existing systems without client-side instrumentation, and supports real-time inference and incremental updates, making it suitable for practical e-commerce security deployments.

TL;DR: SQUAD introduces quorum-based early-exit decisions with ensemble learning, improving accuracy and reducing latency via complementary learners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard early-exit methods suffer from unreliable confidence thresholds due to calibration issues, prompting a need for robust uncertainty estimation.

Method: SQUAD combines early-exit mechanisms with distributed ensemble learning, using quorum-based stopping and hierarchical learner diversity.

Result: Test accuracy improved by up to 5.95% and latency reduced by up to 70.60% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SQUAD's consensus-driven approach outperforms traditional methods by balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Early-exit neural networks have become popular for reducing inference latency by allowing intermediate predictions when sufficient confidence is achieved. However, standard approaches typically rely on single-model confidence thresholds, which are frequently unreliable due to inherent calibration issues. To address this, we introduce SQUAD (Scalable Quorum Adaptive Decisions), the first inference scheme that integrates early-exit mechanisms with distributed ensemble learning, improving uncertainty estimation while reducing the inference time. Unlike traditional methods that depend on individual confidence scores, SQUAD employs a quorum-based stopping criterion on early-exit learners by collecting intermediate predictions incrementally in order of computational complexity until a consensus is reached and halting the computation at that exit if the consensus is statistically significant. To maximize the efficacy of this voting mechanism, we also introduce QUEST (Quorum Search Technique), a Neural Architecture Search method to select early-exit learners with optimized hierarchical diversity, ensuring learners are complementary at every intermediate layer. This consensus-driven approach yields statistically robust early exits, improving the test accuracy up to 5.95% compared to state-of-the-art dynamic solutions with a comparable computational cost and reducing the inference latency up to 70.60% compared to static ensembles while maintaining a good accuracy.

*Youngeun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MC-GRPO replaces the mean baseline with a median baseline in group-relative policy optimization to reduce advantage sign flips and improve accuracy in low-rollout settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the degradation of accuracy in resource-constrained settings where the rollout budget is small, caused by noise in the shared mean reward baseline inducing advantage sign flips.

Method: MC-GRPO proposes using a median baseline instead of a mean baseline, generating one additional rollout for median reference (G+1), and excluding the median pivot rollout from backpropagation to maintain the core update cost.

Result: The method consistently improves stability and final accuracy in low-rollout regimes, reducing the performance gap between small and large rollout sizes to within 1%.

Conclusion: MC-GRPO is a simple and effective solution for small-rollout training, mitigating issues caused by noise in the baseline and improving performance across various models and scales.

Abstract: Group-relative policy optimization methods train language models by generating multiple rollouts per prompt and normalizing rewards with a shared mean reward baseline. In resource-constrained settings where the rollout budget is small, accuracy often degrades. We find that noise in the shared baseline induces advantage sign flips, where some rollouts receive an incorrect advantage sign, and the update direction is reversed. To address this, we propose Median-Centered Group Relative Policy Optimization (MC-GRPO), a simple and effective solution for small-rollout training. Our main idea is to replace the mean baseline with a median baseline: the median is far less sensitive to outlier rewards than the mean, mitigating the sign flips under small rollout size (G). We generate one additional rollout for median reference (G+1), and compute advantages by using the group median. With an odd-sized group, exactly one completion is the median and receives zero advantage, we exclude this pivot rollout from backpropagation so the number of gradient-contributing samples per prompt remains G, preserving the core update cost of standard G-rollout training. Across various GRPO-family methods and a wide range of models and scales, this median-centered training consistently improves stability and final accuracy in the low-rollout regime, reducing the gap between G=2 and G=8 to within 1%.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of Latent Action Models (LAMs) failing with action-correlated distractors by proposing the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for better representations, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LAMs struggle with action-correlated distractors, while humans excel at distinguishing task-relevant motions. The paper aims to leverage VLMs' common-sense reasoning to improve LAMs.

Method: Utilize VLMs to provide promptable representations for separating controllable changes from noise in an unsupervised way. Benchmark various VLMs for representation quality and robustness.

Result: Recent VLMs may underperform compared to older ones. Simple prompts to ignore distractors can significantly enhance latent action quality, boosting downstream success rates.

Conclusion: VLMs can effectively improve LAMs by providing promptable representations, with simple strategies like ignoring distractors leading to substantial performance gains.

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) have rapidly gained traction as an important component in the pre-training pipelines of leading Vision-Language-Action models. However, they fail when observations contain action-correlated distractors, often encoding noise instead of meaningful latent actions. Humans, on the other hand, can effortlessly distinguish task-relevant motions from irrelevant details in any video given only a brief task description. In this work, we propose to utilize the common-sense reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide promptable representations, effectively separating controllable changes from the noise in unsupervised way. We use these representations as targets during LAM training and benchmark a wide variety of popular VLMs, revealing substantial variation in the quality of promptable representations as well as their robustness to different prompts and hyperparameters. Interestingly, we find that more recent VLMs may perform worse than older ones. Finally, we show that simply asking VLMs to ignore distractors can substantially improve latent action quality, yielding up to a six-fold increase in downstream success rates on Distracting MetaWorld.

*Yue Li,Mingmin Chu,Xilei Yang,Da Xiao,Ziqi Xu,Wei Shao,Qipeng Song,Hui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedCARE is a federated unlearning framework that addresses inefficiencies and utility issues in existing methods by using gradient ascent and model inversion for conflict-aware unlearning and recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy regulations require removing data influence in FL systems, but retraining is costly. Existing FU methods struggle with overhead, utility loss, and unintended relearning.

Method: FedCARE uses gradient ascent for efficient forgetting, model inversion for proxy construction, and integrates pseudo-sample generation, conflict-aware projected gradient ascent, and a recovery strategy.

Result: FedCARE achieves effective forgetting, better utility retention, and lower relearning risk across datasets and settings compared to baselines.

Conclusion: FedCARE provides a low-overhead, unified solution for federated unlearning, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and utility.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without centralizing raw data, but privacy regulations such as the right to be forgotten require FL systems to remove the influence of previously used training data upon request. Retraining a federated model from scratch is prohibitively expensive, motivating federated unlearning (FU). However, existing FU methods suffer from high unlearning overhead, utility degradation caused by entangled knowledge, and unintended relearning during post-unlearning recovery. In this paper, we propose FedCARE, a unified and low overhead FU framework that enables conflict-aware unlearning and relearning-resistant recovery. FedCARE leverages gradient ascent for efficient forgetting when target data are locally available and employs data free model inversion to construct class level proxies of shared knowledge. Based on these insights, FedCARE integrates a pseudo-sample generator, conflict-aware projected gradient ascent for utility preserving unlearning, and a recovery strategy that suppresses rollback toward the pre-unlearning model. FedCARE supports client, instance, and class level unlearning with modest overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures under both IID and non-IID settings show that FedCARE achieves effective forgetting, improved utility retention, and reduced relearning risk compared to state of the art FU baselines.

*Zhan Fa,Yue Duan,Jian Zhang,Lei Qi,Wanqi Yang,Yinghuan Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decomposable Rank-1 Expert Pool and Activation-Guided Orthogonal loss for continual learning in vision-language models to reduce catastrophic forgetting and improve task adaptation with fewer parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning in vision-language models struggles with catastrophic forgetting and task adaptation. Existing methods are inefficient or rely on external knowledge.

Method: Restructures LoRA into a Rank-1 Expert Pool for dynamic task-specific updates and introduces an AGO loss to orthogonalize critical LoRA weights.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 96.7% fewer trainable parameters, no reliance on external datasets, and no inference latency.

Conclusion: The novel framework effectively minimizes inter-task interference and maintains performance while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in vision-language models (VLMs) faces significant challenges in improving task adaptation and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Existing methods usually have heavy inference burden or rely on external knowledge, while Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has shown potential in reducing these issues by enabling parameter-efficient tuning. However, considering directly using LoRA to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem is non-trivial, we introduce a novel framework that restructures a single LoRA module as a decomposable Rank-1 Expert Pool. Our method learns to dynamically compose a sparse, task-specific update by selecting from this expert pool, guided by the semantics of the [CLS] token. In addition, we propose an Activation-Guided Orthogonal (AGO) loss that orthogonalizes critical parts of LoRA weights across tasks. This sparse composition and orthogonalization enable fewer parameter updates, resulting in domain-aware learning while minimizing inter-task interference and maintaining downstream task performance. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all metrics, surpassing zero-shot upper bounds in generalization. Notably, it reduces trainable parameters by 96.7% compared to the baseline method, eliminating reliance on external datasets or task-ID discriminators. The merged LoRAs retain less weights and incur no inference latency, making our method computationally lightweight.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGMT introduces a scalable and interpretable framework for multi-graph learning by mapping graphs into a shared latent space and constructing a meta-graph for joint reasoning, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in integrating information across heterogeneous graphs with differing topologies, scales, and semantics, especially without shared node identities, to extract meaningful signals.

Method: MGMT employs Graph Transformer encoders for each graph to map structure and attributes into a shared latent space, selects task-relevant supernodes via attention, and constructs a meta-graph for joint reasoning.

Result: MGMT outperforms existing models in graph-level prediction tasks on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing interpretable representations that aid scientific discoveries.

Conclusion: MGMT is established as a unified framework for structured multi-graph learning, advancing representation techniques in graph-based domains.

Abstract: Multi-graph learning is crucial for extracting meaningful signals from collections of heterogeneous graphs. However, effectively integrating information across graphs with differing topologies, scales, and semantics, often in the absence of shared node identities, remains a significant challenge. We present the Multi-Graph Meta-Transformer (MGMT), a unified, scalable, and interpretable framework for cross-graph learning. MGMT first applies Graph Transformer encoders to each graph, mapping structure and attributes into a shared latent space. It then selects task-relevant supernodes via attention and builds a meta-graph that connects functionally aligned supernodes across graphs using similarity in the latent space. Additional Graph Transformer layers on this meta-graph enable joint reasoning over intra- and inter-graph structure. The meta-graph provides built-in interpretability: supernodes and superedges highlight influential substructures and cross-graph alignments. Evaluating MGMT on both synthetic datasets and real-world neuroscience applications, we show that MGMT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in graph-level prediction tasks while offering interpretable representations that facilitate scientific discoveries. Our work establishes MGMT as a unified framework for structured multi-graph learning, advancing representation techniques in domains where graph-based data plays a central role.

*Hanwei Tan,Wentai Hu,Ligang He,Yijun Quan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Lethe, a federated unlearning method to prevent knowledge resurfacing during continued training, ensuring persistent erasure of unlearned data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated unlearning methods ignore the possibility of knowledge resurfacing when training continues after unlearning, posing a risk to data privacy.

Method: Lethe uses a Reshape--Rectify--Restore pipeline with a temporary adapter to de-correlate and permanently erase unlearned knowledge.

Result: Lethe achieves persistent unlearning (Resurfacing Rate <1%) across client, class, and sample levels in federated systems.

Conclusion: Lethe effectively addresses the challenge of knowledge resurfacing, ensuring robust and persistent unlearning in federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: Federated unlearning (FU) aims to erase designated client-level, class-level, or sample-level knowledge from a global model. Existing studies commonly assume that the collaboration ends up with the unlearning operation, overlooking the follow-up situation where the federated training continues over the remaining data.We identify a critical failure mode, termed Knowledge resurfacing, by revealing that continued training can re-activate unlearned knowledge and cause the removed influence to resurface in the global model. To address this, we propose Lethe, a novel federated unlearning method that de-correlates knowledge to be unlearned from knowledge to be retained, ensuring persistent erasure during continued training.Lethe follows a Reshape--Rectify--Restore pipeline: a temporary adapter is first trained with gradient ascent on the unlearning data to obtain magnified updates, which is then used as corrective signals to diverge layer-wise rectification on the remaining updates in two streams. Finally, the adapter is removed and a short recovery stage is performed on the retained data. Our experiments show that Lethe supports unlearning in the federated system at all levels in a unified manner and maintains superior persistence (Resurfacing Rate <1% in most cases) even after numerous rounds of follow-up training.

TL;DR: Consensus mechanism stabilizes transformer training across wider learning rate ranges, with empirical support and hybrid framework proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are unstable under high learning rates, and architectural solutions are underexplored.

Method: Introduces consensus as a graphical model replacing attention, validated via learning rate sweeps on text, DNA, and protein data.

Result: Consensus improves stability without losing performance; hybrid framework combines benefits.

Conclusion: Consensus offers a stable alternative to attention, backed by theory and evidence.

Abstract: Standard attention-based transformers are known to exhibit instability under learning rate overspecification during training, particularly at high learning rates. While various methods have been proposed to improve resilience to such overspecification by modifying the optimization procedure, fundamental architectural innovations to this end remain underexplored. In this work, we illustrate that the consensus mechanism, a drop-in replacement for attention, stabilizes transformer training across a wider effective range of learning rates. We formulate consensus as a graphical model and provide extensive empirical analysis demonstrating improved stability across learning rate sweeps on text, DNA, and protein modalities. We further propose a hybrid consensus-attention framework that preserves performance while improving stability. We provide theoretical analysis characterizing the properties of consensus.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEFT-MuTS is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for few-shot RUL prediction, leveraging cross-domain pre-trained time-series models and outperforming traditional methods with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RUL prediction relies heavily on large datasets from similar equipment, limiting practicality. PEFT-MuTS addresses this by enabling knowledge transfer across domains with minimal data.

Method: Uses a pre-trained univariate time-series model enhanced with a feature tuning network and multivariate fusion mechanism, plus a zero-initialized regressor for stable fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves effective RUL prediction with less than 1% of target data, outperforming supervised and few-shot methods while reducing data requirements.

Conclusion: PEFT-MuTS demonstrates robust cross-domain knowledge transfer and efficient RUL prediction with minimal data, advancing practical applications.

Abstract: The application of data-driven remaining useful life (RUL) prediction has long been constrained by the availability of large amount of degradation data. Mainstream solutions such as domain adaptation and meta-learning still rely on large amounts of historical degradation data from equipment that is identical or similar to the target, which imposes significant limitations in practical applications. This study investigates PEFT-MuTS, a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning framework for few-shot RUL prediction, built on cross-domain pre-trained time-series representation models. Contrary to the widely held view that knowledge transfer in RUL prediction can only occur within similar devices, we demonstrate that substantial benefits can be achieved through pre-training process with large-scale cross-domain time series datasets. A independent feature tuning network and a meta-variable-based low rank multivariate fusion mechanism are developed to enable the pre-trained univariate time-series representation backbone model to fully exploit the multivariate relationships in degradation data for downstream RUL prediction task. Additionally, we introduce a zero-initialized regressor that stabilizes the fine-tuning process under few-shot conditions. Experiments on aero-engine and industrial bearing datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve effective RUL prediction even when less than 1\% of samples of target equipment are used. Meanwhile, it substantially outperforms conventional supervised and few-shot approaches while markedly reducing the data required to achieve high predictive accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address logical inconsistencies and reward hacking in LLMs caused by stochastic next-token prediction by integrating formal symbolic verification.

Method: A two-stage training pipeline combining formal logic verification-guided supervised fine-tuning and policy optimization, with real-time feedback.

Result: Improved performance on six benchmarks (mathematical, logical, general reasoning) with 7B and 14B models outperforming baselines by 10.4% and 14.2%.

Conclusion: Formal verification can scale and significantly enhance LLM reasoning performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable capabilities, yet their stochastic next-token prediction creates logical inconsistencies and reward hacking that formal symbolic systems avoid. To bridge this gap, we introduce a formal logic verification-guided framework that dynamically interleaves formal symbolic verification with the natural language generation process, providing real-time feedback to detect and rectify errors as they occur. Distinguished from previous neuro-symbolic methods limited by passive post-hoc validation, our approach actively penalizes intermediate fallacies during the reasoning chain. We operationalize this framework via a novel two-stage training pipeline that synergizes formal logic verification-guided supervised fine-tuning and policy optimization. Extensive evaluation on six benchmarks spanning mathematical, logical, and general reasoning demonstrates that our 7B and 14B models outperform state-of-the-art baselines by average margins of 10.4% and 14.2%, respectively. These results validate that formal verification can serve as a scalable mechanism to significantly push the performance boundaries of advanced LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GUDA proposes a group-level attribution method for vision generative models using unlearning to avoid costly retraining, showing reliability and efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners need group-level attribution (e.g., styles or classes) for vision generative models, but existing methods are computationally expensive.

Method: GUDA approximates counterfactual models via machine unlearning instead of retraining, using likelihood-based scores to quantify group influence.

Result: GUDA outperforms semantic similarity, gradient-based methods, and instance-level unlearning in identifying primary groups, with a x100 speedup over LOGO retraining.

Conclusion: GUDA provides an efficient and reliable solution for group-level data attribution in diffusion models.

Abstract: Training-data attribution for vision generative models aims to identify which training data influenced a given output. While most methods score individual examples, practitioners often need group-level answers (e.g., artistic styles or object classes). Group-wise attribution is counterfactual: how would a model's behavior on a generated sample change if a group were absent from training? A natural realization of this counterfactual is Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) retraining, which retrains the model with each group removed; however, it becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of groups grows. We propose GUDA (Group Unlearning-based Data Attribution) for diffusion models, which approximates each counterfactual model by applying machine unlearning to a shared full-data model instead of training from scratch. GUDA quantifies group influence using differences in a likelihood-based scoring rule (ELBO) between the full model and each unlearned counterfactual. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and artistic style attribution with Stable Diffusion show that GUDA identifies primary contributing groups more reliably than semantic similarity, gradient-based attribution, and instance-level unlearning approaches, while achieving x100 speedup on CIFAR-10 over LOGO retraining.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores progressive freezing as an alternative to STE for training binary networks, introducing StoMPP to improve accuracy without STE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of progressive freezing in full binary neural networks due to gradient blockades and improve training accuracy.

Method: Introduces StoMPP, a layerwise stochastic masking approach that progressively replaces differentiable weights/activations with binary step functions, avoiding STE.

Result: StoMPP outperforms STE baselines, with significant gains on deeper models and datasets (e.g., ResNet-50 BNN: +18.0 on CIFAR-10).

Conclusion: StoMPP effectively improves binary network training, demonstrating better depth scaling and non-monotonic convergence dynamics.

Abstract: We investigate progressive freezing as an alternative to straight-through estimators (STE) for training binary networks from scratch. Under controlled training conditions, we find that while global progressive freezing works for binary-weight networks, it fails for full binary neural networks due to activation-induced gradient blockades. We introduce StoMPP (Stochastic Masked Partial Progressive Binarization), which uses layerwise stochastic masking to progressively replace differentiable clipped weights/activations with hard binary step functions, while only backpropagating through the unfrozen (clipped) subset (i.e., no straight-through estimator). Under a matched minimal training recipe, StoMPP improves accuracy over a BinaryConnect-style STE baseline, with gains that increase with depth (e.g., for ResNet-50 BNN: +18.0 on CIFAR-10, +13.5 on CIFAR-100, and +3.8 on ImageNet; for ResNet-18: +3.1, +4.7, and +1.3). For binary-weight networks, StoMPP achieves 91.2\% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 69.5\% on CIFAR-100 with ResNet-50. We analyze training dynamics under progressive freezing, revealing non-monotonic convergence and improved depth scaling under binarization constraints.

TL;DR: A data-free early stopping framework for Federated Learning (FL) is proposed, eliminating the need for validation data and reducing computational costs/privacy risks while achieving comparable or better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed global rounds or validation data for hyperparameter tuning in FL incur high computational costs and privacy risks, hindering practical deployment.

Method: The framework monitors the task vector's growth rate using only server-side parameters to determine the optimal stopping point.

Result: The approach outperforms validation-based early stopping, achieving 12.5%/10.3% higher performance in skin lesion/blood cell classification with fewer rounds.

Conclusion: This is the first work proposing an early stopping framework for FL without validation data, offering efficiency and privacy benefits.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates decentralized collaborative learning without transmitting raw data. However, reliance on fixed global rounds or validation data for hyperparameter tuning hinders practical deployment by incurring high computational costs and privacy risks. To address this, we propose a data-free early stopping framework that determines the optimal stopping point by monitoring the task vector's growth rate using solely server-side parameters. The numerical results on skin lesion/blood cell classification demonstrate that our approach is comparable to validation-based early stopping across various state-of-the-art FL methods. In particular, the proposed framework spends an average of 47/20 (skin lesion/blood cell) rounds to achieve over 12.5%/10.3% higher performance than early stopping based on validation data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an early stopping framework for FL methods without using any validation data.

TL;DR: This paper compares full-graph vs. mini-batch GNN training, analyzing the impact of batch size and fan-out size on performance and efficiency, providing practical tuning guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to resolve the challenge of choosing between full-graph and mini-batch GNN training by examining their convergence, generalization, and computational efficiency.

Method: Empirical and theoretical analyses are conducted, focusing on batch size and fan-out size, including generalization analysis using Wasserstein distance.

Result: Full-graph training isn't always superior; tuning batch and fan-out sizes affects GNN performance and efficiency non-isotropically.

Conclusion: The findings offer practical insights for optimizing GNN training under resource constraints.

Abstract: Full-graph and mini-batch Graph Neural Network (GNN) training approaches have distinct system design demands, making it crucial to choose the appropriate approach to develop. A core challenge in comparing these two GNN training approaches lies in characterizing their model performance (i.e., convergence and generalization) and computational efficiency. While a batch size has been an effective lens in analyzing such behaviors in deep neural networks (DNNs), GNNs extend this lens by introducing a fan-out size, as full-graph training can be viewed as mini-batch training with the largest possible batch size and fan-out size. However, the impact of the batch and fan-out size for GNNs remains insufficiently explored. To this end, this paper systematically compares full-graph vs. mini-batch training of GNNs through empirical and theoretical analyses from the view points of the batch size and fan-out size. Our key contributions include: 1) We provide a novel generalization analysis using the Wasserstein distance to study the impact of the graph structure, especially the fan-out size. 2) We uncover the non-isotropic effects of the batch size and the fan-out size in GNN convergence and generalization, providing practical guidance for tuning these hyperparameters under resource constraints. Finally, full-graph training does not always yield better model performance or computational efficiency than well-tuned smaller mini-batch settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of Transformer-based LLMs in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, focusing on periodicity as a key OOD scenario. It introduces a theoretical framework and benchmark (Coper) to assess composite periodicity generalization, finding that Transformers memorize but fail to generalize such patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Transformer-based LLMs struggle with OOD generalization, specifically periodic patterns, and to provide a theoretical and empirical foundation for addressing this gap.

Method: The authors interpret periodicity through abstract algebra and reasoning, covering single and composite cases. They develop Coper, a benchmark with OOD settings (Hollow and Extrapolation), and test Transformer models on periodicity generalization.

Result: Experiments show Transformers fail to generalize unseen composite periodicity despite memorizing periodic data during training.

Conclusion: The paper highlights a critical limitation in Transformer models regarding OOD generalization of periodic patterns and releases resources (Coper benchmark) to aid further research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based on the Transformer have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks. However, current models still exhibit substantial limitations in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization compared with humans. We investigate this gap through periodicity, one of the basic OOD scenarios. Periodicity captures invariance amid variation. Periodicity generalization represents a model's ability to extract periodic patterns from training data and generalize to OOD scenarios. We introduce a unified interpretation of periodicity from the perspective of abstract algebra and reasoning, including both single and composite periodicity, to explain why Transformers struggle to generalize periodicity. Then we construct Coper about composite periodicity, a controllable generative benchmark with two OOD settings, Hollow and Extrapolation. Experiments reveal that periodicity generalization in Transformers is limited, where models can memorize periodic data during training, but cannot generalize to unseen composite periodicity. We release the source code to support future research.

Motivation: To address the need for trustworthy AI in medicine by quantifying data quality for model training and testing.

Result: Demonstrated the approach on the PTB-XL ECG-dataset, showing practical applicability.

Conclusion: The framework supports fit-for-purpose evaluation of medical data, fostering trustworthy AI adoption.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) in medicine has transitioned from research to concrete applications aimed at supporting several medical purposes like therapy selection, monitoring and treatment. Acceptance and effective adoption by clinicians and patients, as well as regulatory approval, require evidence of trustworthiness. A major factor for the development of trustworthy AI is the quantification of data quality for AI model training and testing. We have recently proposed the METRIC-framework for systematically evaluating the suitability (fit-for-purpose) of data for medical ML for a given task. Here, we operationalize this theoretical framework by introducing a collection of data quality metrics - the metric library - for practically measuring data quality dimensions. For each metric, we provide a metric card with the most important information, including definition, applicability, examples, pitfalls and recommendations, to support the understanding and implementation of these metrics. Furthermore, we discuss strategies and provide decision trees for choosing an appropriate set of data quality metrics from the metric library given specific use cases. We demonstrate the impact of our approach exemplarily on the PTB-XL ECG-dataset. This is a first step to enable fit-for-purpose evaluation of training and test data in practice as the base for establishing trustworthy AI in medicine.

*Ritesh Bhadana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning-based surrogate model using CNN for early-stage IR-drop estimation is proposed, offering fast and accurate predictions compared to traditional physics-based tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IR-drop poses significant timing and reliability challenges in VLSI designs, but conventional analysis tools are computationally expensive and unsuitable for early design exploration.

Method: A U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture maps spatial layout features to IR-drop heatmaps, trained on synthetic data incorporating key physical factors.

Result: The model achieves accurate IR-drop predictions with millisecond-level inference time, enabling rapid pre-signoff screening.

Conclusion: This framework serves as a complementary early-stage tool, providing designers with quick IR-drop insights before costly signoff analysis.

Abstract: IR-drop is a critical power integrity challenge in modern VLSI designs that can cause timing degradation, reliability issues, and functional failures if not detected early in the design flow. Conventional IR-drop analysis relies on physics-based signoff tools, which provide high accuracy but incur significant computational cost and require near-final layout information, making them unsuitable for rapid early-stage design exploration. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based surrogate modeling approach for early-stage IR-drop estimation using a CNN. The task is formulated as a dense pixel-wise regression problem, where spatial physical layout features are mapped directly to IR-drop heatmaps. A U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections is employed to effectively capture both local and global spatial dependencies within the layout. The model is trained on a physics-inspired synthetic dataset generated by us, which incorporates key physical factors including power grid structure, cell density distribution, and switching activity. Model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict IR-drop distributions with millisecond-level inference time, enabling fast pre-signoff screening and iterative design optimization. The proposed framework is intended as a complementary early-stage analysis tool, providing designers with rapid IR-drop insight prior to expensive signoff analysis. The implementation, dataset generation scripts, and the interactive inference application are publicly available at: https://github.com/riteshbhadana/IR-Drop-Predictor.

### [303] [Breaking the Blocks: Continuous Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling for Unified LLM Quantization and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22716)
*Pingzhi Tang,Ruijie Zhou,Fanxu Meng,Wenjie Pei,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRDS introduces element-wise quantization via low-rank matrices (S=BA), outperforming block-wise methods with better expressivity, efficiency, and no added inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current block-wise quantization methods limit representational flexibility. This work aims to enhance expressive power while maintaining efficiency.

Method: Proposes Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework using low-rank matrices (S=BA) for element-wise quantization, enabling efficient PTQ, QAT, and PEFT.

Result: LoRDS outperforms baselines, achieving up to 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits and 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090, with 9.6% better PEFT performance.

Conclusion: LoRDS offers a robust, integrated solution for LLM compression and adaptation, combining efficiency, flexibility, and superior performance.

Abstract: Current quantization methods for LLMs predominantly rely on block-wise structures to maintain efficiency, often at the cost of representational flexibility. In this work, we demonstrate that element-wise quantization can be made as efficient as block-wise scaling while providing strictly superior expressive power by modeling the scaling manifold as continuous low-rank matrices ($S = BA$). We propose Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework that rethinks quantization granularity through this low-rank decomposition. By "breaking the blocks" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs.

### [304] [Local Intrinsic Dimension of Representations Predicts Alignment and Generalization in AI Models and Human Brain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22722)
*Junjie Yu,Wenxiao Ma,Chen Wei,Jianyu Zhang,Haotian Deng,Zihan Deng,Quanying Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stronger generalization in neural networks correlates with higher alignment between models and human neural activity, explained by lower local intrinsic dimension of embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the relationship between generalization performance, model-model alignment, model-brain alignment, and the geometric properties of learned representations.

Method: Analyzed generalization, alignment metrics, and the local intrinsic dimension of embeddings across models with varying capacities and training data scales.

Result: Lower local intrinsic dimension correlates with better generalization, stronger model-model and model-brain alignment. Scaling improves this dimension.

Conclusion: Local intrinsic dimension is a key descriptor of representational convergence in both artificial and biological systems.

Abstract: Recent work has found that neural networks with stronger generalization tend to exhibit higher representational alignment with one another across architectures and training paradigms. In this work, we show that models with stronger generalization also align more strongly with human neural activity. Moreover, generalization performance, model--model alignment, and model--brain alignment are all significantly correlated with each other. We further show that these relationships can be explained by a single geometric property of learned representations: the local intrinsic dimension of embeddings. Lower local dimension is consistently associated with stronger model--model alignment, stronger model--brain alignment, and better generalization, whereas global dimension measures fail to capture these effects. Finally, we find that increasing model capacity and training data scale systematically reduces local intrinsic dimension, providing a geometric account of the benefits of scaling. Together, our results identify local intrinsic dimension as a unifying descriptor of representational convergence in artificial and biological systems.

*Md Musfiqur Rahman,Ziwei Jiang,Hilaf Hasson,Murat Kocaoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to distinguish between sample uncertainty and non-ID uncertainty in causal effect bounds using neural networks and confidence sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of distinguishing fundamental non-identifiability from finite-sample limitations in causal inference under unobserved confounding.

Method: Uses neural causal models to solve min-max and max-min problems over distributions and structural causal models (SCMs) within a confidence set.

Result: Demonstrates that the framework can identify when more data won't improve causal effect bounds, guiding practitioners on data collection strategies.

Conclusion: Provides a systematic approach to determine whether more samples or variables are needed for reliable causal inference.

Abstract: Causal inference from observational data provides strong evidence for the best action in decision-making without performing expensive randomized trials. The effect of an action is usually not identifiable under unobserved confounding, even with an infinite amount of data. Recent work uses neural networks to obtain practical bounds to such causal effects, which is often an intractable problem. However, these approaches may overfit to the dataset and be overconfident in their causal effect estimates. Moreover, there is currently no systematic approach to disentangle how much of the width of causal effect bounds is due to fundamental non-identifiability versus how much is due to finite-sample limitations. We propose a novel framework to address this problem by considering a confidence set around the empirical observational distribution and obtaining the intersection of causal effect bounds for all distributions in this confidence set. This allows us to distinguish the part of the interval that can be reduced by collecting more samples, which we call sample uncertainty, from the part that can only be reduced by observing more variables, such as latent confounders or instrumental variables, but not with more data, which we call non-ID uncertainty. The upper and lower bounds to this intersection are obtained by solving min-max and max-min problems with neural causal models by searching over all distributions that the dataset might have been sampled from, and all SCMs that entail the corresponding distribution. We demonstrate via extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets that our algorithm can determine when collecting more samples will not help determine the best action. This can guide practitioners to collect more variables or lean towards a randomized study for best action identification.

TL;DR: The paper explores Softmax-family losses, analyzing their consistency, convergence, and efficiency trade-offs in large-class settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical scalability of Softmax-family losses.

Method: Investigates surrogate consistency, gradient dynamics, and introduces a bias-variance decomposition for approximate methods.

Result: Demonstrates alignment between theoretical consistency, convergence, and empirical performance.

Conclusion: Provides principled foundation and practical guidance for selecting losses in large-class applications.

Abstract: The Softmax loss is one of the most widely employed surrogate objectives for classification and ranking tasks. To elucidate its theoretical properties, the Fenchel-Young framework situates it as a canonical instance within a broad family of surrogates. Concurrently, another line of research has addressed scalability when the number of classes is exceedingly large, in which numerous approximations have been proposed to retain the benefits of the exact objective while improving efficiency. Building on these two perspectives, we present a principled investigation of the Softmax-family losses. We examine whether different surrogates achieve consistency with classification and ranking metrics, and analyze their gradient dynamics to reveal distinct convergence behaviors. We also introduce a systematic bias-variance decomposition for approximate methods that provides convergence guarantees, and further derive a per-epoch complexity analysis, showing explicit trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on a representative task demonstrate a strong alignment between consistency, convergence, and empirical performance. Together, these results establish a principled foundation and offer practical guidance for loss selections in large-class machine learning applications.

TL;DR: MSN-PINN introduces a power-law basis network to recover scaling exponents and solutions in singular physics problems, achieving high accuracy under noise and constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard neural networks ignore implicit governing exponents in physical systems near singularities. MSN-PINN addresses this gap by making exponents trainable and interpretable.

Method: MSN-PINN uses physics-informed training with power-law basis functions, treating scaling exponents as trainable parameters and enforcing physical constraints like boundary conditions.

Result: Achieves 1-5% error in exponent recovery under noise, 0.009% error for Laplace equation singularities, and 100% success on a wedge benchmark with 0.022% mean error.

Conclusion: MSN-PINN bridges neural network expressiveness and asymptotic analysis interpretability, yielding physically meaningful parameters.

Abstract: Physical systems near singularities, interfaces, and critical points exhibit power-law scaling, yet standard neural networks leave the governing exponents implicit. We introduce physics-informed M"untz-Sz'asz Networks (MSN-PINN), a power-law basis network that treats scaling exponents as trainable parameters. The model outputs both the solution and its scaling structure. We prove identifiability, or unique recovery, and show that, under these conditions, the squared error between learned and true exponents scales as $O(|μ- α|^2)$. Across experiments, MSN-PINN achieves single-exponent recovery with 1--5% error under noise and sparse sampling. It recovers corner singularity exponents for the two-dimensional Laplace equation with 0.009% error, matches the classical result of Kondrat'ev (1967), and recovers forcing-induced exponents in singular Poisson problems with 0.03% and 0.05% errors. On a 40-configuration wedge benchmark, it reaches a 100% success rate with 0.022% mean error. Constraint-aware training encodes physical requirements such as boundary condition compatibility and improves accuracy by three orders of magnitude over naive training. By combining the expressiveness of neural networks with the interpretability of asymptotic analysis, MSN-PINN produces learned parameters with direct physical meaning.

TL;DR: OSNIP is a privacy-preserving framework for LLM inference using obfuscated semantic null space injection, ensuring privacy and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy concerns in LLM inference without compromising performance.

Method: Injects perturbations into embeddings via a key-dependent stochastic mapping to create individualized obfuscated semantic null spaces.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing attack success rates while maintaining utility on 12 benchmarks.

Conclusion: OSNIP effectively balances privacy and utility in LLM inference.

Abstract: We propose Obfuscated Semantic Null space Injection for Privacy (OSNIP), a lightweight client-side encryption framework for privacy-preserving LLM inference. Generalizing the geometric intuition of linear kernels to the high-dimensional latent space of LLMs, we formally define the ``Obfuscated Semantic Null Space'', a high-dimensional regime that preserves semantic fidelity while enforcing near-orthogonality to the original embedding. By injecting perturbations that project the original embedding into this space, OSNIP ensures privacy without any post-processing. Furthermore, OSNIP employs a key-dependent stochastic mapping that synthesizes individualized perturbation trajectories unique to each user. Evaluations on 12 generative and classification benchmarks show that OSNIP achieves state-of-the-art performance, sharply reducing attack success rates while maintaining strong model utility under strict security constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores generalization in deep neural networks from a representation-centric view, linking it to embedding geometry and dimensionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why deep neural networks generalize well despite over-parameterization, focusing on embeddings rather than parameters.

Method: Analyzes generalization using Wasserstein distance convergence rates of embeddings and Lipschitz constants of downstream mappings.

Result: Population risk bounds depend on embedding dimension and sensitivity, explaining empirical generalization trends.

Conclusion: Embedding-based diagnostics provide insights into generalization, independent of parameter counts.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often generalize well despite heavy over-parameterization, challenging classical parameter-based analyses. We study generalization from a representation-centric perspective and analyze how the geometry of learned embeddings controls predictive performance for a fixed trained model. We show that population risk can be bounded by two factors: (i) the intrinsic dimension of the embedding distribution, which determines the convergence rate of empirical embedding distribution to the population distribution in Wasserstein distance, and (ii) the sensitivity of the downstream mapping from embeddings to predictions, characterized by Lipschitz constants. Together, these yield an embedding-dependent error bound that does not rely on parameter counts or hypothesis class complexity. At the final embedding layer, architectural sensitivity vanishes and the bound is dominated by embedding dimension, explaining its strong empirical correlation with generalization performance. Experiments across architectures and datasets validate the theory and demonstrate the utility of embedding-based diagnostics.

TL;DR: The study examines scaling laws in molecular language models, showing predictable behavior under fixed computational budgets and highlighting the impact of molecular representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether molecular generative models follow predictable scaling laws under fixed computational budgets, aiding optimal resource allocation.

Method: Train 300 models with over 10,000 experiments, varying model size, training tokens, and molecular representation while controlling compute budgets.

Result: Clear scaling laws emerge for pretraining and downstream tasks, with molecular representation significantly impacting performance.

Conclusion: The findings clarify inconsistencies in scaling behavior for molecular generation and provide a publicly released library of models.

Abstract: Molecular generative models, often employing GPT-style language modeling on molecular string representations, have shown promising capabilities when scaled to large datasets and model sizes. However, it remains unclear and subject to debate whether these models adhere to predictable scaling laws under fixed computational budgets, which is a crucial understanding for optimally allocating resources between model size, data volume, and molecular representation. In this study, we systematically investigate the scaling behavior of molecular language models across both pretraining and downstream tasks. We train 300 models and conduct over 10,000 experiments, rigorously controlling compute budgets while independently varying model size, number of training tokens, and molecular representation. Our results demonstrate clear scaling laws in molecular models for both pretraining and downstream transfer, reveal the substantial impact of molecular representation on performance, and explain previously observed inconsistencies in scaling behavior for molecular generation. Additionally, we publicly release the largest library of molecular language models to date to facilitate future research and development.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes a link between sparse attention mechanisms in transformers and compact kernels, showing how kernel design explains sparsity and offering principled alternatives to heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in understanding sparse attention mechanisms by connecting them to kernel regression, particularly compact kernels.

Method: Demonstrates correspondence between sparse attention (e.g., normalized ReLU, sparsemax) and compact kernels (e.g., Epanechnikov, biweight). Introduces Memory Mosaics for experimentation.

Result: Validates that kernel-based sparse attention performs well on language modeling, in-context learning, and length generalization tasks.

Conclusion: Provides a unified framework linking kernel design to sparsity in attention mechanisms, offering principled alternatives to heuristic approaches.

Abstract: Recent work has revealed a link between self-attention mechanisms in transformers and test-time kernel regression via the Nadaraya-Watson estimator, with standard softmax attention corresponding to a Gaussian kernel. However, a kernel-theoretic understanding of sparse attention mechanisms is currently missing. In this paper, we establish a formal correspondence between sparse attention and compact (bounded support) kernels. We show that normalized ReLU and sparsemax attention arise from Epanechnikov kernel regression under fixed and adaptive normalizations, respectively. More generally, we demonstrate that widely used kernels in nonparametric density estimation -- including Epanechnikov, biweight, and triweight -- correspond to $α$-entmax attention with $α= 1 + \frac{1}{n}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, while the softmax/Gaussian relationship emerges in the limit $n \to \infty$. This unified perspective explains how sparsity naturally emerges from kernel design and provides principled alternatives to heuristic top-$k$ attention and other associative memory mechanisms. Experiments with a kernel-regression-based variant of transformers -- Memory Mosaics -- show that kernel-based sparse attention achieves competitive performance on language modeling, in-context learning, and length generalization tasks, offering a principled framework for designing attention mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clipping-based methods in reinforcement learning for LLM post-training introduce optimization issues like zero-gradient regions and reward hacking. CFPO aims to address these problems.

Method: CFPO uses a convex quadratic penalty derived from Total Variation divergence constraints, replacing clipping to create a differentiable objective and enforce stable policy updates.

Result: CFPO matches clipping-based methods in reasoning tasks, extends stable training, and mitigates verbosity exploitation in alignment tasks while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: CFPO is a simple, effective drop-in alternative to clipping-based methods for post-training LLMs, offering improved stability and performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become central to post-training large language models, yet dominant algorithms rely on clipping mechanisms that introduce optimization issues at scale, including zero-gradient regions, reward hacking, and training instability. We propose Clipping-Free Policy Optimization (CFPO), which replaces heuristic clipping with a convex quadratic penalty derived from Total Variation divergence constraints, yielding an everywhere-differentiable objective that enforces stable policy updates without hard boundaries. We evaluate CFPO across both reasoning and alignment settings. In reasoning, CFPO matches clipping-based methods on downstream benchmarks while extending the stable training regime. In alignment, CFPO mitigates verbosity exploitation and reduces capability degradation, while achieving competitive instruction-following performance. CFPO requires only a one-line code change and no additional hyperparameters. Our results suggest that CFPO is a promising drop-in alternative to clipping-based methods for LLM post-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve quantized training accuracy in NVFP4 format, addressing current limitations sacrificing representation capacity for unbiased gradient estimation.

Method: Proposes MS-EDEN for micro-scaled formats and Quartet II for fully-NVFP4 quantization in linear layers, analytically showing better gradient estimation.

Result: Demonstrates 4.2x speedup over BF16 on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs and validates on 1.9B parameter LLM training.

Conclusion: Quartet II advances NVFP4 quantized training, offering significant speedups and improved accuracy, with kernels available for implementation.

Abstract: The NVFP4 lower-precision format, supported in hardware by NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, promises to allow, for the first time, end-to-end fully-quantized pre-training of massive models such as LLMs. Yet, existing quantized training methods still sacrifice some of the representation capacity of this format in favor of more accurate unbiased quantized gradient estimation by stochastic rounding (SR), losing noticeable accuracy relative to standard FP16 and FP8 training. In this paper, improve the state of the art for quantized training in NVFP4 via a novel unbiased quantization routine for micro-scaled formats, called MS-EDEN, that has more than 2x lower quantization error than SR. We integrate it into a novel fully-NVFP4 quantization scheme for linear layers, called Quartet II. We show analytically that Quartet II achieves consistently better gradient estimation across all major matrix multiplications, both on the forward and on the backward passes. In addition, our proposal synergizes well with recent training improvements aimed specifically at NVFP4. We further validate Quartet II on end-to-end LLM training with up to 1.9B parameters on 38B tokens. We provide kernels for execution on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs with up to 4.2x speedup over BF16.

TL;DR: A cascaded diffusion model improves generation of mixed-type tabular features by first creating low-resolution representations and then refining them, outperforming current methods by 40% in realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating mixed-type features (discrete states within continuous distributions) in tabular data remains challenging, motivating advancements in diffusion models.

Method: The proposed cascaded approach first generates low-resolution representations (categorical features and coarse numerical features), then refines them using guided conditional probability paths and data-dependent coupling.

Result: The model achieves a 40% improvement in detection scores, generating more realistic samples and capturing distributional details accurately.

Conclusion: The cascaded diffusion model effectively addresses the challenge of generating mixed-type features, tightening transport cost bounds and enhancing sample realism.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have recently been adapted to tabular data containing discrete and continuous features. However, generating mixed-type features that combine discrete states with an otherwise continuous distribution in a single feature remains challenging. We advance the state-of-the-art in diffusion models for tabular data with a cascaded approach. We first generate a low-resolution version of a tabular data row, that is, the collection of the purely categorical features and a coarse categorical representation of numerical features. Next, this information is leveraged in the high-resolution flow matching model via a novel guided conditional probability path and data-dependent coupling. The low-resolution representation of numerical features explicitly accounts for discrete outcomes, such as missing or inflated values, and therewith enables a more faithful generation of mixed-type features. We formally prove that this cascade tightens the transport cost bound. The results indicate that our model generates significantly more realistic samples and captures distributional details more accurately, for example, the detection score increases by 40%.

TL;DR: MetaDrug is a meta-learning framework addressing the patient cold-start problem in medication recommendations by using self and peer adaptation, enhanced with uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with unreliable recommendations for new patients and lack personalization. Meta-learning shows promise but is underexplored for EHR data.

Method: MetaDrug uses a two-level meta-adaptation (self-adaptation and peer-adaptation) and uncertainty quantification to improve recommendations for cold-start patients.

Result: MetaDrug outperforms state-of-the-art methods on MIMIC-III and AKI datasets for cold-start patients.

Conclusion: MetaDrug effectively addresses the patient cold-start problem and enhances personalized medication recommendations.

Abstract: Large-scale Electronic Health Record (EHR) databases have become indispensable in supporting clinical decision-making through data-driven treatment recommendations. However, existing medication recommender methods often struggle with a user (i.e., patient) cold-start problem, where recommendations for new patients are usually unreliable due to the lack of sufficient prescription history for patient profiling. While prior studies have utilized medical knowledge graphs to connect medication concepts through pharmacological or chemical relationships, these methods primarily focus on mitigating the item cold-start issue and fall short in providing personalized recommendations that adapt to individual patient characteristics. Meta-learning has shown promise in handling new users with sparse interactions in recommender systems. However, its application to EHRs remains underexplored due to the unique sequential structure of EHR data. To tackle these challenges, we propose MetaDrug, a multi-level, uncertainty-aware meta-learning framework designed to address the patient cold-start problem in medication recommendation. MetaDrug proposes a novel two-level meta-adaptation mechanism, including self-adaptation, which adapts the model to new patients using their own medical events as support sets to capture temporal dependencies; and peer-adaptation, which adapts the model using similar visits from peer patients to enrich new patient representations. Meanwhile, to further improve meta-adaptation outcomes, we introduce an uncertainty quantification module that ranks the support visits and filters out the unrelated information for adaptation consistency. We evaluate our approach on the MIMIC-III and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) datasets. Experimental results on both datasets demonstrate that MetaDrug consistently outperforms state-of-the-art medication recommendation methods on cold-start patients.

TL;DR: SCIQL improves offline reinforcement learning by aligning behavior style with task performance using subtrajectory labeling and a gated advantage mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning style with high task performance is challenging due to distribution shift and conflicts between style and reward. Existing methods struggle with this.

Method: Proposes a unified definition of behavior style and introduces SCIQL, leveraging offline goal-conditioned RL techniques and a Gated Advantage Weighted Regression mechanism.

Result: SCIQL outperforms prior methods in balancing style alignment and task performance.

Conclusion: SCIQL offers an effective solution for style-conditioned offline RL, with superior results demonstrated experimentally.

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning of style-conditioned policies using explicit style supervision via subtrajectory labeling functions. In this setting, aligning style with high task performance is particularly challenging due to distribution shift and inherent conflicts between style and reward. Existing methods, despite introducing numerous definitions of style, often fail to reconcile these objectives effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a unified definition of behavior style and instantiate it into a practical framework. Building on this, we introduce Style-Conditioned Implicit Q-Learning (SCIQL), which leverages offline goal-conditioned RL techniques, such as hindsight relabeling and value learning, and combine it with a new Gated Advantage Weighted Regression mechanism to efficiently optimize task performance while preserving style alignment. Experiments demonstrate that SCIQL achieves superior performance on both objectives compared to prior offline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing latent representations with desirable equivariance properties for time-series generation is underexplored. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes a latent flow-matching framework with an equivariance loss to fine-tune pre-trained autoencoder latent spaces for transformations like translation and scaling.

Result: The approach outperforms diffusion-based baselines in generation quality and achieves faster sampling, validated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating geometric inductive biases into latent generative models enhances time-series generation efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Flow-based models have proven successful for time-series generation, particularly when defined in lower-dimensional latent spaces that enable efficient sampling. However, how to design latent representations with desirable equivariance properties for time-series generative modelling remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a latent flow-matching framework in which equivariance is explicitly encouraged through a simple regularisation of a pre-trained autoencoder. Specifically, we introduce an equivariance loss that enforces consistency between transformed signals and their reconstructions, and use it to fine-tune latent spaces with respect to basic time-series transformations such as translation and amplitude scaling. We show that these equivariance-regularised latent spaces improve generation quality while preserving the computational advantages of latent flow models. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based baselines in standard time-series generation metrics, while achieving orders-of-magnitude faster sampling. These results highlight the practical benefits of incorporating geometric inductive biases into latent generative models for time series.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OptiMAG addresses discrepancies between implicit semantic and explicit graph structures in MAGs using an Unbalanced Optimal Transport-based framework, improving multimodal node representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods aggregate dissimilar features due to fixed explicit graph structures, introducing noise and hindering effective learning.

Method: Proposes OptiMAG, a framework using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance for cross-modal structural consistency and KL divergence for handling inconsistencies.

Result: OptiMAG outperforms baselines in tasks like node classification, link prediction, and multimodal generation.

Conclusion: OptiMAG effectively mitigates structural-semantic conflicts and can be integrated into existing models as a regularizer.

Abstract: Multimodal Attributed Graphs (MAGs) have been widely adopted for modeling complex systems by integrating multi-modal information, such as text and images, on nodes. However, we identify a discrepancy between the implicit semantic structure induced by different modality embeddings and the explicit graph structure. For instance, neighbors in the explicit graph structure may be close in one modality but distant in another. Since existing methods typically perform message passing over the fixed explicit graph structure, they inadvertently aggregate dissimilar features, introducing modality-specific noise and impeding effective node representation learning. To address this, we propose OptiMAG, an Unbalanced Optimal Transport-based regularization framework. OptiMAG employs the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to explicitly guide cross-modal structural consistency within local neighborhoods, effectively mitigating structural-semantic conflicts. Moreover, a KL divergence penalty enables adaptive handling of cross-modal inconsistencies. This framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing multimodal graph models, acting as an effective drop-in regularizer. Experiments demonstrate that OptiMAG consistently outperforms baselines across multiple tasks, ranging from graph-centric tasks (e.g., node classification, link prediction) to multimodal-centric generation tasks (e.g., graph2text, graph2image).

### [319] [Matterhorn: Efficient Analog Sparse Spiking Transformer Architecture with Masked Time-To-First-Spike Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22876)
*Zhanglu Yan,Kaiwen Tang,Zixuan Zhu,Zhenyu Bai,Qianhui Liu,Weng-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Matterhorn introduces a spiking transformer with M-TTFS encoding and MSU hardware to reduce energy costs in SNNs, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SNN energy evaluations overlook real-world hardware costs like data movement, which dominate energy consumption.

Method: Proposes M-TTFS encoding (masking silent states) and MSU hardware (memristive synapse) to minimize spike movement and weight access.

Result: Achieves 1.42% higher accuracy and 2.31× better energy efficiency on GLUE benchmark.

Conclusion: Matterhorn sets a new standard for energy-efficient SNNs by addressing hardware inefficiencies.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising candidate for energy-efficient LLM inference. However, current energy evaluations for SNNs primarily focus on counting accumulate operations, and fail to account for real-world hardware costs such as data movement, which can consume nearly 80% of the total energy. In this paper, we propose Matterhorn, a spiking transformer that integrates a novel masked time-to-first-spike (M-TTFS) encoding method to reduce spike movement and a memristive synapse unit (MSU) to eliminate weight access overhead. M-TTFS employs a masking strategy that reassigns the zero-energy silent state (a spike train of all 0s) to the most frequent membrane potential rather than the lowest. This aligns the coding scheme with the data distribution, minimizing spike movement energy without information loss. We further propose a `dead zone' strategy that maximizes sparsity by mapping all values within a given range to the silent state. At the hardware level, the MSU utilizes compute-in-memory (CIM) technology to perform analog integration directly within memory, effectively removing weight access costs. On the GLUE benchmark, Matterhorn establishes a new state-of-the-art, surpassing existing SNNs by 1.42% in average accuracy while delivering a 2.31 times improvement in energy efficiency.

TL;DR: A framework using Quantile Graphs (QG) for synthetic time series generation is proposed, showing competitive results against GANs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited access to high-quality time series data due to privacy, cost, and labeling issues drives the need for synthetic generation methods.

Method: Time series are transformed into Quantile Graphs (QG) and reconstructed via inverse mapping to generate synthetic data.

Result: The QG-based method preserves statistical and structural properties of original data, offering a competitive alternative to GANs.

Conclusion: The quantile graph approach provides an interpretable and effective solution for synthetic time series generation.

Abstract: Time series data are essential for a wide range of applications, particularly in developing robust machine learning models. However, access to high-quality datasets is often limited due to privacy concerns, acquisition costs, and labeling challenges. Synthetic time series generation has emerged as a promising solution to address these constraints. In this work, we present a framework for generating synthetic time series by leveraging complex networks mappings. Specifically, we investigate whether time series transformed into Quantile Graphs (QG) -- and then reconstructed via inverse mapping -- can produce synthetic data that preserve the statistical and structural properties of the original. We evaluate the fidelity and utility of the generated data using both simulated and real-world datasets, and compare our approach against state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) methods. Results indicate that our quantile graph-based methodology offers a competitive and interpretable alternative for synthetic time series generation.

*Jacques Cloete,Mathias Jackermeier,Ioannis Havoutis,Alessandro Abate*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PlatoLTL enables zero-shot generalization in multi-task RL across unseen LTL structures and propositions by treating propositions as parameterized predicates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing LTL-guided multi-task RL methods in generalizing to unseen vocabularies of propositions.

Method: Proposes PlatoLTL, treating propositions as parameterized predicates and using a novel architecture to embed and compose predicates for LTL specifications.

Result: Demonstrates successful zero-shot generalization to novel propositions and tasks in challenging environments.

Conclusion: PlatoLTL effectively generalizes across both LTL formula structures and propositions, advancing multi-task RL capabilities.

Abstract: A central challenge in multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) is to train generalist policies capable of performing tasks not seen during training. To facilitate such generalization, linear temporal logic (LTL) has recently emerged as a powerful formalism for specifying structured, temporally extended tasks to RL agents. While existing approaches to LTL-guided multi-task RL demonstrate successful generalization across LTL specifications, they are unable to generalize to unseen vocabularies of propositions (or "symbols"), which describe high-level events in LTL. We present PlatoLTL, a novel approach that enables policies to zero-shot generalize not only compositionally across LTL formula structures, but also parametrically across propositions. We achieve this by treating propositions as instances of parameterized predicates rather than discrete symbols, allowing policies to learn shared structure across related propositions. We propose a novel architecture that embeds and composes predicates to represent LTL specifications, and demonstrate successful zero-shot generalization to novel propositions and tasks across challenging environments.

*Aya Laajil,Elnura Zhalieva,Naomi Desobry,Souhaib Ben Taieb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a regularization-based method to enforce multivariate calibration during training, using novel PCA-based pre-rank functions, improving calibration without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving multivariate calibration is challenging despite progress in univariate settings. Existing pre-rank functions are limited to post-hoc evaluation.

Method: The proposed method uses regularization to enforce multivariate calibration during training, incorporating a new PCA-based pre-rank function to project predictions onto principal directions.

Result: Tests on simulations and 18 real-world datasets show improved multivariate calibration and detection of dependence-structure misspecifications without harming predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: The PCA-based pre-rank and regularization method significantly enhances multivariate calibration and uncovers misspecifications unnoticed by existing methods.

Abstract: The goal of probabilistic prediction is to issue predictive distributions that are as informative as possible, subject to being calibrated. Despite substantial progress in the univariate setting, achieving multivariate calibration remains challenging. Recent work has introduced pre-rank functions, scalar projections of multivariate forecasts and observations, as flexible diagnostics for assessing specific aspects of multivariate calibration, but their use has largely been limited to post-hoc evaluation. We propose a regularization-based calibration method that enforces multivariate calibration during training of multivariate distributional regression models using pre-rank functions. We further introduce a novel PCA-based pre-rank that projects predictions onto principal directions of the predictive distribution. Through simulation studies and experiments on 18 real-world multi-output regression datasets, we show that the proposed approach substantially improves multivariate pre-rank calibration without compromising predictive accuracy, and that the PCA pre-rank reveals dependence-structure misspecifications that are not detected by existing pre-ranks.

*Viktor Andonovikj,Sašo Džeroski,Pavle Boškoski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Bayesian decision tree model combines oblique splits and Gaussian Process (GP) predictors in leaves to improve regression performance, especially for extrapolation and uncertainty calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decision trees struggle with reliable extrapolation and uncertainty calibration in regression tasks, limiting their effectiveness under distribution shifts.

Method: The proposed model integrates Bayesian oblique splits for uncertainty-aware partitioning and GP predictors in leaves for local functional modeling. It includes efficient inference using posterior sampling and a gating mechanism for GP-based extrapolation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate enhanced predictive performance over standard variational oblique trees and significant gains in extrapolation scenarios.

Conclusion: The Bayesian approach with GP predictors effectively addresses limitations of traditional decision trees in regression tasks.

Abstract: Decision trees are widely used due to their interpretability and efficiency, but they struggle in regression tasks that require reliable extrapolation and well-calibrated uncertainty. Piecewise-constant leaf predictions are bounded by the training targets and often become overconfident under distribution shift. We propose a single-tree Bayesian model that extends VSPYCT by equipping each leaf with a GP predictor. Bayesian oblique splits provide uncertainty-aware partitioning of the input space, while GP leaves model local functional behaviour and enable principled extrapolation beyond the observed target range. We present an efficient inference and prediction scheme that combines posterior sampling of split parameters with \gls{gp} posterior predictions, and a gating mechanism that activates GP-based extrapolation when inputs fall outside the training support of a leaf. Experiments on benchmark regression tasks show improvements in the predictive performance compared to standard variational oblique trees, and substantial performance gains in extrapolation scenarios.

### [324] [Stabilizing the Q-Gradient Field for Policy Smoothness in Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22970)
*Jeong Woon Lee,Kyoleen Kwak,Daeho Kim,Hyoseok Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAVE introduces a critic-centric regularization framework to stabilize policy oscillations by addressing the root cause in the critic's geometry, avoiding direct policy regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods enforce smoothness by directly regularizing policy outputs, which treats symptoms rather than underlying causes linked to the critic's differential geometry.

Method: PAVE minimizes Q-gradient volatility while preserving local curvature, treating the critic as a scalar field to stabilize the action-gradient field without modifying the actor.

Result: PAVE achieves smoothness and robustness comparable to policy-side methods while maintaining competitive task performance.

Conclusion: Critic-centric regularization via PAVE effectively addresses policy non-smoothness by targeting the critic's geometry, offering a principled alternative to direct policy regularization.

Abstract: Policies learned via continuous actor-critic methods often exhibit erratic, high-frequency oscillations, making them unsuitable for physical deployment. Current approaches attempt to enforce smoothness by directly regularizing the policy's output. We argue that this approach treats the symptom rather than the cause. In this work, we theoretically establish that policy non-smoothness is fundamentally governed by the differential geometry of the critic. By applying implicit differentiation to the actor-critic objective, we prove that the sensitivity of the optimal policy is bounded by the ratio of the Q-function's mixed-partial derivative (noise sensitivity) to its action-space curvature (signal distinctness). To empirically validate this theoretical insight, we introduce PAVE (Policy-Aware Value-field Equalization), a critic-centric regularization framework that treats the critic as a scalar field and stabilizes its induced action-gradient field. PAVE rectifies the learning signal by minimizing the Q-gradient volatility while preserving local curvature. Experimental results demonstrate that PAVE achieves smoothness and robustness comparable to policy-side smoothness regularization methods, while maintaining competitive task performance, without modifying the actor.

### [325] [FlexLoRA: Entropy-Guided Flexible Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22905)
*Muqing Liu,Chongjie Si,Yuheng Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlexLoRA introduces an entropy-guided framework for flexible low-rank adaptation, improving upon LoRA by enabling dynamic rank allocation, addressing granularity, flexibility, and stability limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fixed-rank design of LoRA limits flexibility, and existing dynamic rank allocation methods rely on heuristics without distinguishing matrices or expanding capacity where needed.

Method: FlexLoRA uses spectral energy entropy to evaluate matrix importance, supports dynamic rank pruning and expansion under a global budget, and initializes new singular directions with zero impact for stability.

Result: FlexLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: FlexLoRA offers a principled and flexible solution for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable success across diverse domains, yet fully fine-tuning incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has thus become a mainstream paradigm. Among them, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) introduces trainable low-rank matrices and shows strong performance, nevertheless, its fixed-rank design limits flexibility. Dynamic rank allocation methods mitigate this issue by pruning redundant directions; however, they often rely on heuristic, element-level metrics that globally sort rank directions without matrix-wise distinction, and they lack mechanisms to expand capacity in layers requiring additional adaptation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexLoRA, an entropy-guided flexible low-rank adaptation framework that (i) evaluates matrix importance via spectral energy entropy, (ii) supports rank pruning and expansion under a global budget, and (iii) employs zero-impact initialization for newly added singular directions to ensure stability. By addressing granularity, flexibility, and stability limitations, FlexLoRA provides a more principled solution for PEFT. Extensive experiments show that FlexLoRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across benchmarks. Codes are available at https://github.com/Chongjie-Si/Subspace-Tuning.

### [326] [DC-LA: Difference-of-Convex Langevin Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22932)
*Hoang Phuc Hau Luu,Zhongjian Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DC-LA, a proximal Langevin algorithm for sampling from a target distribution with non-smooth DC regularizers. It generalizes prior work and demonstrates effectiveness in synthetic and real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to sample from a target distribution involving a smooth data fidelity term and a non-smooth DC regularizer, addressing limitations in non-log-concave sampling.

Method: The method smoothens the DC regularizer using Moreau envelopes, redistributes the concave part to the data fidelity, and applies a proximal Langevin algorithm (DC-LA).

Result: DC-LA converges to the target distribution (up to errors) in the q-Wasserstein distance under distant dissipative assumptions, outperforming previous non-log-concave sampling methods.

Conclusion: DC-LA provides a general and effective framework for sampling with non-smooth DC regularizers, validated by synthetic and real-world experiments.

Abstract: We study a sampling problem whose target distribution is $π\propto \exp(-f-r)$ where the data fidelity term $f$ is Lipschitz smooth while the regularizer term $r=r_1-r_2$ is a non-smooth difference-of-convex (DC) function, i.e., $r_1,r_2$ are convex. By leveraging the DC structure of $r$, we can smooth out $r$ by applying Moreau envelopes to $r_1$ and $r_2$ separately. In line of DC programming, we then redistribute the concave part of the regularizer to the data fidelity and study its corresponding proximal Langevin algorithm (termed DC-LA). We establish convergence of DC-LA to the target distribution $π$, up to discretization and smoothing errors, in the $q$-Wasserstein distance for all $q \in \mathbb{N}^*$, under the assumption that $V$ is distant dissipative. Our results improve previous work on non-log-concave sampling in terms of a more general framework and assumptions. Numerical experiments show that DC-LA produces accurate distributions in synthetic settings and reliably provides uncertainty quantification in a real-world Computed Tomography application.

*Xiang Wu,Rong-Hua Li,Xunkai Li,Kangfei Zhao,Hongchao Qin,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STPGC introduces scalable methods for graph coarsening that preserve topological features, addressing time complexity issues while maintaining GNN performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph coarsening methods either preserve spectral or spatial characteristics but struggle with exponential time complexity when preserving topological features.

Method: STPGC uses graph strong collapse and edge collapse concepts, introducing three algorithms (GStrongCollapse, GEdgeCollapse, NeighborhoodConing) to eliminate dominated nodes/edges while preserving topology. It also includes approximate algorithms for faster GNN training.

Result: Experiments show STPGC effectively preserves GNN receptive fields and improves training efficiency for node classification tasks.

Conclusion: STPGC offers a scalable, topology-preserving solution for graph coarsening, enhancing GNN performance without excessive computational cost.

Abstract: Graph coarsening reduces the size of a graph while preserving certain properties. Most existing methods preserve either spectral or spatial characteristics. Recent research has shown that preserving topological features helps maintain the predictive performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on the coarsened graph but suffers from exponential time complexity. To address these problems, we propose Scalable Topology-Preserving Graph Coarsening (STPGC) by introducing the concepts of graph strong collapse and graph edge collapse extended from algebraic topology. STPGC comprises three new algorithms, GStrongCollapse, GEdgeCollapse, and NeighborhoodConing based on these two concepts, which eliminate dominated nodes and edges while rigorously preserving topological features. We further prove that STPGC preserves the GNN receptive field and develop approximate algorithms to accelerate GNN training. Experiments on node classification with GNNs demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of STPGC.

*Yufei Gu,Zeke Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mano is a novel optimizer bridging the gap between manifold optimization and modern optimizers like AdamW and Muon, offering better performance with less memory and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimizers like AdamW and Muon have limitations—AdamW ignores structural properties, and Muon loses curvature information. Manifold optimization methods are underused due to poor large-scale performance.

Method: Mano projects momentum onto the tangent space of model parameters and constrains it on a rotational Oblique manifold, addressing previous optimizers' shortcomings.

Result: Mano outperforms AdamW and Muon on LLaMA and Qwen3 models with lower memory and computational demands.

Conclusion: Mano expands the Pareto frontier in space and time efficiency, proving manifold optimization's potential for LLMs.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, the hardware and computational costs for training LLMs are also significantly burdensome. Among the state-of-the-art optimizers, AdamW relies on diagonal curvature estimates and ignores structural properties, while Muon applies global spectral normalization at the expense of losing curvature information. In this study, we restriked manifold optimization methods for training LLMs, which may address both optimizers' limitations, while conventional manifold optimization methods have been largely overlooked due to the poor performance in large-scale model optimization. By innovatively projecting the momentum onto the tangent space of model parameters and constraining it on a rotational Oblique manifold, we propose a novel, powerful, and efficient optimizer **Mano** that is the first to bridge the performance gap between manifold optimization and modern optimizers. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen3 models demonstrate that Mano consistently and significantly outperforms AdamW and Muon even with less memory consumption and computational complexity, respectively, suggesting an expanded Pareto frontier in terms of space and time efficiency.

*Wang Yuanchao,Lai Zhao-Rong,Zhong Tianqi,Li Fengnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ECTR, a framework combining environment-level invariance and sample-level robustness to address mixed distribution shifts in OOD generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRM methods focus on environment-level spurious correlations but ignore sample-level heterogeneity, limiting OOD performance. The authors aim to address both types of shifts simultaneously.

Method: ECTR integrates TV-based invariant learning with environment-conditioned tail reweighting. It also handles unlabeled environments via a minimax latent environment inference.

Result: Experiments across benchmarks show consistent improvements in worst-environment and average OOD performance.

Conclusion: ECTR effectively addresses mixed distribution shifts by combining environment-level invariance with sample-level robustness, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains challenging when models simultaneously encounter correlation shifts across environments and diversity shifts driven by rare or hard samples. Existing invariant risk minimization (IRM) methods primarily address spurious correlations at the environment level, but often overlook sample-level heterogeneity within environments, which can critically impact OOD performance. In this work, we propose \emph{Environment-Conditioned Tail Reweighting for Total Variation Invariant Risk Minimization} (ECTR), a unified framework that augments TV-based invariant learning with environment-conditioned tail reweighting to jointly address both types of distribution shift. By integrating environment-level invariance with within-environment robustness, the proposed approach makes these two mechanisms complementary under mixed distribution shifts. We further extend the framework to scenarios without explicit environment annotations by inferring latent environments through a minimax formulation. Experiments across regression, tabular, time-series, and image classification benchmarks under mixed distribution shifts demonstrate consistent improvements in both worst-environment and average OOD performance.

*Xinchen Han,Qiuyang Fang,Hossam Afifi,Michel Marot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CCI unifies three RL constraint families into a single framework with an interpolation parameter, enabling smoother transitions and combinations. ACPO adapts this parameter practically, leading to state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing offline RL methods use disjoint constraint families without a unified principle, limiting understanding of their connections and trade-offs. The aim is to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposes Continuous Constraint Interpolation (CCI) for a unified constraint spectrum and Automatic Constraint Policy Optimization (ACPO) for adaptive interpolation.

Result: Achieves robust performance gains on D4RL and NeoRL2 benchmarks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: CCI and ACPO provide a principled, adaptive approach to offline RL constraints, unifying disparate methods and improving performance.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) relies on policy constraints to mitigate extrapolation error, where both the constraint form and constraint strength critically shape performance. However, most existing methods commit to a single constraint family: weighted behavior cloning, density regularization, or support constraints, without a unified principle that explains their connections or trade-offs. In this work, we propose Continuous Constraint Interpolation (CCI), a unified optimization framework in which these three constraint families arise as special cases along a common constraint spectrum. The CCI framework introduces a single interpolation parameter that enables smooth transitions and principled combinations across constraint types. Building on CCI, we develop Automatic Constraint Policy Optimization (ACPO), a practical primal--dual algorithm that adapts the interpolation parameter via a Lagrangian dual update. Moreover, we establish a maximum-entropy performance difference lemma and derive performance lower bounds for both the closed-form optimal policy and its parametric projection. Experiments on D4RL and NeoRL2 demonstrate robust gains across diverse domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance overall.

*Dhruv Sarkar,Nishant Pandey,Sayak Ray Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces optimal Nash regret bounds for linear bandits and generalizes fairness metrics using a new framework called FairLinBandit, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address suboptimality in Nash regret bounds for linear bandits and generalize fairness objectives with a unifying framework.

Method: Proposes FairLinBandit, a meta-algorithm compatible with existing linear bandit strategies, instantiated with Phased Elimination and Upper Confidence Bound.

Result: Achieves order-optimal Nash regret bounds and sublinear p-means regret across p values, validated by experiments on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The FairLinBandit framework effectively resolves suboptimality issues and generalizes fairness objectives, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Nash regret has recently emerged as a principled fairness-aware performance metric for stochastic multi-armed bandits, motivated by the Nash Social Welfare objective. Although this notion has been extended to linear bandits, existing results suffer from suboptimality in ambient dimension $d$, stemming from proof techniques that rely on restrictive concentration inequalities. In this work, we resolve this open problem by introducing new analytical tools that yield an order-optimal Nash regret bound in linear bandits. Beyond Nash regret, we initiate the study of $p$-means regret in linear bandits, a unifying framework that interpolates between fairness and utility objectives and strictly generalizes Nash regret. We propose a generic algorithmic framework, FairLinBandit, that works as a meta-algorithm on top of any linear bandit strategy. We instantiate this framework using two bandit algorithms: Phased Elimination and Upper Confidence Bound, and prove that both achieve sublinear $p$-means regret for the entire range of $p$. Extensive experiments on linear bandit instances generated from real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform the existing state-of-the-art baseline.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of inter-subject variability and the impracticality of high-density sensor arrays in myoelectric prostheses.

Method: Uses a Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE) for temporal feature extraction from raw sEMG signals and employs few-shot transfer learning and incremental learning for adaptability.

Result: Achieved 94.3% F1-score for a 6-class gesture set and improved unseen subject performance to 92.3% with minimal calibration data. Expanded to a 10-class set with a 90.0% F1-score.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, efficient solution for affordable and adaptive prosthetic systems with minimal sensor and computational overhead.

Abstract: Reliable control of myoelectric prostheses is often hindered by high inter-subject variability and the clinical impracticality of high-density sensor arrays. This study proposes a deep learning framework for accurate gesture recognition using only two surface electromyography (sEMG) channels. The method employs a Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE) to extract temporal feature representations directly from raw signals, eliminating the need for heuristic feature engineering. On a 6-class gesture set, our model achieved a multi-subject F1-score of 94.3% $\pm$ 0.3%. To address subject-specific differences, we present a few-shot transfer learning protocol that improved performance on unseen subjects from a baseline of 35.1% $\pm$ 3.1% to 92.3% $\pm$ 0.9% with minimal calibration data. Furthermore, the system supports functional extensibility through an incremental learning strategy, allowing for expansion to a 10-class set with a 90.0% $\pm$ 0.2% F1-score without full model retraining. By combining high precision with minimal computational and sensor overhead, this framework provides a scalable and efficient approach for the next generation of affordable and adaptive prosthetic systems.

TL;DR: The paper identifies Premature Mode Collapse in differentiable matching layers and proposes Efficient PH-ASC, an adaptive scheduling algorithm, to stabilize inference by decoupling spectral diagnostics from training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The instability in recovering discrete permutations via annealing in entropy-regularized Optimal Transport motivates the need for a robust solution to avoid spurious local basins.

Method: The authors analyze the Sinkhorn fixed-point map dynamics, identify a thermodynamic speed limit, and introduce Efficient PH-ASC, an algorithm enforcing linear stability law to reduce overhead.

Result: Efficient PH-ASC reduces computational overhead from O(N^3) to amortized O(1) while maintaining stability in the inference process.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive scheduling algorithm effectively addresses instability issues in differentiable matching layers, improving inference efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Differentiable matching layers, often implemented via entropy-regularized Optimal Transport, serve as a critical approximate inference mechanism in structural prediction. However, recovering discrete permutations via annealing $ε\to 0$ is notoriously unstable. We identify a fundamental mechanism for this failure: \textbf{Premature Mode Collapse}. By analyzing the non-normal dynamics of the Sinkhorn fixed-point map, we reveal a theoretical \textbf{thermodynamic speed limit}. Under standard exponential cooling, the shift in the target posterior ($O(1)$) outpaces the contraction rate of the inference operator, which degrades as $O(1/ε)$. This mismatch inevitably forces the inference trajectory into spurious local basins. To address this, we propose \textbf{Efficient PH-ASC}, an adaptive scheduling algorithm that monitors the stability of the inference process. By enforcing a linear stability law, we decouple expensive spectral diagnostics from the training loop, reducing overhead from $O(N^3)$ to amortized $O(1)$. Our implementation and interactive demo are available at https://github.com/xxx0438/torch-sinkhorn-asc and https://huggingface.co/spaces/leon0923/torch-sinkhorn-asc-demo. bounded away from zero in generic training dynamics unless the feature extractor converges unrealistically fast.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A density-aware conditional graph generation framework using Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) is proposed to improve realistic graph generation by replacing random edge sampling with a learnable edge predictor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph generation methods struggle with capturing complex structural dependencies due to reliance on random edge sampling, limiting their ability to model real-world graph connectivity patterns.

Method: The framework embeds nodes into a latent space where proximity indicates edge likelihood, uses a differentiable edge predictor for pairwise relationships, and employs a density-aware selection mechanism to match real-world sparsity distributions. It trains using WGAN with gradient penalty and a GCN-based critic.

Result: Experiments show the method generates graphs with superior structural coherence and class-consistent connectivity, closely matching real-world density and topology.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves training stability and controllability, making it effective for realistic graph generation and data augmentation.

Abstract: Generating realistic graph-structured data is challenging due to discrete structures, variable sizes, and class-specific connectivity patterns that resist conventional generative modelling. While recent graph generation methods employ generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks to handle permutation invariance and irregular topologies, they typically rely on random edge sampling with fixed probabilities, limiting their capacity to capture complex structural dependencies between nodes. We propose a density-aware conditional graph generation framework using Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) that replaces random sampling with a learnable distance-based edge predictor. Our approach embeds nodes into a latent space where proximity correlates with edge likelihood, enabling the generator to learn meaningful connectivity patterns. A differentiable edge predictor determines pairwise relationships directly from node embeddings, while a density-aware selection mechanism adaptively controls edge density to match class-specific sparsity distributions observed in real graphs. We train the model using a WGAN with gradient penalty, employing a GCN-based critic to ensure generated graphs exhibit realistic topology and align with target class distributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method produces graphs with superior structural coherence and class-consistent connectivity compared to existing baselines. The learned edge predictor captures complex relational patterns beyond simple heuristics, generating graphs whose density and topology closely match real structural distributions. Our results show improved training stability and controllable synthesis, making the framework effective for realistic graph generation and data augmentation.

Motivation: To exploit the sensitivity of dLLMs to unmasking order as a new channel for watermarking, enabling detection without altering the model's learned probabilities.

Method: Steers unmasking order toward positions where high-reward tokens meet a parity constraint from a binary hash, compatible with common decoding strategies and strengthened by lookahead.

Result: Achieves watermark detection via elevated parity-matching statistics, robust against insertion, deletion, substitution, and paraphrasing.

Conclusion: dgMARK offers a practical, plug-and-play watermarking solution for dLLMs, resilient to post-editing and adaptable to various decoding strategies.

Abstract: We propose dgMARK, a decoding-guided watermarking method for discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs). Unlike autoregressive models, dLLMs can generate tokens in arbitrary order. While an ideal conditional predictor would be invariant to this order, practical dLLMs exhibit strong sensitivity to the unmasking order, creating a new channel for watermarking. dgMARK steers the unmasking order toward positions whose high-reward candidate tokens satisfy a simple parity constraint induced by a binary hash, without explicitly reweighting the model's learned probabilities. The method is plug-and-play with common decoding strategies (e.g., confidence, entropy, and margin-based ordering) and can be strengthened with a one-step lookahead variant. Watermarks are detected via elevated parity-matching statistics, and a sliding-window detector ensures robustness under post-editing operations including insertion, deletion, substitution, and paraphrasing.

*Rohan Tangri,Jan-Peter Calliess*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VaR-CPO is a sample-efficient, conservative algorithm for optimizing Value-at-Risk constraints, ensuring zero violations during training in feasible environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for safe exploration in policy optimization by directly optimizing VaR constraints, which baseline methods fail to uphold.

Method: Uses the one-sided Chebyshev inequality for a tractable surrogate of the VaR constraint and extends the trust-region framework of CPO for rigorous bounds.

Result: Achieves zero constraint violations during training in feasible environments and provides worst-case bounds for policy improvement and constraint violation.

Conclusion: VaR-CPO is a robust method for safe policy optimization with guaranteed performance and safety.

Abstract: We introduce the Value-at-Risk Constrained Policy Optimization algorithm (VaR-CPO), a sample efficient and conservative method designed to optimize Value-at-Risk (VaR) constraints directly. Empirically, we demonstrate that VaR-CPO is capable of safe exploration, achieving zero constraint violations during training in feasible environments, a critical property that baseline methods fail to uphold. To overcome the inherent non-differentiability of the VaR constraint, we employ the one-sided Chebyshev inequality to obtain a tractable surrogate based on the first two moments of the cost return. Additionally, by extending the trust-region framework of the Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO) method, we provide rigorous worst-case bounds for both policy improvement and constraint violation during the training process.

*Joao Fonseca,Julia Stoyanovich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ExplainerPFN, a zero-shot method for estimating Shapley values without accessing the model or explanations, achieving competitive performance with few-shot approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of Shapley value computation, such as requiring model access or being computationally expensive, the paper explores zero-shot estimation.

Method: ExplainerPFN, a tabular foundation model pretrained on synthetic datasets using structural causal models and Shapley values, predicts feature attributions without model access.

Result: ExplainerPFN achieves high fidelity to SHAP values with minimal reference observations and performs competitively with few-shot surrogate explainers.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the feasibility of zero-shot Shapley value estimation, providing a practical solution for interpretability without model access.

Abstract: Computing the importance of features in supervised classification tasks is critical for model interpretability. Shapley values are a widely used approach for explaining model predictions, but require direct access to the underlying model, an assumption frequently violated in real-world deployments. Further, even when model access is possible, their exact computation may be prohibitively expensive. We investigate whether meaningful Shapley value estimations can be obtained in a zero-shot setting, using only the input data distribution and no evaluations of the target model. To this end, we introduce ExplainerPFN, a tabular foundation model built on TabPFN that is pretrained on synthetic datasets generated from random structural causal models and supervised using exact or near-exact Shapley values. Once trained, ExplainerPFN predicts feature attributions for unseen tabular datasets without model access, gradients, or example explanations.
  Our contributions are fourfold: (1) we show that few-shot learning-based explanations can achieve high fidelity to SHAP values with as few as two reference observations; (2) we propose ExplainerPFN, the first zero-shot method for estimating Shapley values without access to the underlying model or reference explanations; (3) we provide an open-source implementation of ExplainerPFN, including the full training pipeline and synthetic data generator; and (4) through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we show that ExplainerPFN achieves performance competitive with few-shot surrogate explainers that rely on 2-10 SHAP examples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals that models trained on short horizons, combined with the proposed Evolutionary Forecasting (EF) paradigm, outperform those trained on long horizons, addressing optimization issues in Direct Forecasting (DF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency and optimization problems in the Direct Forecasting (DF) paradigm, which requires re-training for every target horizon and suffers from conflicting gradients.

Method: The authors propose the Evolutionary Forecasting (EF) paradigm, which mitigates optimization pathologies by training models on short horizons and evolving predictions.

Result: Experiments show that EF models outperform DF models, even surpassing task-specific DF ensembles, and demonstrate robust stability in extreme extrapolation.

Conclusion: The work advocates a shift from passive Static Mapping (DF) to autonomous Evolutionary Reasoning (EF) in Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF).

Abstract: The prevailing Direct Forecasting (DF) paradigm dominates Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) by forcing models to predict the entire future horizon in a single forward pass. While efficient, this rigid coupling of output and evaluation horizons necessitates computationally prohibitive re-training for every target horizon. In this work, we uncover a counter-intuitive optimization anomaly: models trained on short horizons-when coupled with our proposed Evolutionary Forecasting (EF) paradigm-significantly outperform those trained directly on long horizons. We attribute this success to the mitigation of a fundamental optimization pathology inherent in DF, where conflicting gradients from distant futures cripple the learning of local dynamics. We establish EF as a unified generative framework, proving that DF is merely a degenerate special case of EF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a singular EF model surpasses task-specific DF ensembles across standard benchmarks and exhibits robust asymptotic stability in extreme extrapolation. This work propels a paradigm shift in LTSF: moving from passive Static Mapping to autonomous Evolutionary Reasoning.

*Christiaan P. Opperman,Anna S. Bosman,Katherine M. Malan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines whether regularisation techniques universally improve neural network performance, finding it varies by dataset and method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the common assumption that adding regularisation always enhances neural network generalization.

Method: A taxonomy of regularisation techniques into four categories, followed by empirical testing on ten datasets using MLPs and CNNs.

Result: Regularisation effectiveness is dataset-dependent; some methods work better on numeric data, others on images.

Conclusion: Understanding regularisation's context-specific effects is vital for practical application in machine learning.

Abstract: Despite huge successes on a wide range of tasks, neural networks are known to sometimes struggle to generalise to unseen data. Many approaches have been proposed over the years to promote the generalisation ability of neural networks, collectively known as regularisation techniques. These are used as common practice under the assumption that any regularisation added to the pipeline would result in a performance improvement. In this study, we investigate whether this assumption holds in practice. First, we provide a broad review of regularisation techniques, including modern theories such as double descent. We propose a taxonomy of methods under four broad categories, namely: (1) data-based strategies, (2) architecture strategies, (3) training strategies, and (4) loss function strategies. Notably, we highlight the contradictions and correspondences between the approaches in these broad classes. Further, we perform an empirical comparison of the various regularisation techniques on classification tasks for ten numerical and image datasets applied to the multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network architectures. Results show that the efficacy of regularisation is dataset-dependent. For example, the use of a regularisation term only improved performance on numeric datasets, whereas batch normalisation improved performance on image datasets only. Generalisation is crucial to machine learning; thus, understanding the effects of applying regularisation techniques, and considering the connections between them is essential to the appropriate use of these methods in practice.

*Saeid Jamshidi,Omar Abdul Wahab,Rolando Herrero,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STGAT introduces a framework to detect temporal inconsistencies in IoT devices, outperforming existing models with high accuracy and reduced delay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring time integrity in IoT devices is critical for energy systems like smart grids, but current models fail to address temporal inconsistencies.

Method: STGAT combines drift-aware temporal embeddings, temporal self-attention, and graph attention to model timing errors spatially and temporally.

Result: STGAT achieves 95.7% accuracy and reduces detection delay by 26%, outperforming baselines in handling drift, overflow, and synchronization issues.

Conclusion: STGAT effectively addresses temporal distortions in IoT systems, offering superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: The integrity of time in distributed Internet of Things (IoT) devices is crucial for reliable operation in energy cyber-physical systems, such as smart grids and microgrids. However, IoT systems are vulnerable to clock drift, time-synchronization manipulation, and timestamp discontinuities, such as the Year 2038 (Y2K38) Unix overflow, all of which disrupt temporal ordering. Conventional anomaly-detection models, which assume reliable timestamps, fail to capture temporal inconsistencies. This paper introduces STGAT (Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network), a framework that models both temporal distortion and inter-device consistency in energy IoT systems. STGAT combines drift-aware temporal embeddings and temporal self-attention to capture corrupted time evolution at individual devices, and uses graph attention to model spatial propagation of timing errors. A curvature-regularized latent representation geometrically separates normal clock evolution from anomalies caused by drift, synchronization offsets, and overflow events. Experimental results on energy IoT telemetry with controlled timing perturbations show that STGAT achieves 95.7% accuracy, outperforming recurrent, transformer, and graph-based baselines with significant improvements (d > 1.8, p < 0.001). Additionally, STGAT reduces detection delay by 26%, achieving a 2.3-time-step delay while maintaining stable performance under overflow, drift, and physical inconsistencies.

*Hendrik Suhr,David Kaltenpoth,Jilles Vreeken*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a causal model distinguishing between measurement errors and mechanistic shifts in anomalies, proving their identifiability and proposing a maximum likelihood approach. It outperforms in root cause localization and anomaly classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook that anomalies can arise from measurement errors or fundamental mechanism shifts, necessitating different handling. The paper aims to model and distinguish these anomaly types.

Method: Defines a causal model treating outliers as latent interventions on true and measured variables. Uses maximum likelihood estimation for practical application.

Result: The method matches state-of-the-art performance in root cause localization, accurately classifies anomaly types, and remains robust with unknown causal DAG.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling anomaly types improves root cause analysis and anomaly classification, offering robust performance even without a known causal structure.

Abstract: Root cause analysis of anomalies aims to identify those features that cause the deviation from the normal process. Existing methods ignore, however, that anomalies can arise through two fundamentally different processes: measurement errors, where data was generated normally but one or more values were recorded incorrectly, and mechanism shifts, where the causal process generating the data changed. While measurement errors can often be safely corrected, mechanistic anomalies require careful consideration. We define a causal model that explicitly captures both types by treating outliers as latent interventions on latent ("true") and observed ("measured") variables. We show that they are identifiable, and propose a maximum likelihood estimation approach to put this to practice. Experiments show that our method matches state-of-the-art performance in root cause localization, while it additionally enables accurate classification of anomaly types, and remains robust even when the causal DAG is unknown.

### [342] [On Safer Reinforcement Learning Policies for Sedation and Analgesia in Intensive Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23154)
*Joel Romero-Hernandez,Oscar Camara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning helps optimize pain management in ICU by balancing pain reduction and mortality risks, showing long-term outcomes are crucial for safer policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of balancing pain management and patient safety in ICUs using reinforcement learning, given limitations of prior work.

Method: Implemented a deep reinforcement learning framework to suggest hourly medication doses under partial observability, using MIMIC-IV data.

Result: Policies reducing pain and mortality together showed negative correlation with mortality, unlike those focusing only on pain.

Conclusion: Valuing long-term outcomes like mortality is critical for safer treatment policies, even with a primary short-term goal.

Abstract: Pain management in intensive care usually involves complex trade-offs between therapeutic goals and patient safety, since both inadequate and excessive treatment may induce serious sequelae. Reinforcement learning can help address this challenge by learning medication dosing policies from retrospective data. However, prior work on sedation and analgesia has optimized for objectives that do not value patient survival while relying on algorithms unsuitable for imperfect information settings. We investigated the risks of these design choices by implementing a deep reinforcement learning framework to suggest hourly medication doses under partial observability. Using data from 47,144 ICU stays in the MIMIC-IV database, we trained policies to prescribe opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, and dexmedetomidine according to two goals: reduce pain or jointly reduce pain and mortality. We found that, although the two policies were associated with lower pain, actions from the first policy were positively correlated with mortality, while those proposed by the second policy were negatively correlated. This suggests that valuing long-term outcomes could be critical for safer treatment policies, even if a short-term goal remains the primary objective.

*Arvind Mahankali,Kaiyue Wen,Tengyu Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DC-CoT reduces latency in long CoT reasoning by enabling parallel subtask execution, maintaining accuracy while decreasing longest path length by 35-40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long CoT reasoning in LLMs causes high latency due to sequential generation; DC-CoT aims to mitigate this by parallelizing subtasks.

Method: Train DC-CoT using SFT and multi-stage RL with data filtering to recover accuracy while reducing longest path length.

Result: Achieves similar accuracy to DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview while decreasing longest path length by 35-40%.

Conclusion: DC-CoT effectively balances accuracy and latency in CoT reasoning, offering a scalable solution for LLMs.

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought reasoning (Long CoT) is now fundamental to state-of-the-art LLMs, especially in mathematical reasoning. However, LLM generation is highly sequential, and long CoTs lead to a high latency. We propose to train Divide-and-Conquer CoT (DC-CoT) to reduce the latency. With DC-CoT, the model can act as a director that identifies distinct subtasks that can be performed in parallel in its reasoning process, and then spawns workers to execute the subtasks. Our goal is to achieve high accuracy, with a low longest path length, which is a theoretical measure of the latency needed for the response. We start with a long CoT base model (DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview), and first use SFT with a small curated demonstration set to initialize its ability to spawn workers in a certain format. Because SFT degrades the accuracy significantly, we design a multi-stage RL algorithm, with various data filtering strategies, to recover the accuracy while decreasing the longest path length. Across several benchmarks including AIME 2024 and HMMT 2025, DC-CoT achieves similar accuracy as DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview while decreasing longest path length by 35-40%. Our code, SFT dataset and models are publicly available at https://github.com/amahankali10/DC_CoT_RL_for_Low_Latency_CoT_with_Parallel_Reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPICE, a conflict-aware data selector, improves performance by maximizing information and penalizing gradient misalignment, achieving comparable or better results with only 10% of the data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing gradient conflicts and misalignment between per-sample gradients slows down information decay, which impacts the effectiveness of data selection for instruction tuning.

Method: Proposes SPICE, a selector that maximizes log-determinant information while penalizing gradient misalignment, and supports early stopping and proxy models for efficiency.

Result: SPICE outperforms 6 methods, including full-data tuning, across 8 benchmarks using only 10% of the data, with LLaMA2-7B and Qwen2-7B models.

Conclusion: SPICE achieves significant performance improvements with reduced training costs by optimizing data selection and mitigating gradient conflicts.

Abstract: Information-based data selection for instruction tuning is compelling: maximizing the log-determinant of the Fisher information yields a monotone submodular objective, enabling greedy algorithms to achieve a $(1-1/e)$ approximation under a cardinality budget. In practice, however, we identify alleviating gradient conflicts, misalignment between per-sample gradients, is a key factor that slows down the decay of marginal log-determinant information gains, thereby preventing significant loss of information. We formalize this via an $\varepsilon$-decomposition that quantifies the deviation from ideal submodularity as a function of conflict statistics, yielding data-dependent approximation factors that tighten as conflicts diminish. Guided by this analysis, we propose SPICE, a conflict-aware selector that maximizes information while penalizing misalignment, and that supports early stopping and proxy models for efficiency. Empirically, SPICE selects subsets with higher log-determinant information than original criteria, and these informational gains translate into performance improvements: across 8 benchmarks with LLaMA2-7B and Qwen2-7B, SPICE uses only 10% of the data, yet matches or exceeds 6 methods including full-data tuning. This achieves performance improvements with substantially lower training cost.

*Marthe Ballon,Brecht Verbeken,Vincent Ginis,Andres Algaba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how accuracy and decision commitment evolve in LLMs' reasoning traces, proposing a protocol to truncate and test partial traces. Findings show consistent accuracy gains linked to content relevance, not just length or style, with stronger models better recovering from errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how accuracy and decision commitment develop in LLMs' reasoning traces, and whether intermediate segments add meaningful value beyond superficial effects like length or style.

Method: A protocol involving generating reasoning traces, truncating them at fixed token-percentiles, and injecting partial traces back into models to measure answer-choice distributions. Applied to Qwen3 and gpt-oss models on GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks.

Result: Accuracy and decision commitment rise with more reasoning tokens, driven by content relevance. Stronger models recover better from incorrect traces, but initial answers often stay anchored to weaker models' errors.

Conclusion: Trajectory probing offers practical diagnostics for deploying reasoning models, improving reliability by informing trace-handling policies without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve difficult problems by producing "reasoning traces" before emitting a final response. However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic "reasoning style" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response. More broadly, we show that trajectory probing provides diagnostics for efficient and safer deployment of reasoning models as the measurements can inform practical trace-handling and monitoring policies that improve reliability without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful explanations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DyCAST introduces dynamic character-aligned speech tokenization with variable frame rates, improving efficiency and quality over fixed-frame-rate codecs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural audio codecs use fixed frame rates, leading to unnecessarily long sequences and uniform token allocation. DyCAST aims to optimize this by enabling variable-frame-rate tokenization.

Method: DyCAST employs soft character-level alignment and explicit duration modeling for variable-frame-rate tokenization. It includes retrieval-augmented decoding to enhance resynthesis quality at low frame rates.

Result: DyCAST achieves competitive speech resynthesis quality and downstream performance with fewer tokens compared to fixed-frame-rate codecs.

Conclusion: DyCAST offers a more efficient and flexible approach to speech tokenization, reducing sequence length while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Neural audio codecs are at the core of modern conversational speech technologies, converting continuous speech into sequences of discrete tokens that can be processed by LLMs. However, existing codecs typically operate at fixed frame rates, allocating tokens uniformly in time and producing unnecessarily long sequences. In this work, we introduce DyCAST, a Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenizer that enables variable-frame-rate tokenization through soft character-level alignment and explicit duration modeling. DyCAST learns to associate tokens with character-level linguistic units during training and supports alignment-free inference with direct control over token durations at decoding time. To improve speech resynthesis quality at low frame rates, we further introduce a retrieval-augmented decoding mechanism that enhances reconstruction fidelity without increasing bitrate. Experiments show that DyCAST achieves competitive speech resynthesis quality and downstream performance while using significantly fewer tokens than fixed-frame-rate codecs.

TL;DR: RLRR introduces relative ranking rewards to address limitations of absolute numerical rewards in group-based reinforcement learning, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current group-based methods like GRPO face issues with sparse supervision in verifiable tasks and unstable reward model scores in open-ended scenarios.

Method: Proposes RLRR, a framework using relative rankings instead of absolute scores, and introduces the Ranking Reward Model for group-based optimization.

Result: RLRR outperforms standard baselines in reasoning benchmarks and open-ended generation tasks.

Conclusion: Shifting to relative rankings mitigates sparsity and instability, enhancing reinforcement learning performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become a cornerstone for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, where group-based approaches such as GRPO have emerged as efficient paradigms that optimize policies by leveraging intra-group performance differences. However, these methods typically rely on absolute numerical rewards, introducing intrinsic limitations. In verifiable tasks, identical group evaluations often result in sparse supervision, while in open-ended scenarios, the score range instability of reward models undermines advantage estimation based on group means. To address these limitations, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Relative Rewards (RLRR), a framework that shifts reward shaping from absolute scoring to relative ranking. Complementing this framework, we introduce the Ranking Reward Model, a listwise preference model tailored for group-based optimization to directly generate relative rankings. By transforming raw evaluations into robust relative signals, RLRR effectively mitigates signal sparsity and reward instability. Experimental results demonstrate that RLRR yields consistent performance improvements over standard group-based baselines across reasoning benchmarks and open-ended generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand GNNs' learning capabilities for executing graph algorithms under bounded-degree and finite-precision conditions.

Method: Train MLP ensembles for local node instructions, then integrate them into GNNs for inference, leveraging NTK theory for learnability guarantees.

Result: Shows exact learnability for LOCAL model and algorithms like flooding, BFS, DFS, and Bellman-Ford.

Conclusion: GNNs can learn and execute graph algorithms accurately under specified constraints.

Abstract: Understanding what graph neural networks can learn, especially their ability to learn to execute algorithms, remains a central theoretical challenge. In this work, we prove exact learnability results for graph algorithms under bounded-degree and finite-precision constraints. Our approach follows a two-step process. First, we train an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to execute the local instructions of a single node. Second, during inference, we use the trained MLP ensemble as the update function within a graph neural network (GNN). Leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, we show that local instructions can be learned from a small training set, enabling the complete graph algorithm to be executed during inference without error and with high probability. To illustrate the learning power of our setting, we establish a rigorous learnability result for the LOCAL model of distributed computation. We further demonstrate positive learnability results for widely studied algorithms such as message flooding, breadth-first and depth-first search, and Bellman-Ford.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SplineFlow introduces B-spline interpolation for flow matching in dynamical systems, improving stability and capturing higher-order dynamics better than linear methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flow matching methods struggle with modeling dynamical systems due to unstable linear interpolants and inability to capture complex state evolution.

Method: SplineFlow uses B-spline interpolation to construct stable, smooth conditional paths that meet multi-marginal constraints across observations.

Result: Experiments on deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems, including cellular trajectory inference, show SplineFlow outperforms existing baselines.

Conclusion: SplineFlow provides a robust solution for modeling complex dynamics in flow matching frameworks.

Abstract: Flow matching is a scalable generative framework for characterizing continuous normalizing flows with wide-range applications. However, current state-of-the-art methods are not well-suited for modeling dynamical systems, as they construct conditional paths using linear interpolants that may not capture the underlying state evolution, especially when learning higher-order dynamics from irregular sampled observations. Constructing unified paths that satisfy multi-marginal constraints across observations is challenging, since naïve higher-order polynomials tend to be unstable and oscillatory. We introduce SplineFlow, a theoretically grounded flow matching algorithm that jointly models conditional paths across observations via B-spline interpolation. Specifically, SplineFlow exploits the smoothness and stability of B-spline bases to learn the complex underlying dynamics in a structured manner while ensuring the multi-marginal requirements are met. Comprehensive experiments across various deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems of varying complexity, as well as on cellular trajectory inference tasks, demonstrate the strong improvement of SplineFlow over existing baselines.

TL;DR: Replacing standard Gaussian actors with discretized categorical actors improves performance in continuous control tasks by stabilizing optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard on-policy deep reinforcement learning uses Gaussian actors and shallow MLP policies, which can be brittle under noisy gradients and conservative updates. This paper explores policy representation as a key design choice to address these issues.

Method: Proposes discretized categorical actors representing actions with distributions over bins, resembling cross-entropy loss. Also introduces regularized actor networks while keeping critic design unchanged.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms standard methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse continuous-control benchmarks.

Conclusion: Discretized and regularized actor networks are a promising alternative to Gaussian actors for robust and high-performing continuous control.

Abstract: On-policy deep reinforcement learning remains a dominant paradigm for continuous control, yet standard implementations rely on Gaussian actors and relatively shallow MLP policies, often leading to brittle optimization when gradients are noisy and policy updates must be conservative. In this paper, we revisit policy representation as a first-class design choice for on-policy optimization. We study discretized categorical actors that represent each action dimension with a distribution over bins, yielding a policy objective that resembles a cross-entropy loss. Building on architectural advances from supervised learning, we further propose regularized actor networks, while keeping critic design fixed. Our results show that simply replacing the standard actor network with our discretized regularized actor yields consistent gains and achieve the state-of-the-art performance across diverse continuous-control benchmarks.

*Rajib Mostakim,Reza T. Batley,Sourav Saha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPAN introduces a spline-based adaptive network for RL, improving sample efficiency and success rates over MLPs while maintaining robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep RL often uses inefficient MLPs for function approximation, hindering learning efficiency in resource-constrained settings. SPAN addresses this by combining spline-based architectures with adaptive preprocessing.

Method: SPAN integrates a learnable preprocessing layer with a separable tensor product B-spline basis, adapting the KHRONOS framework. Evaluated in discrete (PPO) and continuous (SAC) control tasks, as well as offline settings.

Result: SPAN achieves 30-50% better sample efficiency and 1.3-9× higher success rates than MLP baselines, with superior anytime performance and hyperparameter robustness.

Conclusion: SPAN is a high-performance, efficient alternative to MLPs for RL in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly deployed in resource-constrained environments, yet the go-to function approximators - multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) - are often parameter-inefficient due to an imperfect inductive bias for the smooth structure of many value functions. This mismatch can also hinder sample efficiency and slow policy learning in this capacity-limited regime. Although model compression techniques exist, they operate post-hoc and do not improve learning efficiency. Recent spline-based separable architectures - such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) - have been shown to offer parameter efficiency but are widely reported to exhibit significant computational overhead, especially at scale.
  In seeking to address these limitations, this work introduces SPAN (SPline-based Adaptive Networks), a novel function approximation approach to RL. SPAN adapts the low rank KHRONOS framework by integrating a learnable preprocessing layer with a separable tensor product B-spline basis. SPAN is evaluated across discrete (PPO) and high-dimensional continuous (SAC) control tasks, as well as offline settings (Minari/D4RL). Empirical results demonstrate that SPAN achieves a 30-50% improvement in sample efficiency and 1.3-9 times higher success rates across benchmarks compared to MLP baselines. Furthermore, SPAN demonstrates superior anytime performance and robustness to hyperparameter variations, suggesting it as a viable, high performance alternative for learning intrinsically efficient policies in resource-limited settings.

*Nisarg Parikh,Kunjal Panchal,Ananya Sai,Pannaga Shivaswamy,Andrew Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CATTO is a calibration-aware objective for LLMs that improves confidence calibration without sacrificing accuracy, outperforming baselines like DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often have poorly calibrated confidence in predictions, exacerbated by preference-based alignment methods.

Method: Introduces CATTO, a token-level training objective aligning predicted confidence with correctness, and Confidence@k for token selection.

Result: Reduces ECE by up to 10.44% and maintains or improves accuracy on multiple-choice datasets.

Conclusion: CATTO enhances calibration and accuracy in LLMs, offering practical improvements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often make accurate next token predictions but their confidence in these predictions can be poorly calibrated: high-confidence predictions are frequently wrong, and low-confidence predictions may be correct. This miscalibration is exacerbated by preference-based alignment methods breaking the link between predictive probability and correctness. We introduce a Calibration Aware Token-level Training Objective (CATTO), a calibration-aware objective that aligns predicted confidence with empirical prediction correctness, which can be combined with the original preference optimization objectives. Empirically, CATTO reduces Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by 2.22%-7.61% in-distribution and 1.46%-10.44% out-of-distribution compared to direct preference optimization (DPO), and by 0.22%-1.24% in-distribution and 1.23%-5.07% out-of-distribution compared to the strongest DPO baseline. This improvement in confidence does not come at a cost of losing task accuracy, where CATTO maintains or slightly improves multiple-choice question-answering accuracy on five datasets. We also introduce Confidence@k, a test-time scaling mechanism leveraging calibrated token probabilities for Bayes-optimal selection of output tokens.

*Aleksandr Zimin,Yury Polyanskiy,Philippe Rigollet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes interpreting transformer layers as optimization steps, linking self-attention and MLPs to gradient updates of energy functions, and introduces an accelerated transformer inspired by optimization theory, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reinterpret transformer layers through an optimization lens, enabling principled architectural improvements by leveraging classical optimization ideas.

Method: The framework treats transformer layers as iterations optimizing token embeddings, with self-attention and MLPs corresponding to gradient steps of interaction and potential energies. An accelerated transformer is introduced using Nesterov-style optimization.

Result: The Nesterov-style transformer outperforms nanoGPT baselines on TinyStories and OpenWebText, showing practical benefits from optimization insights.

Conclusion: Optimization-theoretic perspectives can guide transformer design and improve performance, as evidenced by the success of the accelerated variant.

Abstract: We propose a variational framework that interprets transformer layers as iterations of an optimization algorithm acting on token embeddings. In this view, self-attention implements a gradient step of an interaction energy, while MLP layers correspond to gradient updates of a potential energy. Standard GPT-style transformers emerge as vanilla gradient descent on the resulting composite objective, implemented via Lie--Trotter splitting between these two energy functionals. This perspective enables principled architectural design using classical optimization ideas. As a proof of concept, we introduce a Nesterov-style accelerated transformer that preserves the same attention and MLP oracles. The resulting architecture consistently outperforms a nanoGPT baseline on TinyStories and OpenWebText, demonstrating that optimization-theoretic insights can translate into practical gains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DCR improves ranking model uncertainty quantification by using exact distribution of non-conformity scores, reducing prediction set size by up to 36% without losing coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for ranking model uncertainty quantification are overly conservative, leading to large prediction sets, necessitating a more efficient solution.

Method: Proposes Distribution-informed Conformal Ranking (DCR), which derives exact distribution of non-conformity scores using Negative Hypergeometric distributions for calibration items.

Result: DCR reduces average prediction set size by up to 36% while maintaining valid coverage, outperforming the baseline.

Conclusion: DCR offers a more efficient and reliable solution for uncertainty quantification in ranking models compared to existing conservative methods.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty is critical for the safe deployment of ranking models in real-world applications. Recent work offers a rigorous solution using conformal prediction in a full ranking scenario, which aims to construct prediction sets for the absolute ranks of test items based on the relative ranks of calibration items. However, relying on upper bounds of non-conformity scores renders the method overly conservative, resulting in substantially large prediction sets. To address this, we propose Distribution-informed Conformal Ranking (DCR), which produces efficient prediction sets by deriving the exact distribution of non-conformity scores. In particular, we find that the absolute ranks of calibration items follow Negative Hypergeometric distributions, conditional on their relative ranks. DCR thus uses the rank distribution to derive non-conformity score distribution and determine conformal thresholds. We provide theoretical guarantees that DCR achieves improved efficiency over the baseline while ensuring valid coverage under mild assumptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DCR, reducing average prediction set size by up to 36%, while maintaining valid coverage.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TEON generalizes Muon by extending gradient orthogonalization to higher-order tensors across layers, offering improved convergence and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the Muon optimizer's performance by addressing its limitation of layer-independent gradient orthogonalization.

Method: TEON models gradients as structured higher-order tensors, enabling cross-layer orthogonalization, with a practical implementation backed by theoretical analysis.

Result: TEON improves training and validation perplexity across GPT and LLaMA model scales (130M to 1B parameters) and shows robustness under approximate SVD schemes.

Conclusion: TEON outperforms Muon by achieving better convergence and generalization through structured tensor-based gradient orthogonalization.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has demonstrated strong empirical performance in pre-training large language models by performing matrix-level gradient (or momentum) orthogonalization in each layer independently. In this work, we propose TEON, a principled generalization of Muon that extends orthogonalization beyond individual layers by modeling the gradients of a neural network as a structured higher-order tensor. We present TEON's improved convergence guarantee over layer-wise Muon, and further develop a practical instantiation of TEON based on the theoretical analysis with corresponding ablation. We evaluate our approach on two widely adopted architectures: GPT-style models, ranging from 130M to 774M parameters, and LLaMA-style models, ranging from 60M to 1B parameters. Experimental results show that TEON consistently improves training and validation perplexity across model scales and exhibits strong robustness under various approximate SVD schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models struggle with equality-constrained distributions common in scientific domains. The work aims to address these limitations.

Method: A computationally cheap, mathematically justified perturbation of the data distribution is introduced, preserving manifold geometry while matching ambient space support.

Result: The approach enables consistent data distribution recovery and stable sampling across diffusion models and normalizing flows.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively overcomes pitfalls in equality-constrained generative models, validated by theoretical and empirical results.

Abstract: Generative models have enjoyed widespread success in a variety of applications. However, they encounter inherent mathematical limitations in modeling distributions where samples are constrained by equalities, as is frequently the setting in scientific domains. In this work, we develop a computationally cheap, mathematically justified, and highly flexible distributional modification for combating known pitfalls in equality-constrained generative models. We propose perturbing the data distribution in a constraint-aware way such that the new distribution has support matching the ambient space dimension while still implicitly incorporating underlying manifold geometry. Through theoretical analyses and empirical evidence on several representative tasks, we illustrate that our approach consistently enables data distribution recovery and stable sampling with both diffusion models and normalizing flows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Summarize


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the brittle and incomplete nature of large language model editing by proposing a synthetic data framework, Behemoth, to better understand the relationship between training data and model behavior.

Method: The paper introduces Behemoth, a synthetic data generation framework, and explores model editing efficacy using simple tabular data, revealing insights like restricted update rank effectiveness.

Result: Findings suggest that synthetic data can mirror real-world editing challenges, such as the unexpected effectiveness of restricted update ranks in certain cases.

Conclusion: Synthetic frameworks like Behemoth provide valuable insights into model editing, aiding in understanding and improving real-world applications despite their limitations.

Abstract: As artificial neural networks, and specifically large language models, have improved rapidly in capabilities and quality, they have increasingly been deployed in real-world applications, from customer service to Google search, despite the fact that they frequently make factually incorrect or undesirable statements. This trend has inspired practical and academic interest in model editing, that is, in adjusting the weights of the model to modify its likely outputs for queries relating to a specific fact or set of facts. This may be done either to amend a fact or set of facts, for instance, to fix a frequent error in the training data, or to suppress a fact or set of facts entirely, for instance, in case of dangerous knowledge. Multiple methods have been proposed to do such edits. However, at the same time, it has been shown that such model editing can be brittle and incomplete. Moreover the effectiveness of any model editing method necessarily depends on the data on which the model is trained, and, therefore, a good understanding of the interaction of the training data distribution and the way it is stored in the network is necessary and helpful to reliably perform model editing. However, working with large language models trained on real-world data does not allow us to understand this relationship or fully measure the effects of model editing. We therefore propose Behemoth, a fully synthetic data generation framework. To demonstrate the practical insights from the framework, we explore model editing in the context of simple tabular data, demonstrating surprising findings that, in some cases, echo real-world results, for instance, that in some cases restricting the update rank results in a more effective update.

*Damion Harvey,Geraud Nangue Tasse,Branden Ingram,Benjamin Rosman,Steven James*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised method for skill segmentation and hierarchical structure discovery in reinforcement learning without relying on labeled data or rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for skill segmentation require action labels, rewards, or annotations, limiting their applicability. The paper aims to develop a method that works on unlabeled trajectories.

Method: Uses a grammar-based approach to segment unlabeled trajectories into reusable skills and induces a hierarchical structure over them, capturing low-level behaviors and higher-level compositions.

Result: The method produces structured and semantically meaningful hierarchies, outperforming baselines in skill segmentation, reuse, and hierarchy quality. It also accelerates downstream reinforcement learning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed grammar-based approach effectively discovers hierarchies in unlabeled trajectories, enhancing learning efficiency and stability in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: We consider the problem of unsupervised skill segmentation and hierarchical structure discovery in reinforcement learning. While recent approaches have sought to segment trajectories into reusable skills or options, most rely on action labels, rewards, or handcrafted annotations, limiting their applicability. We propose a method that segments unlabelled trajectories into skills and induces a hierarchical structure over them using a grammar-based approach. The resulting hierarchy captures both low-level behaviours and their composition into higher-level skills. We evaluate our approach in high-dimensional, pixel-based environments, including Craftax and the full, unmodified version of Minecraft. Using metrics for skill segmentation, reuse, and hierarchy quality, we find that our method consistently produces more structured and semantically meaningful hierarchies than existing baselines. Furthermore, as a proof of concept for utility, we demonstrate that these discovered hierarchies accelerate and stabilise learning on downstream reinforcement learning tasks.

*Daniel Ezer,Alon Peled-Cohen,Yishay Mansour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores stochastic linear bandits with parameter noise, providing tight regret bounds and showing a simple explore-exploit algorithm achieves them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify regret in stochastic linear bandits under parameter noise, emphasizing variance-dependent bounds.

Method: Analyzes regret bounds for general action sets and specific sets like ℓ_p unit balls, using theoretical proofs.

Result: Upper bound of Õ(√(dT log(K/δ) σ²ₘₐₓ)) and lower bound of Ω̃(d√(T σ²ₘₐₓ)), tight for log(K)≈d. For ℓ_p balls, minimax regret is Θ̃(√(dT σ²_q)).

Conclusion: Regret bounds depend on reward variance; simple algorithms can achieve optimal performance for certain action sets.

Abstract: We study the stochastic linear bandits with parameter noise model, in which the reward of action $a$ is $a^\top θ$ where $θ$ is sampled i.i.d. We show a regret upper bound of $\widetilde{O} (\sqrt{d T \log (K/δ) σ^2_{\max})}$ for a horizon $T$, general action set of size $K$ of dimension $d$, and where $σ^2_{\max}$ is the maximal variance of the reward for any action. We further provide a lower bound of $\widetildeΩ (d \sqrt{T σ^2_{\max}})$ which is tight (up to logarithmic factors) whenever $\log (K) \approx d$. For more specific action sets, $\ell_p$ unit balls with $p \leq 2$ and dual norm $q$, we show that the minimax regret is $\widetildeΘ (\sqrt{dT σ^2_q)}$, where $σ^2_q$ is a variance-dependent quantity that is always at most $4$. This is in contrast to the minimax regret attainable for such sets in the classic additive noise model, where the regret is of order $d \sqrt{T}$. Surprisingly, we show that this optimal (up to logarithmic factors) regret bound is attainable using a very simple explore-exploit algorithm.

TL;DR: Proposes a Transformer-based mechanism for handling interchangeable tokens, improving generalization to unseen symbols with parallel embedding streams and aggregated attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural architectures lack principled handling of interchangeable tokens (e.g., bound variables), limiting generalization to new symbols despite unchanged semantics.

Method: Introduces parallel embedding streams to isolate interchangeable tokens and an aggregated attention mechanism for structured information sharing.

Result: Experimental results validate the method's theoretical guarantees and show significant performance gains on open-vocabulary tasks with novel symbols.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism effectively addresses invariance to interchangeable tokens, enhancing generalization in neural models.

Abstract: Current neural architectures lack a principled way to handle interchangeable tokens, i.e., symbols that are semantically equivalent yet distinguishable, such as bound variables. As a result, models trained on fixed vocabularies often struggle to generalize to unseen symbols, even when the underlying semantics remain unchanged. We propose a novel Transformer-based mechanism that is provably invariant to the renaming of interchangeable tokens. Our approach employs parallel embedding streams to isolate the contribution of each interchangeable token in the input, combined with an aggregated attention mechanism that enables structured information sharing across streams. Experimental results confirm the theoretical guarantees of our method and demonstrate substantial performance gains on open-vocabulary tasks that require generalization to novel symbols.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present MeshGraphNet-Transformer (MGN-T), a novel architecture that combines the global modeling capabilities of Transformers with the geometric inductive bias of MeshGraphNets, while preserving a mesh-based graph representation. MGN-T overcomes a key limitation of standard MGN, the inefficient long-range information propagation caused by iterative message passing on large, high-resolution meshes. A physics-attention Transformer serves as a global processor, updating all nodal states simultaneously while explicitly retaining node and edge attributes. By directly capturing long-range physical interactions, MGN-T eliminates the need for deep message-passing stacks or hierarchical, coarsened meshes, enabling efficient learning on high-resolution meshes with varying geometries, topologies, and boundary conditions at an industrial scale.
  We demonstrate that MGN-T successfully handles industrial-scale meshes for impact dynamics, a setting in which standard MGN fails due message-passing under-reaching. The method accurately models self-contact, plasticity, and multivariate outputs, including internal, phenomenological plastic variables. Moreover, MGN-T outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on classical benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining practical efficiency, using only a fraction of the parameters required by competing baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving inference efficiency in LLMs by addressing the verification cost bottleneck in speculative decoding, which current methods overlook.

Method: Introduces TriSpec, a ternary SD framework with a lightweight proxy to approve easy drafts and engage the full model for uncertain tokens, compatible with existing SD methods like EAGLE-3.

Result: Achieves up to 35% speedup over standard SD and reduces target model invocations by 50% while maintaining comparable accuracy, tested on Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen/LLaMA models.

Conclusion: TriSpec effectively advances SD by optimizing verification costs, offering significant efficiency gains without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Inference efficiency in Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by their serial, autoregressive generation, especially as reasoning becomes a key capability and response sequences grow longer. Speculative decoding (SD) offers a powerful solution, providing significant speed-ups through its lightweight drafting and parallel verification mechanism. While existing work has nearly saturated improvements in draft effectiveness and efficiency, this paper advances SD from a new yet critical perspective: the verification cost. We propose TriSpec, a novel ternary SD framework that, at its core, introduces a lightweight proxy to significantly reduce computational cost by approving easily verifiable draft sequences and engaging the full target model only when encountering uncertain tokens. TriSpec can be integrated with state-of-the-art SD methods like EAGLE-3 to further reduce verification costs, achieving greater acceleration. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen/LLaMA families show that TriSpec achieves up to 35\% speedup over standard SD, with up to 50\% fewer target model invocations while maintaining comparable accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper explores Weight Space Learning (WSL) using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to map data semantics into network weights, leveraging the Implicit Function Theorem (IFT) for theoretical rigor. It achieves competitive performance in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to provide a theoretical foundation for how data semantics are encoded into neural network weights, addressing a gap in the emerging field of WSL.

Method: The authors use the Implicit Function Theorem (IFT) to rigorously map data space to latent weight representation space, employing a hypernetwork to map embeddings to INR weights.

Result: The framework achieves performance competitive with existing baselines on downstream classification tasks across 2D and 3D datasets.

Conclusion: The findings offer a theoretical basis for future research into network weights and their semantic encoding.

Abstract: Weight Space Learning (WSL), which frames neural network weights as a data modality, is an emerging field with potential for tasks like meta-learning or transfer learning. Particularly, Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) provide a convenient testbed, where each set of weights determines the corresponding individual data sample as a mapping from coordinates to contextual values. So far, a precise theoretical explanation for the mechanism of encoding semantics of data into network weights is still missing. In this work, we deploy the Implicit Function Theorem (IFT) to establish a rigorous mapping between the data space and its latent weight representation space. We analyze a framework that maps instance-specific embeddings to INR weights via a shared hypernetwork, achieving performance competitive with existing baselines on downstream classification tasks across 2D and 3D datasets. These findings offer a theoretical lens for future investigations into network weights.

TL;DR: The paper explores the link between traffic intensity and air pollution in Mexico City, proposing a method to improve hyper-local air quality forecasts using innovative traffic data representation and Partial Least Squares Regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution is a critical urban issue, with vehicular traffic being a significant contributor. Current air quality data is often coarse-grained, while traffic data is finer and more accessible. This study aims to leverage traffic data for better air quality predictions.

Method: The study transforms colour-coded traffic maps into concentric ring-based descriptions to better represent traffic conditions. It uses Partial Least Squares Regression to predict pollution levels based on these transformed traffic intensities, optimizing the model with various training samples.

Result: The optimized model provides improved hyper-local, dynamic air quality forecasts by effectively linking traffic intensity measurements with pollutant levels.

Conclusion: The developed workflow is adaptable to other cities, offering a practical solution for enhancing air quality forecasts using readily available traffic data.

Abstract: Air pollution is a chronic problem in large cities worldwide and awareness is rising as the long-term health implications become clearer. Vehicular traffic has been identified as a major contributor to poor air quality. In a lot of cities the publicly available air quality measurements and forecasts are coarse-grained both in space and time. However, in general, real-time traffic intensity data is openly available in various forms and is fine-grained. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of pollution sensor measurements combined with traffic data from Mexico City. We analyse and model the relationship between traffic intensity and air quality with the aim to provide hyper-local, dynamic air quality forecasts. We developed an innovative method to represent traffic intensities by transforming simple colour-coded traffic maps into concentric ring-based descriptions, enabling improved characterisation of traffic conditions. Using Partial Least Squares Regression, we predict pollution levels based on these newly defined traffic intensities. The model was optimised with various training samples to achieve the best predictive performance and gain insights into the relationship between pollutants and traffic. The workflow we have designed is straightforward and adaptable to other contexts, like other cities beyond the specifics of our dataset.

TL;DR: The paper explores fairness in crowdsourced label aggregation, deriving bounds for Majority Vote and Optimal Bayesian methods, and introduces a post-processing algorithm for strict demographic parity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in crowdsourced aggregation is understudied, lacking convergence guarantees and post-processing methods for enforcing ε-fairness. The paper aims to address these gaps.

Method: Analyzes Majority Vote and Optimal Bayesian aggregation within ε-fairness, derives fairness gap bounds, and generalizes a fairness post-processing algorithm for strict demographic parity.

Result: Shows exponential convergence of fairness gaps to ground-truth fairness and validates effectiveness on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses fairness concerns in crowdsourced aggregation, supported by theoretical and empirical results.

Abstract: As acquiring reliable ground-truth labels is usually costly, or infeasible, crowdsourcing and aggregation of noisy human annotations is the typical resort. Aggregating subjective labels, though, may amplify individual biases, particularly regarding sensitive features, raising fairness concerns. Nonetheless, fairness in crowdsourced aggregation remains largely unexplored, with no existing convergence guarantees and only limited post-processing approaches for enforcing $\varepsilon$-fairness under demographic parity. We address this gap by analyzing the fairness s of crowdsourced aggregation methods within the $\varepsilon$-fairness framework, for Majority Vote and Optimal Bayesian aggregation. In the small-crowd regime, we derive an upper bound on the fairness gap of Majority Vote in terms of the fairness gaps of the individual annotators. We further show that the fairness gap of the aggregated consensus converges exponentially fast to that of the ground-truth under interpretable conditions. Since ground-truth itself may still be unfair, we generalize a state-of-the-art multiclass fairness post-processing algorithm from the continuous to the discrete setting, which enforces strict demographic parity constraints to any aggregation rule. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and corroborate the theoretical insights.

TL;DR: SDG is a diffusion-based framework unifying dynamic graph learning with generative denoising for temporal link prediction, capturing uncertainty and sequential structure better than discriminative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing temporal graph neural networks lack mechanisms to capture uncertainty and sequential structure in future temporal interactions, limiting their predictive capabilities.

Method: SDG introduces a sequence-level diffusion framework with noise injection and conditional denoising, using a cross-attention decoder for reconstruction and end-to-end optimization.

Result: SDG achieves state-of-the-art performance on various temporal graph benchmarks for temporal link prediction.

Conclusion: SDG effectively addresses limitations of existing models by integrating generative denoising, offering improved temporal link prediction.

Abstract: Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a fundamental problem in many real-world systems. Existing temporal graph neural networks mainly focus on learning representations of historical interactions. Despite their strong performance, these models are still purely discriminative, producing point estimates for future links and lacking an explicit mechanism to capture the uncertainty and sequential structure of future temporal interactions. In this paper, we propose SDG, a novel sequence-level diffusion framework that unifies dynamic graph learning with generative denoising. Specifically, SDG injects noise into the entire historical interaction sequence and jointly reconstructs all interaction embeddings through a conditional denoising process, thereby enabling the model to capture more comprehensive interaction distributions. To align the generative process with temporal link prediction, we employ a cross-attention denoising decoder to guide the reconstruction of the destination sequence and optimize the model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on various temporal graph benchmarks show that SDG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the temporal link prediction task.

Motivation: To evaluate generative learning models for solving inverse problems in engineering design, specifically gas turbine combustor design.

Method: Comparison of traditional Bayesian inverse approach (MCMC) with generative models (cGANs, INNs, CFM) using metrics like accuracy, diversity, and dataset size impact.

Result: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) outperforms other methods in accuracy and diversity consistently.

Conclusion: CFM is the superior approach for inverse design tasks in this context.

Abstract: Generative learning generates high dimensional data based on low dimensional conditions, also called prompts. Therefore, generative learning algorithms are eligible for solving (Bayesian) inverse problems. In this article we compare a traditional Bayesian inverse approach based on a forward regression model and a prior sampled with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with three state of the art generative learning models, namely conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, Invertible Neural Networks and Conditional Flow Matching. We apply them to a problem of gas turbine combustor design where we map six independent design parameters to three performance labels. We propose several metrics for the evaluation of this inverse design approaches and measure the accuracy of the labels of the generated designs along with the diversity. We also study the performance as a function of the training dataset size. Our benchmark has a clear winner, as Conditional Flow Matching consistently outperforms all competing approaches.

Abstract: We propose a data-efficient, physics-aware generative framework in function space for inverse PDE problems. Existing plug-and-play diffusion posterior samplers represent physics implicitly through joint coefficient-solution modeling, requiring substantial paired supervision. In contrast, our Decoupled Diffusion Inverse Solver (DDIS) employs a decoupled design: an unconditional diffusion learns the coefficient prior, while a neural operator explicitly models the forward PDE for guidance. This decoupling enables superior data efficiency and effective physics-informed learning, while naturally supporting Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) to avoid over-smoothing in Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). Theoretically, we prove that DDIS avoids the guidance attenuation failure of joint models when training data is scarce. Empirically, DDIS achieves state-of-the-art performance under sparse observation, improving $l_2$ error by 11% and spectral error by 54% on average; when data is limited to 1%, DDIS maintains accuracy with 40% advantage in $l_2$ error compared to joint models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a constrained recommendation framework for selecting agents in multi-agent systems, addressing gaps in existing recommender systems by incorporating relevance, reliability, and interaction effects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recommender systems fail to handle the structured, sequential, and interaction-dependent nature of agent orchestration in multi-agent systems.

Method: The framework combines retrieval to build a candidate set and utility optimization using a learned scorer. It leverages historical calling trees for learning signals and supports both agent-level and system-level recommendations.

Result: The paper introduces a unified benchmark for evaluation by normalizing logs from diverse multi-agent corpora.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges of agent recommendation in multi-agent systems by integrating retrieval, optimization, and structured historical data.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) increasingly solve complex tasks by orchestrating agents and tools selected from rapidly growing marketplaces. As these marketplaces expand, many candidates become functionally overlapping, making selection not just a retrieval problem: beyond filtering relevant agents, an orchestrator must choose options that are reliable, compatible with the current execution context, and able to cooperate with other selected agents. Existing recommender systems -- largely built for item-level ranking from flat user-item logs -- do not directly address the structured, sequential, and interaction-dependent nature of agent orchestration. We address this gap by \textbf{formulating agent recommendation in MAS as a constrained decision problem} and introducing a generic \textbf{constrained recommendation framework} that first uses retrieval to build a compact candidate set conditioned on the current subtask and context, and then performs \textbf{utility optimization} within this feasible set using a learned scorer that accounts for relevance, reliability, and interaction effects. We ground both the formulation and learning signals in \textbf{historical calling trees}, which capture the execution structure of MAS (parent-child calls, branching dependencies, and local cooperation patterns) beyond what flat logs provide. The framework supports two complementary settings: \textbf{agent-level recommendation} (select the next agent/tool) and \textbf{system-level recommendation} (select a small, connected agent team/subgraph for coordinated execution). To enable systematic evaluation, we construct a unified calling-tree benchmark by normalizing invocation logs from eight heterogeneous multi-agent corpora into a shared structured representation.

### [370] [Aligning Microscopic Vehicle and Macroscopic Traffic Statistics: Reconstructing Driving Behavior from Partial Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22242)
*Zhihao Zhang,Keith Redmill,Chengyang Peng,Bowen Weng*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining microscopic and macroscopic data to develop autonomous driving policies that align with human driving practices, ensuring safety and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for safe and efficient autonomous vehicles drives the development of algorithms that align with human driving practices, overcoming limitations of current data collection methods.

Method: The framework reconstructs unobserved microscopic states from macroscopic observations, anchoring vehicle behaviors with microscopic data and learning a shared policy consistent with observed trajectories and traffic statistics.

Result: The proposed method promotes realistic traffic flow patterns and safe coordination with human drivers.

Conclusion: By leveraging complementary data sources, the framework advances autonomous driving policies toward safer and more efficient collaboration with human drivers.

Abstract: A driving algorithm that aligns with good human driving practices, or at the very least collaborates effectively with human drivers, is crucial for developing safe and efficient autonomous vehicles. In practice, two main approaches are commonly adopted: (i) supervised or imitation learning, which requires comprehensive naturalistic driving data capturing all states that influence a vehicle's decisions and corresponding actions, and (ii) reinforcement learning (RL), where the simulated driving environment either matches or is intentionally more challenging than real-world conditions. Both methods depend on high-quality observations of real-world driving behavior, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. State-of-the-art sensors on individual vehicles can gather microscopic data, but they lack context about the surrounding conditions. Conversely, roadside sensors can capture traffic flow and other macroscopic characteristics, but they cannot associate this information with individual vehicles on a microscopic level. Motivated by this complementarity, we propose a framework that reconstructs unobserved microscopic states from macroscopic observations, using microscopic data to anchor observed vehicle behaviors, and learns a shared policy whose behavior is microscopically consistent with the partially observed trajectories and actions and macroscopically aligned with target traffic statistics when deployed population-wide. Such constrained and regularized policies promote realistic flow patterns and safe coordination with human drivers at scale.

*Manuela Chacon-Chamorro,Luis Felipe Giraldo,Nicanor Quijano*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores cooperative resilience in mixed-motive multi-agent systems, focusing on reward function design. A hybrid reward strategy improves robustness without compromising task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agents in dynamic, uncertain environments must balance individual and collective goals. Resilience in multi-agent systems is underexplored, particularly in reward design.

Method: Introduced a framework for learning reward functions from ranked trajectories using a resilience metric. Tested three reward strategies (individual, resilience-inferred, hybrid) in social dilemma environments with various parameterizations and algorithms.

Result: Hybrid reward strategy enhanced robustness under disruptions, maintained task performance, and reduced catastrophic outcomes like resource overuse.

Conclusion: Reward design is crucial for resilient cooperation, and the hybrid approach advances robust multi-agent systems in uncertain settings.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems often operate in dynamic and uncertain environments, where agents must not only pursue individual goals but also safeguard collective functionality. This challenge is especially acute in mixed-motive multi-agent systems. This work focuses on cooperative resilience, the ability of agents to anticipate, resist, recover, and transform in the face of disruptions, a critical yet underexplored property in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. We study how reward function design influences resilience in mixed-motive settings and introduce a novel framework that learns reward functions from ranked trajectories, guided by a cooperative resilience metric. Agents are trained in a suite of social dilemma environments using three reward strategies: i) traditional individual reward; ii) resilience-inferred reward; and iii) hybrid that balance both. We explore three reward parameterizations-linear models, hand-crafted features, and neural networks, and employ two preference-based learning algorithms to infer rewards from behavioral rankings. Our results demonstrate that hybrid strategy significantly improve robustness under disruptions without degrading task performance and reduce catastrophic outcomes like resource overuse. These findings underscore the importance of reward design in fostering resilient cooperation, and represent a step toward developing robust multi-agent systems capable of sustaining cooperation in uncertain environments.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: ScholarPeer is a search-enabled multi-agent framework that improves automated peer review by emulating a senior researcher's cognitive processes, addressing limitations in assessing novelty and significance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated peer review systems excel at summarizing but struggle with deep critiques like novelty assessment and methodological flaws due to lacking external context.

Method: ScholarPeer uses a dual-stream process with a historian agent, baseline scout, and Q&A engine to dynamically acquire context and verify claims against live literature.

Result: ScholarPeer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in evaluations, achieving higher win-rates and reducing the gap to human-level diversity.

Conclusion: ScholarPeer advances automated peer review by integrating dynamic context and verification, bridging the gap toward human-level critique quality.

Abstract: Automated peer review has evolved from simple text classification to structured feedback generation. However, current state-of-the-art systems still struggle with "surface-level" critiques: they excel at summarizing content but often fail to accurately assess novelty and significance or identify deep methodological flaws because they evaluate papers in a vacuum, lacking the external context a human expert possesses. In this paper, we introduce ScholarPeer, a search-enabled multi-agent framework designed to emulate the cognitive processes of a senior researcher. ScholarPeer employs a dual-stream process of context acquisition and active verification. It dynamically constructs a domain narrative using a historian agent, identifies missing comparisons via a baseline scout, and verifies claims through a multi-aspect Q&A engine, grounding the critique in live web-scale literature. We evaluate ScholarPeer on DeepReview-13K and the results demonstrate that ScholarPeer achieves significant win-rates against state-of-the-art approaches in side-by-side evaluations and reduces the gap to human-level diversity.

### [373] [Multi-Agent Systems Should be Treated as Principal-Agent Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23211)
*Paulius Rauba,Simonas Cepenas,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores multi-agent systems with information asymmetry and misaligned goals, framing them as principal-agent problems, and shows how LLM-based agents' 'scheming' behavior aligns with economic theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the challenge of agency loss in multi-agent systems, where LLM-based agents may develop goals like self-preservation and deceive others, leading to unintended system behavior.

Method: The paper draws on microeconomic theory, particularly principal-agent problems, to analyze information asymmetry and misaligned goals in multi-agent systems, using 'scheming' as a case study.

Result: The study demonstrates that terminology like 'covert subversion' in scheming aligns with concepts in mechanism design, offering mitigation strategies for agency loss.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for applying tools from human agent behavior analysis to non-human agents, providing a framework to address challenges in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Consider a multi-agent systems setup in which a principal (a supervisor agent) assigns subtasks to specialized agents and aggregates their responses into a single system-level output. A core property of such systems is information asymmetry: agents observe task-specific information, produce intermediate reasoning traces, and operate with different context windows. In isolation, such asymmetry is not problematic, since agents report truthfully to the principal when incentives are fully aligned. However, this assumption breaks down when incentives diverge. Recent evidence suggests that LLM-based agents can acquire their own goals, such as survival or self-preservation, a phenomenon known as scheming, and may deceive humans or other agents. This leads to agency loss: a gap between the principal's intended outcome and the realized system behavior. Drawing on core ideas from microeconomic theory, we argue that these characteristics, information asymmetry and misaligned goals, are best studied through the lens of principal-agent problems. We explain why multi-agent systems, both human-to-LLM and LLM-to-LLM, naturally induce information asymmetry under this formulation, and we use scheming, where LLM agents pursue covert goals, as a concrete case study. We show that recently introduced terminology used to describe scheming, such as covert subversion or deferred subversion, corresponds to well-studied concepts in the mechanism design literature, which not only characterizes the problem but also prescribes concrete mitigation strategies. More broadly, we argue for applying tools developed to study human agent behavior to the analysis of non-human agents.

### [374] [MonoScale: Scaling Multi-Agent System with Monotonic Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23219)
*Shuai Shao,Yixiang Liu,Bingwei Lu,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: MonoScale is a framework for expanding LLM-based multi-agent systems without performance collapse by using familiarization tasks and natural-language memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling up multi-agent systems by adding new agents can lead to performance issues due to cold-start problems with heterogeneous and unreliable agents.

Method: Proposes MonoScale, which generates agent-conditioned tasks, collects interaction evidence, and distills it into natural-language memory for better routing.

Result: Outperforms naive scale-up and fixed-pool baselines, showing stable performance gains as the agent pool grows.

Conclusion: MonoScale ensures monotonic non-decreasing performance during agent pool expansion, validated on benchmarks like GAIA and Humanity's Last Exam.

Abstract: In recent years, LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have advanced rapidly, using a router to decompose tasks and delegate subtasks to specialized agents. A natural way to expand capability is to scale up the agent pool by continually integrating new functional agents or tool interfaces, but naive expansion can trigger performance collapse when the router cold-starts on newly added, heterogeneous, and unreliable agents. We propose MonoScale, an expansion-aware update framework that proactively generates a small set of agent-conditioned familiarization tasks, harvests evidence from both successful and failed interactions, and distills it into auditable natural-language memory to guide future routing. We formalize sequential augmentation as a contextual bandit and perform trust-region memory updates, yielding a monotonic non-decreasing performance guarantee across onboarding rounds. Experiments on GAIA and Humanity's Last Exam show stable gains as the agent pool grows, outperforming naive scale-up and strong-router fixed-pool baselines.
