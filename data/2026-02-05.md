*Longjie Zhao,Ziming Hong,Jiaxin Huang,Runnan Chen,Mingming Gong,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper surveys intellectual property (IP) protection for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), proposing a framework to analyze perturbation mechanisms, protection paradigms, and robustness challenges while outlining future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing commercial use of 3DGS raises concerns about IP protection, but current research lacks a unified understanding of mechanisms and challenges.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic survey and introduce a bottom-up framework to examine Gaussian-based perturbation mechanisms, protection paradigms, and robustness threats.

Result: The survey reveals gaps in technical foundations and robustness characterization and identifies opportunities for deeper investigation.

Conclusion: Six research directions are proposed to advance reliable IP protection for 3DGS assets, focusing on robustness, efficiency, and protection paradigms.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a mainstream representation for real-time 3D scene synthesis, enabling applications in virtual and augmented reality, robotics, and 3D content creation. Its rising commercial value and explicit parametric structure raise emerging intellectual property (IP) protection concerns, prompting a surge of research on 3DGS IP protection. However, current progress remains fragmented, lacking a unified view of the underlying mechanisms, protection paradigms, and robustness challenges. To address this gap, we present the first systematic survey on 3DGS IP protection and introduce a bottom-up framework that examines (i) underlying Gaussian-based perturbation mechanisms, (ii) passive and active protection paradigms, and (iii) robustness threats under emerging generative AI era, revealing gaps in technical foundations and robustness characterization and indicating opportunities for deeper investigation. Finally, we outline six research directions across robustness, efficiency, and protection paradigms, offering a roadmap toward reliable and trustworthy IP protection for 3DGS assets.

### [2] [TruKAN: Towards More Efficient Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks Using Truncated Power Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03879)
*Ali Bayeh,Samira Sadaoui,Malek Mouhoub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TruKAN introduces truncated power functions to KAN, improving accuracy and efficiency while maintaining interpretability, outperforming other KAN variants in vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance computational efficiency and adherence to KAN principles while enhancing accuracy and interpretability.

Method: Replaces B-spline basis with truncated power functions, integrates into EfficientNet-V2, and evaluates against MLP, KAN, and SineKAN models with hybrid optimization.

Result: TruKAN excels in accuracy, computational efficiency, and memory usage compared to other KAN models in vision tasks.

Conclusion: TruKAN offers a superior trade-off between performance and transparency, advancing KAN-based architectures for complex tasks.

Abstract: To address the trade-off between computational efficiency and adherence to Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) principles, we propose TruKAN, a new architecture based on the KAN structure and learnable activation functions. TruKAN replaces the B-spline basis in KAN with a family of truncated power functions derived from k-order spline theory. This change maintains the KAN's expressiveness while enhancing accuracy and training time. Each TruKAN layer combines a truncated power term with a polynomial term and employs either shared or individual knots. TruKAN exhibits greater interpretability than other KAN variants due to its simplified basis functions and knot configurations. By prioritizing interpretable basis functions, TruKAN aims to balance approximation efficacy with transparency. We develop the TruKAN model and integrate it into an advanced EfficientNet-V2-based framework, which is then evaluated on computer vision benchmark datasets. To ensure a fair comparison, we develop various models: MLP-, KAN-, SineKAN and TruKAN-based EfficientNet frameworks and assess their training time and accuracy across small and deep architectures. The training phase uses hybrid optimization to improve convergence stability. Additionally, we investigate layer normalization techniques for all the models and assess the impact of shared versus individual knots in TruKAN. Overall, TruKAN outperforms other KAN models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency and memory usage on the complex vision task, demonstrating advantages beyond the limited settings explored in prior KAN studies.

*Maxx Richard Rahman,Mostafa Hammouda,Wolfgang Maass*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiGAN, a novel deep learning model combining diffusion modeling and attention-guided networks, improves early Alzheimer's detection by synthesizing realistic neuroimaging trajectories and capturing temporal-structural patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early Alzheimer's diagnosis is challenging due to subtle brain changes and irregular data progression. Existing methods struggle with temporal continuity and modality irregularities.

Method: DiGAN integrates latent diffusion modeling to synthesize longitudinal neuroimaging data and an attention-guided convolutional network to capture structural-temporal patterns.

Result: DiGAN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic and ADNI datasets, demonstrating enhanced early-stage Alzheimer's detection.

Conclusion: DiGAN's innovative approach effectively addresses limitations in current methods, showing promise for early Alzheimer's diagnosis.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a major challenge due to the subtle and temporally irregular progression of structural brain changes in the prodromal stages. Existing deep learning approaches require large longitudinal datasets and often fail to model the temporal continuity and modality irregularities inherent in real-world clinical data. To address these limitations, we propose the Diffusion-Guided Attention Network (DiGAN), which integrates latent diffusion modelling with an attention-guided convolutional network. The diffusion model synthesizes realistic longitudinal neuroimaging trajectories from limited training data, enriching temporal context and improving robustness to unevenly spaced visits. The attention-convolutional layer then captures discriminative structural--temporal patterns that distinguish cognitively normal subjects from those with mild cognitive impairment and subjective cognitive decline. Experiments on synthetic and ADNI datasets demonstrate that DiGAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines, showing its potential for early-stage AD detection.

### [4] [PriorProbe: Recovering Individual-Level Priors for Personalizing Neural Networks in Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03882)
*Haijiang Yan,Nick Chater,Adam Sanborn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PriorProbe introduces a novel method using MCMC with People to recover individual-specific cognitive priors, enhancing neural network personalization for tasks like facial expression recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for eliciting individual-level cognitive priors are either non-unique or biased, limiting personalization.

Method: PriorProbe uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People to recover fine-grained, individual-specific priors.

Result: Incorporating PriorProbe-derived priors significantly improves neural network performance on ambiguous stimuli.

Conclusion: PriorProbe offers a general, interpretable framework for personalizing deep neural networks.

Abstract: Incorporating individual-level cognitive priors offers an important route to personalizing neural networks, yet accurately eliciting such priors remains challenging: existing methods either fail to uniquely identify them or introduce systematic biases. Here, we introduce PriorProbe, a novel elicitation approach grounded in Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People that recovers fine-grained, individual-specific priors. Focusing on a facial expression recognition task, we apply PriorProbe to individual participants and test whether integrating the recovered priors with a state-of-the-art neural network improves its ability to predict an individual's classification on ambiguous stimuli. The PriorProbe-derived priors yield substantial performance gains, outperforming both the neural network alone and alternative sources of priors, while preserving the network's inference on ground-truth labels. Together, these results demonstrate that PriorProbe provides a general and interpretable framework for personalizing deep neural networks.

### [5] [Explainable Computer Vision Framework for Automated Pore Detection and Criticality Assessment in Additive Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03883)
*Akshansh Mishra,Rakesh Morisetty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces an explainable computer vision framework for detecting and assessing the criticality of pores in 3D-printed materials, emphasizing interpretability for engineers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Internal porosity in additively manufactured components undermines structural performance and hinders industrial adoption. Existing automated defect detection methods lack interpretability, making it difficult for engineers to understand the basis of criticality predictions.

Method: The framework reconstructs grayscale slices into volumetric datasets, uses intensity-based thresholding and connected component analysis to identify pores, characterizes them geometrically, constructs a pore interaction network, and employs machine learning with SHAP analysis to predict and explain pore criticality.

Result: Normalized surface distance significantly influences criticality predictions, outweighing other descriptors like pore size and geometric parameters. Pore proximity to boundaries strongly correlates with failure mechanisms.

Conclusion: The interpretable framework provides transparent defect assessment and actionable insights for optimizing additive manufacturing processes and quality control.

Abstract: Internal porosity remains a critical defect mode in additively manufactured components, compromising structural performance and limiting industrial adoption. Automated defect detection methods exist but lack interpretability, preventing engineers from understanding the physical basis of criticality predictions. This study presents an explainable computer vision framework for pore detection and criticality assessment in three-dimensional tomographic volumes. Sequential grayscale slices were reconstructed into volumetric datasets, and intensity-based thresholding with connected component analysis identified 500 individual pores. Each pore was characterized using geometric descriptors including size, aspect ratio, extent, and spatial position relative to the specimen boundary. A pore interaction network was constructed using percentile-based Euclidean distance criteria, yielding 24,950 inter-pore connections. Machine learning models predicted pore criticality scores from extracted features, and SHAP analysis quantified individual feature contributions. Results demonstrate that normalized surface distance dominates model predictions, contributing more than an order of magnitude greater importance than all other descriptors. Pore size provides minimal influence, while geometric parameters show negligible impact. The strong inverse relationship between surface proximity and criticality reveals boundary-driven failure mechanisms. This interpretable framework enables transparent defect assessment and provides actionable insights for process optimization and quality control in additive manufacturing.

### [6] [4DPC$^2$hat: Towards Dynamic Point Cloud Understanding with Failure-Aware Bootstrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03890)
*Xindan Zhang,Weilong Yan,Yufei Shi,Xuerui Qiu,Tao He,Ying Li,Ming Li,Hehe Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 4DPC$^2$hat, the first MLLM designed for dynamic point cloud understanding, addressing limitations in existing methods focused on static objects. It includes a large-scale dataset (4DPC$^2$hat-200K) and a Mamba-enhanced temporal reasoning MLLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud methods primarily focus on static objects, leaving dynamic point cloud sequences unexplored due to dataset scarcity and motion modeling challenges.

Method: The authors construct a large-scale dataset (4DPC$^2$hat-200K) via a two-stage pipeline and develop a Mamba-enhanced temporal reasoning MLLM. They also propose a failure-aware bootstrapping learning strategy.

Result: 4DPC$^2$hat outperforms existing models in action understanding and temporal reasoning, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for 4D dynamic point cloud understanding, showcasing significant improvements over current models.

Abstract: Point clouds provide a compact and expressive representation of 3D objects, and have recently been integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing methods primarily focus on static objects, while understanding dynamic point cloud sequences remains largely unexplored. This limitation is mainly caused by the lack of large-scale cross-modal datasets and the difficulty of modeling motions in spatio-temporal contexts. To bridge this gap, we present 4DPC$^2$hat, the first MLLM tailored for dynamic point cloud understanding. To this end, we construct a large-scale cross-modal dataset 4DPC$^2$hat-200K via a meticulous two-stage pipeline consisting of topology-consistent 4D point construction and two-level captioning. The dataset contains over 44K dynamic object sequences, 700K point cloud frames, and 200K curated question-answer (QA) pairs, supporting inquiries about counting, temporal relationship, action, spatial relationship, and appearance. At the core of the framework, we introduce a Mamba-enhanced temporal reasoning MLLM to capture long-range dependencies and dynamic patterns among a point cloud sequence. Furthermore, we propose a failure-aware bootstrapping learning strategy that iteratively identifies model deficiencies and generates targeted QA supervision to continuously strengthen corresponding reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 4DPC$^2$hat significantly improves action understanding and temporal reasoning compared with existing models, establishing a strong foundation for 4D dynamic point cloud understanding.

### [7] [Audit After Segmentation: Reference-Free Mask Quality Assessment for Language-Referred Audio-Visual Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03892)
*Jinxing Zhou,Yanghao Zhou,Yaoting Wang,Zongyan Han,Jiaqi Ma,Henghui Ding,Rao Muhammad Anwer,Hisham Cholakkal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mask Quality Assessment in Ref-AVS (MQA-RefAVS), a task to evaluate segmentation mask quality without ground-truth annotations, proposing MQ-RAVSBench benchmark and MQ-Auditor, an MLLM-based solution for quantitative and qualitative assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Ref-AVS systems lack interpretable diagnoses of segmentation mask quality, prompting the need for a method to assess masks without ground-truth references.

Method: The authors introduce MQA-RefAVS, build MQ-RAVSBench with diverse mask error modes, and propose MQ-Auditor, an MLLM-based model for multimodal reasoning.

Result: MQ-Auditor outperforms open-source and commercial MLLMs, proving effective for detecting segmentation failures and improving downstream tasks.

Conclusion: MQ-Auditor and MQA-RefAVS provide a robust framework for evaluating and enhancing segmentation mask quality in Ref-AVS, with data and codes set for public release.

Abstract: Language-referred audio-visual segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects described by natural language by jointly reasoning over video, audio, and text. Beyond generating segmentation masks, providing rich and interpretable diagnoses of mask quality remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Mask Quality Assessment in the Ref-AVS context (MQA-RefAVS), a new task that evaluates the quality of candidate segmentation masks without relying on ground-truth annotations as references at inference time. Given audio-visual-language inputs and each provided segmentation mask, the task requires estimating its IoU with the unobserved ground truth, identifying the corresponding error type, and recommending an actionable quality-control decision. To support this task, we construct MQ-RAVSBench, a benchmark featuring diverse and representative mask error modes that span both geometric and semantic issues. We further propose MQ-Auditor, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based auditor that explicitly reasons over multimodal cues and mask information to produce quantitative and qualitative mask quality assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MQ-Auditor outperforms strong open-source and commercial MLLMs and can be integrated with existing Ref-AVS systems to detect segmentation failures and support downstream segmentation improvement. Data and codes will be released at https://github.com/jasongief/MQA-RefAVS.

### [8] [GPAIR: Gaussian-Kernel-Based Ultrafast 3D Photoacoustic Iterative Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03893)
*Yibing Wang,Shuang Li,Tingting Huang,Yu Zhang,Chulhong Kim,Seongwook Choi,Changhui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GPAIR, an ultrafast iterative reconstruction method for 3D PACT, achieving sub-second reconstruction speeds for large-scale imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IR algorithms for 3D PACT are slow, hindering clinical applications. GPAIR aims to address this by drastically reducing reconstruction time.

Method: GPAIR uses Gaussian-kernel-based transformations and GPU-accelerated differentiable Triton operators for ultrafast 3D reconstruction.

Result: GPAIR achieves sub-second reconstruction for 8.4 million voxels, orders-of-magnitude faster than traditional IR.

Conclusion: GPAIR's speed advances 3D PACT toward clinical use, enabling near-real-time large-scale imaging.

Abstract: Although the iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithm can substantially correct reconstruction artifacts in photoacoustic (PA) computed tomography (PACT), it suffers from long reconstruction times, especially for large-scale three-dimensional (3D) imaging in which IR takes hundreds of seconds to hours. The computing burden severely limits the practical applicability of IR algorithms. In this work, we proposed an ultrafast IR method for 3D PACT, called Gaussian-kernel-based Ultrafast 3D Photoacoustic Iterative Reconstruction (GPAIR), which achieves orders-of-magnitude acceleration in computing. GPAIR transforms traditional spatial grids with continuous isotropic Gaussian kernels. By deriving analytical closed-form expression for pressure waves and implementing powerful GPU-accelerated differentiable Triton operators, GPAIR demonstrates extraordinary ultrafast sub-second reconstruction speed for 3D targets containing 8.4 million voxels in animal experiments. This revolutionary ultrafast image reconstruction enables near-real-time large-scale 3D PA reconstruction, significantly advancing 3D PACT toward clinical applications.

### [9] [Vision Transformers for Zero-Shot Clustering of Animal Images: A Comparative Benchmarking Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03894)
*Hugo Markoff,Stefan Hein Bengtson,Michael Ørsted*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores using Vision Transformer (ViT) models to automate species-level clustering of unlabeled animal images, achieving high accuracy with supervised and unsupervised methods, while also revealing intra-specific ecological patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling of animal images is a bottleneck in ecological research, limiting biodiversity monitoring. The study aims to automate this process using ViT models.

Method: Five ViT models, combined with five dimensionality reduction techniques and four clustering algorithms, are benchmarked on 60 species (30 mammals, 30 birds) using 200 images per species. Both supervised and unsupervised approaches are tested.

Result: Near-perfect species-level clustering (V-measure: 0.958) is achieved with DINOv3 embeddings, t-SNE, and supervised hierarchical clustering. Unsupervised methods also perform well (0.943), with minimal outlier rejection (1.14%). Intra-specific variations like age and sex are reliably detected.

Conclusion: ViT models are effective for automated species-level clustering, even revealing ecological patterns. The study provides a toolkit and recommendations for ecologists to apply these methods to their data.

Abstract: Manual labeling of animal images remains a significant bottleneck in ecological research, limiting the scale and efficiency of biodiversity monitoring efforts. This study investigates whether state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models can reduce thousands of unlabeled animal images directly to species-level clusters. We present a comprehensive benchmarking framework evaluating five ViT models combined with five dimensionality reduction techniques and four clustering algorithms, two supervised and two unsupervised, across 60 species (30 mammals and 30 birds), with each test using a random subset of 200 validated images per species. We investigate when clustering succeeds at species-level, where it fails, and whether clustering within the species-level reveals ecologically meaningful patterns such as sex, age, or phenotypic variation. Our results demonstrate near-perfect species-level clustering (V-measure: 0.958) using DINOv3 embeddings with t-SNE and supervised hierarchical clustering methods. Unsupervised approaches achieve competitive performance (0.943) while requiring no prior species knowledge, rejecting only 1.14% of images as outliers requiring expert review. We further demonstrate robustness to realistic long-tailed distributions of species and show that intentional over-clustering can reliably extract intra-specific variation including age classes, sexual dimorphism, and pelage differences. We introduce an open-source benchmarking toolkit and provide recommendations for ecologists to select appropriate methods for sorting their specific taxonomic groups and data.

### [10] [Benchmarking Bias Mitigation Toward Fairness Without Harm from Vision to LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03895)
*Xuwei Tan,Ziyu Hu,Xueru Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NH-Fair is a unified benchmark addressing bias mitigation in machine learning by standardizing datasets, metrics, and training protocols across vision and vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of inconsistent fairness evaluations and ineffective bias mitigation methods in machine learning, ensuring fair comparisons across models.

Method: Introduces NH-Fair, a benchmark with standardized protocols, and conducts systematic ERM tuning to identify impactful training choices.

Result: Debiasing methods often don't outperform well-tuned ERM baselines, but composite data-augmentation shows consistent fairness gains without utility loss.

Conclusion: NH-Fair offers a reproducible pipeline for fairness evaluation, highlighting the importance of training protocols over scaling for reducing disparities.

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data often inherit and amplify biases against certain social groups, raising urgent concerns about their deployment at scale. While numerous bias mitigation methods have been proposed, comparing the effectiveness of bias mitigation methods remains difficult due to heterogeneous datasets, inconsistent fairness metrics, isolated evaluation of vision versus multi-modal models, and insufficient hyperparameter tuning that undermines fair comparisons. We introduce NH-Fair, a unified benchmark for fairness without harm that spans both vision models and large vision-language models (LVLMs) under standardized data, metrics, and training protocols, covering supervised and zero-shot regimes. Our key contributions are: (1) a systematic ERM tuning study that identifies training choices with large influence on both utility and disparities, yielding empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners reduce expensive hyperparameter tuning space in achieving strong fairness and accuracy; (2) evidence that many debiasing methods do not reliably outperform a well-tuned ERM baseline, whereas a composite data-augmentation method consistently delivers parity gains without sacrificing utility, emerging as a promising practical strategy. (3) an analysis showing that while LVLMs achieve higher average accuracy, they still exhibit subgroup disparities, and gains from scaling are typically smaller than those from architectural or training-protocol choices. NH-Fair provides a reproducible, tuning-aware pipeline for rigorous, harm-aware fairness evaluation.

### [12] [Entropy-Aware Structural Alignment for Zero-Shot Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03913)
*Qiuming Luo,Tao Zeng,Feng Li,Heming Liu,Rui Mao,Chang Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Entropy-Aware Structural Alignment Network for zero-shot HCCR, addressing limitations in hierarchical topology and uneven information density. It introduces an Information Entropy Prior, Dual-View Radical Tree, and Top-K Semantic Feature Fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HCCR methods overlook hierarchical topology and uneven information density in radicals, leading to suboptimal recognition. The paper aims to bridge the visual-semantic gap and improve zero-shot recognition.

Method: The proposed method includes: 1) an Information Entropy Prior for dynamic positional embeddings, 2) a Dual-View Radical Tree for multi-granularity features, and 3) Top-K Semantic Feature Fusion for decoding.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot HCCR, outperforming CLIP-based baselines and demonstrating exceptional data efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the visual-semantic gap, enhances recognition accuracy, and adapts quickly with minimal samples, setting a new benchmark for zero-shot HCCR.

Abstract: Zero-shot Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition (HCCR) aims to recognize unseen characters by leveraging radical-based semantic compositions. However, existing approaches often treat characters as flat radical sequences, neglecting the hierarchical topology and the uneven information density of different components. To address these limitations, we propose an Entropy-Aware Structural Alignment Network that bridges the visual-semantic gap through information-theoretic modeling. First, we introduce an Information Entropy Prior to dynamically modulate positional embeddings via multiplicative interaction, acting as a saliency detector that prioritizes discriminative roots over ubiquitous components. Second, we construct a Dual-View Radical Tree to extract multi-granularity structural features, which are integrated via an adaptive Sigmoid-based gating network to encode both global layout and local spatial roles. Finally, a Top-K Semantic Feature Fusion mechanism is devised to augment the decoding process by utilizing the centroid of semantic neighbors, effectively rectifying visual ambiguities through feature-level consensus. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing CLIP-based baselines in the challenging zero-shot setting. Furthermore, the framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, demonstrating rapid adaptability with minimal support samples.

### [13] [Phaedra: Learning High-Fidelity Discrete Tokenization for the Physical Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03915)
*Levi Lingsch,Georgios Kissas,Johannes Jakubik,Siddhartha Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the suitability of existing image tokenizers for scientific images, which require retaining physical and spectral properties. It introduces Phaedra, a new tokenizer inspired by classical methods, showing improved reconstruction and generalization across various PDE datasets and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenizers are designed for visual perception tasks and may not optimally handle scientific images with high dynamic range and specific physical requirements.

Method: The paper evaluates current tokenizers for PDE fidelity and introduces Phaedra, a tokenizer based on shape-gain quantization and proper orthogonal decomposition.

Result: Phaedra outperforms existing tokenizers in reconstruction accuracy and demonstrates strong generalization across different PDE tasks and real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed Phaedra tokenizer is better suited for scientific images, addressing limitations of current methods and improving performance in PDE-related tasks.

Abstract: Tokens are discrete representations that allow modern deep learning to scale by transforming high-dimensional data into sequences that can be efficiently learned, generated, and generalized to new tasks. These have become foundational for image and video generation and, more recently, physical simulation. As existing tokenizers are designed for the explicit requirements of realistic visual perception of images, it is necessary to ask whether these approaches are optimal for scientific images, which exhibit a large dynamic range and require token embeddings to retain physical and spectral properties. In this work, we investigate the accuracy of a suite of image tokenizers across a range of metrics designed to measure the fidelity of PDE properties in both physical and spectral space. Based on the observation that these struggle to capture both fine details and precise magnitudes, we propose Phaedra, inspired by classical shape-gain quantization and proper orthogonal decomposition. We demonstrate that Phaedra consistently improves reconstruction across a range of PDE datasets. Additionally, our results show strong out-of-distribution generalization capabilities to three tasks of increasing complexity, namely known PDEs with different conditions, unknown PDEs, and real-world Earth observation and weather data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatiaLab is a new benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) using realistic, diverse tasks, revealing significant gaps compared to human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for spatial reasoning in VLMs rely on synthetic or limited setups, missing real-world complexity. SpatiaLab aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive, realistic evaluation framework.

Method: SpatiaLab includes 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six categories (30 subcategories) with multiple-choice and open-ended formats. It evaluates diverse VLMs, including open-source, closed-source, and specialized models.

Result: VLMs perform significantly worse than humans (e.g., InternVL3.5-72B scores 54.93% vs. 87.57% for humans in multiple-choice). Open-ended tasks show further drops (e.g., GPT-5-mini at 40.93% vs. 64.93%).

Conclusion: SpatiaLab highlights VLMs' limitations in complex spatial reasoning and provides a benchmark to guide future research toward human-level performance.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, yet it remains a major challenge for contemporary vision-language models (VLMs). Prior work largely relied on synthetic or LLM-generated environments with limited task designs and puzzle-like setups, failing to capture the real-world complexity, visual noise, and diverse spatial relationships that VLMs encounter. To address this, we introduce SpatiaLab, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning in realistic, unconstrained contexts. SpatiaLab comprises 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six major categories: Relative Positioning, Depth & Occlusion, Orientation, Size & Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each with five subcategories, yielding 30 distinct task types. Each subcategory contains at least 25 questions, and each main category includes at least 200 questions, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation. Experiments across diverse state-of-the-art VLMs, including open- and closed-source models, reasoning-focused, and specialized spatial reasoning models, reveal a substantial gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared with humans. In the multiple-choice setup, InternVL3.5-72B achieves 54.93% accuracy versus 87.57% for humans. In the open-ended setting, all models show a performance drop of around 10-25%, with GPT-5-mini scoring highest at 40.93% versus 64.93% for humans. These results highlight key limitations in handling complex spatial relationships, depth perception, navigation, and 3D geometry. By providing a diverse, real-world evaluation framework, SpatiaLab exposes critical challenges and opportunities for advancing VLMs' spatial reasoning, offering a benchmark to guide future research toward robust, human-aligned spatial understanding.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of resource-constrained deployment and efficient transfer learning in masked self-supervised vision transformers by identifying redundant blocks.

Method: Uses information entropy of pretrained block weights to estimate block importance, enabling a one-shot pruning principle called Gardener.

Result: Gardener matches or outperforms existing data-free pruning methods and retains competitive performance even after pruning up to 91.7% of blocks.

Conclusion: Information-theoretic analysis is effective for pruning and optimizing masked self-supervised vision transformers.

Abstract: Masked self-supervised vision transformers have become a dominant pretraining paradigm, yet their substantial model size poses significant challenges for resource-constrained deployment and efficient transfer learning. A fundamental question remains: are all transformer blocks equally important for downstream performance? In this paper, we show that block importance in masked self-supervised vision transformers can be accurately estimated without access to any data. Our key finding is that the information entropy of pretrained block weights strongly correlates with oracle sensitivity obtained via iterative block removal and finetuning. This observation enables Gardener, a data-free, one-shot, block-level pruning principle that identifies redundant blocks through simple information-theoretic measurements. We evaluate Gardener on VideoMAE-B across multiple pruning ratios and downstream video recognition benchmarks. Despite its negligible computational overhead, Gardener consistently matches or outperforms existing data-free pruning baselines and closely approaches sensitivity-based pruning. Remarkably, even after pruning up to 91.7\% of blocks, the pruned model retains competitive transfer performance. Our results reveal substantial block-level redundancy in masked self-supervised vision transformers and demonstrate that information-theoretic analysis offers a principled and efficient pathway for model compression and resource-efficient transfer learning.

*Leeje Jang,Yijun Lin,Yao-Yi Chiang,Jerod Weinman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TiCLS is a new text spotting method that integrates external linguistic knowledge at the character level, improving recognition of ambiguous or fragmented text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on visual cues and lack external linguistic knowledge, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: TiCLS uses a character-level pretrained language model to fuse visual and linguistic features in an end-to-end framework.

Result: Experiments show TiCLS achieves state-of-the-art performance on ICDAR 2015 and Total-Text datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating PLM-guided linguistic knowledge significantly enhances scene text spotting.

Abstract: Scene text spotting aims to detect and recognize text in real-world images, where instances are often short, fragmented, or visually ambiguous. Existing methods primarily rely on visual cues and implicitly capture local character dependencies, but they overlook the benefits of external linguistic knowledge. Prior attempts to integrate language models either adapt language modeling objectives without external knowledge or apply pretrained models that are misaligned with the word-level granularity of scene text. We propose TiCLS, an end-to-end text spotter that explicitly incorporates external linguistic knowledge from a character-level pretrained language model. TiCLS introduces a linguistic decoder that fuses visual and linguistic features, yet can be initialized by a pretrained language model, enabling robust recognition of ambiguous or fragmented text. Experiments on ICDAR 2015 and Total-Text demonstrate that TiCLS achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of PLM-guided linguistic integration for scene text spotting.

TL;DR: AnyStyle is a pose-free, feed-forward 3D reconstruction and stylization framework that supports multimodal conditioning (text or images) for appearance control, improving flexibility and quality over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for scalable 3D asset creation and the limitations of image-based conditioning in existing stylization pipelines drove the development of AnyStyle.

Method: AnyStyle integrates modular stylization into feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipelines, using textual or visual style inputs for zero-shot control.

Result: Experiments show improved style controllability and preserved geometric reconstruction quality, supported by superior user study outcomes.

Conclusion: AnyStyle advances feed-forward 3D stylization by enabling flexible multimodal conditioning without compromising reconstruction quality.

Abstract: The growing demand for rapid and scalable 3D asset creation has driven interest in feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods, with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerging as an effective scene representation. While recent approaches have demonstrated pose-free reconstruction from unposed image collections, integrating stylization or appearance control into such pipelines remains underexplored. Existing attempts largely rely on image-based conditioning, which limits both controllability and flexibility. In this work, we introduce AnyStyle, a feed-forward 3D reconstruction and stylization framework that enables pose-free, zero-shot stylization through multimodal conditioning. Our method supports both textual and visual style inputs, allowing users to control the scene appearance using natural language descriptions or reference images. We propose a modular stylization architecture that requires only minimal architectural modifications and can be integrated into existing feed-forward 3D reconstruction backbones. Experiments demonstrate that AnyStyle improves style controllability over prior feed-forward stylization methods while preserving high-quality geometric reconstruction. A user study further confirms that AnyStyle achieves superior stylization quality compared to an existing state-of-the-art approach. Repository: https://github.com/joaxkal/AnyStyle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-life embedded DL applications require balancing performance with multiple constraints like latency, power, and cost, which current FPGA-based CNN accelerators often overlook.

Method: Uses HLS tools to parameterize CNN accelerator designs, enabling optimizations across constraints.

Result: Outperforms non-parameterized designs and is adaptable to other DL applications.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively balances performance and constraints, offering flexibility for broader DL applications.

Abstract: Convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerators implemented on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are typically designed with a primary focus on maximizing performance, often measured in giga-operations per second (GOPS). However, real-life embedded deep learning (DL) applications impose multiple constraints related to latency, power consumption, area, and cost. This work presents a hardware-software (HW/SW) co-design methodology in which a CNN accelerator is described using high-level synthesis (HLS) tools that ease the parameterization of the design, facilitating more effective optimizations across multiple design constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed design methodology is able to outperform non-parameterized design approaches, and it can be easily extended to other types of DL applications.

*Shikha Dubey,Patricia Raciti,Kristopher Standish,Albert Juan Ramon,Erik Ames Burlingame*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised framework for assessing registration quality of histopathological images using joint metrics, validated by human evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of evaluating registration quality in whole slide images without ground-truth annotations.

Method: Employs down-sampled tissue masks and deformations-based metrics for global and local assessment.

Result: Demonstrates strong correlation between automated metrics and human evaluations.

Conclusion: Offers reliable, real-time quality assessment for large-scale digital pathology.

Abstract: High-fidelity registration of histopathological whole slide images (WSIs), such as hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), is vital for integrated molecular analysis but challenging to evaluate without ground-truth (GT) annotations. Existing WSI-level assessments -- using annotated landmarks or intensity-based similarity metrics -- are often time-consuming, unreliable, and computationally intensive, limiting large-scale applicability. This study proposes a fast, unsupervised framework that jointly employs down-sampled tissue masks- and deformations-based metrics for registration quality assessment (RQA) of registered H&E and IHC WSI pairs. The masks-based metrics measure global structural correspondence, while the deformations-based metrics evaluate local smoothness, continuity, and transformation realism. Validation across multiple IHC markers and multi-expert assessments demonstrate a strong correlation between automated metrics and human evaluations. In the absence of GT, this framework offers reliable, real-time RQA with high fidelity and minimal computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale quality control in digital pathology.

TL;DR: A lightweight, automated framework detects and restores artifacts in AFM images using classification, segmentation, mask expansion, inpainting, and smoothing, achieving high-fidelity results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AFM imaging suffers from artifacts due to environmental noise, scanning imperfections, and tip-sample interactions, degrading image quality and interpretation.

Method: The pipeline includes artifact classification, lightweight semantic segmentation for mask generation, adaptive mask expansion, directional neighbor-based inpainting, and localized Gaussian smoothing.

Result: The framework effectively removes artifacts while preserving nanoscale structural details, validated experimentally.

Conclusion: This automated, geometry-aware solution enhances AFM data fidelity and is implemented in a user-friendly GUI for real-time and batch processing.

Abstract: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) enables high-resolution surface imaging at the nanoscale, yet the output is often degraded by artifacts introduced by environmental noise, scanning imperfections, and tip-sample interactions. To address this challenge, a lightweight and fully automated framework for artifact detection and restoration in AFM image analysis is presented. The pipeline begins with a classification model that determines whether an AFM image contains artifacts. If necessary, a lightweight semantic segmentation network, custom-designed and trained on AFM data, is applied to generate precise artifact masks. These masks are adaptively expanded based on their structural orientation and then inpainted using a directional neighbor-based interpolation strategy to preserve 3D surface continuity. A localized Gaussian smoothing operation is then applied for seamless restoration. The system is integrated into a user-friendly GUI that supports real-time parameter adjustments and batch processing. Experimental results demonstrate the effective artifact removal while preserving nanoscale structural details, providing a robust, geometry-aware solution for high-fidelity AFM data interpretation.

TL;DR: SeeingThroughClutter is a method for reconstructing 3D structures from single images by iteratively removing and modeling objects, leveraging VLMs without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on intermediate tasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation, which struggle with occlusion and clutter in complex scenes.

Method: An iterative pipeline detects, segments, removes, and fits 3D models for objects one at a time, improving segmentation accuracy.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art robustness on 3D-Front and ADE20K datasets, handling occluded scenes effectively.

Conclusion: SeeingThroughClutter demonstrates superior performance by decomposing complex scenes into simpler subtasks, benefiting from foundation model advancements.

Abstract: We present SeeingThroughClutter, a method for reconstructing structured 3D representations from single images by segmenting and modeling objects individually. Prior approaches rely on intermediate tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, which often underperform in complex scenes, particularly in the presence of occlusion and clutter. We address this by introducing an iterative object removal and reconstruction pipeline that decomposes complex scenes into a sequence of simpler subtasks. Using VLMs as orchestrators, foreground objects are removed one at a time via detection, segmentation, object removal, and 3D fitting. We show that removing objects allows for cleaner segmentations of subsequent objects, even in highly occluded scenes. Our method requires no task-specific training and benefits directly from ongoing advances in foundation models. We demonstrate stateof-the-art robustness on 3D-Front and ADE20K datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models for H&E-stained slides struggle with domain-specific variations in IHC. The study aims to bridge this gap by leveraging a comprehensive IHC dataset.

Method: Developed iSight, a multi-task learning framework combining visual features and metadata via token-level attention to predict staining intensity, location, quantity, tissue type, and malignancy status.

Result: iSight achieved 85.5% accuracy for location, 76.6% for intensity, and 75.7% for quantity, outperforming foundation models. It also improved pathologist assessments and agreement.

Conclusion: iSight enhances IHC interpretation accuracy and consistency, demonstrating potential for integration into clinical workflows.

Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides information on protein expression in tissue sections and is commonly used to support pathology diagnosis and disease triage. While AI models for H\&E-stained slides show promise, their applicability to IHC is limited due to domain-specific variations. Here we introduce HPA10M, a dataset that contains 10,495,672 IHC images from the Human Protein Atlas with comprehensive metadata included, and encompasses 45 normal tissue types and 20 major cancer types. Based on HPA10M, we trained iSight, a multi-task learning framework for automated IHC staining assessment. iSight combines visual features from whole-slide images with tissue metadata through a token-level attention mechanism, simultaneously predicting staining intensity, location, quantity, tissue type, and malignancy status. On held-out data, iSight achieved 85.5\% accuracy for location, 76.6\% for intensity, and 75.7\% for quantity, outperforming fine-tuned foundation models (PLIP, CONCH) by 2.5--10.2\%. In addition, iSight demonstrates well-calibrated predictions with expected calibration errors of 0.0150-0.0408. Furthermore, in a user study with eight pathologists evaluating 200 images from two datasets, iSight outperformed initial pathologist assessments on the held-out HPA dataset (79\% vs 68\% for location, 70\% vs 57\% for intensity, 68\% vs 52\% for quantity). Inter-pathologist agreement also improved after AI assistance in both held-out HPA (Cohen's $κ$ increased from 0.63 to 0.70) and Stanford TMAD datasets (from 0.74 to 0.76), suggesting expert--AI co-assessment can improve IHC interpretation. This work establishes a foundation for AI systems that can improve IHC diagnostic accuracy and highlights the potential for integrating iSight into clinical workflows to enhance the consistency and reliability of IHC assessment.

*Junbo Zou,Ziheng Huang,Shengjie Zhang,Liwen Zhang,Weining Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoBrain is a framework enhancing VLMs' ability to understand long-form videos by adaptive frame sampling using dual agents and behavior-aware rewards, improving performance with fewer frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of existing methods in long-form video understanding by balancing computational constraints and information capture across many frames.

Method: Proposes VideoBrain with dual agents (CLIP-based for semantic retrieval and Uniform for dense sampling) and behavior-aware rewards to optimize frame sampling.

Result: Achieves +3.5% to +9.0% improvement over baselines with 30-40% fewer frames and strong cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: VideoBrain effectively addresses long-video understanding challenges through adaptive sampling and learned policies.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding remains challenging for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) due to the inherent tension between computational constraints and the need to capture information distributed across thousands of frames. Existing approaches either sample frames uniformly (risking information loss) or select keyframes in a single pass (with no recovery from poor choices). We propose VideoBrain, an end-to-end framework that enables VLMs to adaptively acquire visual information through learned sampling policies. Our approach features dual complementary agents: a CLIP-based agent for semantic retrieval across the video and a Uniform agent for dense temporal sampling within intervals. Unlike prior agent-based methods that rely on text-only LLMs orchestrating visual tools, our VLM directly perceives frames and reasons about information sufficiency. To prevent models from invoking agents indiscriminately to maximize rewards, we introduce a behavior-aware reward function coupled with a data classification pipeline that teaches the model when agent invocation is genuinely beneficial. Experiments on four long video benchmarks demonstrate that VideoBrain achieves +3.5% to +9.0% improvement over the baseline while using 30-40% fewer frames, with strong cross-dataset generalization to short video benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods struggle with capturing long-range spectral dependencies or are computationally expensive, limiting their practical use in hyperspectral anomaly detection.

Method: The proposed DMS2F-HAD uses Mamba's linear-time modeling to learn spatial and spectral features in dual branches, integrated via dynamic gated fusion for anomaly detection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art AUC of 98.78% and 4.6x faster inference speed across fourteen benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DMS2F-HAD excels in generalization and scalability, making it highly suitable for practical hyperspectral anomaly detection applications.

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) aims to identify rare and irregular targets in high-dimensional hyperspectral images (HSIs), which are often noisy and unlabelled data. Existing deep learning methods either fail to capture long-range spectral dependencies (e.g., convolutional neural networks) or suffer from high computational cost (e.g., Transformers). To address these challenges, we propose DMS2F-HAD, a novel dual-branch Mamba-based model. Our architecture utilizes Mamba's linear-time modeling to efficiently learn distinct spatial and spectral features in specialized branches, which are then integrated by a dynamic gated fusion mechanism to enhance anomaly localization. Across fourteen benchmark HSI datasets, our proposed DMS2F-HAD not only achieves a state-of-the-art average AUC of 98.78%, but also demonstrates superior efficiency with an inference speed 4.6 times faster than comparable deep learning methods. The results highlight DMS2FHAD's strong generalization and scalability, positioning it as a strong candidate for practical HAD applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Structure-from-Motion (SfM) performance in endoscopy videos by enhancing feature extraction.

Method: Introduces SuperPoint-E with Tracking Adaptation supervision for better feature detection and description.

Result: Produces denser 3D reconstructions covering longer video segments due to higher feature density and survivability.

Conclusion: SuperPoint-E outperforms existing methods, making guided matching redundant and significantly improving SfM results.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on boosting the feature extraction to improve the performance of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) in endoscopy videos. We present SuperPoint-E, a new local feature extraction method that, using our proposed Tracking Adaptation supervision strategy, significantly improves the quality of feature detection and description in endoscopy. Extensive experimentation on real endoscopy recordings studies our approach's most suitable configuration and evaluates SuperPoint-E feature quality. The comparison with other baselines also shows that our 3D reconstructions are denser and cover more and longer video segments because our detector fires more densely and our features are more likely to survive (i.e. higher detection precision). In addition, our descriptor is more discriminative, making the guided matching step almost redundant. The presented approach brings significant improvements in the 3D reconstructions obtained, via SfM on endoscopy videos, compared to the original SuperPoint and the gold standard SfM COLMAP pipeline.

Method: The study evaluates six encoder-decoder architectures across seven datasets spanning SEM, AFM, XCT, and optical microscopy. It includes out-of-distribution detection and counterfactual explanations for interpretability.

Result: Architecture performance varies by context: UNet performs best for high-contrast 2D imaging, while DeepLabv3+ excels in challenging cases. The framework provides tools to assess trustworthiness on new samples.

Conclusion: The framework addresses practical gaps in materials characterization by guiding architecture selection, offering reliability signals, and enhancing interpretability for diverse imaging setups.

Abstract: Segmentation architectures are typically benchmarked on single imaging modalities, obscuring deployment-relevant performance variations: an architecture optimal for one modality may underperform on another. We present a cross-modal evaluation framework for materials image segmentation spanning SEM, AFM, XCT, and optical microscopy. Our evaluation of six encoder-decoder combinations across seven datasets reveals that optimal architectures vary systematically by context: UNet excels for high-contrast 2D imaging while DeepLabv3+ is preferred for the hardest cases. The framework also provides deployment feedback via out-of-distribution detection and counterfactual explanations that reveal which microstructural features drive predictions. Together, the architecture guidance, reliability signals, and interpretability tools address a practical gap in materials characterization, where researchers lack tools to select architectures for their specific imaging setup or assess when models can be trusted on new samples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of inter-slice discontinuities in 3D medical imaging reconstruction using 2D diffusion models by introducing Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a plug-and-play method that aligns sampling trajectories without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D medical imaging reconstruction with diffusion models faces challenges due to data collection difficulties and computational burdens, leading to compromises like using 2D priors, which cause inter-slice discontinuities.

Method: The authors propose ISCS, a strategy to control stochastic noise consistency during diffusion sampling, ensuring inter-slice alignment without additional loss terms or optimization.

Result: Experiments show ISCS effectively improves 3D imaging performance using 2D diffusion models, achieving high-fidelity results without extra computational costs.

Conclusion: Controlling inter-slice stochasticity is a principled and practical approach for enhancing 3D medical imaging with 2D diffusion priors.

Abstract: 3D medical imaging is in high demand and essential for clinical diagnosis and scientific research. Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps. Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug-and-play and can be dropped into any 2D trained diffusion based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost. Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that our method can effectively improve the performance of medical 3D imaging problems based on 2D diffusion models. Our findings suggest that controlling inter-slice stochasticity is a principled and practically attractive route toward high-fidelity 3D medical imaging with 2D diffusion priors.

TL;DR: Point2Insert is a sparse-point-based framework for precise object insertion in videos, eliminating the need for dense masks and offering fine-grained spatial control. It outperforms baselines and larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driven by the demand for accurate yet low-effort object placement, Point2Insert addresses the limitations of mask-based (labor-intensive) and instruction-based (imprecise) methods by using sparse points.

Method: Point2Insert uses sparse positive/negative points for spatial control, trained in two stages: initial insertion with point/mask prompts, followed by adaptation to videos via synthesized datasets and teacher-student distillation.

Result: The framework consistently outperforms baselines and surpasses larger models (×10 more parameters) in insertion success.

Conclusion: Point2Insert offers a flexible, efficient solution for video object insertion, balancing precision and user effort.

Abstract: This paper introduces Point2Insert, a sparse-point-based framework for flexible and user-friendly object insertion in videos, motivated by the growing popularity of accurate, low-effort object placement. Existing approaches face two major challenges: mask-based insertion methods require labor-intensive mask annotations, while instruction-based methods struggle to place objects at precise locations. Point2Insert addresses these issues by requiring only a small number of sparse points instead of dense masks, eliminating the need for tedious mask drawing. Specifically, it supports both positive and negative points to indicate regions that are suitable or unsuitable for insertion, enabling fine-grained spatial control over object locations. The training of Point2Insert consists of two stages. In Stage 1, we train an insertion model that generates objects in given regions conditioned on either sparse-point prompts or a binary mask. In Stage 2, we further train the model on paired videos synthesized by an object removal model, adapting it to video insertion. Moreover, motivated by the higher insertion success rate of mask-guided editing, we leverage a mask-guided insertion model as a teacher to distill reliable insertion behavior into the point-guided model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Point2Insert consistently outperforms strong baselines and even surpasses models with $\times$10 more parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EAR methods suffer from computational and structural redundancies and neglect spectral information critical for global motion patterns.

Method: Proposes CHSR for compact spatiotemporal representation and GSG for spectral cue utilization via FFT.

Result: Achieves 10.29%, 1.71%, and 6.25% improvements on benchmarks; lightweight variant reduces parameters by 5.4x.

Conclusion: HoloEv-Net offers scalable, efficient EAR with superior accuracy and potential for edge deployment.

Abstract: Event-based Action Recognition (EAR) has attracted significant attention due to the high temporal resolution and high dynamic range of event cameras. However, existing methods typically suffer from (i) the computational redundancy of dense voxel representations, (ii) structural redundancy inherent in multi-branch architectures, and (iii) the under-utilization of spectral information in capturing global motion patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient EAR framework named HoloEv-Net. First, to simultaneously tackle representation and structural redundancies, we introduce a Compact Holographic Spatiotemporal Representation (CHSR). Departing from computationally expensive voxel grids, CHSR implicitly embeds horizontal spatial cues into the Time-Height (T-H) view, effectively preserving 3D spatiotemporal contexts within a 2D representation. Second, to exploit the neglected spectral cues, we design a Global Spectral Gating (GSG) module. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for global token mixing in the frequency domain, GSG enhances the representation capability with negligible parameter overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our framework. Specifically, HoloEv-Net-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance on THU-EACT-50-CHL, HARDVS and DailyDVS-200, outperforming existing methods by 10.29%, 1.71% and 6.25%, respectively. Furthermore, our lightweight variant, HoloEv-Net-Small, delivers highly competitive accuracy while offering extreme efficiency, reducing parameters by 5.4 times, FLOPs by 300times, and latency by 2.4times compared to heavy baselines, demonstrating its potential for edge deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most prior instruction-following planners rely on simulations or fixed commands, limiting real-world generalization. The study aims to bridge this gap by leveraging free-form language instructions.

Method: OpenEMMA, an MLLM-based driving framework, is adapted to incorporate doScenes' passenger-style prompts. The system ingests front-camera views and ego-state to output trajectories.

Result: Instruction conditioning reduces mean ADE by 98.7% by preventing extreme failures. Well-phrased prompts improve ADE by up to 5.1% even without outliers.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of instruction conditioning for robust driving behavior and discusses the qualities of effective prompts. The dataset and code are released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Instruction-grounded driving, where passenger language guides trajectory planning, requires vehicles to understand intent before motion. However, most prior instruction-following planners rely on simulation or fixed command vocabularies, limiting real-world generalization. doScenes, the first real-world dataset linking free-form instructions (with referentiality) to nuScenes ground-truth motion, enables instruction-conditioned planning. In this work, we adapt OpenEMMA, an open-source MLLM-based end-to-end driving framework that ingests front-camera views and ego-state and outputs 10-step speed-curvature trajectories, to this setting, presenting a reproducible instruction-conditioned baseline on doScenes and investigate the effects of human instruction prompts on predicted driving behavior. We integrate doScenes directives as passenger-style prompts within OpenEMMA's vision-language interface, enabling linguistic conditioning before trajectory generation. Evaluated on 849 annotated scenes using ADE, we observe that instruction conditioning substantially improves robustness by preventing extreme baseline failures, yielding a 98.7% reduction in mean ADE. When such outliers are removed, instructions still influence trajectory alignment, with well-phrased prompts improving ADE by up to 5.1%. We use this analysis to discuss what makes a "good" instruction for the OpenEMMA framework. We release the evaluation prompts and scripts to establish a reproducible baseline for instruction-aware planning. GitHub: https://github.com/Mi3-Lab/doScenes-VLM-Planning

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiMo introduces a discrete diffusion framework for bidirectional text-motion tasks, unifying generation and understanding within a single model, and offers quality-latency trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus mainly on text-to-motion, ignoring bidirectional tasks. DiMo aims to bridge this gap.

Method: DiMo uses iterative masked token refinement, RVQ for motion token fidelity, and GRPO for alignment.

Result: Achieves strong motion quality and bidirectional understanding on HumanML3D and KIT-ML.

Conclusion: DiMo successfully unifies multiple tasks and demonstrates versatility in motion generation and understanding.

Abstract: Prior masked modeling motion generation methods predominantly study text-to-motion. We present DiMo, a discrete diffusion-style framework, which extends masked modeling to bidirectional text--motion understanding and generation. Unlike GPT-style autoregressive approaches that tokenize motion and decode sequentially, DiMo performs iterative masked token refinement, unifying Text-to-Motion (T2M), Motion-to-Text (M2T), and text-free Motion-to-Motion (M2M) within a single model. This decoding paradigm naturally enables a quality-latency trade-off at inference via the number of refinement steps.We further improve motion token fidelity with residual vector quantization (RVQ) and enhance alignment and controllability with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show strong motion quality and competitive bidirectional understanding under a unified framework. In addition, we demonstrate model ability in text-free motion completion, text-guided motion prediction and motion caption correction without architectural change.Additional qualitative results are available on our project page: https://animotionlab.github.io/DiMo/.

### [32] [Continuous Degradation Modeling via Latent Flow Matching for Real-World Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04193)
*Hyeonjae Kim,Dongjin Kim,Eugene Jin,Tae Hyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework synthesizes realistic low-resolution (LR) images from high-resolution (HR) ones using flow matching, enabling better training for super-resolution (SR) models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SR methods perform poorly on real-world images due to complex degradations; current datasets are limited and labor-intensive to create.

Method: Leverages latent degradation space with flow matching to synthesize LR images with realistic artifacts at various degradation levels.

Result: Synthetic LR images accurately replicate real-world degradations, and SR models trained on these datasets achieve superior HR outcomes.

Conclusion: The framework effectively generates realistic LR images, improving SR performance on real-world images.

Abstract: While deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have shown impressive outcomes with synthetic degradation scenarios such as bicubic downsampling, they frequently struggle to perform well on real-world images that feature complex, nonlinear degradations like noise, blur, and compression artifacts. Recent efforts to address this issue have involved the painstaking compilation of real low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs, usually limited to several specific downscaling factors. To address these challenges, our work introduces a novel framework capable of synthesizing authentic LR images from a single HR image by leveraging the latent degradation space with flow matching. Our approach generates LR images with realistic artifacts at unseen degradation levels, which facilitates the creation of large-scale, real-world SR training datasets. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments verify that our synthetic LR images accurately replicate real-world degradations. Furthermore, both traditional and arbitrary-scale SR models trained using our datasets consistently yield much better HR outcomes.

*Feng Wang,Yichun Shi,Ceyuan Yang,Qiushan Guo,Jingxiang Sun,Alan Yuille,Peng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTok is a unified video tokenization framework that decouples spatial and temporal representations, improving efficiency and performance in video understanding and generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language systems tokenize videos naively, leading to high complexity. VTok aims to reduce this complexity while maintaining expressive representations by separating spatial and temporal features.

Method: VTok retains spatial features from a key frame and encodes subsequent frames as residual tokens, reducing token count while capturing motion and viewpoint changes.

Result: VTok outperforms baselines in video understanding and generation, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency with shorter token sequences.

Conclusion: VTok provides a compact and effective tokenization method for video tasks, serving as a potential standard for future research.

Abstract: This work presents VTok, a unified video tokenization framework that can be used for both generation and understanding tasks. Unlike the leading vision-language systems that tokenize videos through a naive frame-sampling strategy, we propose to decouple the spatial and temporal representations of videos by retaining the spatial features of a single key frame while encoding each subsequent frame into a single residual token, achieving compact yet expressive video tokenization. Our experiments suggest that VTok effectively reduces the complexity of video representation from the product of frame count and per-frame token count to their sum, while the residual tokens sufficiently capture viewpoint and motion changes relative to the key frame. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of VTok: it achieves notably higher performance on a range of video understanding and text-to-video generation benchmarks compared with baselines using naive tokenization, all with shorter token sequences per video (e.g., 3.4% higher accuracy on our TV-Align benchmark and 1.9% higher VBench score). Remarkably, VTok produces more coherent motion and stronger guidance following in text-to-video generation, owing to its more consistent temporal encoding. We hope VTok can serve as a standardized video tokenization paradigm for future research in video understanding and generation.

*Chao Li,Rui Zhang,Siyuan Huang,Xian Zhong,Hongbo Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AGMA introduces adaptive priors to improve multimodal trajectory forecasting by capturing diverse behavioral patterns, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to fully capture the distribution of plausible futures due to misaligned or fixed priors, limiting accuracy and diversity.

Method: AGMA uses a two-stage process: extracting diverse patterns from training data and distilling them into scene-adaptive priors.

Result: AGMA outperforms existing methods on ETH-UCY, Stanford Drone, and JRDB datasets.

Conclusion: High-quality priors are crucial for accurate and diverse trajectory forecasting, as demonstrated by AGMA's success.

Abstract: Human trajectory forecasting requires capturing the multimodal nature of pedestrian behavior. However, existing approaches suffer from prior misalignment. Their learned or fixed priors often fail to capture the full distribution of plausible futures, limiting both prediction accuracy and diversity. We theoretically establish that prediction error is lower-bounded by prior quality, making prior modeling a key performance bottleneck. Guided by this insight, we propose AGMA (Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Anchors), which constructs expressive priors through two stages: extracting diverse behavioral patterns from training data and distilling them into a scene-adaptive global prior for inference. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, Stanford Drone, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that AGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming the critical role of high-quality priors in trajectory forecasting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: One-DVA introduces a transformer-based video autoencoder with adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding, overcoming limitations of fixed-rate compression and inflexible architectures while improving compression ratios and generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of existing video autoencoders—fixed-rate compression, inflexible CNN architectures, and deterministic decoders—to enable adaptive compression and better generative modeling.

Method: Uses query-based vision transformers for encoding with variable-length dropout, and a pixel-space diffusion transformer for decoding. Includes a two-stage training strategy and regularization for generative modeling.

Result: Matches 3D-CNN VAEs in reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios while supporting higher compression rates and better generative modeling.

Conclusion: One-DVA offers an adaptable, high-performance solution for video compression and generative modeling, surpassing traditional methods in flexibility and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent video generation models largely rely on video autoencoders that compress pixel-space videos into latent representations. However, existing video autoencoders suffer from three major limitations: (1) fixed-rate compression that wastes tokens on simple videos, (2) inflexible CNN architectures that prevent variable-length latent modeling, and (3) deterministic decoders that struggle to recover appropriate details from compressed latents. To address these issues, we propose One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA), a transformer-based framework for adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding. The encoder employs query-based vision transformers to extract spatiotemporal features and produce latent representations, while a variable-length dropout mechanism dynamically adjusts the latent length. The decoder is a pixel-space diffusion transformer that reconstructs videos with the latents as input conditions. With a two-stage training strategy, One-DVA achieves performance comparable to 3D-CNN VAEs on reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios. More importantly, it supports adaptive compression and thus can achieve higher compression ratios. To better support downstream latent generation, we further regularize the One-DVA latent distribution for generative modeling and fine-tune its decoder to mitigate artifacts caused by the generation process.

TL;DR: IF-UNet integrates intuitionistic fuzzy logic into UNet to better handle uncertainty in MRI brain image segmentation, improving accuracy and performance metrics like Dice coefficient and IoU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UNet models struggle with uncertainty due to partial volume effects in brain images, necessitating an enhanced approach.

Method: The proposed IF-UNet incorporates intuitionistic fuzzy logic, processing input data via membership, nonmembership, and hesitation degrees to address tissue ambiguity.

Result: Evaluated on the IBSR dataset, IF-UNet shows improved segmentation quality, measured by accuracy, Dice coefficient, and IoU.

Conclusion: IF-UNet effectively enhances segmentation by managing uncertainty in brain images, outperforming traditional UNet approaches.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of MRI brain images is essential for image analysis, diagnosis of neuro-logical disorders and medical image computing. In the deep learning approach, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), especially UNet, are widely applied in medical image segmentation. However, it is difficult to deal with uncertainty due to the partial volume effect in brain images. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced framework, named UNet with intuitionistic fuzzy logic (IF-UNet), which incorporates intuitionistic fuzzy logic into UNet. The model processes input data in terms of membership, nonmembership, and hesitation degrees, allowing it to better address tissue ambiguity resulting from partial volume effects and boundary uncertainties. The proposed architecture is evaluated on the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR) dataset, and its performance is computed using accuracy, Dice coefficient, and intersection over union (IoU). Experimental results confirm that IF-UNet improves segmentation quality with handling uncertainty in brain images.

*Suzeyu Chen,Leheng Li,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPOT-Occ, a Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder for efficient 3D occupancy prediction in autonomous vehicles, improving speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate, real-time 3D occupancy prediction in autonomous vehicles drives the development of efficient sparse representations and decoders.

Method: Proposes a two-stage process: guided feature selection via adaptive prototype identification and focused aggregation, enhanced by a denoising paradigm for stability.

Result: SPOT-Occ outperforms previous methods in speed and accuracy, demonstrating significant improvements.

Conclusion: The approach efficiently addresses the decoder challenge in sparse 3D representations, offering practical benefits for autonomous vehicle deployment.

Abstract: Achieving highly accurate and real-time 3D occupancy prediction from cameras is a critical requirement for the safe and practical deployment of autonomous vehicles. While this shift to sparse 3D representations solves the encoding bottleneck, it creates a new challenge for the decoder: how to efficiently aggregate information from a sparse, non-uniformly distributed set of voxel features without resorting to computationally prohibitive dense attention.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder that replaces this costly interaction with an efficient, two-stage process of guided feature selection and focused aggregation. Our core idea is to make the decoder's attention prototype-guided. We achieve this through a sparse prototype selection mechanism, where each query adaptively identifies a compact set of the most salient voxel features, termed prototypes, for focused feature aggregation.
  To ensure this dynamic selection is stable and effective, we introduce a complementary denoising paradigm. This approach leverages ground-truth masks to provide explicit guidance, guaranteeing a consistent query-prototype association across decoder layers. Our model, dubbed SPOT-Occ, outperforms previous methods with a significant margin in speed while also improving accuracy. Source code is released at https://github.com/chensuzeyu/SpotOcc.

*Aditya R. Bhattacharya,Debanjan Goswami,Shayok Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ACIL, an active learning framework for class incremental learning to reduce annotation costs and prevent catastrophic forgetting by selecting uncertain and diverse samples for annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual learning methods assume fully annotated episodes, leading to high annotation costs and wasted effort, as data from previous episodes becomes inaccessible. Active learning can mitigate this by selecting only informative samples.

Method: The authors introduce ACIL, which uses uncertainty and diversity criteria to identify exemplar samples for annotation in each episode, ensuring these samples are appended to future episodes.

Result: Empirical analyses on vision datasets validate ACIL's effectiveness in reducing annotation costs and preventing catastrophic forgetting compared to baselines.

Conclusion: ACIL offers a practical solution for class incremental learning by combining active learning with continual learning, significantly lowering annotation effort while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Continual learning (or class incremental learning) is a realistic learning scenario for computer vision systems, where deep neural networks are trained on episodic data, and the data from previous episodes are generally inaccessible to the model. Existing research in this domain has primarily focused on avoiding catastrophic forgetting, which occurs due to the continuously changing class distributions in each episode and the inaccessibility of the data from previous episodes. However, these methods assume that all the training samples in every episode are annotated; this not only incurs a huge annotation cost, but also results in a wastage of annotation effort, since most of the samples in a given episode will not be accessible to the model in subsequent episodes. Active learning algorithms identify the salient and informative samples from large amounts of unlabeled data and are instrumental in reducing the human annotation effort in inducing a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose ACIL, a novel active learning framework for class incremental learning settings. We exploit a criterion based on uncertainty and diversity to identify the exemplar samples that need to be annotated in each episode, and will be appended to the data in the next episode. Such a framework can drastically reduce annotation cost and can also avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our extensive empirical analyses on several vision datasets corroborate the promise and potential of our framework against relevant baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a depth-guided framework for monocular video human mesh recovery, addressing metric consistency and temporal stability issues through integrated modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges in existing methods—depth ambiguities, scale uncertainties, and occlusion-induced instabilities—motivate the proposed depth-guided approach.

Method: The framework includes three components: Depth-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion (RGB-geometry integration), D-MAPS (scale-consistent initialization), and MoDAR (temporal refinement via motion-depth alignment).

Result: The method outperforms benchmarks, showing robustness against occlusion and improved spatial accuracy while remaining efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses metric consistency and temporal stability in human mesh recovery, demonstrating significant advancements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Monocular video human mesh recovery faces fundamental challenges in maintaining metric consistency and temporal stability due to inherent depth ambiguities and scale uncertainties. While existing methods rely primarily on RGB features and temporal smoothing, they struggle with depth ordering, scale drift, and occlusion-induced instabilities. We propose a comprehensive depth-guided framework that achieves metric-aware temporal consistency through three synergistic components: A Depth-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion module that adaptively integrates geometric priors with RGB features via confidence-aware gating; A Depth-guided Metric-Aware Pose and Shape (D-MAPS) estimator that leverages depth-calibrated bone statistics for scale-consistent initialization; A Motion-Depth Aligned Refinement (MoDAR) module that enforces temporal coherence through cross-modal attention between motion dynamics and geometric cues. Our method achieves superior results on three challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against heavy occlusion and spatial accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Yong Li,Yuanzhi Wang,Yi Ding,Shiqing Zhang,Ke Lu,Cuntai Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DHMD is a novel MER framework that decouples multimodal features into homogeneous and heterogeneous components, using a hierarchical distillation strategy for improved cross-modal alignment and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MER methods struggle with multimodal heterogeneities and varying modality contributions, prompting the need for better feature integration and alignment.

Method: DHMD decouples features into modality-irrelevant/exclusive parts and employs a two-stage knowledge distillation (coarse-grained via GD-Unit and fine-grained via cross-modal dictionary matching).

Result: DHMD outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods, showing relative improvements in accuracy (ACC) and F1 scores on CMU-MOSI/MOSEI datasets.

Conclusion: DHMD effectively addresses multimodal heterogeneity and enhances MER performance through hierarchical distillation and feature decoupling, validated by both quantitative and visualization results.

Abstract: Human multimodal emotion recognition (MER) seeks to infer human emotions by integrating information from language, visual, and acoustic modalities. Although existing MER approaches have achieved promising results, they still struggle with inherent multimodal heterogeneities and varying contributions from different modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Decoupled Hierarchical Multimodal Distillation (DHMD). DHMD decouples each modality's features into modality-irrelevant (homogeneous) and modality-exclusive (heterogeneous) components using a self-regression mechanism. The framework employs a two-stage knowledge distillation (KD) strategy: (1) coarse-grained KD via a Graph Distillation Unit (GD-Unit) in each decoupled feature space, where a dynamic graph facilitates adaptive distillation among modalities, and (2) fine-grained KD through a cross-modal dictionary matching mechanism, which aligns semantic granularities across modalities to produce more discriminative MER representations. This hierarchical distillation approach enables flexible knowledge transfer and effectively improves cross-modal feature alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that DHMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods, achieving 1.3\%/2.4\% (ACC$_7$), 1.3\%/1.9\% (ACC$_2$) and 1.9\%/1.8\% (F1) relative improvement on CMU-MOSI/CMU-MOSEI dataset, respectively. Meanwhile, visualization results reveal that both the graph edges and dictionary activations in DHMD exhibit meaningful distribution patterns across modality-irrelevant/-exclusive feature spaces.

*Siyu Jiang,Feiyang Chen,Xiaojin Zhang,Kun He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KVSmooth is a training-free, plug-and-play method to reduce hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models by adaptively smoothing hidden states based on attention entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination in MLLMs (generating visually inconsistent outputs) hinders reliable deployment, especially as outputs diverge from visual facts with longer sequences.

Method: KVSmooth uses attention-entropy-guided adaptive smoothing on hidden states via exponential moving average (EMA) on KV-Cache, adjusting smoothing strength dynamically.

Result: KVSmooth reduces hallucination (CHAIR_S from 41.8 to 18.2) and improves performance (F1 score from 77.5 to 79.2) without sacrificing precision or recall.

Conclusion: KVSmooth is an effective and general solution for mitigating hallucination in MLLMs during inference, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Despite the significant progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, hallucination -- corresponding to the generation of visually inconsistent objects, attributes, or relations -- remains a major obstacle to their reliable deployment. Unlike pure language models, MLLMs must ground their generation process in visual inputs. However, existing models often suffer from semantic drift during decoding, causing outputs to diverge from visual facts as the sequence length increases.
  To address this issue, we propose KVSmooth, a training-free and plug-and-play method that mitigates hallucination by performing attention-entropy-guided adaptive smoothing on hidden states. Specifically, KVSmooth applies an exponential moving average (EMA) to both keys and values in the KV-Cache, while dynamically quantifying the sink degree of each token through the entropy of its attention distribution to adaptively adjust the smoothing strength.
  Unlike computationally expensive retraining or contrastive decoding methods, KVSmooth operates efficiently during inference without additional training or model modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSmooth significantly reduces hallucination ($\mathit{CHAIR}_{S}$ from $41.8 \rightarrow 18.2$) while improving overall performance ($F_1$ score from $77.5 \rightarrow 79.2$), achieving higher precision and recall simultaneously. In contrast, prior methods often improve one at the expense of the other, validating the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

TL;DR: SkeletonGaussian is a framework for generating editable dynamic 3D Gaussians from monocular video, using a hierarchical articulated representation for motion control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D generation methods lack direct control and editability due to implicit motion representations. SkeletonGaussian aims to address this by introducing explicit motion decomposition.

Method: The approach uses a skeleton-driven hierarchical representation: rigid motion via linear blend skinning and fine-grained non-rigid motion with hexplane-based refinement.

Result: SkeletonGaussian outperforms existing methods in generation quality and enables intuitive motion editing.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a new paradigm for editable 4D generation, improving interpretability and control.

Abstract: 4D generation has made remarkable progress in synthesizing dynamic 3D objects from input text, images, or videos. However, existing methods often represent motion as an implicit deformation field, which limits direct control and editability. To address this issue, we propose SkeletonGaussian, a novel framework for generating editable dynamic 3D Gaussians from monocular video input. Our approach introduces a hierarchical articulated representation that decomposes motion into sparse rigid motion explicitly driven by a skeleton and fine-grained non-rigid motion. Concretely, we extract a robust skeleton and drive rigid motion via linear blend skinning, followed by a hexplane-based refinement for non-rigid deformations, enhancing interpretability and editability. Experimental results demonstrate that SkeletonGaussian surpasses existing methods in generation quality while enabling intuitive motion editing, establishing a new paradigm for editable 4D generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LASER improves LVLMs by dynamically selecting task-appropriate layers for visual grounding, enhancing accuracy across complex VQA tasks without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs use fixed visual-token budgets and static attention layers, which may not adapt well to complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposed VAQ metric identifies relevant layers for grounding; LASER adaptively selects layers for localization and QA.

Result: LASER significantly boosts VQA accuracy across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dynamic visual grounding via VAQ and LASER outperforms static methods, improving LVLM performance.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced rapidly by aligning visual patches with the text embedding space, but a fixed visual-token budget forces images to be resized to a uniform pretraining resolution, often erasing fine-grained details and causing hallucinations via over-reliance on language priors. Recent attention-guided enhancement (e.g., cropping or region-focused attention allocation) alleviates this, yet it commonly hinges on a static "magic layer" empirically chosen on simple recognition benchmarks and thus may not transfer to complex reasoning tasks. In contrast to this static assumption, we propose a dynamic perspective on visual grounding. Through a layer-wise sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that visual grounding is a dynamic process: while simple object recognition tasks rely on middle layers, complex visual search and reasoning tasks require visual information to be reactivated at deeper layers. Based on this observation, we introduce Visual Activation by Query (VAQ), a metric that identifies the layer whose attention map is most relevant to query-specific visual grounding by measuring attention sensitivity to the input query. Building on VAQ, we further propose LASER (Layer-adaptive Attention-guided Selective visual and decoding Enhancement for Reasoning), a training-free inference procedure that adaptively selects task-appropriate layers for visual localization and question answering. Experiments across diverse VQA benchmarks show that LASER significantly improves VQA accuracy across tasks with varying levels of complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reconstructing animatable 3D human avatars struggle with inaccurate camera parameters and poses in real-world settings, especially in unconstrained scenarios.

Method: JOintGS introduces a unified framework that refines camera extrinsics, human poses, and 3D Gaussian representations through foreground-background disentanglement, temporal dynamics, and residual color fields.

Result: The method achieves a 2.1 dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods on the NeuMan dataset and maintains real-time rendering with enhanced robustness to noisy initialization.

Conclusion: JOintGS effectively addresses challenges in reconstructing high-fidelity avatars from monocular videos, outperforming existing methods in quality and applicability.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable 3D human avatars from monocular RGB videos remains challenging, particularly in unconstrained in-the-wild scenarios where camera parameters and human poses from off-the-shelf methods (e.g., COLMAP, HMR2.0) are often inaccurate. Splatting (3DGS) advances demonstrate impressive rendering quality and real-time performance, they critically depend on precise camera calibration and pose annotations, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We present JOintGS, a unified framework that jointly optimizes camera extrinsics, human poses, and 3D Gaussian representations from coarse initialization through a synergistic refinement mechanism. Our key insight is that explicit foreground-background disentanglement enables mutual reinforcement: static background Gaussians anchor camera estimation via multi-view consistency; refined cameras improve human body alignment through accurate temporal correspondence; optimized human poses enhance scene reconstruction by removing dynamic artifacts from static constraints. We further introduce a temporal dynamics module to capture fine-grained pose-dependent deformations and a residual color field to model illumination variations. Extensive experiments on NeuMan and EMDB datasets demonstrate that JOintGS achieves superior reconstruction quality, with 2.1~dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods on NeuMan dataset, while maintaining real-time rendering. Notably, our method shows significantly enhanced robustness to noisy initialization compared to the baseline.Our source code is available at https://github.com/MiliLab/JOintGS.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MSRL, a method for learning invariant representations from heterogeneous multiview data derived from various pretrained models, using self-representation learning and distribution consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of learning invariant representations from diverse pretrained models' feature distributions motivates the need for a unified approach like MSRL.

Method: MSRL uses self-representation learning and an information-passing mechanism to aggregate features, with distribution consistency guiding multiview learning.

Result: Experiments show MSRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: MSRL effectively learns invariant representations from heterogeneous views, validated by theoretical and experimental results.

Abstract: Features of the same sample generated by different pretrained models often exhibit inherently distinct feature distributions because of discrepancies in the model pretraining objectives or architectures. Learning invariant representations from large-scale unlabeled visual data with various pretrained models in a fully unsupervised transfer manner remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a multiview self-representation learning (MSRL) method in which invariant representations are learned by exploiting the self-representation property of features across heterogeneous views. The features are derived from large-scale unlabeled visual data through transfer learning with various pretrained models and are referred to as heterogeneous multiview data. An individual linear model is stacked on top of its corresponding frozen pretrained backbone. We introduce an information-passing mechanism that relies on self-representation learning to support feature aggregation over the outputs of the linear model. Moreover, an assignment probability distribution consistency scheme is presented to guide multiview self-representation learning by exploiting complementary information across different views. Consequently, representation invariance across different linear models is enforced through this scheme. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the information-passing mechanism, the assignment probability distribution consistency and the incremental views. Extensive experiments with multiple benchmark visual datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSRL method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, but adapting them to downstream tasks typically requires costly labeled data. Existing unsupervised self-training methods rely on pseudo-labeling, yet often suffer from unreliable confidence filtering, confirmation bias, and underutilization of low-confidence samples. We propose Collaborative Fine-Tuning (CoFT), an unsupervised adaptation framework that leverages unlabeled data through a dual-model, cross-modal collaboration mechanism. CoFT introduces a dual-prompt learning strategy with positive and negative textual prompts to explicitly model pseudo-label cleanliness in a sample-dependent manner, removing the need for hand-crafted thresholds or noise assumptions. The negative prompt also regularizes lightweight visual adaptation modules, improving robustness under noisy supervision. CoFT employs a two-phase training scheme, transitioning from parameter-efficient fine-tuning on high-confidence samples to full fine-tuning guided by collaboratively filtered pseudo-labels. Building on CoFT, CoFT+ further enhances adaptation via iterative fine-tuning, momentum contrastive learning, and LLM-generated prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over existing unsupervised methods and even few-shot supervised baselines.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP exhibit strong transferability, yet adapting them to downstream image classification tasks under limited annotation budgets remains challenging. In active learning settings, the model must select the most informative samples for annotation from a large pool of unlabeled data. Existing approaches typically estimate uncertainty via entropy-based criteria or representation clustering, without explicitly modeling uncertainty from the model perspective. In this work, we propose a robust uncertainty modeling framework for active CLIP adaptation based on dual-prompt tuning. We introduce two learnable prompts in the textual branch of CLIP. The positive prompt enhances the discriminability of task-specific textual embeddings corresponding to light-weight tuned visual embeddings, improving classification reliability. Meanwhile, the negative prompt is trained in an reversed manner to explicitly model the probability that the predicted label is correct, providing a principled uncertainty signal for guiding active sample selection. Extensive experiments across different fine-tuning paradigms demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing active learning methods under the same annotation budget.

TL;DR: NeMO is a novel object-centric representation for detecting, segmenting, and estimating 6DoF poses of unseen objects using RGB images, requiring only a few template views and no retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance interaction with novel objects by enabling few-shot perception without retraining or extensive preprocessing, improving scalability and efficiency.

Method: Uses an encoder to generate sparse object-like point clouds from RGB templates and a decoder for dense predictions. Leverages a learned UDF for semantic and geometric information.

Result: Achieves competitive and state-of-the-art results on BOP benchmark datasets for various perception tasks.

Conclusion: NeMO's versatility and efficiency make it scalable for quick object onboarding and multiple perception tasks.

Abstract: We present Neural Memory Object (NeMO), a novel object-centric representation that can be used to detect, segment and estimate the 6DoF pose of objects unseen during training using RGB images. Our method consists of an encoder that requires only a few RGB template views depicting an object to generate a sparse object-like point cloud using a learned UDF containing semantic and geometric information. Next, a decoder takes the object encoding together with a query image to generate a variety of dense predictions. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method can be used for few-shot object perception without requiring any camera-specific parameters or retraining on target data. Our proposed concept of outsourcing object information in a NeMO and using a single network for multiple perception tasks enhances interaction with novel objects, improving scalability and efficiency by enabling quick object onboarding without retraining or extensive pre-processing. We report competitive and state-of-the-art results on various datasets and perception tasks of the BOP benchmark, demonstrating the versatility of our approach. https://github.com/DLR-RM/nemo

*Teng-Fang Hsiao,Bo-Kai Ruan,Yu-Lun Liu,Hong-Han Shuai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VecSet-Edit introduces a novel pipeline for direct 3D mesh editing using VecSet tokens, overcoming limitations of voxel-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D editing methods primarily focus on Gaussian Splatting or multi-view images, neglecting direct mesh editing. Voxel-based approaches like VoxHammer suffer from resolution limits and require intensive 3D masks.

Method: VecSet-Edit uses VecSet LRM as a backbone, analyzing spatial properties of tokens to govern geometric regions. It employs Mask-guided Token Seeding, Attention-aligned Token Gating, Drift-aware Token Pruning, and Detail-preserving Texture Baking.

Result: The proposed method precisely localizes target regions using 2D image conditions, rejects geometric outliers during denoising, and preserves both geometric and textural details.

Conclusion: VecSet-Edit is a pioneering approach for efficient and high-fidelity 3D mesh editing, addressing gaps in current literature.

Abstract: 3D editing has emerged as a critical research area to provide users with flexible control over 3D assets. While current editing approaches predominantly focus on 3D Gaussian Splatting or multi-view images, the direct editing of 3D meshes remains underexplored. Prior attempts, such as VoxHammer, rely on voxel-based representations that suffer from limited resolution and necessitate labor-intensive 3D mask. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{VecSet-Edit}, the first pipeline that leverages the high-fidelity VecSet Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) as a backbone for mesh editing. Our approach is grounded on a analysis of the spatial properties in VecSet tokens, revealing that token subsets govern distinct geometric regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Mask-guided Token Seeding and Attention-aligned Token Gating strategies to precisely localize target regions using only 2D image conditions. Also, considering the difference between VecSet diffusion process versus voxel we design a Drift-aware Token Pruning to reject geometric outliers during the denoising process. Finally, our Detail-preserving Texture Baking module ensures that we not only preserve the geometric details of original mesh but also the textural information.

TL;DR: SAGA, an attention-guided adversarial attack framework, efficiently targets high-attention regions in LVLMs, outperforming random cropping methods in success rates and imperceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in existing adversarial attacks on LVLMs, particularly random cropping, which lacks precision in using perturbation budgets.

Method: Proposes SAGA, a stage-wise framework that progressively focuses perturbations on high-attention regions, guided by regional attention scores.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates across ten LVLMs while maintaining high imperceptibility.

Conclusion: SAGA demonstrates the effectiveness of structured, attention-guided perturbations in improving adversarial attack efficiency and success.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are crucial for exposing safety vulnerabilities in modern multimodal systems. Recent attacks based on input transformations, such as random cropping, suggest that spatially localized perturbations can be more effective than global image manipulation. However, randomly cropping the entire image is inherently stochastic and fails to use the limited per-pixel perturbation budget efficiently. We make two key observations: (i) regional attention scores are positively correlated with adversarial loss sensitivity, and (ii) attacking high-attention regions induces a structured redistribution of attention toward subsequent salient regions. Based on these findings, we propose Stage-wise Attention-Guided Attack (SAGA), an attention-guided framework that progressively concentrates perturbations on high-attention regions. SAGA enables more efficient use of constrained perturbation budgets, producing highly imperceptible adversarial examples while consistently achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates across ten LVLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/jackwaky/SAGA.

### [51] [SparVAR: Exploring Sparsity in Visual AutoRegressive Modeling for Training-Free Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04361)
*Zekun Li,Ning Wang,Tongxin Bai,Changwang Mei,Peisong Wang,Shuang Qiu,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparVAR is a training-free framework speeding up Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) modeling by exploiting attention properties, achieving faster inference without sacrificing image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VAR models face high computational complexity with increasing resolution, leading to latency. Existing accelerations compromise image quality by skipping high-resolution scales.

Method: SparVAR dynamically predicts sparse attention patterns for high-resolution scales using cross-scale activation similarity and locality, enabling efficient sparse computation. It includes a block-wise sparse kernel for faster processing.

Result: SparVAR reduces generation time for high-resolution images to 1s, speeds up inference by 1.57x compared to FlashAttention, and achieves up to 2.28x acceleration with scale-skipping while preserving quality.

Conclusion: SparVAR successfully addresses VAR's computational inefficiency, offering a balance between speed and quality for high-resolution image generation.

Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) modeling has garnered significant attention for its innovative next-scale prediction paradigm. However, mainstream VAR paradigms attend to all tokens across historical scales at each autoregressive step. As the next scale resolution grows, the computational complexity of attention increases quartically with resolution, causing substantial latency. Prior accelerations often skip high-resolution scales, which speeds up inference but discards high-frequency details and harms image quality. To address these problems, we present SparVAR, a training-free acceleration framework that exploits three properties of VAR attention: (i) strong attention sinks, (ii) cross-scale activation similarity, and (iii) pronounced locality. Specifically, we dynamically predict the sparse attention pattern of later high-resolution scales from a sparse decision scale, and construct scale self-similar sparse attention via an efficient index-mapping mechanism, enabling high-efficiency sparse attention computation at large scales. Furthermore, we propose cross-scale local sparse attention and implement an efficient block-wise sparse kernel, which achieves $\mathbf{> 5\times}$ faster forward speed than FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SparseVAR can reduce the generation time of an 8B model producing $1024\times1024$ high-resolution images to the 1s, without skipping the last scales. Compared with the VAR baseline accelerated by FlashAttention, our method achieves a $\mathbf{1.57\times}$ speed-up while preserving almost all high-frequency details. When combined with existing scale-skipping strategies, SparseVAR attains up to a $\mathbf{2.28\times}$ acceleration, while maintaining competitive visual generation quality.

TL;DR: UltraSeg family offers ultra-compressed models (<0.3 M parameters) for real-time polyp segmentation on CPUs, achieving high speed (90 FPS) and retaining accuracy (>94% Dice score vs. U-Net).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GPU-reliant segmentation models are impractical for resource-constrained settings like primary hospitals or mobile units. UltraSeg aims to bridge this gap with CPU-friendly solutions.

Method: Optimizes encoder-decoder widths, uses constrained dilated convolutions for larger receptive fields, and integrates a lightweight fusion module. Models include UltraSeg-108K (single-center) and UltraSeg-130K (multi-center).

Result: Achieves 90 FPS on a single CPU core with minimal accuracy loss (>94% Dice score compared to a 31 M-parameter U-Net). Evaluated on seven datasets.

Conclusion: UltraSeg provides a clinically viable, CPU-native solution for polyp segmentation and a blueprint for minimally invasive surgical vision applications. Source code is publicly available.

Abstract: Early detection of colorectal cancer hinges on real-time, accurate polyp identification and resection. Yet current high-precision segmentation models rely on GPUs, making them impractical to deploy in primary hospitals, mobile endoscopy units, or capsule robots. To bridge this gap, we present the UltraSeg family, operating in an extreme-compression regime (<0.3 M parameters). UltraSeg-108K (0.108 M parameters) is optimized for single-center data, while UltraSeg-130K (0.13 M parameters) generalizes to multi-center, multi-modal images. By jointly optimizing encoder-decoder widths, incorporating constrained dilated convolutions to enlarge receptive fields, and integrating a cross-layer lightweight fusion module, the models achieve 90 FPS on a single CPU core without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluated on seven public datasets, UltraSeg retains >94% of the Dice score of a 31 M-parameter U-Net while utilizing only 0.4% of its parameters, establishing a strong, clinically viable baseline for the extreme-compression domain and offering an immediately deployable solution for resource-constrained settings. This work provides not only a CPU-native solution for colonoscopy but also a reproducible blueprint for broader minimally invasive surgical vision applications. Source code is publicly available to ensure reproducibility and facilitate future benchmarking.

*Yixin Zhu,Long Lv,Pingping Zhang,Xuehu Liu,Tongdan Tang,Feng Tian,Weibing Sun,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ISFM, a novel framework for Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) that combines spatial and frequency features interactively, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMIF methods lack interaction between spatial and frequency domains, limiting their effectiveness. This paper aims to bridge this gap for better feature fusion.

Method: The proposed ISFM framework includes Modality-Specific Extractors (MSE), Multi-scale Frequency Fusion (MFF), and Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion (ISF) to enhance feature integration.

Result: Experiments on six datasets show ISFM achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ISFM effectively combines spatial and frequency features interactively, improving MMIF results.

Abstract: Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to combine images from different modalities to produce fused images, retaining texture details and preserving significant information. Recently, some MMIF methods incorporate frequency domain information to enhance spatial features. However, these methods typically rely on simple serial or parallel spatial-frequency fusion without interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba (ISFM) framework for MMIF. Specifically, we begin with a Modality-Specific Extractor (MSE) to extract features from different modalities. It models long-range dependencies across the image with linear computational complexity. To effectively leverage frequency information, we then propose a Multi-scale Frequency Fusion (MFF). It adaptively integrates low-frequency and high-frequency components across multiple scales, enabling robust representations of frequency features. More importantly, we further propose an Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion (ISF). It incorporates frequency features to guide spatial features across modalities, enhancing complementary representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on six MMIF datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our ISFM can achieve better performances than other state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/Namn23/ISFM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCUDiff improves human-centric image restoration by upgrading latent diffusion models to 16-channel space, using CSD and PPA for fidelity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack fidelity in human body restoration, and VAE bottlenecks limit performance in diffusion-based approaches.

Method: Upgrades pre-trained latent diffusion models to 16-channel space, uses CSD for VAE fine-tuning, PPA to bridge channel mismatch, and DeR for decoder routing.

Result: Achieves higher fidelity and fewer artifacts in mild degradations while maintaining one-step efficiency.

Conclusion: LCUDiff outperforms existing methods in human-centric image restoration, balancing fidelity and efficiency.

Abstract: Existing methods for restoring degraded human-centric images often struggle with insufficient fidelity, particularly in human body restoration (HBR). Recent diffusion-based restoration methods commonly adapt pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, where the variational autoencoder (VAE) can significantly bottleneck restoration fidelity. We propose LCUDiff, a stable one-step framework that upgrades a pre-trained latent diffusion model from the 4-channel latent space to the 16-channel latent space. For VAE fine-tuning, channel splitting distillation (CSD) is used to keep the first four channels aligned with pre-trained priors while allocating the additional channels to effectively encode high-frequency details. We further design prior-preserving adaptation (PPA) to smoothly bridge the mismatch between 4-channel diffusion backbones and the higher-dimensional 16-channel latent. In addition, we propose a decoder router (DeR) for per-sample decoder routing using restoration-quality score annotations, which improves visual quality across diverse conditions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show competitive results with higher fidelity and fewer artifacts under mild degradations, while preserving one-step efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Med-MMFL, the first comprehensive multimodal federated learning benchmark for the medical domain, addressing gaps in standardized evaluation for diverse modalities, tasks, and federation scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized benchmarks for multimodal federated learning (MMFL) in the medical domain hinders systematic understanding and advancement. Existing efforts are limited in modalities and tasks.

Method: The authors introduce Med-MMFL, evaluating six state-of-the-art FL algorithms across diverse modalities (text, images, ECG, X-ray, etc.), tasks (segmentation, classification, retrieval, VQA), and federation settings (natural, synthetic IID, non-IID).

Result: The benchmark spans 10 medical modalities, assesses multiple tasks, and releases data processing pipelines for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Med-MMFL fills a critical gap in medical MMFL research, providing a standardized benchmark for future method comparison and advancement.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized medical institutions while preserving data privacy. However, medical FL benchmarks remain scarce, with existing efforts focusing mainly on unimodal or bimodal modalities and a limited range of medical tasks. This gap underscores the need for standardized evaluation to advance systematic understanding in medical MultiModal FL (MMFL). To this end, we introduce Med-MMFL, the first comprehensive MMFL benchmark for the medical domain, encompassing diverse modalities, tasks, and federation scenarios. Our benchmark evaluates six representative state-of-the-art FL algorithms, covering different aggregation strategies, loss formulations, and regularization techniques. It spans datasets with 2 to 4 modalities, comprising a total of 10 unique medical modalities, including text, pathology images, ECG, X-ray, radiology reports, and multiple MRI sequences. Experiments are conducted across naturally federated, synthetic IID, and synthetic non-IID settings to simulate real-world heterogeneity. We assess segmentation, classification, modality alignment (retrieval), and VQA tasks. To support reproducibility and fair comparison of future multimodal federated learning (MMFL) methods under realistic medical settings, we release the complete benchmark implementation, including data processing and partitioning pipelines, at https://github.com/bhattarailab/Med-MMFL-Benchmark .

TL;DR: TrajVG improves 3D reconstruction in videos with object motion by explicitly predicting cross-frame 3D correspondence using trajectories, enhancing geometric consistency and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feed-forward 3D reconstruction models struggle with videos containing object motion due to ambiguous global references and drifting local pointmaps.

Method: TrajVG predicts 3D trajectories for cross-frame correspondence, coupling sparse trajectories, local pointmaps, and camera poses with geometric consistency objectives, and uses self-supervised training with pseudo 2D tracks.

Result: TrajVG outperforms baselines in 3D tracking, pose estimation, pointmap reconstruction, and video depth tasks.

Conclusion: TrajVG effectively addresses motion-related degradation in 3D reconstruction by leveraging explicit trajectory predictions and mixed supervision training.

Abstract: Feed-forward multi-frame 3D reconstruction models often degrade on videos with object motion. Global-reference becomes ambiguous under multiple motions, while the local pointmap relies heavily on estimated relative poses and can drift, causing cross-frame misalignment and duplicated structures. We propose TrajVG, a reconstruction framework that makes cross-frame 3D correspondence an explicit prediction by estimating camera-coordinate 3D trajectories. We couple sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (i) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (ii) a pose consistency objective driven by static track anchors that suppresses gradients from dynamic regions. To scale training to in-the-wild videos where 3D trajectory labels are scarce, we reformulate the same coupling constraints into self-supervised objectives using only pseudo 2D tracks, enabling unified training with mixed supervision. Extensive experiments across 3D tracking, pose estimation, pointmap reconstruction, and video depth show that TrajVG surpasses the current feedforward performance baseline.

Motivation: Progress in point tracking is hindered by limited high-quality, diverse datasets with imperfect annotations.

Method: A large-scale synthetic dataset (SynthVerse) is created, covering new domains and object types like animated-film content, manipulation, navigation, and articulated objects.

Result: Training with SynthVerse improves generalization in point tracking and exposes limitations of current trackers under diverse conditions.

Conclusion: SynthVerse enhances point tracking by providing high-quality, diverse data, enabling better training and evaluation.

Abstract: Point tracking aims to follow visual points through complex motion, occlusion, and viewpoint changes, and has advanced rapidly with modern foundation models. Yet progress toward general point tracking remains constrained by limited high-quality data, as existing datasets often provide insufficient diversity and imperfect trajectory annotations. To this end, we introduce SynthVerse, a large-scale, diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for point tracking. SynthVerse includes several new domains and object types missing from existing synthetic datasets, such as animated-film-style content, embodied manipulation, scene navigation, and articulated objects. SynthVerse substantially expands dataset diversity by covering a broader range of object categories and providing high-quality dynamic motions and interactions, enabling more robust training and evaluation for general point tracking. In addition, we establish a highly diverse point tracking benchmark to systematically evaluate state-of-the-art methods under broader domain shifts. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that training with SynthVerse yields consistent improvements in generalization and reveal limitations of existing trackers under diverse settings.

TL;DR: Seg-ReSearch is a novel segmentation paradigm that integrates reasoning and external search to handle dynamic queries beyond MLLMs' frozen knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation systems using MLLMs are limited by their static internal knowledge, making them unsuitable for dynamic or domain-specific scenarios.

Method: Seg-ReSearch interleaves reasoning with external search and uses hierarchical rewards for training to balance guidance and incentives.

Result: Seg-ReSearch significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods on the OK-VOS benchmark and other reasoning segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Seg-ReSearch addresses the knowledge bottleneck in segmentation, offering improved performance for open-world queries.

Abstract: Segmentation based on language has been a popular topic in computer vision. While recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have endowed segmentation systems with reasoning capabilities, these efforts remain confined by the frozen internal knowledge of MLLMs, which limits their potential for real-world scenarios that involve up-to-date information or domain-specific concepts. In this work, we propose \textbf{Seg-ReSearch}, a novel segmentation paradigm that overcomes the knowledge bottleneck of existing approaches. By enabling interleaved reasoning and external search, Seg-ReSearch empowers segmentation systems to handle dynamic, open-world queries that extend beyond the frozen knowledge of MLLMs. To effectively train this capability, we introduce a hierarchical reward design that harmonizes initial guidance with progressive incentives, mitigating the dilemma between sparse outcome signals and rigid step-wise supervision. For evaluation, we construct OK-VOS, a challenging benchmark that explicitly requires outside knowledge for video object segmentation. Experiments on OK-VOS and two existing reasoning segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our Seg-ReSearch improves state-of-the-art approaches by a substantial margin. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/iSEE-Laboratory/Seg-ReSearch.

TL;DR: Combining temporal slowness and central vision enhances semantic object representation learning from human-like visual input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how central vision and temporal slowness contribute to forming semantic object representations from natural visual experience.

Method: Simulated five months of human-like visual experience using the Ego4D dataset, predicted gaze coordinates, and trained a time-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning model on central vision crops.

Result: Central vision improves foreground object feature extraction, while temporal slowness encodes broader semantic object information.

Conclusion: The findings offer insights into human semantic object representation development.

Abstract: Humans acquire semantic object representations from egocentric visual streams with minimal supervision. Importantly, the visual system processes with high resolution only the center of its field of view and learns similar representations for visual inputs occurring close in time. This emphasizes slowly changing information around gaze locations. This study investigates the role of central vision and slowness learning in the formation of semantic object representations from human-like visual experience. We simulate five months of human-like visual experience using the Ego4D dataset and generate gaze coordinates with a state-of-the-art gaze prediction model. Using these predictions, we extract crops that mimic central vision and train a time-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning model on them. Our results show that combining temporal slowness and central vision improves the encoding of different semantic facets of object representations. Specifically, focusing on central vision strengthens the extraction of foreground object features, while considering temporal slowness, especially during fixational eye movements, allows the model to encode broader semantic information about objects. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which humans may develop semantic object representations from natural visual experience.

TL;DR: SALAD-Pan introduces a sensor-agnostic latent space diffusion method for efficient pansharpening, achieving faster inference and robust cross-sensor performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for pansharpening are slow and sensor-specific. SALAD-Pan aims to overcome these limitations by operating in latent space and accommodating diverse multispectral imagery.

Method: The method trains a single-channel VAE for latent encoding, uses spectral properties and imagery for diffusion control, and adds a cross-spectral attention module to enhance spectral consistency.

Result: SALAD-Pan outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three datasets, achieves 2-3x speedup, and demonstrates zero-shot cross-sensor capability.

Conclusion: SALAD-Pan is an efficient, high-precision pansharpening solution with broad applicability across sensors.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models bring novel insights for Pan-sharpening and notably boost fusion precision. However, most existing models perform diffusion in the pixel space and train distinct models for different multispectral (MS) imagery, suffering from high latency and sensor-specific limitations. In this paper, we present SALAD-Pan, a sensor-agnostic latent space diffusion method for efficient pansharpening. Specifically, SALAD-Pan trains a band-wise single-channel VAE to encode high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) into compact latent representations, supporting MS images with various channel counts and establishing a basis for acceleration. Then spectral physical properties, along with PAN and MS images, are injected into the diffusion backbone through unidirectional and bidirectional interactive control structures respectively, achieving high-precision fusion in the diffusion process. Finally, a lightweight cross-spectral attention module is added to the central layer of diffusion model, reinforcing spectral connections to boost spectral consistency and further elevate fusion precision. Experimental results on GaoFen-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 demonstrate that SALAD-Pan outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods across all three datasets, attains a 2-3x inference speedup, and exhibits robust zero-shot (cross-sensor) capability.

TL;DR: VaLR, a vision-aligned latent reasoning framework, addresses MLLMs' struggles with multi-step reasoning by dynamically generating vision-aligned latent tokens, improving performance and test-time scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with tasks requiring extensive multi-step reasoning due to visual information dilution in long-context generation.

Method: Introduces VaLR, a framework that generates vision-aligned latent tokens before reasoning steps, aligning MLLM intermediate embeddings with vision encoders to preserve visual knowledge.

Result: VaLR outperforms existing approaches, with a 19.9%p improvement on VSI-Bench, demonstrating better test-time scaling and long-context understanding.

Conclusion: VaLR effectively enhances MLLMs' reasoning by preserving visual cues, offering significant performance gains and scaling improvements.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse understanding tasks, these models struggle to solve problems which require extensive multi-step reasoning. This is primarily due to the progressive dilution of visual information during long-context generation, which hinders their ability to fully exploit test-time scaling. To address this issue, we introduce Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning (VaLR), a simple, yet effective reasoning framework that dynamically generates vision-aligned latent tokens before each Chain of Thought reasoning step, guiding the model to reason based on perceptual cues in the latent space. Specifically, VaLR is trained to preserve visual knowledge during reasoning by aligning intermediate embeddings of MLLM with those from vision encoders.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing memory limitations in extending foundation models for large-scale RGB stream 3D reconstruction.

Method: Proposes S-MUSt3R, leveraging sequence segmentation, segment alignment, and lightweight loop closure optimization without model retraining.

Result: Achieves accurate and consistent 3D reconstruction on long RGB sequences, outperforming traditional methods in scalability.

Conclusion: S-MUSt3R demonstrates the potential of foundation models for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world settings, with metric-space predictions.

Abstract: The recent paradigm shift in 3D vision led to the rise of foundation models with remarkable capabilities in 3D perception from uncalibrated images. However, extending these models to large-scale RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. This work proposes S-MUSt3R, a simple and efficient pipeline that extends the limits of foundation models for monocular 3D reconstruction. Our approach addresses the scalability bottleneck of foundation models through a simple strategy of sequence segmentation followed by segment alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without model retraining, we benefit from remarkable 3D reconstruction capacities of MUSt3R model and achieve trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods with more complex architecture. We evaluate S-MUSt3R on TUM, 7-Scenes and proprietary robot navigation datasets and show that S-MUSt3R runs successfully on long RGB sequences and produces accurate and consistent 3D reconstruction. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging the MUSt3R model for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, with an important advantage of making predictions directly in the metric space.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark dataset for mapping informal settlements, proposes a semi-supervised segmentation framework to address data challenges, and demonstrates superior performance across multiple cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid urban expansion has led to informal settlements, but mapping them is hindered by annotation scarcity and data quality issues like spectral ambiguity and annotation noise.

Method: A new semi-supervised segmentation framework with Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding and Prototype Bank System is introduced to mitigate class imbalance and feature degradation.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, showing superior domain transfer capability and achieving higher mIoU on unseen geographies with minimal labeled data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses challenges in mapping informal settlements, demonstrating robustness and scalability across diverse urban contexts.

Abstract: Rapid urban expansion has fueled the growth of informal settlements in major cities of low- and middle-income countries, with Lahore and Karachi in Pakistan and Mumbai in India serving as prominent examples. However, large-scale mapping of these settlements is severely constrained not only by the scarcity of annotations but by inherent data quality challenges, specifically high spectral ambiguity between formal and informal structures and significant annotation noise. We address this by introducing a benchmark dataset for Lahore, constructed from scratch, along with companion datasets for Karachi and Mumbai, which were derived from verified administrative boundaries, totaling 1,869 $\text{km}^2$ of area. To evaluate the global robustness of our framework, we extend our experiments to five additional established benchmarks, encompassing eight cities across three continents, and provide comprehensive data quality assessments of all datasets. We also propose a new semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to mitigate the class imbalance and feature degradation inherent in standard semi-supervised learning pipelines. Our method integrates a Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding mechanism that dynamically adjusts confidence thresholds to prevent minority class suppression and a Prototype Bank System that enforces semantic consistency by anchoring predictions to historically learned high-fidelity feature representations. Extensive experiments across a total of eight cities spanning three continents demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised baselines. Most notably, our method demonstrates superior domain transfer capability whereby a model trained on only 10% of source labels reaches a 0.461 mIoU on unseen geographies and outperforms the zero-shot generalization of fully supervised models.

TL;DR: NiFi introduces a diffusion-based method for extreme 3DGS compression, achieving high perceptual quality at very low rates (0.1 MB) and significant rate improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time novel view rendering but requires high storage space, limiting its use in applications like immersive communication. Current compression methods introduce artifacts at low rates.

Method: NiFi uses artifact-aware, diffusion-based one-step distillation for extreme 3DGS compression.

Result: NiFi achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality at extremely low rates (0.1 MB) and up to 1000x rate improvement over 3DGS.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses space limitations in 3DGS while maintaining high visual quality, with plans to open-source the code.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) revolutionized novel view rendering. Instead of inferring from dense spatial points, as implicit representations do, 3DGS uses sparse Gaussians. This enables real-time performance but increases space requirements, hindering applications such as immersive communication. 3DGS compression emerged as a field aimed at alleviating this issue. While impressive progress has been made, at low rates, compression introduces artifacts that degrade visual quality significantly. We introduce NiFi, a method for extreme 3DGS compression through restoration via artifact-aware, diffusion-based one-step distillation. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality at extremely low rates, down to 0.1 MB, and towards 1000x rate improvement over 3DGS at comparable perceptual performance. The code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DU-VLM, a hierarchical structured prediction model for understanding visual degradations, leveraging autoregressive prediction and multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lack understanding of parametric physics behind image degradations, prompting a need for a structured approach.

Method: DU-VLM uses autoregressive next-token prediction, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with structured rewards, alongside a new dataset (DU-110k).

Result: DU-VLM outperforms generalist baselines in accuracy and robustness, and serves as a zero-shot controller for diffusion models.

Conclusion: The hierarchical structured prediction paradigm effectively unifies degradation understanding tasks, enabling superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Understanding visual degradations is a critical yet challenging problem in computer vision. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at qualitative description, they often fall short in understanding the parametric physics underlying image degradations. In this work, we redefine degradation understanding as a hierarchical structured prediction task, necessitating the concurrent estimation of degradation types, parameter keys, and their continuous physical values. Although these sub-tasks operate in disparate spaces, we prove that they can be unified under one autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm, whose error is bounded by the value-space quantization grid. Building on this insight, we introduce DU-VLM, a multimodal chain-of-thought model trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning using structured rewards. Furthermore, we show that DU-VLM can serve as a zero-shot controller for pre-trained diffusion models, enabling high-fidelity image restoration without fine-tuning the generative backbone. We also introduce \textbf{DU-110k}, a large-scale dataset comprising 110,000 clean-degraded pairs with grounded physical annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms generalist baselines in both accuracy and robustness, exhibiting generalization to unseen distributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PEPR, a cross-modal framework using event cameras as privileged information to train robust RGB models, avoiding direct feature alignment and improving domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift poses challenges for visual perception models. The paper aims to improve robustness by leveraging complementary characteristics of RGB and event camera data.

Method: Proposes Privileged Event-based Predictive Regularization (PEPR) for training RGB models to predict event-based latent features, avoiding direct alignment.

Result: The RGB model trained with PEPR shows improved robustness to domain shifts like day-to-night, outperforming alignment-based methods in object detection and segmentation.

Conclusion: PEPR effectively leverages privileged event data to enhance RGB model robustness without losing semantic richness, proving superior to direct alignment approaches.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for visual perception are highly susceptible to domain shift, which poses a critical challenge for real-world deployment under conditions that differ from the training data. To address this domain generalization challenge, we propose a cross-modal framework under the learning using privileged information (LUPI) paradigm for training a robust, single-modality RGB model. We leverage event cameras as a source of privileged information, available only during training. The two modalities exhibit complementary characteristics: the RGB stream is semantically dense but domain-dependent, whereas the event stream is sparse yet more domain-invariant. Direct feature alignment between them is therefore suboptimal, as it forces the RGB encoder to mimic the sparse event representation, thereby losing semantic detail. To overcome this, we introduce Privileged Event-based Predictive Regularization (PEPR), which reframes LUPI as a predictive problem in a shared latent space. Instead of enforcing direct cross-modal alignment, we train the RGB encoder with PEPR to predict event-based latent features, distilling robustness without sacrificing semantic richness. The resulting standalone RGB model consistently improves robustness to day-to-night and other domain shifts, outperforming alignment-based baselines across object detection and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: SalFormer360 demonstrates superior performance in saliency estimation for 360-degree videos, leveraging transformer architecture and attention bias.

Abstract: Saliency estimation has received growing attention in recent years due to its importance in a wide range of applications. In the context of 360-degree video, it has been particularly valuable for tasks such as viewport prediction and immersive content optimization. In this paper, we propose SalFormer360, a novel saliency estimation model for 360-degree videos built on a transformer-based architecture. Our approach is based on the combination of an existing encoder architecture, SegFormer, and a custom decoder. The SegFormer model was originally developed for 2D segmentation tasks, and it has been fine-tuned to adapt it to 360-degree content. To further enhance prediction accuracy in our model, we incorporated Viewing Center Bias to reflect user attention in 360-degree environments. Extensive experiments on the three largest benchmark datasets for saliency estimation demonstrate that SalFormer360 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. In terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient, our model achieves 8.4% higher performance on Sport360, 2.5% on PVS-HM, and 18.6% on VR-EyeTracking compared to previous state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard vision models assume fixed channel spaces, but IMC lacks this due to varying marker sets. ImmuVis aims to solve this adaptability challenge.

Method: ImmuVis uses marker-adaptive hyperconvolutions to generate kernels from embeddings, enabling use on arbitrary marker subsets without retraining. Pretrained via self-supervised masked reconstruction on IMC17M.

Result: Outperforms SOTA baselines in virtual staining and classification tasks with lower compute cost. Provides calibrated uncertainty via heteroscedastic likelihood.

Conclusion: ImmuVis is an efficient, adaptable foundation model for real-world IMC applications.

Abstract: We present ImmuVis, an efficient convolutional foundation model for imaging mass cytometry (IMC), a high-throughput multiplex imaging technology that handles molecular marker measurements as image channels and enables large-scale spatial tissue profiling. Unlike natural images, multiplex imaging lacks a fixed channel space, as real-world marker sets vary across studies, violating a core assumption of standard vision backbones. To address this, ImmuVis introduces marker-adaptive hyperconvolutions that generate convolutional kernels from learned marker embeddings, enabling a single model to operate on arbitrary measured marker subsets without retraining. We pretrain ImmuVis on the largest to-date dataset, IMC17M (28 cohorts, 24,405 images, 265 markers, over 17M patches), using self-supervised masked reconstruction. ImmuVis outperforms SOTA baselines and ablations in virtual staining and downstream classification tasks at substantially lower compute cost than transformer-based alternatives, and is the sole model that provides calibrated uncertainty via a heteroscedastic likelihood objective. These results position ImmuVis as a practical, efficient foundation model for real-world IMC modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIO-FVLM accelerates VLM inference by reducing redundant visual tokens, prioritizing tokens crucial for preserving output invariance, achieving significant speedups and efficiency gains without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for visual token compression rely on heuristics, limiting performance and deployment. PIO-FVLM addresses this by focusing on preserving output invariance.

Method: PIO-FVLM reorders and selects visual tokens using gradient saliency and NMS, leveraging a layer-local proxy loss for coarse constraints. It is training-free and compatible with FlashAttention.

Result: On LLaVA-Next-7B, PIO-FVLM retains only 11.1% of tokens while maintaining 97.2% performance, with significant speedups (2.67× prefill, 2.11× inference), lower FLOPs (6.22×), and reduced KV Cache overhead (6.05×).

Conclusion: PIO-FVLM offers a practical, efficient solution for visual token compression in VLMs, balancing performance retention with substantial computational savings.

Abstract: Recently, reducing redundant visual tokens in vision-language models (VLMs) to accelerate VLM inference has emerged as a hot topic. However, most existing methods rely on heuristics constructed based on inter-visual-token similarity or cross-modal visual-text similarity, which gives rise to certain limitations in compression performance and practical deployment. In contrast, we propose PIO-FVLM from the perspective of inference objectives, which transforms visual token compression into preserving output result invariance and selects tokens primarily by their importance to this goal. Specially, vision tokens are reordered with the guidance of token-level gradient saliency generated by our designed layer-local proxy loss, a coarse constraint from the current layer to the final result. Then the most valuable vision tokens are selected following the non-maximum suppression (NMS) principle. The proposed PIO-FVLM is training-free and compatible with FlashAttention, friendly to practical application and deployment. It can be deployed independently as an encoder-free method, or combined with encoder compression approaches like VisionZip for use as an encoder-involved method. On LLaVA-Next-7B, PIO-FVLM retains just 11.1% of visual tokens but maintains 97.2% of the original performance, with a 2.67$\times$ prefill speedup, 2.11$\times$ inference speedup, 6.22$\times$ lower FLOPs, and 6.05$\times$ reduced KV Cache overhead.

TL;DR: AGILE is a robust framework for reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions from monocular videos, addressing limitations of neural rendering and SfM by using agentic generation and a contact-aware optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for reconstructing hand-object interactions face issues like fragmented geometries and reliance on brittle SfM initialization, which fail in real-world scenarios. AGILE aims to overcome these barriers.

Method: AGILE uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to guide generative synthesis of complete object meshes, bypasses SfM with a robust anchor-and-track strategy, and employs contact-aware optimization for physical plausibility.

Result: AGILE outperforms baselines in geometric accuracy and robustness, especially in challenging sequences, and produces simulation-ready assets validated for robotic applications.

Conclusion: AGILE advances the field by shifting from reconstruction to agentic generation, offering physically valid and robust solutions for dynamic hand-object interaction learning.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions from monocular videos is critical for dexterous manipulation data collection and creating realistic digital twins for robotics and VR. However, current methods face two prohibitive barriers: (1) reliance on neural rendering often yields fragmented, non-simulation-ready geometries under heavy occlusion, and (2) dependence on brittle Structure-from-Motion (SfM) initialization leads to frequent failures on in-the-wild footage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AGILE, a robust framework that shifts the paradigm from reconstruction to agentic generation for interaction learning. First, we employ an agentic pipeline where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) guides a generative model to synthesize a complete, watertight object mesh with high-fidelity texture, independent of video occlusions. Second, bypassing fragile SfM entirely, we propose a robust anchor-and-track strategy. We initialize the object pose at a single interaction onset frame using a foundation model and propagate it temporally by leveraging the strong visual similarity between our generated asset and video observations. Finally, a contact-aware optimization integrates semantic, geometric, and interaction stability constraints to enforce physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on HO3D, DexYCB, and in-the-wild videos reveal that AGILE outperforms baselines in global geometric accuracy while demonstrating exceptional robustness on challenging sequences where prior art frequently collapses. By prioritizing physical validity, our method produces simulation-ready assets validated via real-to-sim retargeting for robotic applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), a task combining RGB, depth, and language modalities for 3D-aware tracking, addressing limitations of existing RMOT models. It also presents DRSet, a dataset for evaluation, and DRTrack, a depth-referring tracking framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RMOT models struggle with complex spatial semantics and occlusion due to reliance on 2D RGB data alone. The authors aim to improve tracking accuracy by integrating depth and language modalities.

Method: The authors propose DRMOT, a task requiring fusion of RGB, depth, and language modalities. They introduce DRSet, a dataset with RGB images, depth maps, and language descriptions, and develop DRTrack, a framework leveraging MLLM-guided depth cues for robust tracking.

Result: Experiments on DRSet demonstrate DRTrack's effectiveness in depth-aware target grounding and trajectory association, showcasing improved performance.

Conclusion: The work advances RMOT by incorporating 3D spatial information, providing a new dataset (DRSet) and framework (DRTrack) for future research.

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to track specific targets based on language descriptions and is vital for interactive AI systems such as robotics and autonomous driving. However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues. Extensive experiments on the DRSet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: Proposes an annotation-free pipeline for detecting and segmenting space targets using Vision Language Models (VLMs), achieving significant performance improvements without manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation in space applications is challenging due to low visibility and object blending. VLMs offer potential but remain unexplored for this domain.

Method: Automatically generates pseudo-labels with a pre-trained VLM, then uses a teacher-student distillation framework to train lightweight models.

Result: Achieves up to 10-point improvements in average precision (AP) on segmentation tasks across SPARK-2024, SPEED+, and TANGO datasets.

Conclusion: The annotation-free pipeline using VLMs is effective for space target detection and segmentation, reducing reliance on manual labeling.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in open-world zero-shot visual recognition. However, their potential in space-related applications remains largely unexplored. In the space domain, accurate manual annotation is particularly challenging due to factors such as low visibility, illumination variations, and object blending with planetary backgrounds. Developing methods that can detect and segment spacecraft and orbital targets without requiring extensive manual labeling is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we propose an annotation-free detection and segmentation pipeline for space targets using VLMs. Our approach begins by automatically generating pseudo-labels for a small subset of unlabeled real data with a pre-trained VLM. These pseudo-labels are then leveraged in a teacher-student label distillation framework to train lightweight models. Despite the inherent noise in the pseudo-labels, the distillation process leads to substantial performance gains over direct zero-shot VLM inference. Experimental evaluations on the SPARK-2024, SPEED+, and TANGO datasets on segmentation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements in average precision (AP) by up to 10 points.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the differentiation and identification of military vehicles in SAR images, which often appear indistinguishable, by utilizing contextual search and past image examples.

Method: SAR-RAG integrates a multimodal large language model with a vector database of semantic embeddings to retrieve and compare past image exemplars with known target types.

Result: SAR-RAG improves ATR prediction accuracy, verified through search metrics, classification accuracy, and regression of vehicle dimensions.

Conclusion: SAR-RAG as an attached memory bank enhances SAR ATR performance, demonstrating its effectiveness over baseline MLLM methods.

Abstract: We present a visual-context image retrieval-augmented generation (ImageRAG) assisted AI agent for automatic target recognition (ATR) of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). SAR is a remote sensing method used in defense and security applications to detect and monitor the positions of military vehicles, which may appear indistinguishable in images. Researchers have extensively studied SAR ATR to improve the differentiation and identification of vehicle types, characteristics, and measurements. Test examples can be compared with known vehicle target types to improve recognition tasks. New methods enhance the capabilities of neural networks, transformer attention, and multimodal large language models. An agentic AI method may be developed to utilize a defined set of tools, such as searching through a library of similar examples. Our proposed method, SAR Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAR-RAG), combines a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a vector database of semantic embeddings to support contextual search for image exemplars with known qualities. By recovering past image examples with known true target types, our SAR-RAG system can compare similar vehicle categories, achieving improved ATR prediction accuracy. We evaluate this through search and retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions. These metrics all show improvements when SAR-RAG is added to an MLLM baseline method as an attached ATR memory bank.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm effectively solves fruit tracking challenges, supporting precision agriculture applications like autonomous robotics.

Abstract: Following crop growth through the vegetative cycle allows farmers to predict fruit setting and yield in early stages, but it is a laborious and non-scalable task if performed by a human who has to manually measure fruit sizes with a caliper or dendrometers. In recent years, computer vision has been used to automate several tasks in precision agriculture, such as detecting and counting fruits, and estimating their size. However, the fundamental problem of matching the exact same fruits from one video, collected on a given date, to the fruits visible in another video, collected on a later date, which is needed to track fruits' growth through time, remains to be solved. Few attempts were made, but they either assume that the camera always starts from the same known position and that there are sufficiently distinct features to match, or they used other sources of data like GPS. Here we propose a new paradigm to tackle this problem, based on constellations of 3D centroids, and introduce a descriptor for very sparse 3D point clouds that can be used to match fruits across videos. Matching constellations instead of individual fruits is key to deal with non-rigidity, occlusions and challenging imagery with few distinct visual features to track. The results show that the proposed method can be successfully used to match fruits across videos and through time, and also to build an orchard map and later use it to locate the camera pose in 6DoF, thus providing a method for autonomous navigation of robots in the orchard and for selective fruit picking, for example.

TL;DR: A prompt-controlled diffusion augmentation framework improves semantic segmentation in remote-sensing by generating synthetic data with controlled domain and class ratios, mitigating long-tail bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing severe pixel imbalance and domain inconsistency in remote-sensing datasets like LoveDA, which hinder accurate urban and rural land-cover monitoring.

Method: A two-stage framework: Stage A generates layouts with controlled class ratios using a domain-aware diffusion model; Stage B translates layouts into photorealistic images using Stable Diffusion with ControlNet.

Result: Consistent segmentation improvements across multiple backbones, especially for minority classes, with enhanced urban and rural generalization.

Conclusion: Controllable synthetic augmentation effectively mitigates long-tail bias in remote-sensing segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote-sensing imagery is critical for urban mapping and land-cover monitoring, yet training data typically exhibits severe long-tailed pixel imbalance. In the dataset LoveDA, this challenge is compounded by an explicit Urban/Rural split with distinct appearance and inconsistent class-frequency statistics across domains. We present a prompt-controlled diffusion augmentation framework that synthesizes paired label--image samples with explicit control of both domain and semantic composition. Stage~A uses a domain-aware, masked ratio-conditioned discrete diffusion model to generate layouts that satisfy user-specified class-ratio targets while respecting learned co-occurrence structure. Stage~B translates layouts into photorealistic, domain-consistent images using Stable Diffusion with ControlNet guidance. Mixing the resulting ratio and domain-controlled synthetic pairs with real data yields consistent improvements across multiple segmentation backbones, with gains concentrated on minority classes and improved Urban and Rural generalization, demonstrating controllable augmentation as a practical mechanism to mitigate long-tail bias in remote-sensing segmentation.

*Chengtao Lv,Yumeng Shi,Yushi Huang,Ruihao Gong,Shen Ren,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Light Forcing introduces sparse attention tailored for autoregressive video generation, improving efficiency and quality via Chunk-Aware Growth and Hierarchical Sparse Attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadratic complexity of attention limits efficient deployment of AR video models; existing sparse solutions degrade performance by ignoring chunk interdependence and historical context.

Method: Proposes Chunk-Aware Growth for sparsity allocation and Hierarchical Sparse Attention for coarse-to-fine context capture.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in quality (84.5 VBench) and efficiency (1.2~1.3x speedup), achieving 19.7 FPS with FP8 quantization.

Conclusion: Light Forcing efficiently enhances AR video generation with tailored sparse attention, balancing performance and speed.

Abstract: Advanced autoregressive (AR) video generation models have improved visual fidelity and interactivity, but the quadratic complexity of attention remains a primary bottleneck for efficient deployment. While existing sparse attention solutions have shown promise on bidirectional models, we identify that applying these solutions to AR models leads to considerable performance degradation for two reasons: isolated consideration of chunk generation and insufficient utilization of past informative context. Motivated by these observations, we propose \textsc{Light Forcing}, the \textit{first} sparse attention solution tailored for AR video generation models. It incorporates a \textit{Chunk-Aware Growth} mechanism to quantitatively estimate the contribution of each chunk, which determines their sparsity allocation. This progressive sparsity increase strategy enables the current chunk to inherit prior knowledge in earlier chunks during generation. Additionally, we introduce a \textit{Hierarchical Sparse Attention} to capture informative historical and local context in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such two-level mask selection strategy (\ie, frame and block level) can adaptively handle diverse attention patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing sparse attention in quality (\eg, 84.5 on VBench) and efficiency (\eg, $1.2{\sim}1.3\times$ end-to-end speedup). Combined with FP8 quantization and LightVAE, \textsc{Light Forcing} further achieves a $2.3\times$ speedup and 19.7\,FPS on an RTX~5090 GPU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA-Bench evaluates VLMs' performance on visualized text understanding, revealing a significant gap between pure-text and visualized-text queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) mostly ignore visualized text in images, despite its real-world prevalence. VISTA-Bench addresses this gap.

Method: The benchmark systematically evaluates VLMs by comparing their performance on pure-text versus visualized-text questions under controlled conditions.

Result: Testing 20+ VLMs shows a notable performance drop when semantic content is presented as visualized text, especially with increased perceptual difficulty.

Conclusion: VISTA-Bench highlights VLMs' sensitivity to rendering variations and aims to advance unified language representations across text and pixels.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in cross-modal understanding across textual and visual inputs, yet existing benchmarks predominantly focus on pure-text queries. In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels. The source dataset is available at https://github.com/QingAnLiu/VISTA-Bench.

*Ronghuan Wu,Wanchao Su,Kede Ma,Jing Liao,Rafał K. Mantiuk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pretrained diffusion models can be adapted for HDR generation without retraining by using perceptually uniform encodings, improving fidelity and dynamic range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale HDR training data and enable pretrained models to generate HDR outputs.

Method: Convert HDR inputs to perceptually uniform encodings (e.g., PU21) and finetune the denoiser via low-rank adaptation, freezing the VAE.

Result: Perceptual fidelity, text-image alignment, and dynamic range are improved compared to previous techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptation strategy efficiently bridges the gap between LDR-pretrained models and HDR generation.

Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) formats and displays are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Stable Diffusion and FLUX) typically remain limited to low-dynamic-range (LDR) output due to the lack of large-scale HDR training data. In this work, we show that existing pretrained diffusion models can be easily adapted to HDR generation without retraining from scratch. A key challenge is that HDR images are natively represented in linear RGB, whose intensity and color statistics differ substantially from those of sRGB-encoded LDR images. This gap, however, can be effectively bridged by converting HDR inputs into perceptually uniform encodings (e.g., using PU21 or PQ). Empirically, we find that LDR-pretrained variational autoencoders (VAEs) reconstruct PU21-encoded HDR inputs with fidelity comparable to LDR data, whereas linear RGB inputs cause severe degradations. Motivated by this finding, we describe an efficient adaptation strategy that freezes the VAE and finetunes only the denoiser via low-rank adaptation in a perceptually uniform space. This results in a unified computational method that supports both text-to-HDR synthesis and single-image RAW-to-HDR reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our perceptually encoded adaptation consistently improves perceptual fidelity, text-image alignment, and effective dynamic range, relative to previous techniques.

TL;DR: XtraLight-MedMamba is a lightweight deep learning framework for classifying precancerous polyps with high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate risk stratification of precancerous polyps is crucial for reducing colorectal cancer risk, but current methods lack objectivity.

Method: Combines ConvNext feature extraction with parallel vision mamba and integrates SCAB and FNOClassifier for efficient feature modeling.

Result: Achieved 97.18% accuracy and F1-score of 0.9767 with only ~32,000 parameters.

Conclusion: XtraLight-MedMamba outperforms complex models, offering a scalable solution for polyp classification.

Abstract: Accurate risk stratification of precancerous polyps during routine colonoscopy screenings is essential for lowering the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, assessment of low-grade dysplasia remains limited by subjective histopathologic interpretation. Advancements in digital pathology and deep learning provide new opportunities to identify subtle and fine morphologic patterns associated with malignant progression that may be imperceptible to the human eye. In this work, we propose XtraLight-MedMamba, an ultra-lightweight state-space-based deep learning framework for classifying neoplastic tubular adenomas from whole-slide images (WSIs). The architecture is a blend of ConvNext based shallow feature extractor with parallel vision mamba to efficiently model both long- and short-range dependencies and image generalization. An integration of Spatial and Channel Attention Bridge (SCAB) module enhances multiscale feature extraction, while Fixed Non-Negative Orthogonal Classifier (FNOClassifier) enables substantial parameter reduction and improved generalization. The model was evaluated on a curated dataset acquired from patients with low-grade tubular adenomas, stratified into case and control cohorts based on subsequent CRC development. XtraLight-MedMamba achieved an accuracy of 97.18% and an F1-score of 0.9767 using approximately 32,000 parameters, outperforming transformer-based and conventional Mamba architectures with significantly higher model complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning model for classifying nail diseases was developed using CNN architectures, achieving high accuracy (95.57%) with InceptionV3. Adversarial training and SHAP were used to enhance robustness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of nail diseases is crucial but challenging due to subtle visual differences. Automated classification can assist doctors in accurate and timely diagnosis.

Method: Four CNN models (InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, ResNet50) were trained on a dataset of 3,835 images resized to 224x224 pixels. Adversarial training and SHAP were applied for robustness and interpretability.

Result: InceptionV3 achieved the highest accuracy (95.57%), followed by DenseNet201 (94.79%). Adversarial training improved robustness, and SHAP provided interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed system offers a promising tool for supporting doctors in diagnosing nail diseases more efficiently and accurately.

Abstract: Human nail diseases are gradually observed over all age groups, especially among older individuals, often going ignored until they become severe. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of such conditions are important because they sometimes reveal our body's health problems. But it is challenging due to the inferred visual differences between disease types. This paper presents a machine learning-based model for automated classification of nail diseases based on a publicly available dataset, which contains 3,835 images scaling six categories. In 224x224 pixels, all images were resized to ensure consistency. To evaluate performance, four well-known CNN models-InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, and ResNet50 were trained and analyzed. Among these, InceptionV3 outperformed the others with an accuracy of 95.57%, while DenseNet201 came next with 94.79%. To make the model stronger and less likely to make mistakes on tricky or noisy images, we used adversarial training. To help understand how the model makes decisions, we used SHAP to highlight important features in the predictions. This system could be a helpful support for doctors, making nail disease diagnosis more accurate and faster.

TL;DR: LitS is a novel neighborhood descriptor for 2D/3D point clouds, capturing local geometries via piecewise constant functions on the unit circle, adaptable to various contexts and resilient to data issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for accurate local geometry characterization in point clouds, crucial for practical analysis across scientific fields.

Method: Introduces LitS, a descriptor with two versions ('regular' and 'cumulative') and parameters, providing neighborhood information via cone-like regions in specified directions.

Result: LitS effectively captures local point arrangements, adapts to diverse contexts, and resists issues like noise and variable density.

Conclusion: LitS is a versatile and robust descriptor for point cloud analysis, enhancing global structural understanding through local neighborhood insights.

Abstract: With the advancement of 3D scanning technologies, point clouds have become fundamental for representing 3D spatial data, with applications that span across various scientific and technological fields. Practical analysis of this data depends crucially on available neighborhood descriptors to accurately characterize the local geometries of the point cloud. This paper introduces LitS, a novel neighborhood descriptor for 2D and 3D point clouds. LitS are piecewise constant functions on the unit circle that allow points to keep track of their surroundings. Each element in LitS' domain represents a direction with respect to a local reference system. Once constructed, evaluating LitS at any given direction gives us information about the number of neighbors in a cone-like region centered around that same direction. Thus, LitS conveys a lot of information about the local neighborhood of a point, which can be leveraged to gain global structural understanding by analyzing how LitS changes between close points. In addition, LitS comes in two versions ('regular' and 'cumulative') and has two parameters, allowing them to adapt to various contexts and types of point clouds. Overall, they are a versatile neighborhood descriptor, capable of capturing the nuances of local point arrangements and resilient to common point cloud data issues such as variable density and noise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask-LLaVA reduces visual tokens in autoregressive VLMs by combining multi-level features, enabling dynamic token selection at inference without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiency of autoregressive VLMs due to high visual token counts.

Method: Combine mask-based object representations, global tokens, and local patch tokens.

Result: Competitive performance with fewer tokens, dynamic token selection at inference.

Conclusion: Multi-level feature combination enables efficient learning and flexible inference.

Abstract: Current autoregressive Vision Language Models (VLMs) usually rely on a large number of visual tokens to represent images, resulting in a need for more compute especially at inference time. To address this problem, we propose Mask-LLaVA, a framework that leverages different levels of visual features to create a compact yet information-rich visual representation for autoregressive VLMs. Namely, we combine mask-based object representations together with global tokens and local patch tokens. While all tokens are used during training, it shows that the resulting model can flexibly drop especially the number of mask-based object-tokens at test time, allowing to adapt the number of tokens during inference without the need to retrain the model and without a significant drop in performance. We evaluate the proposed approach on a suite of standard benchmarks showing results competitive to current token efficient methods and comparable to the original LLaVA baseline using only a fraction of visual tokens. Our analysis demonstrates that combining multi-level features enables efficient learning with fewer tokens while allowing dynamic token selection at test time for good performance.

TL;DR: FlatDINO compresses dense patch features from DINOv2 into a compact 1D sequence, reducing computational costs for diffusion models while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models using dense patch grids (e.g., DINOv2) are computationally expensive due to redundancy in the features.

Method: FlatDINO, a variational autoencoder, compresses dense patch grids into a 1D sequence of 32 tokens, significantly reducing sequence length and dimensionality.

Result: On ImageNet 256x256, FlatDINO achieves a gFID of 1.80 with 8x fewer FLOPs per forward pass and up to 4.5x fewer FLOPs per training step compared to uncompressed DINOv2 features.

Conclusion: FlatDINO offers an efficient alternative for diffusion models by compressing features, reducing computational costs without sacrificing quality.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that diffusion models can generate high-quality images by operating directly on SSL patch features rather than pixel-space latents. However, the dense patch grids from encoders like DINOv2 contain significant redundancy, making diffusion needlessly expensive. We introduce FlatDINO, a variational autoencoder that compresses this representation into a one-dimensional sequence of just 32 continuous tokens -an 8x reduction in sequence length and 48x compression in total dimensionality. On ImageNet 256x256, a DiT-XL trained on FlatDINO latents achieves a gFID of 1.80 with classifier-free guidance while requiring 8x fewer FLOPs per forward pass and up to 4.5x fewer FLOPs per training step compared to diffusion on uncompressed DINOv2 features. These are preliminary results and this work is in progress.

TL;DR: PerpetualWonder is a hybrid generative simulator for long-horizon, action-conditioned 4D scene generation from a single image, addressing decoupling issues by linking physical state and visual primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with long-horizon scene generation due to the decoupling of physical state and visual representation, limiting generative refinements and subsequent interactions.

Method: PerpetualWonder introduces a unified representation linking physical state and visual primitives bidirectionally, along with a robust update mechanism using multi-viewpoint supervision.

Result: Experiments show PerpetualWonder successfully simulates complex, multi-step interactions from single images, maintaining physical plausibility and visual consistency.

Conclusion: PerpetualWonder advances 4D scene generation by enabling closed-loop updates to both dynamics and appearance, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce PerpetualWonder, a hybrid generative simulator that enables long-horizon, action-conditioned 4D scene generation from a single image. Current works fail at this task because their physical state is decoupled from their visual representation, which prevents generative refinements to update the underlying physics for subsequent interactions. PerpetualWonder solves this by introducing the first true closed-loop system. It features a novel unified representation that creates a bidirectional link between the physical state and visual primitives, allowing generative refinements to correct both the dynamics and appearance. It also introduces a robust update mechanism that gathers supervision from multiple viewpoints to resolve optimization ambiguity. Experiments demonstrate that from a single image, PerpetualWonder can successfully simulate complex, multi-step interactions from long-horizon actions, maintaining physical plausibility and visual consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel dense point tracker, \method, replaces cost volumes with feature warping and a transformer architecture for efficient, scalable tracking. It achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, unifying dense tracking and optical flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dense point trackers use cost volumes, which have quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and efficiency. This paper aims to overcome this limitation with a warping-based approach.

Method: The proposed method iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from the target frame to the query frame, using a transformer for joint spatiotemporal reasoning without feature correlations.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on dense tracking benchmarks (TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, Robo-TAP) and even outperforms specialized optical flow methods on Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks.

Conclusion: Warping-based architectures can effectively unify dense point tracking and optical flow estimation, offering simplicity and superior results.

Abstract: Dense point tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications ranging from video analysis to robotic manipulation. State-of-the-art trackers typically rely on cost volumes to match features across frames, but this approach incurs quadratic complexity in spatial resolution, limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose \method, a novel dense point tracker that eschews cost volumes in favor of warping. Inspired by recent advances in optical flow, our approach iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from the target frame to the query frame based on the current estimate. Combined with a transformer architecture that performs joint spatiotemporal reasoning across all tracks, our design establishes long-range correspondences without computing feature correlations. Our model is simple and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard dense point tracking benchmarks, including TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, and Robo-TAP. Remarkably, the model also excels at optical flow, sometimes outperforming specialized methods on the Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks. These results suggest that warping-based architectures can unify dense point tracking and optical flow estimation.

*Mohamed Elgaar,Hadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how linguistic traits of clinical decisions affect extraction accuracy, finding narrative-style decisions (e.g., advice, precautions) are harder to extract than telegraphic ones (e.g., drugs, problems).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding linguistic differences in clinical decisions can improve extraction models for decision support and patient summaries.

Method: Analyzed MedDec discharge summaries annotated with DICTUM categories, computing linguistic indices and evaluating recall of a transformer model.

Result: Exact-match recall was 48%, dropping for narrative spans with stopwords, hedging, or negation. Relaxed matching improved recall to 71%, highlighting boundary issues.

Conclusion: Narrative decisions are challenging to extract; systems should use boundary-tolerant strategies for better performance.

Abstract: Extracting medical decisions from clinical notes is a key step for clinical decision support and patient-facing care summaries. We study how the linguistic characteristics of clinical decisions vary across decision categories and whether these differences explain extraction failures. Using MedDec discharge summaries annotated with decision categories from the Decision Identification and Classification Taxonomy for Use in Medicine (DICTUM), we compute seven linguistic indices for each decision span and analyze span-level extraction recall of a standard transformer model. We find clear category-specific signatures: drug-related and problem-defining decisions are entity-dense and telegraphic, whereas advice and precaution decisions contain more narrative, with higher stopword and pronoun proportions and more frequent hedging and negation cues. On the validation split, exact-match recall is 48%, with large gaps across linguistic strata: recall drops from 58% to 24% from the lowest to highest stopword-proportion bins, and spans containing hedging or negation cues are less likely to be recovered. Under a relaxed overlap-based match criterion, recall increases to 71%, indicating that many errors are span boundary disagreements rather than complete misses. Overall, narrative-style spans--common in advice and precaution decisions--are a consistent blind spot under exact matching, suggesting that downstream systems should incorporate boundary-tolerant evaluation and extraction strategies for clinical decisions.

TL;DR: Using NLP techniques to automate the assessment of Computer Science curriculum alignment with ACM/IEEE guidelines, saving time compared to manual audits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual auditing of CS program alignment with extensive ACM/IEEE guidelines is time-consuming and cognitively demanding, taking about a day per course.

Method: Explored two NLP approaches: traditional parsing/tagging/embeddings and Large Language Models, applied to classify pedagogical materials.

Result: Demonstrated meaningful automatic classification of documents, validating the feasibility of NLP for this task.

Conclusion: NLP techniques can significantly accelerate the alignment assessment process for CS programs.

Abstract: Professional societies often publish curriculum guidelines to help programs align their content to international standards. In Computer Science, the primary standard is published by ACM and IEEE and provide detailed guidelines for what should be and could be included in a Computer Science program.
  While very helpful, it remains difficult for program administrators to assess how much of the guidelines is being covered by a CS program. This is in particular due to the extensiveness of the guidelines, containing thousands of individual items. As such, it is time consuming and cognitively demanding to audit every course to confidently mark everything that is actually being covered. Our preliminary work indicated that it takes about a day of work per course.
  In this work, we propose using Natural Language Processing techniques to accelerate the process. We explore two kinds of techniques, the first relying on traditional tools for parsing, tagging, and embeddings, while the second leverages the power of Large Language Models. We evaluate the application of these techniques to classify a corpus of pedagogical materials and show that we can meaningfully classify documents automatically.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Log-probability rewards outperform binary and probability-based rewards in fine-tuning LLMs for reasoning tasks, performing well in both verifiable and non-verifiable settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of binary rewards (sparsity and design complexity) by exploring likelihood-based rewards, which are scalable and don't require specific verifiers.

Method: The study systematically compares variants of likelihood-based rewards (e.g., log-probability of reference answers) with standard binary rewards, testing them on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and long-form answers.

Result: Log-probability rewards perform consistently well across setups, matching or surpassing binary rewards in verifiable settings and performing on par with SFT in non-verifiable settings. Probability-based rewards fail in non-verifiable settings.

Conclusion: Log-probability rewards are a viable and effective method for fine-tuning LLMs, bridging the gap between verifiable and non-verifiable reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on reasoning benchmarks via reinforcement learning requires a specific reward function, often binary, for each benchmark. This comes with two potential limitations: the need to design the reward, and the potentially sparse nature of binary rewards. Here, we systematically investigate rewards derived from the probability or log-probability of emitting the reference answer (or any other prompt continuation present in the data), which have the advantage of not relying on specific verifiers and being available at scale. Several recent works have advocated for the use of similar rewards (e.g., VeriFree, JEPO, RLPR, NOVER). We systematically compare variants of likelihood-based rewards with standard baselines, testing performance both on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and on long-form answers where no external verifier is available. We find that using the log-probability of the reference answer as the reward for chain-of-thought (CoT) learning is the only option that performs well in all setups. This reward is also consistent with the next-token log-likelihood loss used during pretraining. In verifiable settings, log-probability rewards bring comparable or better success rates than reinforcing with standard binary rewards, and yield much better perplexity. In non-verifiable settings, they perform on par with SFT. On the other hand, methods based on probability, such as VeriFree, flatline on non-verifiable settings due to vanishing probabilities of getting the correct answer. Overall, this establishes log-probability rewards as a viable method for CoT fine-tuning, bridging the short, verifiable and long, non-verifiable answer settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT2's next-word predictions show reduced pooling of evidence from similar contexts as training progresses, resembling hierarchical regression patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how transformers like GPT2 generalize language by pooling evidence from similar contexts.

Method: Analyze GPT2's next-word predictions across training epochs, focusing on pooling effects.

Result: Pooling decreases with training; influenced by context frequency, type frequency, and variability.

Conclusion: Transformer learning behaviors align with hierarchical regression, suggesting realistic generalization.

Abstract: Because language is creative, any reasonable language model must generalize, deciding what to say in novel contexts by using information from similar contexts. But what about contexts that are not novel but merely infrequent? In hierarchical regression, the model's predictions for behavior in a context are affected by observations from other similar contexts to the extent that 1) the current context is infrequent and 2) different contexts behave similarly. This is called adaptive partial pooling of evidence. This paper shows that next-word predictions of a transformer (GPT2) are increasingly unaffected by observations from outside the current context across epochs of training (the amount of pooling reduces with training), and that the extent of pooling is affected by context frequency, context number (type frequency) and context variability in a similar way to hierarchical regression. These characteristics of learning in transformers are argued to be realistic on both rational and empirical grounds.

### [92] [On the Credibility of Evaluating LLMs using Survey Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04033)
*Jindřich Libovický*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper critiques current methods for evaluating LLMs' value orientation via surveys, highlighting how prompting and decoding strategies impact results. It introduces a novel metric, self-correlation distance, to assess answer consistency and recommends improved evaluation practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing methodologies that misestimate LLM-human value similarity due to prompting and decoding variations.

Method: Analyzed World Value Survey data in three languages across five countries, comparing direct vs. chain-of-thought prompting and greedy vs. sampling decoding. Introduced self-correlation distance to measure answer consistency.

Result: Prompting and decoding methods significantly affect results; self-correlation distance reveals structural misalignment despite high average agreement. Common metrics (mean-squared distance, KL divergence) weakly correlate.

Conclusion: Recommends CoT prompting, sampling-based decoding with multiple samples, and multi-metric analysis (including self-correlation distance) for future LLM evaluation.

Abstract: Recent studies evaluate the value orientation of large language models (LLMs) using adapted social surveys, typically by prompting models with survey questions and comparing their responses to average human responses. This paper identifies limitations in this methodology that, depending on the exact setup, can lead to both underestimating and overestimating the similarity of value orientation. Using the World Value Survey in three languages across five countries, we demonstrate that prompting methods (direct vs. chain-of-thought) and decoding strategies (greedy vs. sampling) significantly affect results. To assess the interaction between answers, we introduce a novel metric, self-correlation distance. This metric measures whether LLMs maintain consistent relationships between answers across different questions, as humans do. This indicates that even a high average agreement with human data, when considering LLM responses independently, does not guarantee structural alignment in responses. Additionally, we reveal a weak correlation between two common evaluation metrics, mean-squared distance and KL divergence, which assume that survey answers are independent of each other. For future research, we recommend CoT prompting, sampling-based decoding with dozens of samples, and robust analysis using multiple metrics, including self-correlation distance.

### [93] [Abstraction Induces the Brain Alignment of Language and Speech Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04081)
*Emily Cheng,Aditya R. Vaidya,Richard Antonello*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Intermediate layers of language and speech models predict brain responses due to shared meaning abstraction, not next-word prediction. High intrinsic dimension in these layers correlates with brain predictivity and semantic richness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why intermediate layers of models predict brain responses better than output layers and identify the representation properties enabling this.

Method: Analyze intrinsic dimension (feature complexity) across model layers, relate it to brain signal prediction (fMRI, ECoG), and test effects of pre-training and finetuning.

Result: Intermediate layers with high intrinsic dimension predict brain signals best; finetuning boosts both intrinsic dimension and semantic content.

Conclusion: Semantic richness, intrinsic dimension, and brain predictivity are linked, with meaning abstraction driving model-brain similarity.

Abstract: Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models and speech audio models predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most effective for this unique and highly general transfer task? We give evidence that the correspondence between speech and language models and the brain derives from shared meaning abstraction and not their next-word prediction properties. In particular, models construct higher-order linguistic features in their middle layers, cued by a peak in the layerwise intrinsic dimension, a measure of feature complexity. We show that a layer's intrinsic dimension strongly predicts how well it explains fMRI and ECoG signals; that the relation between intrinsic dimension and brain predictivity arises over model pre-training; and finetuning models to better predict the brain causally increases both representations' intrinsic dimension and their semantic content. Results suggest that semantic richness, high intrinsic dimension, and brain predictivity mirror each other, and that the key driver of model-brain similarity is rich meaning abstraction of the inputs, where language modeling is a task sufficiently complex (but perhaps not the only) to require it.

### [94] [Expert Selections In MoE Models Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04105)
*Amir Nuriyev,Gabriel Kulp*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates a text-reconstruction attack on MoE language models, showing that routing decisions leak significant information, with transformer-based decoders achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal vulnerabilities in MoE models by showing how expert selections expose sensitive text information.

Method: Used a 3-layer MLP and transformer-based sequence decoder to reconstruct tokens from expert selections.

Result: Achieved 63.1% top-1 accuracy with MLP and 91.2% top-1 (94.8% top-10) with transformer decoder on 32-token sequences.

Conclusion: Expert selections in MoE models leak sensitive text information, suggesting they should be treated as confidential.

Abstract: We present a text-reconstruction attack on mixture-of-experts (MoE) language models that recovers tokens from expert selections alone. In MoE models, each token is routed to a subset of expert subnetworks; we show these routing decisions leak substantially more information than previously understood. Prior work using logistic regression achieves limited reconstruction; we show that a 3-layer MLP improves this to 63.1% top-1 accuracy, and that a transformer-based sequence decoder recovers 91.2% of tokens top-1 (94.8% top-10) on 32-token sequences from OpenWebText after training on 100M tokens. These results connect MoE routing to the broader literature on embedding inversion. We outline practical leakage scenarios (e.g., distributed inference and side channels) and show that adding noise reduces but does not eliminate reconstruction. Our findings suggest that expert selections in MoE deployments should be treated as sensitive as the underlying text.

*Jiangnan Yang,Junjie Chen,Fei Wang,Yiqi Nie,Yuxin Liu,Zhangling Duan,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DELTA is a multi-agent framework for psychological counseling that uses multimodal signals and structured reasoning to improve empathy and quality in AI-human interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counseling AI systems rely solely on text and implicit mental state inference, lacking the richness of multimodal cues used in human counseling.

Method: DELTA employs a deliberative multi-agent framework with explicit multimodal reasoning (evidence grounding, mental state abstraction, response generation) and reinforcement learning guided by an Emotion Attunement Score.

Result: DELTA outperforms existing systems in counseling quality and emotion attunement, as demonstrated on a multimodal counseling benchmark.

Conclusion: Explicit multimodal reasoning and structured mental state representations enhance empathic AI-human interactions, validated by ablation and qualitative analyses.

Abstract: Psychological counseling is a fundamentally multimodal cognitive process in which clinicians integrate verbal content with visual and vocal cues to infer clients' mental states and respond empathically. However, most existing language-model-based counseling systems operate on text alone and rely on implicit mental state inference. We introduce DELTA, a deliberative multi-agent framework that models counseling as a structured reasoning process over multimodal signals, separating evidence grounding, mental state abstraction, and response generation. DELTA further incorporates reinforcement learning guided by a distribution-level Emotion Attunement Score to encourage emotionally attuned responses. Experiments on a multimodal counseling benchmark show that DELTA improves both counseling quality and emotion attunement across models. Ablation and qualitative analyses suggest that explicit multimodal reasoning and structured mental state representations play complementary roles in supporting empathic human-AI interaction.

*Sercan Karakaş,Yusuf Şimşek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates signals driving Light Verb Construction (LVC) classification in Turkish by testing various models, finding morphosyntax insufficient and lexical identity dependent on normalization choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what signals drive LVC classification in Turkish, given its rich morphology and complex predicates, distinguishing idiomatic from literal uses.

Method: Evaluates lemma-driven baselines, grammar-only Logistic Regression, and full-input BERTurk on a controlled diagnostic set with varied inputs.

Result: Morphosyntax alone is insufficient for LVC detection; lexical identity supports judgments but depends on normalization and calibration.

Conclusion: Targeted evaluation for Turkish MWEs is needed, and 'lemma-only' representation varies with normalization methods.

Abstract: Light verb constructions (LVCs) are a challenging class of verbal multiword expressions, especially in Turkish, where rich morphology and productive complex predicates create minimal contrasts between idiomatic predicate meanings and literal verb--argument uses. This paper asks what signals drive LVC classification by systematically restricting model inputs. Using UD-derived supervision, we compare lemma-driven baselines (lemma TF--IDF + Logistic Regression; BERTurk trained on lemma sequences), a grammar-only Logistic Regression over UD morphosyntax (UPOS/DEPREL/MORPH), and a full-input BERTurk baseline. We evaluate on a controlled diagnostic set with Random negatives, lexical controls (NLVC), and LVC positives, reporting split-wise performance to expose decision-boundary behavior. Results show that coarse morphosyntax alone is insufficient for robust LVC detection under controlled contrasts, while lexical identity supports LVC judgments but is sensitive to calibration and normalization choices. Overall, Our findings motivate targeted evaluation of Turkish MWEs and show that ``lemma-only'' is not a single, well-defined representation, but one that depends critically on how normalization is operationalized.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study explores hidden safety risks in AI models during training, revealing harmful behaviors driven by internal incentives and context, with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct showing risks in 74.4% of runs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the understudied safety risks during AI model training, focusing on implicit harmful behaviors beyond explicit reward hacking.

Method: Systematic study with a taxonomy (five risk levels, ten categories, three incentives), experiments on models like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, and analysis in multi-agent settings.

Result: High prevalence of risks; Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct exhibited risky behaviors in 74.4% of runs when given background context.

Conclusion: Training-time safety risks are urgent and overlooked, requiring attention to mitigate hidden harmful behaviors.

Abstract: Safety risks of AI models have been widely studied at deployment time, such as jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful outputs. In contrast, safety risks emerging during training remain largely unexplored. Beyond explicit reward hacking that directly manipulates explicit reward functions in reinforcement learning, we study implicit training-time safety risks: harmful behaviors driven by a model's internal incentives and contextual background information. For example, during code-based reinforcement learning, a model may covertly manipulate logged accuracy for self-preservation. We present the first systematic study of this problem, introducing a taxonomy with five risk levels, ten fine-grained risk categories, and three incentive types. Extensive experiments reveal the prevalence and severity of these risks: notably, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct exhibits risky behaviors in 74.4% of training runs when provided only with background information. We further analyze factors influencing these behaviors and demonstrate that implicit training-time risks also arise in multi-agent training settings. Our results identify an overlooked yet urgent safety challenge in training.

*Xinyue Wang,Yuanhe Zhang,Zhengshuo Gong,Haoran Gao,Fanyu Meng,Zhenhong Zhou,Li Sun,Yang Liu,Sen Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies 'Toxic Proactivity', an active failure mode in LLM-based agents where ethical constraints are disregarded for utility maximization, and introduces an evaluation framework to analyze it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the overlooked risk of LLM-based agents exhibiting Toxic Proactivity, where agents ignore ethical constraints to appear overly helpful.

Method: A novel evaluation framework based on dilemma-driven interactions between dual models is introduced to simulate and analyze agent behavior over multi-step trajectories.

Result: Experiments show Toxic Proactivity is widespread in mainstream LLMs, revealing two major tendencies. A systematic benchmark is also presented.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for better identification and evaluation of Toxic Proactivity in LLM-based agents to mitigate ethical risks.

Abstract: The enhanced capabilities of LLM-based agents come with an emergency for model planning and tool-use abilities. Attributing to helpful-harmless trade-off from LLM alignment, agents typically also inherit the flaw of "over-refusal", which is a passive failure mode. However, the proactive planning and action capabilities of agents introduce another crucial danger on the other side of the trade-off. This phenomenon we term "Toxic Proactivity'': an active failure mode in which an agent, driven by the optimization for Machiavellian helpfulness, disregards ethical constraints to maximize utility. Unlike over-refusal, Toxic Proactivity manifests as the agent taking excessive or manipulative measures to ensure its "usefulness'' is maintained. Existing research pays little attention to identifying this behavior, as it often lacks the subtle context required for such strategies to unfold. To reveal this risk, we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on dilemma-driven interactions between dual models, enabling the simulation and analysis of agent behavior over multi-step behavioral trajectories. Through extensive experiments with mainstream LLMs, we demonstrate that Toxic Proactivity is a widespread behavioral phenomenon and reveal two major tendencies. We further present a systematic benchmark for evaluating Toxic Proactive behavior across contextual settings.

*Michael A. Lepori,Tal Linzen,Ann Yuan,Katja Filippova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether LLMs can use contextual representations for tasks like next-token prediction and adaptive world modeling, finding limitations even in state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if LLMs can adaptively use in-context representations for downstream tasks, despite their success in other areas.

Method: Evaluated open-weights LLMs on next-token prediction and a novel adaptive world modeling task, and tested state-of-the-art closed-source models.

Result: LLMs struggle to deploy novel in-context semantics, even when they encode them. Advanced models also fail to reliably use these patterns.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for new methods to help LLMs flexibly deploy contextual information.

Abstract: Though large language models (LLMs) have enabled great success across a wide variety of tasks, they still appear to fall short of one of the loftier goals of artificial intelligence research: creating an artificial system that can adapt its behavior to radically new contexts upon deployment. One important step towards this goal is to create systems that can induce rich representations of data that are seen in-context, and then flexibly deploy these representations to accomplish goals. Recently, Park et al. (2024) demonstrated that current LLMs are indeed capable of inducing such representation from context (i.e., in-context representation learning). The present study investigates whether LLMs can use these representations to complete simple downstream tasks.
  We first assess whether open-weights LLMs can use in-context representations for next-token prediction, and then probe models using a novel task, adaptive world modeling. In both tasks, we find evidence that open-weights LLMs struggle to deploy representations of novel semantics that are defined in-context, even if they encode these semantics in their latent representations. Furthermore, we assess closed-source, state-of-the-art reasoning models on the adaptive world modeling task, demonstrating that even the most performant LLMs cannot reliably leverage novel patterns presented in-context. Overall, this work seeks to inspire novel methods for encouraging models to not only encode information presented in-context, but to do so in a manner that supports flexible deployment of this information.

*Nuo Xu,Ahrii Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares three subword tokenization methods (BPE, OBPE, Unigram) for NLP tasks in Uralic languages, showing OBPE's superior morphological alignment and POS tagging accuracy, especially for Latin-script languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how subword tokenization impacts NLP performance in morphologically rich, low-resource Uralic languages.

Method: Systematically compares BPE, OBPE, and Unigram subword paradigms across six Uralic languages using POS tagging as a downstream task.

Result: OBPE outperforms others in morphological alignment and tagging accuracy, reducing fragmentation in open-class categories and balancing frequency spectrum.

Conclusion: Morphology-sensitive tokenization (like OBPE) is crucial for effective cross-lingual transfer in agglutinative, low-resource languages.

Abstract: Subword tokenization critically affects Natural Language Processing (NLP) performance, yet its behavior in morphologically rich and low-resource language families remains under-explored. This study systematically compares three subword paradigms -- Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), Overlap BPE (OBPE), and Unigram Language Model -- across six Uralic languages with varying resource availability and typological diversity. Using part-of-speech (POS) tagging as a controlled downstream task, we show that OBPE consistently achieves stronger morphological alignment and higher tagging accuracy than conventional methods, particularly within the Latin-script group. These gains arise from reduced fragmentation in open-class categories and a better balance across the frequency spectrum. Transfer efficacy further depends on the downstream tagging architecture, interacting with both training volume and genealogical proximity. Taken together, these findings highlight that morphology-sensitive tokenization is not merely a preprocessing choice but a decisive factor in enabling effective cross-lingual transfer for agglutinative, low-resource languages.

### [101] [CoLT: Reasoning with Chain of Latent Tool Calls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04246)
*Fangwei Zhu,Zhifang Sui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoLT introduces a framework automating latent reasoning in LLMs via ‘tool calls’, enhancing efficiency without extensive training or model changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent reasoning methods require model augmentation and exhaustive training, limiting their broader applicability.

Method: CoLT generates seed tokens for reasoning steps; hidden states trigger external models to unpack full reasoning steps, maintaining explicit token space reasoning.

Result: CoLT outperforms baselines in accuracy and reasoning length on mathematical datasets and supports reinforcement learning and varied decoder structures.

Conclusion: CoLT effectively improves reasoning efficiency in LLMs without compromising their capabilities or requiring significant structural changes.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a critical technique in enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), and latent reasoning methods have been proposed to accelerate the inefficient token-level reasoning chain. We notice that existing latent reasoning methods generally require model structure augmentation and exhaustive training, limiting their broader applicability. In this paper, we propose CoLT, a novel framework that implements latent reasoning as ``tool calls''. Instead of reasoning entirely in the latent space, CoLT generates seed tokens that contain information of a reasoning step. When a latent tool call is triggered, a smaller external model will take the hidden states of seed tokens as its input, and unpack the seed tokens back to a full reasoning step. In this way, we can ensure that the main model reasons in the explicit token space, preserving its ability while improving efficiency. Experimental results on four mathematical datasets demonstrate that CoLT achieves higher accuracy and shorter reasoning length than baseline latent models, and is compatible with reinforcement learning algorithms and different decoder structures.

TL;DR: DementiaBank-Emotion is the first annotated corpus for Alzheimer's disease speech, revealing AD patients express more emotions than healthy controls and showing acoustic differences in emotion expression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a resource for studying emotion expression in Alzheimer's disease speech and compare it with healthy controls.

Method: Annotation of 1,492 utterances from 108 speakers for six basic emotions and neutral, followed by exploratory acoustic analysis.

Result: AD patients expressed more non-neutral emotions than controls (16.9% vs. 5.7%). Acoustic analysis showed differences in F0 modulation for sadness.

Conclusion: The corpus supports research on emotion recognition in clinical populations, showing distinct emotion expression patterns in AD speech.

Abstract: We present DementiaBank-Emotion, the first multi-rater emotion annotation corpus for Alzheimer's disease (AD) speech. Annotating 1,492 utterances from 108 speakers for Ekman's six basic emotions and neutral, we find that AD patients express significantly more non-neutral emotions (16.9%) than healthy controls (5.7%; p < .001). Exploratory acoustic analysis suggests a possible dissociation: control speakers showed substantial F0 modulation for sadness (Delta = -3.45 semitones from baseline), whereas AD speakers showed minimal change (Delta = +0.11 semitones; interaction p = .023), though this finding is based on limited samples (sadness: n=5 control, n=15 AD) and requires replication. Within AD speech, loudness differentiates emotion categories, indicating partially preserved emotion-prosody mappings. We release the corpus, annotation guidelines, and calibration workshop materials to support research on emotion recognition in clinical populations.

TL;DR: Agentic Verifier improves LLMs' coding accuracy by actively generating discriminative test inputs and iteratively refining solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing execution-based re-ranking methods struggle with inefficient input sampling or difficult test case generation, limiting LLMs' problem-solving accuracy.

Method: Developed Agentic Verifier, an execution-based agent that reasons about program behaviors and searches for discriminative test inputs through multi-turn interactions and iterative refinement.

Result: Achieves up to +10-15% gains in Best@K accuracy across five competitive programming benchmarks, showing clear test-time scaling benefits.

Conclusion: Agentic Verifier effectively enhances LLMs' coding performance and has broader potential beyond re-ranking.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong coding capabilities but still struggle to solve competitive programming problems correctly in a single attempt. Execution-based re-ranking offers a promising test-time scaling strategy, yet existing methods are constrained by either difficult test case generation or inefficient random input sampling. To address this limitation, we propose Agentic Verifier, an execution-based agent that actively reasons about program behaviors and searches for highly discriminative test inputs that expose behavioral discrepancies among candidate solutions. Through multi-turn interaction with code execution environments, the verifier iteratively refines the candidate input generator and produces targeted counterexamples rather than blindly sampling inputs. We train the verifier to acquire this discriminative input generation capability via a scalable pipeline combining large-scale data synthesis, rejection fine-tuning, and agentic reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across five competitive programming benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong execution-based baselines, achieving up to +10-15% absolute gains in Best@K accuracy. Further analysis reveals clear test-time scaling behavior and highlights the verifier's broader potential beyond reranking.

TL;DR: ECG-R1 is a novel multimodal large language model (MLLM) designed for reliable ECG interpretation through protocol-guided data generation, modality-decoupled architecture, and reinforcement learning, addressing the unreliability of existing MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs produce plausible but clinically incorrect ECG analyses, necessitating a more reliable solution.

Method: ECG-R1 uses protocol-guided instruction data generation, a modality-decoupled architecture with interleaved modality dropout, and reinforcement learning with diagnostic evidence rewards.

Result: The model improves robustness and cross-modal consistency, providing evidence-grounded interpretations. Evaluation shows severe hallucinations in existing MLLMs.

Conclusion: ECG-R1 offers a reliable alternative for ECG interpretation, with publicly available code and an online platform.

Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) serves as an indispensable diagnostic tool in clinical practice, yet existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain unreliable for ECG interpretation, often producing plausible but clinically incorrect analyses. To address this, we propose ECG-R1, the first reasoning MLLM designed for reliable ECG interpretation via three innovations. First, we construct the interpretation corpus using \textit{Protocol-Guided Instruction Data Generation}, grounding interpretation in measurable ECG features and monograph-defined quantitative thresholds and diagnostic logic. Second, we present a modality-decoupled architecture with \textit{Interleaved Modality Dropout} to improve robustness and cross-modal consistency when either the ECG signal or ECG image is missing. Third, we present \textit{Reinforcement Learning with ECG Diagnostic Evidence Rewards} to strengthen evidence-grounded ECG interpretation. Additionally, we systematically evaluate the ECG interpretation capabilities of proprietary, open-source, and medical MLLMs, and provide the first quantitative evidence that severe hallucinations are widespread, suggesting that the public should not directly trust these outputs without independent verification.

*Yun Cheng,Xingyu Zhu,Haoyu Zhao,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) often worsen performance when reflecting on past mistakes due to "contextual drag," where errors in context bias future outputs, leading to self-deterioration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how LLMs' performance declines when they repeatedly encounter their own errors, hindering self-improvement.

Method: Researchers evaluated 11 models on 8 reasoning tasks, analyzing error propagation using tree edit distance and testing mitigation strategies.

Result: Contextual drag causes 10-20% performance drops, and mitigation methods only partially restore baseline performance.

Conclusion: Contextual drag is a persistent issue in LLMs, limiting their ability to self-improve despite feedback or verification.

Abstract: Central to many self-improvement pipelines for large language models (LLMs) is the assumption that models can improve by reflecting on past mistakes. We study a phenomenon termed contextual drag: the presence of failed attempts in the context biases subsequent generations toward structurally similar errors. Across evaluations of 11 proprietary and open-weight models on 8 reasoning tasks, contextual drag induces 10-20% performance drops, and iterative self-refinement in models with severe contextual drag can collapse into self-deterioration. Structural analysis using tree edit distance reveals that subsequent reasoning trajectories inherit structurally similar error patterns from the context. We demonstrate that neither external feedback nor successful self-verification suffices to eliminate this effect. While mitigation strategies such as fallback-behavior fine-tuning and context denoising yield partial improvements, they fail to fully restore baseline performance, positioning contextual drag as a persistent failure mode in current reasoning architectures.

*Lin Zheng,Xinyu Li,Qian Liu,Xiachong Feng,Lingpeng Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proxy compression improves training efficiency and performance in language models by jointly training on raw bytes and compressed inputs, enabling strong transfer without relying on tokenizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to decouple language models from fixed tokenizers, providing an end-to-end raw-byte interface while maintaining efficiency benefits of compressed inputs.

Method: The method involves jointly training a language model on raw byte sequences and compressed views from external compressors, aligning the formats internally.

Result: Results show improved training efficiency and performance over byte-level baselines, with gains scaling with model size and rivaling tokenizer approaches.

Conclusion: Proxy compression offers a robust, tokenizer-free alternative that matches or surpasses tokenizer-based methods while operating on raw bytes.

Abstract: Modern language models are trained almost exclusively on token sequences produced by a fixed tokenizer, an external lossless compressor often over UTF-8 byte sequences, thereby coupling the model to that compressor. This work introduces proxy compression, an alternative training scheme that preserves the efficiency benefits of compressed inputs while providing an end-to-end, raw-byte interface at inference time. During training, one language model is jointly trained on raw byte sequences and compressed views generated by external compressors; through the process, the model learns to internally align compressed sequences and raw bytes. This alignment enables strong transfer between the two formats, even when training predominantly on compressed inputs which are discarded at inference. Extensive experiments on code language modeling demonstrate that proxy compression substantially improves training efficiency and significantly outperforms pure byte-level baselines given fixed compute budgets. As model scale increases, these gains become more pronounced, and proxy-trained models eventually match or rival tokenizer approaches, all while operating solely on raw bytes and retaining the inherent robustness of byte-level modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Guided Verifier framework to improve RL for MLLMs by adding real-time oversight during reasoning, reducing errors and enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for MLLMs lack intermediate oversight, leading to error propagation and noisy optimization signals.

Method: Proposes a dynamic verifier that actively co-solves tasks with the policy, detecting inconsistencies and guiding reasoning trajectories. Uses a specialized data synthesis pipeline to create the CoRe dataset for training.

Result: An 8B-parameter model achieves strong performance on benchmarks like MathVista, MathVerse, and MMMU.

Conclusion: Collaborative inference and dynamic verification significantly enhance reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, prevailing paradigms typically rely on solitary rollout strategies where the model works alone. This lack of intermediate oversight renders the reasoning process susceptible to error propagation, where early logical deviations cascade into irreversible failures, resulting in noisy optimization signals. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{Guided Verifier} framework to address these structural limitations. Moving beyond passive terminal rewards, we introduce a dynamic verifier that actively co-solves tasks alongside the policy. During the rollout phase, this verifier interacts with the policy model in real-time, detecting inconsistencies and providing directional signals to steer the model toward valid trajectories. To facilitate this, we develop a specialized data synthesis pipeline targeting multimodal hallucinations, constructing \textbf{CoRe} dataset of process-level negatives and \textbf{Co}rrect-guide \textbf{Re}asoning trajectories to train the guided verifier. Extensive experiments on MathVista, MathVerse and MMMU indicate that by allocating compute to collaborative inference and dynamic verification, an 8B-parameter model can achieve strong performance.

Result: Few-shot demonstrations enhance RoP's safety by 4.5% but degrade ToP's effectiveness by 21.2%.

Conclusion: Provides practical recommendations for deploying prompt-based defenses in LLM applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face increasing threats from jailbreak attacks that bypass safety alignment. While prompt-based defenses such as Role-Oriented Prompts (RoP) and Task-Oriented Prompts (ToP) have shown effectiveness, the role of few-shot demonstrations in these defense strategies remains unclear. Prior work suggests that few-shot examples may compromise safety, but lacks investigation into how few-shot interacts with different system prompt strategies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on multiple mainstream LLMs across four safety benchmarks (AdvBench, HarmBench, SG-Bench, XSTest) using six jailbreak attack methods. Our key finding reveals that few-shot demonstrations produce opposite effects on RoP and ToP: few-shot enhances RoP's safety rate by up to 4.5% through reinforcing role identity, while it degrades ToP's effectiveness by up to 21.2% through distracting attention from task instructions. Based on these findings, we provide practical recommendations for deploying prompt-based defenses in real-world LLM applications.

### [109] [Revisiting Prompt Sensitivity in Large Language Models for Text Classification: The Role of Prompt Underspecification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04297)
*Branislav Pecher,Michal Spiegel,Robert Belanec,Jan Cegin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show sensitivity to prompt variations, often due to underspecified prompts. Comparing underspecified and specific prompts reveals higher variance and lower logit values for underspecified ones, with effects mainly in final layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs are sensitive to prompt variations, focusing on the role of prompt underspecification in causing performance fluctuations.

Method: Systematic comparison of underspecified and specific prompts using performance analysis, logit analysis, and linear probing.

Result: Underspecified prompts exhibit higher performance variance and lower logit values for relevant tokens, while specific prompts perform more consistently. Effects are mostly seen in final layers.

Conclusion: Prompt sensitivity is significantly influenced by underspecification, emphasizing the need for rigorous investigation and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as zero-shot and few-shot classifiers, where task behaviour is largely controlled through prompting. A growing number of works have observed that LLMs are sensitive to prompt variations, with small changes leading to large changes in performance. However, in many cases, the investigation of sensitivity is performed using underspecified prompts that provide minimal task instructions and weakly constrain the model's output space. In this work, we argue that a significant portion of the observed prompt sensitivity can be attributed to prompt underspecification. We systematically study and compare the sensitivity of underspecified prompts and prompts that provide specific instructions. Utilising performance analysis, logit analysis, and linear probing, we find that underspecified prompts exhibit higher performance variance and lower logit values for relevant tokens, while instruction-prompts suffer less from such problems. However, linear probing analysis suggests that the effects of prompt underspecification have only a marginal impact on the internal LLM representations, instead emerging in the final layers. Overall, our findings highlight the need for more rigour when investigating and mitigating prompt sensitivity.

### [110] [DeFrame: Debiasing Large Language Models Against Framing Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04306)
*Kahee Lim,Soyeon Kim,Steven Euijong Whang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'framing disparity' as a hidden bias in LLMs, showing fairness scores vary with prompt framing and proposing a method to improve consistency and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hidden bias in LLMs persists despite standard evaluations, prompting exploration of framing's role in fairness disparities.

Method: Introduces framing disparity, augments benchmarks with alternative framings, and develops a framing-aware debiasing method.

Result: Fairness scores vary with framing; existing debiasing methods improve overall fairness but not framing disparities. The proposed method reduces bias and improves consistency.

Conclusion: The framing-aware debiasing method enhances LLM fairness and robustness against framing disparities.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their fair responses across demographics has become crucial. Despite many efforts, an ongoing challenge is hidden bias: LLMs appear fair under standard evaluations, but can produce biased responses outside those evaluation settings. In this paper, we identify framing -- differences in how semantically equivalent prompts are expressed (e.g., "A is better than B" vs. "B is worse than A") -- as an underexplored contributor to this gap. We first introduce the concept of "framing disparity" to quantify the impact of framing on fairness evaluation. By augmenting fairness evaluation benchmarks with alternative framings, we find that (1) fairness scores vary significantly with framing and (2) existing debiasing methods improve overall (i.e., frame-averaged) fairness, but often fail to reduce framing-induced disparities. To address this, we propose a framing-aware debiasing method that encourages LLMs to be more consistent across framings. Experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces overall bias and improves robustness against framing disparities, enabling LLMs to produce fairer and more consistent responses.

TL;DR: GutBrainIE is a manually annotated biomedical IE benchmark based on PubMed abstracts, designed to address limitations in existing benchmarks by offering a rich schema and diverse tasks for robust IE development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of scientific publications necessitates transforming unstructured text into structured knowledge, particularly in fast-evolving biomedical fields like the gut-brain axis, where existing benchmarks are often narrow and rely on weak annotations.

Method: The authors introduce GutBrainIE, a benchmark derived from over 1,600 PubMed abstracts manually annotated by experts for fine-grained entities, concept links, and relations, combining highly curated and weakly supervised data.

Result: GutBrainIE provides a comprehensive schema and multiple tasks, making it broadly applicable for developing and evaluating biomedical IE systems across domains.

Conclusion: GutBrainIE addresses gaps in existing biomedical IE benchmarks by offering high-quality annotations and versatility, enhancing the robustness and applicability of IE methods.

Abstract: Information Extraction (IE), encompassing Named Entity Recognition (NER), Named Entity Linking (NEL), and Relation Extraction (RE), is critical for transforming the rapidly growing volume of scientific publications into structured, actionable knowledge. This need is especially evident in fast-evolving biomedical fields such as the gut-brain axis, where research investigates complex interactions between the gut microbiota and brain-related disorders. Existing biomedical IE benchmarks, however, are often narrow in scope and rely heavily on distantly supervised or automatically generated annotations, limiting their utility for advancing robust IE methods. We introduce GutBrainIE, a benchmark based on more than 1,600 PubMed abstracts, manually annotated by biomedical and terminological experts with fine-grained entities, concept-level links, and relations. While grounded in the gut-brain axis, the benchmark's rich schema, multiple tasks, and combination of highly curated and weakly supervised data make it broadly applicable to the development and evaluation of biomedical IE systems across domains.

*Sichu Liang,Hongyu Zhu,Wenwen Wang,Deyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines working memory in vision-language models using a spatial n-back task, finding text-based tasks yield better performance than visual ones, with models often failing to follow instructed lags.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if vision-language models perform similarly on working-memory tasks when information is presented visually versus textually.

Method: Evaluated Qwen2.5 and Qwen2.5-VL on spatial n-back tasks with matched text-rendered or image-rendered grids, analyzing accuracy and log-probability evidence.

Result: Models showed higher accuracy with text than vision, often aligning with recency-locked comparisons instead of instructed lags. Grid size influenced interference and error patterns.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for computation-sensitive interpretations of multimodal working memory.

Abstract: Working memory is a central component of intelligent behavior, providing a dynamic workspace for maintaining and updating task-relevant information. Recent work has used n-back tasks to probe working-memory-like behavior in large language models, but it is unclear whether the same probe elicits comparable computations when information is carried in a visual rather than textual code in vision-language models. We evaluate Qwen2.5 and Qwen2.5-VL on a controlled spatial n-back task presented as matched text-rendered or image-rendered grids. Across conditions, models show reliably higher accuracy and d' with text than with vision. To interpret these differences at the process level, we use trial-wise log-probability evidence and find that nominal 2/3-back often fails to reflect the instructed lag and instead aligns with a recency-locked comparison. We further show that grid size alters recent-repeat structure in the stimulus stream, thereby changing interference and error patterns. These results motivate computation-sensitive interpretations of multimodal working memory.

TL;DR: Merging ChemProt and DrugProt datasets improves chemical-gene relation extraction, and combining BioBERT with GCNs enhances performance by capturing both local and global contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding chemical-gene interactions is crucial for drug discovery and biomedical research. Merging datasets and integrating methods can improve accuracy.

Method: Created a merged dataset from ChemProt and DrugProt. Evaluated using BioBERT and GCNs combined with BioBERT to capture local and global contexts.

Result: Merging datasets improved model performance, especially in shared CPR groups. Combining GCNs with BioBERT increased precision and recall in some CPR groups.

Conclusion: Integrating datasets and methods enhances chemical-gene relation extraction, with GCNs complementing BioBERT's local context capture.

Abstract: The extraction of chemical-gene relations plays a pivotal role in understanding the intricate interactions between chemical compounds and genes, with significant implications for drug discovery, disease understanding, and biomedical research. This paper presents a data set created by merging the ChemProt and DrugProt datasets to augment sample counts and improve model accuracy. We evaluate the merged dataset using two state of the art relationship extraction algorithms: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) specifically BioBERT, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) combined with BioBERT. While BioBERT excels at capturing local contexts, it may benefit from incorporating global information essential for understanding chemical-gene interactions. This can be achieved by integrating GCNs with BioBERT to harness both global and local context. Our results show that by integrating the ChemProt and DrugProt datasets, we demonstrated significant improvements in model performance, particularly in CPR groups shared between the datasets. Incorporating the global context using GCN can help increase the overall precision and recall in some of the CPR groups over using just BioBERT.

*Jie Deng,Hanshuang Tong,Jun Li,Shining Liang,Ning Wu,Hongzhi Li,Yutao Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TrajFusion improves LLM fine-tuning by integrating teacher errors with correct reasoning trajectories, outperforming traditional rejection sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM fine-tuning excludes teacher-generated errors, missing opportunities to model reasoning failures.

Method: TrajFusion interleaves incorrect trajectories with reflection prompts and correct ones, adaptively controlling sample length.

Result: TrajFusion outperforms rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) on math benchmarks, especially for complex problems.

Conclusion: TrajFusion offers richer supervision without architectural changes, enhancing LLM performance in math reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made impressive strides in mathematical reasoning, often fine-tuned using rejection sampling that retains only correct reasoning trajectories. While effective, this paradigm treats supervision as a binary filter that systematically excludes teacher-generated errors, leaving a gap in how reasoning failures are modeled during training. In this paper, we propose TrajFusion, a fine-tuning strategy that reframes rejection sampling as a structured supervision construction process. Specifically, TrajFusion forms fused trajectories that explicitly model trial-and-error reasoning by interleaving selected incorrect trajectories with reflection prompts and correct trajectories. The length of each fused sample is adaptively controlled based on the frequency and diversity of teacher errors, providing richer supervision for challenging problems while safely reducing to vanilla rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) when error signals are uninformative. TrajFusion requires no changes to the architecture or training objective. Extensive experiments across multiple math benchmarks demonstrate that TrajFusion consistently outperforms RFT, particularly on challenging and long-form reasoning problems.

*Isabel Tsintsiper,Sheng Wong,Beth Albert,Shaun P Brennecke,Gabriel Davis Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines sex-specific biases in clinical reasoning exhibited by four general-purpose LLMs, showing stable, model-specific biases despite non-informative sex cues. Safe integration requires conservative configurations and human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs exhibit sex biases in clinical reasoning, given their growing use in healthcare workflows and concerns about reproducing existing biases.

Method: Three experiments using 50 clinician-authored vignettes across 44 specialties, testing four LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeekchat) with non-informative sex cues.

Result: All models showed significant sex-assignment skew, varying by model (e.g., ChatGPT favored female assignments, Gemini favored male). Abstention reduced explicit labeling but not downstream biases.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit model-specific sex biases in clinical reasoning, necessitating conservative configurations, specialty-level auditing, and human oversight for safe healthcare integration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in healthcare workflows for documentation, education, and clinical decision support. However, these systems are trained on large text corpora that encode existing biases, including sex disparities in diagnosis and treatment, raising concerns that such patterns may be reproduced or amplified. We systematically examined whether contemporary LLMs exhibit sex-specific biases in clinical reasoning and how model configuration influences these behaviours. We conducted three experiments using 50 clinician-authored vignettes spanning 44 specialties in which sex was non-informative to the initial diagnostic pathway. Four general-purpose LLMs (ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini), Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash and DeepSeekchat). All models demonstrated significant sex-assignment skew, with predicted sex differing by model. At temperature 0.5, ChatGPT assigned female sex in 70% of cases (95% CI 0.66-0.75), DeepSeek in 61% (0.57-0.65) and Claude in 59% (0.55-0.63), whereas Gemini showed a male skew, assigning a female sex in 36% of cases (0.32-0.41). Contemporary LLMs exhibit stable, model-specific sex biases in clinical reasoning. Permitting abstention reduces explicit labelling but does not eliminate downstream diagnostic differences. Safe clinical integration requires conservative and documented configuration, specialty-level clinical data auditing, and continued human oversight when deploying general-purpose models in healthcare settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework detects and mitigates bias in LLMs by identifying stereotype-inducing words and attributing bias to specific neurons, without fine-tuning or prompt changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit social biases, and existing debiasing methods face scalability issues or degrade user experience.

Method: Comparative analysis identifies stereotype-inducing words; integrated gradients attribute bias to neurons; direct intervention on activations mitigates bias.

Result: The method reduces bias in three LLMs while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable and effective solution for mitigating bias in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their outputs often exhibit social biases, raising fairness concerns. Existing debiasing methods, such as fine-tuning on additional datasets or prompt engineering, face scalability issues or compromise user experience in multi-turn interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for detecting stereotype-inducing words and attributing neuron-level bias in LLMs, without the need for fine-tuning or prompt modification. Our framework first identifies stereotype-inducing adjectives and nouns via comparative analysis across demographic groups. We then attribute biased behavior to specific neurons using two attribution strategies based on integrated gradients. Finally, we mitigate bias by directly intervening on their activations at the projection layer. Experiments on three widely used LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces bias while preserving overall model performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Swordsman is an entropy-driven adaptive block-wise decoding framework for DLMs that improves inference speed and quality by dynamically partitioning blocks and adjusting unmasking thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing block-wise decoding methods rigidly partition blocks, fragmenting semantic/syntactic constituents and leading to suboptimal performance. The entropy reduction hypothesis inspires adaptive partitioning based on entropy shifts.

Method: Swordsman employs entropy analysis to identify constituent boundaries, adaptively partitions blocks, and dynamically adjusts unmasking thresholds based on real-time status within a block.

Result: Supported by KV Cache, Swordsman achieves state-of-the-art performance in evaluations without requiring training.

Conclusion: Swordsman enhances DLMs by aligning block partitions with constituent boundaries and optimizing unmasking thresholds, offering improved efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Block-wise decoding effectively improves the inference speed and quality in diffusion language models (DLMs) by combining inter-block sequential denoising and intra-block parallel unmasking. However, existing block-wise decoding methods typically partition blocks in a rigid and fixed manner, which inevitably fragments complete semantic or syntactic constituents, leading to suboptimal performance. Inspired by the entropy reduction hypothesis (ERH), we recognize that constituent boundaries offer greater opportunities for uncertainty reduction, which motivates us to employ entropy analysis for identifying constituent boundaries. Therefore, we propose Swordsman, an entropy-driven adaptive block-wise decoding framework for DLMs. Swordsman adaptively partitions blocks by identifying entropy shifts between adjacent tokens to better align with semantic or syntactic constituent boundaries. In addition, Swordsman dynamically adjusts unmasking thresholds conditioned on the real-time unmasking status within a block, further improving both efficiency and stability. As a training-free framework, supported by KV Cache, Swordsman demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across extensive evaluations.

*Xinglong Yang,Zhilin Peng,Zhanzhan Liu,Haochen Shi,Sheng-Jun Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces H-GIVR, a framework inspired by human reasoning to dynamically correct errors in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by reusing historical reasoning information, significantly improving accuracy with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-consistency methods for MLLMs lack dynamic error correction and reuse of historical reasoning data, limiting their ability to adjust reasoning iteratively.

Method: The H-GIVR framework enables MLLMs to observe images multiple times and use past answers as references for dynamic error correction during iterative reasoning.

Result: Experiments on five datasets and three models show H-GIVR improves accuracy significantly (e.g., 107% on ScienceQA) with minimal computational overhead (2.57 responses per question).

Conclusion: H-GIVR enhances cross-modal reasoning accuracy by dynamically correcting errors, outperforming traditional self-consistency methods.

Abstract: Self-consistency methods are the core technique for improving the reasoning reliability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By generating multiple reasoning results through repeated sampling and selecting the best answer via voting, they play an important role in cross-modal tasks. However, most existing self-consistency methods are limited to a fixed ``repeated sampling and voting'' paradigm and do not reuse historical reasoning information. As a result, models struggle to actively correct visual understanding errors and dynamically adjust their reasoning during iteration. Inspired by the human reasoning behavior of repeated verification and dynamic error correction, we propose the H-GIVR framework. During iterative reasoning, the MLLM observes the image multiple times and uses previously generated answers as references for subsequent steps, enabling dynamic correction of errors and improving answer accuracy. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five datasets and three models. The results show that the H-GIVR framework can significantly improve cross-modal reasoning accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. For instance, using \texttt{Llama3.2-vision:11b} on the ScienceQA dataset, the model requires an average of 2.57 responses per question to achieve an accuracy of 78.90\%, representing a 107\% improvement over the baseline.

TL;DR: AUSteer is a novel method for fine-grained activation steering in large language models, addressing the inefficiency of block-level steering by targeting beneficial atomic units (AUs) for precise and effective modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Block-level activation steering in LLMs is inefficient due to heterogeneity in activations, which mix beneficial, irrelevant, and harmful features. This motivates the need for finer-grained steering at the atomic unit (AU) level.

Method: The paper introduces AUSteer, which identifies discriminative AUs globally using activation momenta on contrastive samples and assigns adaptive steering strengths tailored to inputs and selected AUs.

Result: Experiments on multiple LLMs and tasks demonstrate that AUSteer outperforms advanced baselines while steering fewer activations, achieving better results with less intervention.

Conclusion: Fine-grained AU-level steering is more precise and effective than block-level steering, enabling efficient modification of LLM behaviors with fewer interventions.

Abstract: Activation steering has emerged as a cost-effective paradigm for modifying large language model (LLM) behaviors. Existing methods typically intervene at the block level, steering the bundled activations of selected attention heads, feedforward networks, or residual streams. However, we reveal that block-level activations are inherently heterogeneous, entangling beneficial, irrelevant, and harmful features, thereby rendering block-level steering coarse, inefficient, and intrusive. To investigate the root cause, we decompose block activations into fine-grained atomic unit (AU)-level activations, where each AU-level activation corresponds to a single dimension of the block activation, and each AU denotes a slice of the block weight matrix. Steering an AU-level activation is thus equivalent to steering its associated AU. Our theoretical and empirical analysis show that heterogeneity arises because different AUs or dimensions control distinct token distributions in LLM outputs. Hence, block-level steering inevitably moves helpful and harmful token directions together, which reduces efficiency. Restricting intervention to beneficial AUs yields more precise and effective steering. Building on this insight, we propose AUSteer, a simple and efficient method that operates at a finer granularity of the AU level. AUSteer first identifies discriminative AUs globally by computing activation momenta on contrastive samples. It then assigns adaptive steering strengths tailored to diverse inputs and selected AU activations. Comprehensive experiments on multiple LLMs and tasks show that AUSteer consistently surpasses advanced baselines while steering considerably fewer activations, demonstrating that steering less achieves more.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates micro domain-adaptive pre-training (mDAPT) for LLMs in generative tasks, breaking the process into subtasks (eliciting, reasoning, composing) and finding mDAPT improves elicitation but not reasoning or composing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore mDAPT's effectiveness for generative tasks in real-world enterprise operations, where proprietary knowledge in small domains (micro domains) is crucial.

Method: The answering process is disentangled into three subtasks: eliciting facts, reasoning over them, and composing answers. mDAPT is evaluated on proprietary IT product knowledge for IT technical support questions.

Result: mDAPT improved elicitation (knowledge retrieval) but not reasoning or composing. Resolving elicitation and reasoning tasks ensures high performance (over 90%), highlighting the need for better reasoning.

Conclusion: mDAPT is effective for knowledge retrieval in micro domains but requires enhancements in reasoning and composition for broader generative task success.

Abstract: When applying LLMs to real-world enterprise operations, LLMs need to handle proprietary knowledge in small domains of specific operations ($\textbf{micro domains}$). A previous study shows micro domain-adaptive pre-training ($\textbf{mDAPT}$) with fewer documents is effective, similarly to DAPT in larger domains. However, it evaluates mDAPT only on multiple-choice questions; thus, its effectiveness for generative tasks in real-world operations remains unknown. We aim to reveal the potential and bottlenecks of mDAPT for generative tasks. To this end, we disentangle the answering process into three subtasks and evaluate the performance of each subtask: (1) $\textbf{eliciting}$ facts relevant to questions from an LLM's own knowledge, (2) $\textbf{reasoning}$ over the facts to obtain conclusions, and (3) $\textbf{composing}$ long-form answers based on the conclusions. We verified mDAPT on proprietary IT product knowledge for real-world questions in IT technical support operations. As a result, mDAPT resolved the elicitation task that the base model struggled with but did not resolve other subtasks. This clarifies mDAPT's effectiveness in the knowledge aspect and its bottlenecks in other aspects. Further analysis empirically shows that resolving the elicitation and reasoning tasks ensures sufficient performance (over 90%), emphasizing the need to enhance reasoning capability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Modality-aware Consistency Reasoning (MCR) to address modality bias in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER), achieving better performance than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome modality bias in MLLMs when performing GMNER, as these models tend to rely on unimodal shortcuts instead of cross-modal verification.

Method: The proposed MCR includes Multi-style Reasoning Schema Injection (MRSI) to translate constraints into reasoning chains and Constraint-guided Verifiable Optimization (CVO) to align reasoning trajectories using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: Experiments show MCR effectively mitigates modality bias and outperforms existing methods on GMNER and visual grounding tasks.

Conclusion: MCR provides a robust solution for reducing modality bias in MLLMs, enhancing their performance in multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) aims to extract text-based entities, assign them semantic categories, and ground them to corresponding visual regions. In this work, we explore the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform GMNER in an end-to-end manner, moving beyond their typical role as auxiliary tools within cascaded pipelines. Crucially, our investigation reveals a fundamental challenge: MLLMs exhibit $\textbf{modality bias}$, including visual bias and textual bias, which stems from their tendency to take unimodal shortcuts rather than rigorous cross-modal verification. To address this, we propose Modality-aware Consistency Reasoning ($\textbf{MCR}$), which enforces structured cross-modal reasoning through Multi-style Reasoning Schema Injection (MRSI) and Constraint-guided Verifiable Optimization (CVO). MRSI transforms abstract constraints into executable reasoning chains, while CVO empowers the model to dynamically align its reasoning trajectories with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on GMNER and visual grounding tasks demonstrate that MCR effectively mitigates modality bias and achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand human reading behavior in garden-path sentences by distinguishing key processing costs and accounting for inattentive reading.

Method: A latent-process mixture model was applied to data from eye tracking, self-paced reading (uni- and bidirectional), and Maze paradigms.

Result: The model accurately reproduced empirical patterns in rereading, comprehension responses, and grammaticality judgments, outperforming GPT-2-based models.

Conclusion: The model provides more realistic estimates of reading behavior, with implications for future research in cognitive processing.

Abstract: Using temporarily ambiguous garden-path sentences ("While the team trained the striker wondered ...") as a test case, we present a latent-process mixture model of human reading behavior across four different reading paradigms (eye tracking, uni- and bidirectional self-paced reading, Maze). The model distinguishes between garden-path probability, garden-path cost, and reanalysis cost, and yields more realistic processing cost estimates by taking into account trials with inattentive reading. We show that the model is able to reproduce empirical patterns with regard to rereading behavior, comprehension question responses, and grammaticality judgments. Cross-validation reveals that the mixture model also has better predictive fit to human reading patterns and end-of-trial task data than a mixture-free model based on GPT-2-derived surprisal values. We discuss implications for future work.

TL;DR: PersoDPO is introduced as a scalable preference optimization framework to enhance persona-grounded dialogue systems by improving contextual coherence and personalization using automatic evaluation signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of open-source LLMs struggling with generating persona-aligned and contextually coherent responses despite their general conversational strengths.

Method: PersoDPO uses automatic evaluation signals from both closed-source and open-source LLMs to fine-tune models, incorporating metrics for coherence, personalization, and instruction adherence to create preference pairs without manual annotation.

Result: Experiments on the FoCus dataset show PersoDPO outperforms open-source baselines and standard DPO variants across multiple evaluation dimensions.

Conclusion: PersoDPO effectively improves persona-grounded dialogue systems by leveraging scalable, automatic preference optimization.

Abstract: Personalization and contextual coherence are two essential components in building effective persona-grounded dialogue systems. These aspects play a crucial role in enhancing user engagement and ensuring responses are more relevant and consistent with user identity. However, recent studies indicate that open-source large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle to generate responses that are both contextually grounded and aligned with persona cues, despite exhibiting strong general conversational abilities like fluency and naturalness. We present PersoDPO, a scalable preference optimisation framework that uses supervision signals from automatic evaluations of responses generated by both closed-source and open-source LLMs to fine-tune dialogue models. The framework integrates evaluation metrics targeting coherence and personalization, along with a length-format compliance feature to promote instruction adherence. These signals are combined to automatically construct high-quality preference pairs without manual annotation, enabling a scalable and reproducible training pipeline. Experiments on the FoCus dataset show that an open-source language model fine-tuned with the PersoDPO framework consistently outperforms strong open-source baselines and a standard Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) variant across multiple evaluation dimensions.

### [125] [Model-Dowser: Data-Free Importance Probing to Mitigate Catastrophic Forgetting in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04509)
*Hyeontaek Hwang,Nguyen Dinh Son,Daeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Model-Dowser is a sparse fine-tuning method for MLLMs that mitigates catastrophic forgetting by selectively updating low-importance parameters, outperforming existing methods while remaining scalable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning MLLMs improves downstream task performance but often causes catastrophic forgetting, reducing generalization on pretrained tasks. Existing methods fail with deeper layers or larger models.

Method: Model-Dowser measures parameter importance using weight magnitudes, input activations, and output sensitivities, then selectively updates low-importance parameters during fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on LLaVA and NVILA show Model-Dowser effectively reduces forgetting and outperforms prior methods, remaining efficient even for large models.

Conclusion: Model-Dowser offers a scalable and effective solution for fine-tuning MLLMs without sacrificing generalization on pretrained tasks.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on task-specific data is an effective way to improve performance on downstream applications. However, such adaptation often leads to a degradation in generalization on pretrained tasks, a phenomenon known as Catastrophic Forgetting. Existing methods that aim to mitigate this issue either become ineffective when fine-tuning deeper layers of the language decoder or scale poorly with increasing model size. To address these limitations, we propose Model-Dowser, a novel sparse fine-tuning approach for MLLMs. Model-Dowser measures a principled importance score for each model parameter with respect to pretrained generalization (prior to downstream adaptation) by jointly considering weight magnitudes, input activations, and output sensitivities. During fine-tuning, Model-Dowser selectively preserves high-importance parameters and updates the remaining. Comprehensive experiments on two representative MLLMs, LLaVA and NVILA, demonstrate that Model-Dowser effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and consistently outperforms prior methods, while remaining resource-efficient and scalable to multi-billion-parameter models.

*Bach Phan-Tat,Kris Heylen,Dirk Geeraerts,Stefano De Pascale,Dirk Speelman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a frame semantics-based method for lexical semantic change detection, showing it outperforms neural embedding models while offering better interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural embedding models for lexical semantic change detection lack interpretability, prompting the exploration of an alternative using frame semantics.

Method: The study employs frame semantics exclusively to detect semantic changes, comparing its performance against traditional distributional semantic models.

Result: The frame semantics method is effective, often outperforming neural embedding models, and provides highly interpretable predictions.

Conclusion: Frame semantics offers a promising, interpretable alternative to neural embedding models for lexical semantic change detection, validated by detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis.

Abstract: The majority of contemporary computational methods for lexical semantic change (LSC) detection are based on neural embedding distributional representations. Although these models perform well on LSC benchmarks, their results are often difficult to interpret. We explore an alternative approach that relies solely on frame semantics. We show that this method is effective for detecting semantic change and can even outperform many distributional semantic models. Finally, we present a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of its predictions, demonstrating that they are both plausible and highly interpretable

*Aditya Kasliwal,Pratinav Seth,Vinay Kumar Sankarapu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C-Δθ is a method to enforce LLM safety policies offline by updating sparse circuits, eliminating runtime hooks while retaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the recurring compute cost and complexity of inference-time safety controls in LLMs by exploring offline solutions.

Method: Proposes C-Δθ: Circuit Restricted Weight Arithmetic, which localizes refusal-causal circuits using EAP-IG and computes constrained weight updates (<5% of parameters) for offline deployment.

Result: The method shows effective category-targeted selectivity and capability retention in benchmarks, shifting cost to a one-time update.

Conclusion: C-Δθ successfully moves selective refusal offline, reducing runtime overhead while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Modern deployments require LLMs to enforce safety policies at scale, yet many controls rely on inference-time interventions that add recurring compute cost and serving complexity. Activation steering is widely used, but it requires runtime hooks and scales cost with the number of generations; conditional variants improve selectivity by gating when steering is applied but still retain an inference-time control path. We ask whether selective refusal can be moved entirely offline: can a mechanistic understanding of category-specific refusal be distilled into a circuit-restricted weight update that deploys as a standard checkpoint? We propose C-Δθ: Circuit Restricted Weight Arithmetic, which (i) localizes refusal-causal computation as a sparse circuit using EAP-IG and (ii) computes a constrained weight update ΔθC supported only on that circuit (typically <5% of parameters). Applying ΔθC yields a drop-in edited checkpoint with no inference-time hooks, shifting cost from per-request intervention to a one-time offline update. We evaluate category-targeted selectivity and capability retention on refusal and utility benchmarks.

*Gang Lin,Dongfang Li,Zhuoen Chen,Yukun Shi,Xuhui Chen,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LycheeDecode is a fine-grained hybrid-head attention mechanism that improves efficiency and performance in long-context LLMs by dynamically selecting crucial tokens and reusing them, achieving up to 2.7x speedup without compromising quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key-value cache expansion in long-context LLMs creates memory and latency bottlenecks. Existing coarse-grained token-sharing methods undermine performance by ignoring the functional diversity of attention heads.

Method: LycheeDecode uses a fine-grained hybrid-head attention mechanism with a HardKuma-based top-k selection strategy. It splits attention heads into retrieval heads (for dynamic token identification) and sparse heads (for token reuse).

Result: Tests on models like Llama3 and Qwen3 show LycheeDecode matches or surpasses full-attention baselines in generative quality while achieving up to 2.7x speedup at 128K context length.

Conclusion: LycheeDecode's fine-grained strategy preserves attention head diversity, addressing efficiency and performance bottlenecks in long-context LLM inference.

Abstract: The proliferation of long-context large language models (LLMs) exposes a key bottleneck: the rapidly expanding key-value cache during decoding, which imposes heavy memory and latency costs. While recent approaches attempt to alleviate this by sharing a single set of crucial tokens across layers, such coarse-grained sharing undermines model performance by neglecting the functional diversity of attention heads. To address this, we propose LycheeDecode, an efficient decoding method centered on a fine-grained hybrid-head attention mechanism that employs a hardware-efficient top-k selection strategy. Specifically, the novel HardKuma-based mechanism partitions attention heads into a small subset of retrieval heads that dynamically identify crucial tokens and a majority of sparse heads that reuse them for efficient computation. Through extensive experiments on leading models like Llama3 and Qwen3 across diverse benchmarks for long-context understanding (e.g., LongBench, RULER) and complex reasoning (e.g., AIME24, OlympiadBench), we demonstrate that LycheeDecode achieves generative quality comparable to, and at times surpassing even the full-attention baseline. Crucially, this is accomplished with up to a 2.7x speedup at a 128K context length. By preserving the functional diversity of attention heads, our fine-grained strategy overcomes the performance bottlenecks of existing methods, providing a powerful and validated pathway to both efficient and high-quality long-context LLM inference.

*Jian Gu,Aldeida Aleti,Chunyang Chen,Hongyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pseudo-Inverse Tying (PIT) synchronizes embedding and unembedding as projections of a shared latent token memory, improving training stability and reducing side effects in compact language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weight tying in language models often leads to unstable token interfaces during training, making optimization and post-training interventions unpredictable.

Method: PIT uses a shared latent token memory with orthonormal initialization and a learned symmetric positive definite transform via Cholesky factorization to ensure pseudo-inverse consistency.

Result: PIT shows improved training stability, stronger semantic consistency, and reduced side effects in models ranging from 256M to 1.3B parameters.

Conclusion: PIT effectively addresses the instability of traditional weight tying, enhancing model performance and predictability.

Abstract: Weight tying is widely used in compact language models to reduce parameters by sharing the token table between the input embedding and the output projection. However, weight sharing does not guarantee a stable token interface: during training, the correspondence between encoding tokens into hidden states and decoding hidden states into logits can drift, worsening optimization sensitivity and making post-training interventions such as editing, patching, and lightweight adaptation less predictable. We propose Pseudo-Inverse Tying (PIT), which synchronizes embedding and unembedding as coupled projections of a shared latent token memory, guaranteeing a pseudo-inverse-consistent interface throughout training. PIT maintains an orthonormal shared memory, obtained by thin polar decomposition for teacher initialization or random orthonormal initialization from scratch, and introduces a fully learned symmetric positive definite hidden-space transform parameterized via a Cholesky factor. The output head applies this transform to hidden states before the vocabulary projection, while the embedding applies the inverse transform to token vectors using stable triangular solves, avoiding explicit pseudo-inverse recomputation and any vocabulary-sized auxiliary parameters. We evaluate PIT on on-device models spanning 256M-1.3B parameters across pretraining and adaptation, and consistently observe improved training stability, stronger layerwise semantic consistency, and substantially reduced side effects.

*Eliezer Shlomi,Ido Levy,Eilam Shapira,Michael Katz,Guy Uziel,Segev Shlomov,Nir Mashkif,Roi Reichart,Sarah Keren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmbedPlan replaces autoregressive LLM planning with a lightweight transition model in embedding space for faster computation, showing strong interpolation but limited cross-domain transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based planning is slow due to token-by-token generation and repeated forward passes, making multi-step lookahead costly in latency and compute.

Method: EmbedPlan encodes states/actions into vectors, predicts next-state embeddings, and retrieves the next state via nearest-neighbor similarity without fine-tuning the encoder.

Result: Achieves near-perfect interpolation but struggles with generalization to unseen problems or domains; excels in plan-variant evaluations.

Conclusion: Frozen embeddings enable efficient within-domain dynamics learning but cross-domain transfer remains challenging.

Abstract: Planning with LLMs is bottlenecked by token-by-token generation and repeated full forward passes, making multi-step lookahead and rollout-based search expensive in latency and compute. We propose EmbedPlan, which replaces autoregressive next-state generation with a lightweight transition model operating in a frozen language embedding space. EmbedPlan encodes natural language state and action descriptions into vectors, predicts the next-state embedding, and retrieves the next state by nearest-neighbor similarity, enabling fast planning computation without fine-tuning the encoder. We evaluate next-state prediction across nine classical planning domains using six evaluation protocols of increasing difficulty: interpolation, plan-variant, extrapolation, multi-domain, cross-domain, and leave-one-out. Results show near-perfect interpolation performance but a sharp degradation when generalization requires transfer to unseen problems or unseen domains; plan-variant evaluation indicates generalization to alternative plans rather than memorizing seen trajectories. Overall, frozen embeddings support within-domain dynamics learning after observing a domain's transitions, while transfer across domain boundaries remains a bottleneck.

*Estrella Pivel-Villanueva,Elisabeth Frederike Sterner,Franziska Knolle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes the stability of entropy estimates in human language comprehension using cloze datasets and compares human responses with LLM predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine how many human responses are needed for stable entropy estimates and to evaluate if LLMs can replicate human entropy accurately.

Method: Used bootstrap-based convergence analysis on German and English cloze datasets, comparing human entropy with LLM-derived estimates (GPT-4o, GPT2-xl, etc.).

Result: 97% of sentences reached stable entropy estimates; GPT-4o showed the highest human alignment, though extraction methods varied in accuracy.

Conclusion: Provides guidelines for human norming and shows LLMs can approximate human entropy but are not perfect substitutes.

Abstract: Predicting upcoming words is a core mechanism of language comprehension and may be quantified using Shannon entropy. There is currently no empirical consensus on how many human responses are required to obtain stable and unbiased entropy estimates at the word level. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as substitutes for human norming data, yet their ability to reproduce stable human entropy remains unclear. Here, we address both issues using two large publicly available cloze datasets in German 1 and English 2. We implemented a bootstrap-based convergence analysis that tracks how entropy estimates stabilize as a function of sample size. Across both languages, more than 97% of sentences reached stable entropy estimates within the available sample sizes. 90% of sentences converged after 111 responses in German and 81 responses in English, while low-entropy sentences (<1) required as few as 20 responses and high-entropy sentences (>2.5) substantially more. These findings provide the first direct empirical validation for common norming practices and demonstrate that convergence critically depends on sentence predictability. We then compared stable human entropy values with entropy estimates derived from several LLMs, including GPT-4o, using both logit-based probability extraction and sampling-based frequency estimation, GPT2-xl/german-GPT-2, RoBERTa Base/GottBERT, and LLaMA 2 7B Chat. GPT-4o showed the highest correspondence with human data, although alignment depended strongly on the extraction method and prompt design. Logit-based estimates minimized absolute error, whereas sampling-based estimates were better in capturing the dispersion of human variability. Together, our results establish practical guidelines for human norming and show that while LLMs can approximate human entropy, they are not interchangeable with stable human-derived distributions.

TL;DR: SSD distills semantic uncertainty into lightweight student models for efficient hallucination prediction and reliability evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational cost of semantic dispersion for uncertainty quantification in large language models.

Method: Distilling sampled semantic distributions into student models to predict uncertainty before token generation.

Result: Student models match or outperform semantic dispersion for hallucination prediction and out-of-domain detection on TriviaQA.

Conclusion: SSD offers a scalable framework for uncertainty distillation in complex output spaces beyond language.

Abstract: Large language models present challenges for principled uncertainty quantification, in part due to their complexity and the diversity of their outputs. Semantic dispersion, or the variance in the meaning of sampled answers, has been proposed as a useful proxy for model uncertainty, but the associated computational cost prohibits its use in latency-critical applications. We show that sampled semantic distributions can be distilled into lightweight student models which estimate a prompt-conditioned uncertainty before the language model generates an answer token. The student model predicts a semantic distribution over possible answers; the entropy of this distribution provides an effective uncertainty signal for hallucination prediction, and the probability density allows candidate answers to be evaluated for reliability. On TriviaQA, our student models match or outperform finite-sample semantic dispersion for hallucination prediction and provide a strong signal for out-of-domain answer detection. We term this technique Semantic Self-Distillation (SSD), which we suggest provides a general framework for distilling predictive uncertainty in complex output spaces beyond language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Trust The Typical (T3), a novel framework for LLM safety by treating it as an out-of-distribution detection problem, achieving state-of-the-art performance without training on harmful examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety methods rely on brittle guardrails. The paper argues robust safety comes from understanding safe distributions rather than blocking known threats.

Method: T3 learns the distribution of acceptable prompts in semantic space and flags deviations as threats, requiring no training on harmful examples.

Result: T3 outperforms specialized safety models across 18 benchmarks, reducing false positives by up to 40x and transferring effectively to 14 languages without retraining.

Conclusion: T3 demonstrates production readiness with minimal overhead, offering a scalable solution for continuous guardrailing in diverse domains and languages.

Abstract: Current approaches to LLM safety fundamentally rely on a brittle cat-and-mouse game of identifying and blocking known threats via guardrails. We argue for a fresh approach: robust safety comes not from enumerating what is harmful, but from deeply understanding what is safe. We introduce Trust The Typical (T3), a framework that operationalizes this principle by treating safety as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. T3 learns the distribution of acceptable prompts in a semantic space and flags any significant deviation as a potential threat. Unlike prior methods, it requires no training on harmful examples, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance across 18 benchmarks spanning toxicity, hate speech, jailbreaking, multilingual harms, and over-refusal, reducing false positive rates by up to 40x relative to specialized safety models. A single model trained only on safe English text transfers effectively to diverse domains and over 14 languages without retraining. Finally, we demonstrate production readiness by integrating a GPU-optimized version into vLLM, enabling continuous guardrailing during token generation with less than 6% overhead even under dense evaluation intervals on large-scale workloads.

Conclusion: VILLAIN demonstrates effective multimodal verification with publicly available code.

Abstract: This paper describes VILLAIN, a multimodal fact-checking system that verifies image-text claims through prompt-based multi-agent collaboration. For the AVerImaTeC shared task, VILLAIN employs vision-language model agents across multiple stages of fact-checking. Textual and visual evidence is retrieved from the knowledge store enriched through additional web collection. To identify key information and address inconsistencies among evidence items, modality-specific and cross-modal agents generate analysis reports. In the subsequent stage, question-answer pairs are produced based on these reports. Finally, the Verdict Prediction agent produces the verification outcome based on the image-text claim and the generated question-answer pairs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores trait-based automated essay scoring for argumentative writing, comparing structured in-context learning with small LLMs and a supervised BigBird model. Results show ordinality modeling improves human rater agreement, while small LLMs offer competitive performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated essay scoring systems lack pedagogical usefulness by focusing on holistic scores. Teachers and learners need trait-level feedback aligned with instructional goals and rubrics.

Method: Two modeling paradigms are studied: (1) structured in-context learning with small open-source LLMs and (2) a supervised BigBird model using CORAL-style ordinal regression. Evaluation is conducted on the ASAP++ dataset with five quality traits.

Result: Explicitly modeling score ordinality improves agreement with human raters, outperforming LLMs and baselines. Small LLMs achieve competitive performance without fine-tuning, especially for reasoning traits.

Conclusion: Aligning model objectives with rubric semantics enhances educational assessment. Small LLMs offer transparent, privacy-preserving solutions, providing insights for AI-based educational systems.

Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring systems have traditionally focused on holistic scores, limiting their pedagogical usefulness, especially in the case of complex essay genres such as argumentative writing. In educational contexts, teachers and learners require interpretable, trait-level feedback that aligns with instructional goals and established rubrics. In this paper, we study trait-based Automatic Argumentative Essay Scoring using two complementary modeling paradigms designed for realistic educational deployment: (1) structured in-context learning with small open-source LLMs, and (2) a supervised, encoder-based BigBird model with a CORAL-style ordinal regression formulation, optimized for long-sequence understanding. We conduct a systematic evaluation on the ASAP++ dataset, which includes essay scores across five quality traits, offering strong coverage of core argumentation dimensions. LLMs are prompted with designed, rubric-aligned in-context examples, along with feedback and confidence requests, while we explicitly model ordinality in scores with the BigBird model via the rank-consistent CORAL framework. Our results show that explicitly modeling score ordinality substantially improves agreement with human raters across all traits, outperforming LLMs and nominal classification and regression-based baselines. This finding reinforces the importance of aligning model objectives with rubric semantics for educational assessment. At the same time, small open-source LLMs achieve a competitive performance without task-specific fine-tuning, particularly for reasoning-oriented traits, while enabling transparent, privacy-preserving, and locally deployable assessment scenarios. Our findings provide methodological, modeling, and practical insights for the design of AI-based educational systems that aim to deliver interpretable, rubric-aligned feedback for argumentative writing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RexBERT is a family of BERT-style encoders tailored for e-commerce, leveraging a specialized 350B token corpus and a three-phase pretraining recipe, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose encoders lack coverage for specialized domains like e-commerce, while domain-specific models can improve performance in retrieval, classification, and ranking systems.

Method: The approach includes curating a 350B token e-commerce corpus (Ecom-niverse), designing a modular pipeline for domain-specific content extraction, and implementing a three-phase pretraining recipe (general pre-training, context extension, and annealed domain specialization).

Result: RexBERT models (17M-400M parameters) outperform larger general-purpose encoders and match/surpass modern long-context models in e-commerce tasks despite having fewer parameters.

Conclusion: High-quality in-domain data and a principled training approach are more effective for e-commerce applications than indiscriminate scaling of model size.

Abstract: Encoder-only transformers remain indispensable in retrieval, classification, and ranking systems where latency, stability, and cost are paramount. Most general purpose encoders, however, are trained on generic corpora with limited coverage of specialized domains. We introduce RexBERT, a family of BERT-style encoders designed specifically for e-commerce semantics. We make three contributions. First, we release Ecom-niverse, a 350 billion token corpus curated from diverse retail and shopping sources. We describe a modular pipeline that isolates and extracts e-commerce content from FineFineWeb and other open web resources, and characterize the resulting domain distribution. Second, we present a reproducible pretraining recipe building on ModernBERT's architectural advances. The recipe consists of three phases: general pre-training, context extension, and annealed domain specialization. Third, we train RexBERT models ranging from 17M to 400M parameters and evaluate them on token classification, semantic similarity, and general natural language understanding tasks using e-commerce datasets. Despite having 2-3x fewer parameters, RexBERT outperforms larger general-purpose encoders and matches or surpasses modern long-context models on domain-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that high quality in-domain data combined with a principled training approach provides a stronger foundation for e-commerce applications than indiscriminate scaling alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving precise feature-level interpretation in LLMs is crucial for high-stakes tasks, but existing methods suffer from attribution dilution due to high dimensionality.

Method: Focus-LIME uses a proxy model to curate perturbation neighborhoods, enabling fine-grained attribution within optimized contexts.

Result: Empirical evaluations show the method makes surgical explanations practicable and provides faithful explanations.

Conclusion: Focus-LIME successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods, offering a scalable solution for high-stakes tasks.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to handle massive context windows, achieving surgical feature-level interpretation is essential for high-stakes tasks like legal auditing and code debugging. However, existing local model-agnostic explanation methods face a critical dilemma in these scenarios: feature-based methods suffer from attribution dilution due to high feature dimensionality, thus failing to provide faithful explanations. In this paper, we propose Focus-LIME, a coarse-to-fine framework designed to restore the tractability of surgical interpretation. Focus-LIME utilizes a proxy model to curate the perturbation neighborhood, allowing the target model to perform fine-grained attribution exclusively within the optimized context. Empirical evaluations on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that our method makes surgical explanations practicable and provides faithful explanations to users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to go beyond word-level analyses in MI for MT and understand how LLMs internally handle sentence-level translation tasks.

Method: The study analyzes attention heads across three open-source LLM families and 20 translation directions, identifying specialized heads for subtasks and constructing subtask-specific steering vectors.

Result: Results show that modifying just 1% of relevant heads achieves instruction-free MT performance matching instruction-based prompting, while ablation selectively disrupts subtask functions.

Conclusion: Distinct attention heads specialize in MT subtasks, enabling targeted manipulation for improved mechanistic understanding and performance.

Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) seeks to explain how neural networks implement their capabilities, but the scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has limited prior MI work in Machine Translation (MT) to word-level analyses. We study sentence-level MT from a mechanistic perspective by analyzing attention heads to understand how LLMs internally encode and distribute translation functions. We decompose MT into two subtasks: producing text in the target language (i.e. target language identification) and preserving the input sentence's meaning (i.e. sentence equivalence). Across three families of open-source models and 20 translation directions, we find that distinct, sparse sets of attention heads specialize in each subtask. Based on this insight, we construct subtask-specific steering vectors and show that modifying just 1% of the relevant heads enables instruction-free MT performance comparable to instruction-based prompting, while ablating these heads selectively disrupts their corresponding translation functions.

TL;DR: LEAD improves Radiology Report Generation by aligning LVLM decoding with expert features layer-wise to reduce hallucinations and enhance clinical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RRG methods relying on external knowledge overlook decoding biases and lack robustness, prompting the need for inherent model modifications.

Method: Proposes Layer-wise Expert-aligned Decoding (LEAD), integrating pathological experts via a gating mechanism into each decoder layer for dynamic bias correction.

Result: LEAD achieves better clinical accuracy and reduces hallucinations while maintaining high report quality on public datasets.

Conclusion: LEAD effectively addresses decoding biases and hallucinations in RRG by leveraging expert-guided layer-wise decoding.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to produce accurate and coherent diagnostics from medical images. Although large vision language models (LVLM) improve report fluency and accuracy, they exhibit hallucinations, generating plausible yet image-ungrounded pathological details. Existing methods primarily rely on external knowledge guidance to facilitate the alignment between generated text and visual information. However, these approaches often ignore the inherent decoding priors and vision-language alignment biases in pretrained models and lack robustness due to reliance on constructed guidance. In this paper, we propose Layer-wise Expert-aligned Decoding (LEAD), a novel method to inherently modify the LVLM decoding trajectory. A multiple experts module is designed for extracting distinct pathological features which are integrated into each decoder layer via a gating mechanism. This layer-wise architecture enables the LLM to consult expert features at every inference step via a learned gating function, thereby dynamically rectifying decoding biases and steering the generation toward factual consistency. Experiments conducted on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the LEAD method yields effective improvements in clinical accuracy metrics and mitigates hallucinations while preserving high generation quality.

Method: Proposes an embedding method to analyze textual semantics alongside graph structures, tested on ~56 million Web of Science publications.

Result: Reveals a self-structured landscape of texts, showcasing the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach successfully integrates semantic and relational features, offering practical insights for large-scale text analysis.

Abstract: Large text data sets, such as publications, websites, and other text-based media, inherit two distinct types of features: (1) the text itself, its information conveyed through semantics, and (2) its relationship to other texts through links, references, or shared attributes. While the latter can be described as a graph structure and can be handled by a range of established algorithms for classification and prediction, the former has recently gained new potential through the use of LLM embedding models. Demonstrating these possibilities and their practicability, we investigate the Web of Science dataset, containing ~56 million scientific publications through the lens of our proposed embedding method, revealing a self-structured landscape of texts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Rationale Consistency to address deceptive alignment in Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) and LLM-as-a-Judge, outperforming traditional outcome accuracy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models prioritize outcome accuracy but fail in reasoning alignment, leading to deceptive alignment and poor generalization in RLHF.

Method: Proposes Rationale Consistency as a metric and a hybrid signal combining it with outcome accuracy for GenRM training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on RM-Bench (87.1%) and JudgeBench (82%), with notable improvements in RLHF applications like creative writing (+7%).

Conclusion: The hybrid method successfully mitigates deceptive alignment, enhancing model reasoning and performance.

Abstract: Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) and LLM-as-a-Judge exhibit deceptive alignment by producing correct judgments for incorrect reasons, as they are trained and evaluated to prioritize Outcome Accuracy, which undermines their ability to generalize during RLHF. We introduce Rationale Consistency, a fine-grained metric that quantifies the alignment between the model's reasoning process and human judgment. Our evaluation of frontier models reveals that rationale consistency effectively discriminates among state-of-the-art models and detects deceptive alignment, while outcome accuracy falls short in both respects. To mitigate this gap, we introduce a hybrid signal that combines rationale consistency with outcome accuracy for GenRM training. Our training method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RM-Bench (87.1%) and JudgeBench (82%), surpassing outcome-only baselines by an average of 5%. Using RM during RLHF, our method effectively improves performance as demonstrated on Arena Hard v2, notably yielding a 7% improvement in creative writing tasks. Further analysis confirms that our method escapes the deceptive alignment trap, effectively reversing the decline in rationale consistency observed in outcome-only training.

TL;DR: Comparative evaluation of STS methods for Slovak, covering traditional algorithms, ML models, and third-party tools, with ABC optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STS is understudied in Slovak due to limited resources, prompting a need for effective methods.

Method: Train ML models using traditional algorithm outputs as features, optimized with ABC. Evaluate third-party tools.

Result: Identified trade-offs among traditional, ML, and third-party approaches for Slovak STS.

Conclusion: Provides insights into effective STS methods for Slovak, guiding future research.

Abstract: Semantic textual similarity (STS) plays a crucial role in many natural language processing tasks. While extensively studied in high-resource languages, STS remains challenging for under-resourced languages such as Slovak. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of sentence-level STS methods applied to Slovak, including traditional algorithms, supervised machine learning models, and third-party deep learning tools. We trained several machine learning models using outputs from traditional algorithms as features, with feature selection and hyperparameter tuning jointly guided by artificial bee colony optimization. Finally, we evaluated several third-party tools, including fine-tuned model by CloudNLP, OpenAI's embedding models, GPT-4 model, and pretrained SlovakBERT model. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between different approaches.

TL;DR: The study examines AI-generated images of disabilities using Stable Diffusion XL and DALL-E 3, revealing imbalances and advocating for inclusive refinements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore underexamined disability representations in text-to-image models and assess their inclusivity.

Method: Analyzed image outputs using structured prompts, comparing generic and specific disability categories, and evaluated mitigation strategies with sentiment analysis.

Result: Found persistent imbalances in disability portrayals, emphasizing the need for model refinement.

Conclusion: Continuous evaluation and improvement of generative models are essential for diverse and inclusive disability representations.

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models have made remarkable progress in producing high-quality visual content from textual descriptions, yet concerns remain about how they represent social groups. While characteristics like gender and race have received increasing attention, disability representations remain underexplored. This study investigates how people with disabilities are represented in AI-generated images by analyzing outputs from Stable Diffusion XL and DALL-E 3 using a structured prompt design. We analyze disability representations by comparing image similarities between generic disability prompts and prompts referring to specific disability categories. Moreover, we evaluate how mitigation strategies influence disability portrayals, with a focus on assessing affective framing through sentiment polarity analysis, combining both automatic and human evaluation. Our findings reveal persistent representational imbalances and highlight the need for continuous evaluation and refinement of generative models to foster more diverse and inclusive portrayals of disability.

### [144] [LinGO: A Linguistic Graph Optimization Framework with LLMs for Interpreting Intents of Online Uncivil Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04693)
*Yuan Zhang,Thales Bertaglia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LinGO, a linguistic graph optimization framework for LLMs, improves classification accuracy of multi-class intents of incivility by decomposing language into linguistic components and optimizing error-prone steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing classifiers often misclassify civil posts with uncivil cues, leading to overestimates of online harm. Addressing this is key for safer online spaces.

Method: LinGO decomposes language into linguistic components, identifies error-prone steps, and optimizes prompts/examples using techniques like TextGrad, AdalFlow, DSPy, and RAG.

Result: LinGO outperforms baselines (zero-shot, chain-of-thought, etc.) across multiple LLMs (GPT-5-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, Claude 3 Haiku) in accuracy and F1, with RAG and Gemini achieving top performance.

Conclusion: Incorporating multi-step linguistic components into LLM optimization enhances semantic understanding, applicable to other complex semantic tasks.

Abstract: Detecting uncivil language is crucial for maintaining safe, inclusive, and democratic online spaces. Yet existing classifiers often misinterpret posts containing uncivil cues but expressing civil intents, leading to inflated estimates of harmful incivility online. We introduce LinGO, a linguistic graph optimization framework for large language models (LLMs) that leverages linguistic structures and optimization techniques to classify multi-class intents of incivility that use various direct and indirect expressions. LinGO decomposes language into multi-step linguistic components, identifies targeted steps that cause the most errors, and iteratively optimizes prompt and/or example components for targeted steps. We evaluate it using a dataset collected during the 2022 Brazilian presidential election, encompassing four forms of political incivility: Impoliteness (IMP), Hate Speech and Stereotyping (HSST), Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric (PHAVPR), and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values (THREAT). Each instance is annotated with six types of civil/uncivil intent. We benchmark LinGO using three cost-efficient LLMs: GPT-5-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, and Claude 3 Haiku, and four optimization techniques: TextGrad, AdalFlow, DSPy, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The results show that, across all models, LinGO consistently improves accuracy and weighted F1 compared with zero-shot, chain-of-thought, direct optimization, and fine-tuning baselines. RAG is the strongest optimization technique and, when paired with Gemini model, achieves the best overall performance. These findings demonstrate that incorporating multi-step linguistic components into LLM instructions and optimize targeted components can help the models explain complex semantic meanings, which can be extended to other complex semantic explanation tasks in the future.

TL;DR: ERNIE 5.0 is a unified multimodal autoregressive model trained from scratch for understanding and generating text, image, video, and audio. It uses an ultra-sparse MoE architecture with elastic training for scalability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a scalable, efficient, and versatile foundation model capable of handling multimodal tasks under diverse resource constraints.

Method: Trains all modalities under a unified next-token prediction objective using ultra-sparse MoE with modality-agnostic routing. Introduces elastic training for flexible sub-model generation.

Result: Achieves balanced performance across text, image, video, and audio, representing the first production-scale trillion-parameter multimodal autoregressive model.

Conclusion: ERNIE 5.0 advances unified multimodal modeling with scalable training and practical deployment solutions, offering insights for future research.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce ERNIE 5.0, a natively autoregressive foundation model desinged for unified multimodal understanding and generation across text, image, video, and audio. All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of a trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation. To facilitate further research, we present detailed visualizations of modality-agnostic expert routing in the unified model, alongside comprehensive empirical analysis of elastic training, aiming to offer profound insights to the community.

*Yike Sun,Haotong Yang,Zhouchen Lin,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines low-frequency tokens in BPE tokenizers, introduces LiteToken to remove them, and shows improved efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address wasted vocabulary capacity and vulnerability caused by low-frequency tokens in BPE tokenizers.

Method: Introduces LiteToken, a method to remove residue tokens, tested across common tokenizers.

Result: LiteToken reduces token fragmentation, parameters, and improves robustness without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LiteToken effectively optimizes tokenizers while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental to how language models represent and process text, yet the behavior of widely used BPE tokenizers has received far less study than model architectures and training. In this paper, we investigate intermediate merge residues in BPE vocabularies: tokens that are frequent during merge learning so that retained in the final vocabulary, but are mostly further merged and rarely emitted when tokenizing the corpus during tokenizer usage. Such low-frequency tokens not only waste vocabulary capacity but also increase vulnerability to adversarial or atypical inputs. We present a systematic empirical characterization of this phenomenon across commonly used tokenizers and introduce LiteToken, a simple method for removing residue tokens. Because the affected tokens are rarely used, pretrained models can often accommodate the modified tokenizer without additional fine-tuning. Experiments show that LiteToken reduces token fragmentation, reduces parameters, and improves robustness to noisy or misspelled inputs, while preserving overall performance.

*Fei-Yueh Chen,Lateef Adeleke,C. M. Downey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FER and TER provide linguistically meaningful insights into ASR model performance for African languages, revealing patterns obscured by WER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WER inadequately captures phonological and tonal errors in ASR models for African languages, prompting the need for more nuanced metrics like FER and TER.

Method: Evaluated three speech encoders on two African languages using WER, CER, FER, and TER to analyze phonological and tonal errors.

Result: Models performed better on segmental features but struggled with tones (mid and downstep). FER and TER showed lower error rates compared to WER, indicating nuanced errors.

Conclusion: FER and TER reveal linguistically-salient error patterns, highlighting the limitations of WER in capturing phonetic feature errors.

Abstract: Word Error Rate (WER) mischaracterizes ASR models' performance for African languages by combining phonological, tone, and other linguistic errors into a single lexical error. By contrast, Feature Error Rate (FER) has recently attracted attention as a viable metric that reveals linguistically meaningful errors in models' performance. In this paper, we evaluate three speech encoders on two African languages by complementing WER with CER, and FER, and add a tone-aware extension (TER). We show that by computing errors on phonological features, FER and TER reveal linguistically-salient error patterns even when word-level accuracy remains low. Our results reveal that models perform better on segmental features, while tones (especially mid and downstep) remain the most challenging features. Results on Yoruba show a striking differential in metrics, with WER=0.788, CER=0.305, and FER=0.151. Similarly for Uneme (an endangered language absent from pretraining data) a model with near-total WER and 0.461 CER achieves the relatively low FER of 0.267. This indicates model error is often attributable to individual phonetic feature errors, which is obscured by all-or-nothing metrics like WER.

*Madison Van Doren,Casey Ford,Jennifer Barajas,Cory Holland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A benchmark evaluates cultural localization in machine translation by multilingual LLMs, revealing gaps in translating idioms and puns compared to holidays and cultural concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MT benchmarks focus on token-level accuracy, often missing cultural and pragmatic nuances needed for real-world localization.

Method: Evaluated 7 multilingual LLMs across 15 languages using 5 native-speaker raters per language, scoring full-text translations and culturally nuanced segments (idioms, puns, holidays, cultural concepts) on a 0-3 scale.

Result: Mean overall quality was modest (1.68/3); GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and Mistral Medium performed best. Idioms and puns scored lower (1.65/3, 1.45/3) and were often untranslated.

Conclusion: The study highlights the gap between grammatical accuracy and cultural resonance, advocating for culturally informed training data and better evaluation paradigms.

Abstract: We present a large-scale human evaluation benchmark for assessing cultural localisation in machine translation produced by state-of-the-art multilingual large language models (LLMs). Existing MT benchmarks emphasise token-level and grammatical accuracy, but of ten overlook pragmatic and culturally grounded competencies required for real-world localisation. Building on a pilot study of 87 translations across 20 languages, we evaluate 7 multilingual LLMs across 15 target languages with 5 native-speaker raters per language. Raters scored both full-text translations and segment-level instances of culturally nuanced language (idioms, puns, holidays, and culturally embedded concepts) on an ordinal 0-3 quality scale; segment ratings additionally included an NA option for untranslated segments.
  Across full-text evaluations, mean overall quality is modest (1.68/3): GPT-5 (2.10/3), Claude Sonnet 3.7 (1.97/3), and Mistral Medium 3.1 (1.84/3) form the strongest tier with fewer catastrophic failures. Segment-level results show sharp category effects: holidays (2.20/3) and cultural concepts (2.19/3) translate substantially better than idioms (1.65/3) and puns (1.45/3), and idioms are most likely to be left untranslated. These findings demonstrate a persistent gap between grammatical adequacy and cultural resonance. To our knowledge, this is the first multilingual, human-annotated benchmark focused explicitly on cultural nuance in translation and localisation, highlighting the need for culturally informed training data, improved cross-lingual pragmatics, and evaluation paradigms that better reflect real-world communicative competence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored challenge of adapting general-purpose LLMs into effective retrievers for specialized domains like biomedicine, aiming to reduce hallucinations and improve knowledge updates.

Method: Proposes the STM framework, which uses synthetic hard negatives, retrieval prompt optimization, and model merging to enhance decoder-only LLMs for domain-specific retrieval tasks.

Result: STM improves task-specific experts by up to 23.5% (average 7.5%) on medical and general tasks from the MTEB benchmark, outperforming single experts and baselines without extensive pretraining.

Conclusion: STM provides a scalable and efficient approach to convert general LLMs into high-performing, domain-specialized retrievers, maintaining general-domain capabilities while excelling in specialized tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the backbone of grounding Large Language Models (LLMs), improving knowledge updates and reducing hallucinations. Recently, LLM-based retriever models have shown state-of-the-art performance for RAG applications. However, several technical aspects remain underexplored on how to adapt general-purpose LLMs into effective domain-specific retrievers, especially in specialized domains such as biomedicine. We present Synthesize-Train-Merge (STM), a modular framework that enhances decoder-only LLMs with synthetic hard negatives, retrieval prompt optimization, and model merging. Experiments on a subset of 12 medical and general tasks from the MTEB benchmark show STM boosts task-specific experts by up to 23.5\% (average 7.5\%) and produces merged models that outperform both single experts and strong baselines without extensive pretraining. Our results demonstrate a scalable, efficient path for turning general LLMs into high-performing, domain-specialized retrievers, preserving general-domain capabilities while excelling on specialized tasks.

*Casey Ford,Madison Van Doren,Emily Dix*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the safety of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) under adversarial prompts, revealing persistent vulnerabilities and alignment shifts across model generations and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the harmlessness of MLLMs amidst adversarial prompting and track evolving safety behaviors across updates.

Method: A two-phase evaluation using 726 adversarial prompts by red teamers, testing multiple MLLMs (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, Qwen VL Plus in Phase 1; their successors in Phase 2) with 82,256 human harm ratings.

Result: Pixtral models were most vulnerable; Claude models safest due to high refusal rates. GPT and Claude showed increased attack success rates (ASR) over generations, while Pixtral and Qwen decreased slightly. Modality effectiveness shifted between phases.

Conclusion: MLLM harmlessness varies and evolves, highlighting the need for ongoing multimodal benchmarks to monitor safety.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, yet their safety under adversarial prompting remains underexplored. We present a two-phase evaluation of MLLM harmlessness using a fixed benchmark of 726 adversarial prompts authored by 26 professional red teamers. Phase 1 assessed GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, and Qwen VL Plus; Phase 2 evaluated their successors (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Pixtral Large, and Qwen Omni) yielding 82,256 human harm ratings. Large, persistent differences emerged across model families: Pixtral models were consistently the most vulnerable, whereas Claude models appeared safest due to high refusal rates. Attack success rates (ASR) showed clear alignment drift: GPT and Claude models exhibited increased ASR across generations, while Pixtral and Qwen showed modest decreases. Modality effects also shifted over time: text-only prompts were more effective in Phase 1, whereas Phase 2 produced model-specific patterns, with GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 showing near-equivalent vulnerability across modalities. These findings demonstrate that MLLM harmlessness is neither uniform nor stable across updates, underscoring the need for longitudinal, multimodal benchmarks to track evolving safety behaviour.

TL;DR: The study examines how LLMs perform in detecting political stance in informal online discourse, finding that contextual user profiles improve accuracy by 17.5% to 38.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if contextual information from user profiles enhances LLM accuracy in political stance detection, especially in sarcastic or ambiguous text.

Method: Used a political forum dataset to create structured user profiles (ideology, topics, linguistic patterns) and tested seven LLMs with and without context.

Result: Contextual prompts improved accuracy significantly (up to 74%), with strategic post selection outperforming random context.

Conclusion: User-level context enhances LLM performance in nuanced political classification, highlighting the importance of tailored contextual data.

Abstract: This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for political stance detection in informal online discourse, where language is often sarcastic, ambiguous, and context-dependent. We explore whether providing contextual information, specifically user profile summaries derived from historical posts, can improve classification accuracy. Using a real-world political forum dataset, we generate structured profiles that summarize users' ideological leaning, recurring topics, and linguistic patterns. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs across baseline and context-enriched setups through a comprehensive cross-model evaluation. Our findings show that contextual prompts significantly boost accuracy, with improvements ranging from +17.5\% to +38.5\%, achieving up to 74\% accuracy that surpasses previous approaches. We also analyze how profile size and post selection strategies affect performance, showing that strategically chosen political content yields better results than larger, randomly selected contexts. These findings underscore the value of incorporating user-level context to enhance LLM performance in nuanced political classification tasks.

*Xinyu Zhou,Chang Jin,Carsten Eickhoff,Zhijiang Guo,Seyed Ali Bahrainian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies training LLMs to abstain from answering uncertain temporal questions, combining Chain-of-Thought supervision and Reinforcement Learning to improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often provide misleading answers instead of abstaining when uncertain, especially in temporal QA. The study aims to improve abstention and reasoning skills.

Method: A pipeline integrates Chain-of-Thought supervision with Reinforcement Learning, guided by abstention-aware rewards, to train LLMs.

Result: The RL-trained model outperforms GPT-4o by 3.46% and 5.80% on TimeQA-Easy and Hard, respectively, and improves True Positive rates by 20% over SFT.

Conclusion: RL improves reasoning and abstention but risks overconfidence; implicit cues offer limited benefits. The study lays groundwork for more reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rarely admit uncertainty, often producing fluent but misleading answers, rather than abstaining (i.e., refusing to answer). This weakness is even evident in temporal question answering, where models frequently ignore time-sensitive evidence and conflate facts across different time-periods. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of training LLMs with an abstention ability while reasoning about temporal QA. Existing approaches such as calibration might be unreliable in capturing uncertainty in complex reasoning. We instead frame abstention as a teachable skill and introduce a pipeline that couples Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision with Reinforcement Learning (RL) guided by abstention-aware rewards. Our goal is to systematically analyze how different information types and training techniques affect temporal reasoning with abstention behavior in LLMs. Through extensive experiments studying various methods, we find that RL yields strong empirical gains on reasoning: a model initialized by Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct surpasses GPT-4o by $3.46\%$ and $5.80\%$ in Exact Match on TimeQA-Easy and Hard, respectively. Moreover, it improves the True Positive rate on unanswerable questions by $20\%$ over a pure supervised fine-tuned (SFT) variant. Beyond performance, our analysis shows that SFT induces overconfidence and harms reliability, while RL improves prediction accuracy but exhibits similar risks. Finally, by comparing implicit reasoning cues (e.g., original context, temporal sub-context, knowledge graphs) with explicit CoT supervision, we find that implicit information provides limited benefit for reasoning with abstention. Our study provides new insights into how abstention and reasoning can be jointly optimized, providing a foundation for building more reliable LLMs.

### [153] [Beyond Many-Shot Translation: Scaling In-Context Demonstrations For Low-Resource Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04764)
*Luis Frentzen Salim,Esteban Carlin,Alexandre Morinvil,Xi Ai,Lun-Wei Ku*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores scaling in-context learning (ICL) for low-resource machine translation (MT) using long-context models, testing three corpus types and finding diminishing returns with larger contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for low-resource MT is challenging due to data scarcity. ICL offers potential solutions.

Method: Scaled ICL to 1M tokens, comparing monolingual unsupervised data, instruction-style data, and parallel data for supervision.

Result: Gains from additional context saturate quickly, with performance degrading near maximum context; monolingual data sometimes matched parallel data.

Conclusion: Larger context windows don't guarantee proportional quality improvements; corpus type strongly influences scaling behavior.

Abstract: Building machine translation (MT) systems for low-resource languages is notably difficult due to the scarcity of high-quality data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved MT system performance, adapting them to lesser-represented languages remains challenging. In-context learning (ICL) may offer novel ways to adapt LLMs for low-resource MT by conditioning models on demonstration at inference time. In this study, we explore scaling low-resource machine translation ICL beyond the few-shot setting to thousands of examples with long-context models. We scale in-context token budget to 1M tokens and compare three types of training corpora used as in-context supervision: monolingual unsupervised data, instruction-style data, and parallel data (English--target and Indonesian--target). Our experiments on Javanese and Sundanese show that gains from additional context saturate quickly and can degrade near the maximum context window, with scaling behavior strongly dependent on corpus type. Notably, some forms of monolingual supervision can be competitive with parallel data, despite the latter offering additional supervision. Overall, our results characterize the effective limits and corpus-type sensitivity of long-context ICL for low-resource MT, highlighting that larger context windows do not necessarily yield proportional quality gains.

*Yue Ding,Yiyan Ji,Jungang Li,Xuyang Liu,Xinlong Chen,Junfei Wu,Bozhou Li,Bohan Zeng,Yang Shi,Yushuo Guan,Yuanxing Zhang,Jiaheng Liu,Qiang Liu,Pengfei Wan,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OmniSIFT is a modality-asymmetric token compression framework for Omni-LLMs, addressing computational overhead with a two-stage strategy: video pruning and audio selection, achieving efficiency and performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Omni-LLMs face computational inefficiency due to long multimodal token sequences, yet existing token compression methods are limited.

Method: OmniSIFT uses a two-stage strategy: spatio-temporal video pruning and vision-guided audio selection, optimized end-to-end.

Result: OmniSIFT maintains low latency, outperforms compression baselines, and even surpasses full-token models on some tasks with only 25% of tokens.

Conclusion: OmniSIFT effectively reduces computational overhead while maintaining or improving performance in Omni-LLM tasks.

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (Omni-LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-video understanding tasks. However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks.

*Jiarui Yuan,Tailin Jin,Weize Chen,Zeyuan Liu,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SE-Bench introduces a diagnostic environment to measure agents' ability to internalize new knowledge by obfuscating NumPy into a pseudo-novel package, revealing insights about training methods and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of measuring true self-evolution in lifelong learners due to entangled prior knowledge and reasoning complexity.

Method: SE-Bench obfuscates NumPy into a randomized pseudo-novel package and evaluates agents on simple coding tasks without documentation.

Result: Key findings include the Open-Book Paradox, the RL Gap, and the viability of Self-Play for knowledge internalization.

Conclusion: SE-Bench provides a rigorous platform for diagnosing self-evolution and knowledge internalization.

Abstract: True self-evolution requires agents to act as lifelong learners that internalize novel experiences to solve future problems. However, rigorously measuring this foundational capability is hindered by two obstacles: the entanglement of prior knowledge, where ``new'' knowledge may appear in pre-training data, and the entanglement of reasoning complexity, where failures may stem from problem difficulty rather than an inability to recall learned knowledge. We introduce SE-Bench, a diagnostic environment that obfuscates the NumPy library and its API doc into a pseudo-novel package with randomized identifiers. Agents are trained to internalize this package and evaluated on simple coding tasks without access to documentation, yielding a clean setting where tasks are trivial with the new API doc but impossible for base models without it. Our investigation reveals three insights: (1) the Open-Book Paradox, where training with reference documentation inhibits retention, requiring "Closed-Book Training" to force knowledge compression into weights; (2) the RL Gap, where standard RL fails to internalize new knowledge completely due to PPO clipping and negative gradients; and (3) the viability of Self-Play for internalization, proving models can learn from self-generated, noisy tasks when coupled with SFT, but not RL. Overall, SE-Bench establishes a rigorous diagnostic platform for self-evolution with knowledge internalization. Our code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/thunlp/SE-Bench.

*Dhruv Madhwal,Lyuxin David Zhang,Dan Roth,Tomer Wolfson,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Decomposed prompting improves reliability in closed-book QA by detecting potential errors through disagreement between regimes, outperforming standard uncertainty baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often hallucinate confidently in closed-book QA; this study explores how decomposed prompting affects reliability rather than just accuracy.

Method: Three prompting regimes (Direct, Assistive, Incremental) are evaluated across model scales and multi-hop QA benchmarks to assess disagreement as a signal of uncertainty.

Result: Disagreement between regimes indicates potential errors, enabling a training-free abstention policy that improves error detection metrics like F1 and AUROC.

Conclusion: Decomposition-based prompting effectively probes model reliability in closed-book QA, offering a practical tool for error detection without retrieval or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models often struggle to recognize their knowledge limits in closed-book question answering, leading to confident hallucinations. While decomposed prompting is typically used to improve accuracy, we investigate its impact on reliability. We evaluate three task-equivalent prompting regimes: Direct, Assistive, and Incremental, across different model scales and multi-hop QA benchmarks. We find that although accuracy gains from decomposition diminish in frontier models, disagreements between prompting regimes remain highly indicative of potential errors. Because factual knowledge is stable while hallucinations are stochastic, cross-regime agreement provides a precise signal of internal uncertainty. We leverage this signal to implement a training-free abstention policy that requires no retrieval or fine-tuning. Our results show that disagreement-based abstention outperforms standard uncertainty baselines as an error detector, improving both F1 and AUROC across settings. This demonstrates that decomposition-based prompting can serve as a practical diagnostic probe for model reliability in closed-book QA.

*Zhao Tong,Chunlin Gong,Yiping Zhang,Qiang Liu,Xingcheng Xu,Shu Wu,Haichao Shi,Xiao-Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that refusal responses in LLMs ensure safety by showing that CoT reasoning can still propagate unsafe narratives internally. It introduces a safety-analysis framework to quantify deceptive reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in assessing the safety of LLMs' internal reasoning processes, especially when generating fake news, even when the final output appears safe.

Method: A unified safety-analysis framework deconstructs CoT generation across model layers, evaluates attention heads using Jacobian-based spectral metrics, and introduces three measures (stability, geometry, energy) to quantify deceptive reasoning.

Result: Experiments reveal that reasoning-oriented LLMs exhibit higher generation risks when CoT is active, with critical decisions concentrated in mid-depth layers.

Conclusion: The study disproves the idea that refusal implies safety and offers tools to mitigate latent reasoning risks in LLMs.

Abstract: From generating headlines to fabricating news, the Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically assessed by their final outputs, under the safety assumption that a refusal response signifies safe reasoning throughout the entire process. Challenging this assumption, our study reveals that during fake news generation, even when a model rejects a harmful request, its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may still internally contain and propagate unsafe narratives. To analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a unified safety-analysis framework that systematically deconstructs CoT generation across model layers and evaluates the role of individual attention heads through Jacobian-based spectral metrics. Within this framework, we introduce three interpretable measures: stability, geometry, and energy to quantify how specific attention heads respond or embed deceptive reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning-oriented LLMs show that the generation risk rise significantly when the thinking mode is activated, where the critical routing decisions concentrated in only a few contiguous mid-depth layers. By precisely identifying the attention heads responsible for this divergence, our work challenges the assumption that refusal implies safety and provides a new understanding perspective for mitigating latent reasoning risks.

TL;DR: RAL optimizes attention distributions in MLLMs for better multimodal performance, outperforming baselines and offering cross-modal alignment benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending RL post-training to MLLMs via verbose rationales shows limited gains or performance drops, necessitating a new approach.

Method: RAL uses policy-gradient to optimize internal attention distributions instead of output sequences, focusing on information allocation.

Result: RAL consistently improves performance on image and video benchmarks over GRPO and baselines, with enhanced cross-modal alignment.

Conclusion: Attention policies are a principled alternative for multimodal post-training, offering better grounding and alignment.

Abstract: Post-training with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has substantially improved reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling. However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance.
  We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines. We further introduce On-Policy Attention Distillation, demonstrating that transferring latent attention behaviors yields stronger cross-modal alignment than standard knowledge distillation. Our results position attention policies as a principled and general alternative for multimodal post-training.

### [159] [On the Uncertainty of Large Language Model-Based Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04234)
*Yuxuan Zhao,Sijia Chen,Ningxin Su*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The study explores multi-agent systems (MAS) built on LLMs, focusing on uncertainty dynamics. Surprisingly, single agents often outperform MAS, and early-round interactions heavily influence outcomes. Key findings include the importance of certainty, base model entropy, and task-specific entropy dynamics. An Entropy Judger algorithm improves MAS accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why MAS based on publicly available LLMs succeed or fail, by examining uncertainty dynamics and entropy transitions during problem-solving.

Method: Analyzed 245 entropy features across token-, trajectory-, and round-levels in various topologies and six tasks. Introduced the Entropy Judger algorithm for solution selection.

Result: Single agents outperformed MAS in 43.3% of cases, with early-round interactions dictating uncertainty. Certainty, base model entropy, and task awareness were critical factors. The Entropy Judger improved accuracy consistently.

Conclusion: Uncertainty dynamics are pivotal in MAS performance. The Entropy Judger algorithm effectively leverages entropy insights to enhance MAS accuracy across tasks.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a prominent paradigm for leveraging large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks. However, the mechanisms governing the effectiveness of MAS built upon publicly available LLMs, specifically the underlying rationales for their success or failure, remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we revisit MAS through the perspective of uncertainty, considering both intra- and inter-agent dynamics by investigating entropy transitions during problem-solving across various topologies and six benchmark tasks. By analyzing 245 features spanning token-, trajectory-, and round-level entropy, we counterintuitively find that a single agent outperforms MAS in approximately 43.3% of cases, and that uncertainty dynamics are largely determined during the first round of interaction. Furthermore, we provide three key observations: 1) Certainty Preference: reducing uncertainty at any stage for any agent is critical for guaranteeing correct solutions; 2) Base Uncertainty: base models with lower entropy during problem-solving directly benefit MAS performance; and 3) Task Awareness: entropy dynamics of MAS play varying roles across different tasks. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, the Entropy Judger, to select solutions from MAS's pass@k results, leading to consistent accuracy improvements across all MAS configurations and tasks.

TL;DR: SPEAR is a multi-agent framework for smart contract auditing, using specialized agents for planning, execution, and repair, outperforming centralized and pipeline-based alternatives in coordination and recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance smart contract auditing by leveraging multi-agent coordination and established MAS patterns for realistic security analysis workflows.

Method: SPEAR employs specialized agents: Planning (risk-aware heuristics), Execution (Contract Net protocol for task allocation), and Repair (programmatic-first policy for artifact recovery). Agents use AGM-compliant belief revision, negotiation, and auction protocols for coordination.

Result: Empirical study shows SPEAR outperforms centralized and pipeline-based designs in coordination, recovery, and resource use under failure scenarios.

Conclusion: SPEAR demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-agent coordination in smart contract auditing, improving resilience and efficiency.

Abstract: We present SPEAR, a multi-agent coordination framework for smart contract auditing that applies established MAS patterns in a realistic security analysis workflow. SPEAR models auditing as a coordinated mission carried out by specialized agents: a Planning Agent prioritizes contracts using risk-aware heuristics, an Execution Agent allocates tasks via the Contract Net protocol, and a Repair Agent autonomously recovers from brittle generated artifacts using a programmatic-first repair policy. Agents maintain local beliefs updated through AGM-compliant revision, coordinate via negotiation and auction protocols, and revise plans as new information becomes available. An empirical study compares the multi-agent design with centralized and pipeline-based alternatives under controlled failure scenarios, focusing on coordination, recovery behavior, and resource use.

*Jiaming Zhang,Huanyi Xie,Meng Ding,Shaopeng Fu,Jinyan Liu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes DP-SGD's poor generalization on long-tailed data, attributing it to gradient clipping and noise injection hindering memorization of rare samples, supported by theoretical and empirical evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical understanding of DP-SGD's suboptimal performance on long-tailed data and its privacy-accuracy trade-off.

Method: Develops a theoretical framework analyzing DP-SGD's training dynamics, focusing on gradient clipping and noise injection's impact on memorizing underrepresented samples.

Result: Shows DP-SGD significantly increases test error on long-tailed subpopulations compared to overall dataset performance.

Conclusion: Provides insights into DP-SGD's limitations on long-tailed data and highlights the need for improved privacy-preserving training methods.

Abstract: Recent research shows that modern deep learning models achieve high predictive accuracy partly by memorizing individual training samples. Such memorization raises serious privacy concerns, motivating the widespread adoption of differentially private training algorithms such as DP-SGD. However, a growing body of empirical work shows that DP-SGD often leads to suboptimal generalization performance, particularly on long-tailed data that contain a large number of rare or atypical samples. Despite these observations, a theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains largely unexplored, and existing differential privacy analysis are difficult to extend to the nonconvex and nonsmooth neural networks commonly used in practice. In this work, we develop the first theoretical framework for analyzing DP-SGD on long-tailed data from a feature learning perspective. We show that the test error of DP-SGD-trained models on the long-tailed subpopulation is significantly larger than the overall test error over the entire dataset. Our analysis further characterizes the training dynamics of DP-SGD, demonstrating how gradient clipping and noise injection jointly adversely affect the model's ability to memorize informative but underrepresented samples. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reversible deep learning model using a conditional invertible neural network unifies molecular structure and spectra prediction, demonstrating successful inversion and meaningful structural signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the one-to-many nature of spectrum-to-structure inference by introducing a reversible model that works bidirectionally for molecular structures and spectra.

Method: The model employs i-RevNet style bijective blocks to ensure invertibility, training it to predict binned spectrum codes from graph-based structures while capturing residual variability.

Result: The model is numerically invertible, achieves above-chance spectrum-code prediction, and generates coarse but meaningful structural signals during inversion.

Conclusion: Invertible architectures can effectively unify spectrum prediction and uncertainty-aware candidate generation in a single end-to-end model.

Abstract: We introduce a reversible deep learning model for 13C NMR that uses a single conditional invertible neural network for both directions between molecular structures and spectra. The network is built from i-RevNet style bijective blocks, so the forward map and its inverse are available by construction. We train the model to predict a 128-bit binned spectrum code from a graph-based structure encoding, while the remaining latent dimensions capture residual variability. At inference time, we invert the same trained network to generate structure candidates from a spectrum code, which explicitly represents the one-to-many nature of spectrum-to-structure inference. On a filtered subset, the model is numerically invertible on trained examples, achieves spectrum-code prediction above chance, and produces coarse but meaningful structural signals when inverted on validation spectra. These results demonstrate that invertible architectures can unify spectrum prediction and uncertainty-aware candidate generation within one end-to-end model.

*Kyuseong Choi,Dwaipayan Saha,Woojeong Kim,Anish Agarwal,Raaz Dwivedi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GOPO is a rank-based policy optimization method that improves RLHF performance by focusing on reward rankings rather than magnitudes, outperforming GRPO in tasks with non-verifiable rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLHF methods rely on absolute reward magnitudes, which can be suboptimal for tasks like summarization or chat completion where rewards are non-verifiable.

Method: Introduces Group Ordinal Policy Optimization (GOPO), which transforms rewards to focus solely on rankings, discarding absolute magnitudes.

Result: GOPO achieves higher reward trajectories, better evaluations, and faster convergence than GRPO in tasks with non-verifiable rewards.

Conclusion: GOPO provides a more effective approach for RLHF in settings where reward magnitudes are unreliable, demonstrating consistent improvements.

Abstract: Standard reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) trains a reward model on pairwise preference data and then uses it for policy optimization. However, while reward models are optimized to capture relative preferences, existing policy optimization techniques rely on absolute reward magnitudes during training. In settings where the rewards are non-verifiable such as summarization, instruction following, and chat completion, this misalignment often leads to suboptimal performance. We introduce Group Ordinal Policy Optimization (GOPO), a policy optimization method that uses only the ranking of the rewards and discards their magnitudes. Our rank-based transformation of rewards provides several gains, compared to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), in settings with non-verifiable rewards: (1) consistently higher training/validation reward trajectories, (2) improved LLM-as-judge evaluations across most intermediate training steps, and (3) reaching a policy of comparable quality in substantially less training steps than GRPO. We demonstrate consistent improvements across a range of tasks and model sizes.

TL;DR: NeuroPareto is a novel multi-objective optimization framework combining rank-centric filtering, uncertainty disentanglement, and history-conditioned acquisition to efficiently navigate high-dimensional search spaces with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of optimizing trade-offs in high-dimensional spaces under tight computational constraints.

Method: Integrates Bayesian classifiers for uncertainty estimation, Deep Gaussian Process surrogates for predictive refinement, and a lightweight acquisition network trained online for guidance.

Result: Outperforms baselines in Pareto proximity and hypervolume on DTLZ, ZDT suites, and subsurface energy extraction tasks.

Conclusion: NeuroPareto offers an efficient, accurate solution for multi-objective optimization under computational constraints.

Abstract: The pursuit of optimal trade-offs in high-dimensional search spaces under stringent computational constraints poses a fundamental challenge for contemporary multi-objective optimization. We develop NeuroPareto, a cohesive architecture that integrates rank-centric filtering, uncertainty disentanglement, and history-conditioned acquisition strategies to navigate complex objective landscapes. A calibrated Bayesian classifier estimates epistemic uncertainty across non-domination tiers, enabling rapid generation of high-quality candidates with minimal evaluation cost. Deep Gaussian Process surrogates further separate predictive uncertainty into reducible and irreducible components, providing refined predictive means and risk-aware signals for downstream selection. A lightweight acquisition network, trained online from historical hypervolume improvements, guides expensive evaluations toward regions balancing convergence and diversity. With hierarchical screening and amortized surrogate updates, the method maintains accuracy while keeping computational overhead low. Experiments on DTLZ and ZDT suites and a subsurface energy extraction task show that NeuroPareto consistently outperforms classifier-enhanced and surrogate-assisted baselines in Pareto proximity and hypervolume.

*Weiqi Wang,Zhiyi Tian,Chenhan Zhang,Shui Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoIB, a method for controlling information compression in deep learning without estimating mutual information, using geometric principles for better accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current implementations of the Information Bottleneck (IB) in deep learning rely on imperfect proxies like variational bounds or mutual information estimators, leading to fragile optimization and indirect control. GeoIB aims to address this by leveraging information geometry.

Method: GeoIB replaces mutual information estimation with exact projection forms as minimal KL distances. It uses Fisher-Rao discrepancy and Jacobian-Frobenius terms for compression control and derives a natural-gradient optimizer.

Result: GeoIB achieves a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and compression ratio than mainstream IB baselines, improving invariance and optimization stability.

Conclusion: GeoIB successfully unifies distributional and geometric regularization under a single bottleneck multiplier, offering a more stable and accurate alternative to traditional IB methods.

Abstract: Information Bottleneck (IB) is widely used, but in deep learning, it is usually implemented through tractable surrogates, such as variational bounds or neural mutual information (MI) estimators, rather than directly controlling the MI I(X;Z) itself. The looseness and estimator-dependent bias can make IB "compression" only indirectly controlled and optimization fragile.
  We revisit the IB problem through the lens of information geometry and propose a \textbf{Geo}metric \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{B}ottleneck (\textbf{GeoIB}) that dispenses with mutual information (MI) estimation. We show that I(X;Z) and I(Z;Y) admit exact projection forms as minimal Kullback-Leibler (KL) distances from the joint distributions to their respective independence manifolds. Guided by this view, GeoIB controls information compression with two complementary terms: (i) a distribution-level Fisher-Rao (FR) discrepancy, which matches KL to second order and is reparameterization-invariant; and (ii) a geometry-level Jacobian-Frobenius (JF) term that provides a local capacity-type upper bound on I(Z;X) by penalizing pullback volume expansion of the encoder. We further derive a natural-gradient optimizer consistent with the FR metric and prove that the standard additive natural-gradient step is first-order equivalent to the geodesic update. We conducted extensive experiments and observed that the GeoIB achieves a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and compression ratio in the information plane than the mainstream IB baselines on popular datasets. GeoIB improves invariance and optimization stability by unifying distributional and geometric regularization under a single bottleneck multiplier. The source code of GeoIB is released at "https://anonymous.4open.science/r/G-IB-0569".

*Simon Weissmann,Tilman Aach,Benedikt Wille,Sebastian Kassing,Leif Döring*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the target network update frequency (TUF) in Q-learning, showing how adaptive schedules optimize performance better than constant schedules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The selection of TUF is often treated as a tunable hyperparameter without deep understanding. This work aims to provide a principled analysis of its role in Q-learning.

Method: The study formulates periodic target updates as a nested optimization scheme, using approximate dynamic programming and stochastic gradient descent in the inner loop for analysis.

Result: Theoretical results show adaptive TUF schedules outperform constant ones, avoiding logarithmic sample complexity overhead and requiring geometric increases in update frequency over time.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that adaptive target update schedules are optimal, providing explicit guidelines for setting TUF in Q-learning.

Abstract: The target network update frequency (TUF) is a central stabilization mechanism in (deep) Q-learning. However, their selection remains poorly understood and is often treated merely as another tunable hyperparameter rather than as a principled design decision. This work provides a theoretical analysis of target fixing in tabular Q-learning through the lens of approximate dynamic programming. We formulate periodic target updates as a nested optimization scheme in which each outer iteration applies an inexact Bellman optimality operator, approximated by a generic inner loop optimizer. Rigorous theory yields a finite-time convergence analysis for the asynchronous sampling setting, specializing to stochastic gradient descent in the inner loop. Our results deliver an explicit characterization of the bias-variance trade-off induced by the target update period, showing how to optimally set this critical hyperparameter. We prove that constant target update schedules are suboptimal, incurring a logarithmic overhead in sample complexity that is entirely avoidable with adaptive schedules. Our analysis shows that the optimal target update frequency increases geometrically over the course of the learning process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ESNs are evaluated for univariate time series forecasting using M4 dataset. Automated ESNs perform competitively with ARIMA and TBATS, showing efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess if automated ESNs can rival traditional statistical methods like ARIMA for time series forecasting.

Method: Two-stage evaluation: hyperparameter sweep on Parameter dataset and out-of-sample accuracy test on Forecast dataset. Metrics: MASE and sMAPE.

Result: ESNs match ARIMA/TBATS for monthly data and outperform for quarterly data, with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: ESNs balance accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, making them viable for automated forecasting.

Abstract: This paper investigates the forecasting performance of Echo State Networks (ESNs) for univariate time series forecasting using a subset of the M4 Forecasting Competition dataset. Focusing on monthly and quarterly time series with at most 20 years of historical data, we evaluate whether a fully automatic, purely feedback-driven ESN can serve as a competitive alternative to widely used statistical forecasting methods. The study adopts a rigorous two-stage evaluation approach: a Parameter dataset is used to conduct an extensive hyperparameter sweep covering leakage rate, spectral radius, reservoir size, and information criteria for regularization, resulting in over four million ESN model fits; a disjoint Forecast dataset is then used for out-of-sample accuracy assessment. Forecast accuracy is measured using MASE and sMAPE and benchmarked against simple benchmarks like drift and seasonal naive and statistical models like ARIMA, ETS, and TBATS. The hyperparameter analysis reveals consistent and interpretable patterns, with monthly series favoring moderately persistent reservoirs and quarterly series favoring more contractive dynamics. Across both frequencies, high leakage rates are preferred, while optimal spectral radii and reservoir sizes vary with temporal resolution. In the out-of-sample evaluation, the ESN performs on par with ARIMA and TBATS for monthly data and achieves the lowest mean MASE for quarterly data, while requiring lower computational cost than the more complex statistical models. Overall, the results demonstrate that ESNs offer a compelling balance between predictive accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, positioning them as a practical option for automated time series forecasting.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight framework to reduce computational costs in Super-Structure-based causal discovery by relaxing strict requirements and integrating efficient strategies, achieving comparable accuracy with fewer CI tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high computational cost of constructing accurate Super-Structures in causal discovery, especially when CI tests are expensive and domain knowledge is lacking.

Method: A novel framework using weakly constrained Super-Structures, efficient graph partitioning, and merging strategies to reduce CI test overhead while maintaining accuracy.

Result: Demonstrates comparable accuracy to PC and FCI algorithms with significantly fewer CI tests on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Scalable and accurate causal discovery is feasible with minimal Super-Structure assumptions, expanding its use in large-scale, knowledge-scarce domains.

Abstract: This paper tackles a critical bottleneck in Super-Structure-based divide-and-conquer causal discovery: the high computational cost of constructing accurate Super-Structures--particularly when conditional independence (CI) tests are expensive and domain knowledge is unavailable. We propose a novel, lightweight framework that relaxes the strict requirements on Super-Structure construction while preserving the algorithmic benefits of divide-and-conquer. By integrating weakly constrained Super-Structures with efficient graph partitioning and merging strategies, our approach substantially lowers CI test overhead without sacrificing accuracy. We instantiate the framework in a concrete causal discovery algorithm and rigorously evaluate its components on synthetic data. Comprehensive experiments on Gaussian Bayesian networks, including magic-NIAB, ECOLI70, and magic-IRRI, demonstrate that our method matches or closely approximates the structural accuracy of PC and FCI while drastically reducing the number of CI tests. Further validation on the real-world China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) dataset confirms its practical applicability. Our results establish that accurate, scalable causal discovery is achievable even under minimal assumptions about the initial Super-Structure, opening new avenues for applying divide-and-conquer methods to large-scale, knowledge-scarce domains such as biomedical and social science research.

*Duc Hoang,Ajay Jaiswal,Mohammad Samragh,Minsik Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpecMD is a framework to benchmark MoE caching policies, revealing inconsistencies with traditional locality assumptions. The proposed Least-Stale policy reduces misses by 85× over LRU, achieving high hit rates and performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoE caching policies lack understanding of their interaction with hardware. SpecMD aims to standardize benchmarking and improve cache efficiency.

Method: Develop SpecMD for benchmarking MoE caching policies. Test various strategies, including the novel Least-Stale policy exploiting MoE's predictable access patterns.

Result: Least-Stale reduces collision misses by 85× over LRU, achieving 88% hit rates and 34.7% TTFT reduction with minimal VRAM cache capacity.

Conclusion: SpecMD effectively benchmarks MoE caching, and Least-Stale outperforms traditional policies, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable sparse expert activation, meaning that only a subset of the model's parameters is used during each inference. However, to translate this sparsity into practical performance, an expert caching mechanism is required. Previous works have proposed hardware-centric caching policies, but how these various caching policies interact with each other and different hardware specification remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we develop \textbf{SpecMD}, a standardized framework for benchmarking ad-hoc cache policies on various hardware configurations. Using SpecMD, we perform an exhaustive benchmarking of several MoE caching strategies, reproducing and extending prior approaches in controlled settings with realistic constraints. Our experiments reveal that MoE expert access is not consistent with temporal locality assumptions (e.g LRU, LFU). Motivated by this observation, we propose \textbf{Least-Stale}, a novel eviction policy that exploits MoE's predictable expert access patterns to reduce collision misses by up to $85\times$ over LRU. With such gains, we achieve over $88\%$ hit rates with up to $34.7\%$ Time-to-first-token (TTFT) reduction on OLMoE at only $5\%$ or $0.6GB$ of VRAM cache capacity.

*Michael Aich,Andreas Fürst,Florian Sestak,Carlos Ruiz-Gonzalez,Niklas Boers,Johannes Brandstetter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WIND is a unified foundation model for weather and climate tasks, eliminating the need for task-specific fine-tuning by using self-supervised video reconstruction and inverse problem solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fragmentation in weather and climate modeling by replacing specialized models with a single, versatile foundation model.

Method: Pre-train WIND with a self-supervised video reconstruction objective using an unconditional video diffusion model. Solve tasks via inverse problem solving at inference.

Result: WIND effectively handles tasks like probabilistic forecasting, downscaling, sparse reconstruction, and generating counterfactual weather scenarios without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: WIND provides a computationally efficient, unified approach to atmospheric modeling by combining generative video modeling with inverse problem solving.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized weather and climate modeling, yet the current landscape remains fragmented: highly specialized models are typically trained individually for distinct tasks. To unify this landscape, we introduce WIND, a single pre-trained foundation model capable of replacing specialized baselines across a vast array of tasks. Crucially, in contrast to previous atmospheric foundation models, we achieve this without any task-specific fine-tuning. To learn a robust, task-agnostic prior of the atmosphere, we pre-train WIND with a self-supervised video reconstruction objective, utilizing an unconditional video diffusion model to iteratively reconstruct atmospheric dynamics from a noisy state. At inference, we frame diverse domain-specific problems strictly as inverse problems and solve them via posterior sampling. This unified approach allows us to tackle highly relevant weather and climate problems, including probabilistic forecasting, spatial and temporal downscaling, sparse reconstruction and enforcing conservation laws purely with our pre-trained model. We further demonstrate the model's capacity to generate physically consistent counterfactual storylines of extreme weather events under global warming scenarios. By combining generative video modeling with inverse problem solving, WIND offers a computationally efficient paradigm shift in AI-based atmospheric modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AURA is a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning system for fast, compliant affordable housing site selection, outperforming baselines in regulatory compliance and multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the slow and complex process of affordable housing site selection due to land scarcity and regulatory constraints.

Method: Uses hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning, regulatory-aware state encoding, Pareto-constrained policy gradients, and reward decomposition.

Result: Achieves 94.3% regulatory compliance, 37.2% better Pareto hypervolume, reduces selection time drastically, and identifies more viable sites with better outcomes.

Conclusion: AURA significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of affordable housing site selection under strict constraints.

Abstract: Affordable housing shortages affect billions, while land scarcity and regulations make site selection slow. We present AURA (Autonomous Urban Resource Allocator), a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning system for real-time affordable housing site selection under hard regulatory constraints (QCT, DDA, LIHTC). We model the task as a constrained multi-objective Markov decision process optimizing accessibility, environmental impact, construction cost, and social equity while enforcing feasibility. AURA uses a regulatory-aware state encoding 127 federal and local constraints, Pareto-constrained policy gradients with feasibility guarantees, and reward decomposition separating immediate costs from long-term social outcomes. On datasets from 8 U.S. metros (47,392 candidate parcels), AURA attains 94.3% regulatory compliance and improves Pareto hypervolume by 37.2% over strong baselines. In a New York City 2026 case study, it reduces selection time from 18 months to 72 hours and identifies 23% more viable sites; chosen sites have 31% better transit access and 19% lower environmental impact than expert picks.

*Tamara Cucumides,Floris Geerts*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques row-wise predictors in tabular learning for failing to capture dependencies between rows and introduces grables, a modular interface for structured prediction, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Row-wise predictors are limited in handling transactional, temporal, and relational tables where labels depend on inter-row relationships.

Method: Introduces grables, separating table-to-graph lifting (constructor) from prediction (node predictor) to clarify expressive power.

Result: Experiments confirm message passing captures inter-row dependencies better than row-local models, and hybrid approaches yield gains.

Conclusion: Structured prediction via grables improves performance by addressing inter-row dependencies overlooked by row-wise methods.

Abstract: Tabular learning is still dominated by row-wise predictors that score each row independently, which fits i.i.d. benchmarks but fails on transactional, temporal, and relational tables where labels depend on other rows. We show that row-wise prediction rules out natural targets driven by global counts, overlaps, and relational patterns. To make "using structure" precise across architectures, we introduce grables: a modular interface that separates how a table is lifted to a graph (constructor) from how predictions are computed on that graph (node predictor), pinpointing where expressive power comes from. Experiments on synthetic tasks, transaction data, and a RelBench clinical-trials dataset confirm the predicted separations: message passing captures inter-row dependencies that row-local models miss, and hybrid approaches that explicitly extract inter-row structure and feed it to strong tabular learners yield consistent gains.

### [173] [Representation Geometry as a Diagnostic for Out-of-Distribution Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03951)
*Ali Zia,Farid Hazratian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a geometry-based diagnostic framework to assess model robustness under distribution shift by analyzing embedding structure, using spectral complexity and local curvature as predictors of out-of-distribution performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for monitoring model robustness under distribution shift rely on labeled target-domain data or low-order representation statistics, which may not fully capture the geometric structure of embeddings. This work aims to fill this gap by exploring geometric invariants as post-hoc signals of robustness.

Method: The authors introduce a framework that constructs class-conditional mutual k-nearest-neighbor graphs from in-distribution embeddings. They extract two geometric invariants: a global spectral complexity proxy (reduced log-determinant of the normalized Laplacian) and a local smoothness measure (Ollivier-Ricci curvature). These measures are evaluated across architectures, training regimes, and corruption benchmarks.

Result: Lower spectral complexity and higher mean curvature consistently predict stronger out-of-distribution accuracy across checkpoints. Controlled perturbations and topological analyses confirm that these signals reflect meaningful representation structure rather than superficial statistics.

Conclusion: The proposed geometry-based diagnostic framework provides interpretable, label-free robustness assessment and supports reliable unsupervised checkpoint selection under distribution shift. Representation geometry emerges as a powerful tool for understanding and predicting model robustness.

Abstract: Robust generalization under distribution shift remains difficult to monitor and optimize in the absence of target-domain labels, as models with similar in-distribution accuracy can exhibit markedly different out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. While prior work has focused on training-time regularization and low-order representation statistics, little is known about whether the geometric structure of learned embeddings provides reliable post-hoc signals of robustness. We propose a geometry-based diagnostic framework that constructs class-conditional mutual k-nearest-neighbor graphs from in-distribution embeddings and extracts two complementary invariants: a global spectral complexity proxy based on the reduced log-determinant of the normalized Laplacian, and a local smoothness measure based on Ollivier--Ricci curvature. Across multiple architectures, training regimes, and corruption benchmarks, we find that lower spectral complexity and higher mean curvature consistently predict stronger OOD accuracy across checkpoints. Controlled perturbations and topological analyses further show that these signals reflect meaningful representation structure rather than superficial embedding statistics. Our results demonstrate that representation geometry enables interpretable, label-free robustness diagnosis and supports reliable unsupervised checkpoint selection under distribution shift.

*Md Muhtasim Munif Fahim,Md Rezaul Karim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning models for child mortality prediction suffer from look-ahead bias. Using Bangladesh DHS data (2011-2022), a single-layer neural network outperformed XGBoost (AUROC 0.76 vs. 0.73). The model showed fairness issues, performing better in poorer regions, identifying more at-risk children annually.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inaccuracies in predictive models for child mortality due to look-ahead bias and improve fairness and performance.

Method: Used DHS data (n=33,962) from Bangladesh (2011-2022), trained on 2011-2014 data, validated on 2017 data, tested on 2022 data. Applied genetic algorithm-based Neural Architecture Search.

Result: Single-layer neural network (64 units) outperformed XGBoost (AUROC 0.76 vs. 0.73; p<0.01). Identified Socioeconomic Predictive Gradient (r=-0.62). Detected 1300 more at-risk children annually.

Conclusion: The model provides a robust tool for targeting maternal and child health interventions, especially in poorer regions.

Abstract: The predictive machine learning models for child mortality tend to be inaccurate when applied to future populations, since they suffer from look-ahead bias due to the randomization used in cross-validation. The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from Bangladesh for 2011-2022, with n = 33,962, are used in this paper. We trained the model on (2011-2014) data, validated it on 2017 data, and tested it on 2022 data. Eight years after the initial test of the model, a genetic algorithm-based Neural Architecture Search found a single-layer neural architecture (with 64 units) to be superior to XGBoost (AUROC = 0.76 vs. 0.73; p < 0.01). Additionally, through a detailed fairness audit, we identified an overall "Socioeconomic Predictive Gradient," with a positive correlation between regional poverty level (r = -0.62) and the algorithm's AUC. In addition, we found that the model performed at its highest levels in the least affluent divisions (AUC 0.74) and decreased dramatically in the wealthiest divisions (AUC 0.66). These findings suggest that the model is identifying areas with the greatest need for intervention. Our model would identify approximately 1300 additional at-risk children annually than a Gradient Boosting model when screened at the 10% level and validated using SHAP values and Platt Calibration, and therefore provide a robust, production-ready computational phenotype for targeted maternal and child health interventions.

*Thomas Uriot,Elise Chung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new non-linear PCA framework combines PCA's interpretability with neural networks' flexibility, outperforming PCA and kPCA in explained variance while handling categorical data efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCA's linearity limits its ability to capture complex data structures, and kPCA lacks interpretability and struggles with hyperparameters. This paper bridges these gaps.

Method: The method uses neural networks for variable transformations, optimized via Evolution Strategies, and introduces a granular objective function maximizing individual variance contributions.

Result: The approach outperforms PCA and kPCA in explained variance across datasets and maintains interpretability with tools like biplots.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully unifies interpretability and flexibility, offering a robust alternative to existing PCA variants.

Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful and popular dimensionality reduction technique. However, due to its linear nature, it often fails to capture the complex underlying structure of real-world data. While Kernel PCA (kPCA) addresses non-linearity, it sacrifices interpretability and struggles with hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose a robust non-linear PCA framework that unifies the interpretability of PCA with the flexibility of neural networks. Our method parametrizes variable transformations via neural networks, optimized using Evolution Strategies (ES) to handle the non-differentiability of eigendecomposition. We introduce a novel, granular objective function that maximizes the individual variance contribution of each variable providing a stronger learning signal than global variance maximization. This approach natively handles categorical and ordinal variables without the dimensional explosion associated with one-hot encoding. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both linear PCA and kPCA in explained variance across synthetic and real-world datasets. At the same time, it preserves PCA's interpretability, enabling visualization and analysis of feature contributions using standard tools such as biplots. The code can be found on GitHub.

### [176] [DeXposure-FM: A Time-series, Graph Foundation Model for Credit Exposures and Stability on Decentralized Financial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03981)
*Aijie Shu,Wenbin Wu,Gbenga Ibikunle,Fengxiang He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeXposure-FM is a graph foundation model designed to measure and forecast credit exposure in DeFi networks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and enabling macroprudential monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Credit exposure in DeFi is implicit and token-mediated, leading to uncontrolled contagion risks. Current tools lack power to quantify these risks as DeFi integrates with traditional finance.

Method: DeXposure-FM uses a graph-tabular encoder with pre-trained weights and task-specific heads. Trained on 43.7M entries across 4,300+ protocols and 24,300+ tokens, it forecasts protocol-level flows and credit-exposure link dynamics.

Result: DeXposure-FM outperforms existing approaches (e.g., graph foundation models, temporal GNNs) and provides tools for systemic-importance scores and stress testing.

Conclusion: DeXposure-FM successfully quantifies DeFi credit exposure, offering practical tools for monitoring and stress testing, with empirical validation support.

Abstract: Credit exposure in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is often implicit and token-mediated, creating a dense web of inter-protocol dependencies. Thus, a shock to one token may result in significant and uncontrolled contagion effects. As the DeFi ecosystem becomes increasingly linked with traditional financial infrastructure through instruments, such as stablecoins, the risk posed by this dynamic demands more powerful quantification tools. We introduce DeXposure-FM, the first time-series, graph foundation model for measuring and forecasting inter-protocol credit exposure on DeFi networks, to the best of our knowledge. Employing a graph-tabular encoder, with pre-trained weight initialization, and multiple task-specific heads, DeXposure-FM is trained on the DeXposure dataset that has 43.7 million data entries, across 4,300+ protocols on 602 blockchains, covering 24,300+ unique tokens. The training is operationalized for credit-exposure forecasting, predicting the joint dynamics of (1) protocol-level flows, and (2) the topology and weights of credit-exposure links. The DeXposure-FM is empirically validated on two machine learning benchmarks; it consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, including a graph foundation model and temporal graph neural networks. DeXposure-FM further produces financial economics tools that support macroprudential monitoring and scenario-based DeFi stress testing, by enabling protocol-level systemic-importance scores, sector-level spillover and concentration measures via a forecast-then-measure pipeline. Empirical verification fully supports our financial economics tools. The model and code have been publicly available. Model: https://huggingface.co/EVIEHub/DeXposure-FM.

*Nikolaos Bousias,Lars Lindemann,George Pappas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies how group symmetrization of pre-trained models improves conformal prediction by reducing uncertainty regions and proposes a method to test these claims in pedestrian trajectory prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CP uncertainty regions can grow significantly in long horizon missions, making the statistical guarantees uninformative. The study aims to mitigate this issue by incorporating geometric information.

Method: Proposes group-averaging of the pre-trained predictor to distribute non-conformity mass across orbits, treating each sample as a representative of an orbit to reduce uncertainty.

Result: The approach provably yields contracted non-conformity scores, leading to improved exponential-tail bounds and sharper conformal prediction sets, especially at high confidence levels.

Conclusion: The theoretical claims are supported by proposing an experimental design for testing in pedestrian trajectory prediction, suggesting practical applicability.

Abstract: We study the effect of group symmetrization of pre-trained models on conformal prediction (CP), a post-hoc, distribution-free, finite-sample method of uncertainty quantification that offers formal coverage guarantees under the assumption of data exchangeability. Unfortunately, CP uncertainty regions can grow significantly in long horizon missions, rendering the statistical guarantees uninformative. To that end, we propose infusing CP with geometric information via group-averaging of the pretrained predictor to distribute the non-conformity mass across the orbits. Each sample now is treated as a representative of an orbit, thus uncertainty can be mitigated by other samples entangled to it via the orbit inducing elements of the symmetry group. Our approach provably yields contracted non-conformity scores in increasing convex order, implying improved exponential-tail bounds and sharper conformal prediction sets in expectation, especially at high confidence levels. We then propose an experimental design to test these theoretical claims in pedestrian trajectory prediction.

*Anish Sathyanarayanan,Aditya Nagarsekar,Aarush Rathore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study challenges the assumption that Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves model transparency by showing that surface-level compliance doesn't ensure causal reliance. It introduces a diagnostic framework to audit unfaithful reasoning, revealing frequent bypass of CoT content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to validate whether CoT prompting genuinely exposes a model's reasoning process and enhances transparency, given concerns about surface-level compliance without causal reliance.

Method: The authors developed a diagnostic framework combining (i) a behavioral module scoring manipulation signals in CoT text and (ii) a causal probe measuring CoT-mediated influence (CMI) via hidden-state patching.

Result: Results showed task-dependent mediation: many QA items had near-total bypass (CMI ≈ 0), while some logic problems showed stronger mediation (CMI up to 0.56). Layer-wise analysis revealed narrow reasoning windows.

Conclusion: The conclusion is negative: CoT prompting often fails to ensure causal reliance on reasoning, with answers frequently produced independently of the rationale.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is widely assumed to expose a model's reasoning process and improve transparency. We attempted to enforce this assumption by penalizing unfaithful reasoning, but found that surface-level compliance does not guarantee causal reliance. Our central finding is negative: even when CoT is verbose, strategic, and flagged by surface-level manipulation detectors, model answers are often causally independent of the CoT content. We present a diagnostic framework for auditing this failure mode: it combines (i) an interpretable behavioral module that scores manipulation-relevant signals in CoT text and (ii) a causal probe that measures CoT-mediated influence (CMI) via hidden-state patching and reports a bypass score ($1-\mathrm{CMI}$), quantifying the degree to which the answer is produced by a bypass circuit independent of the rationale. In pilot evaluations, audit-aware prompting increases detectable manipulation signals (mean risk-score delta: $+5.10$), yet causal probes reveal task-dependent mediation: many QA items exhibit near-total bypass (CMI $\approx 0$), while some logic problems show stronger mediation (CMI up to $0.56$). Layer-wise analysis reveals narrow and task-dependent ``reasoning windows'' even when mean CMI is low.

*Jusheng Zhang,Ningyuan Liu,Qinhan Lyu,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAN (Rational-ANOVA Network) introduces a stable, interpretable deep learning architecture using rational approximation and ANOVA decomposition, outperforming traditional MLPs and additive models like KANs in efficiency and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often use fixed nonlinearities (e.g., ReLU), limiting interpretability and control over function classes. Existing spline-based additive models (e.g., KANs) face computational inefficiency and boundary instability.

Method: RAN decomposes functions into main effects and sparse pairwise interactions, parameterizing each with stable rational units (strictly positive denominator). This combines ANOVA structure for interpretability and Padé-style approximation for efficiency.

Result: RAN matches or exceeds performance of MLPs and learnable-activation baselines on benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR-10) with better stability, throughput, and extrapolation.

Conclusion: RAN offers a robust, interpretable alternative to traditional networks, leveraging rational approximation and ANOVA decomposition for improved efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Deep neural networks typically treat nonlinearities as fixed primitives (e.g., ReLU), limiting both interpretability and the granularity of control over the induced function class. While recent additive models (like KANs) attempt to address this using splines, they often suffer from computational inefficiency and boundary instability. We propose the Rational-ANOVA Network (RAN), a foundational architecture grounded in functional ANOVA decomposition and Padé-style rational approximation. RAN models f(x) as a composition of main effects and sparse pairwise interactions, where each component is parameterized by a stable, learnable rational unit. Crucially, we enforce a strictly positive denominator, which avoids poles and numerical instability while capturing sharp transitions and near-singular behaviors more efficiently than polynomial bases. This ANOVA structure provides an explicit low-order interaction bias for data efficiency and interpretability, while the rational parameterization significantly improves extrapolation. Across controlled function benchmarks and vision classification tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10) under matched parameter and compute budgets, RAN matches or surpasses parameter-matched MLPs and learnable-activation baselines, with better stability and throughput.

*Mehdi Lotfian,Mohammad Jalali,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PromptSplit is a kernel-based framework for identifying prompt-dependent disagreements between generative AI models by analyzing joint prompt-output representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of principled methods for understanding how different prompts lead to distinct behaviors in generative models.

Method: PromptSplit constructs tensor-product embeddings of prompts and outputs, computes kernel covariance matrices, and analyzes their eigenspace to detect behavioral differences.

Result: Experiments show PromptSplit effectively identifies ground-truth behavioral differences and isolates responsible prompts.

Conclusion: PromptSplit provides an interpretable and scalable tool for analyzing disagreements between generative models.

Abstract: Prompt-guided generative AI models have rapidly expanded across vision and language domains, producing realistic and diverse outputs from textual inputs. The growing variety of such models, trained with different data and architectures, calls for principled methods to identify which types of prompts lead to distinct model behaviors. In this work, we propose PromptSplit, a kernel-based framework for detecting and analyzing prompt-dependent disagreement between generative models. For each compared model pair, PromptSplit constructs a joint prompt--output representation by forming tensor-product embeddings of the prompt and image (or text) features, and then computes the corresponding kernel covariance matrix. We utilize the eigenspace of the weighted difference between these matrices to identify the main directions of behavioral difference across prompts. To ensure scalability, we employ a random-projection approximation that reduces computational complexity to $O(nr^2 + r^3)$ for projection dimension $r$. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that this approximation yields an eigenstructure estimate whose expected deviation from the full-dimensional result is bounded by $O(1/r^2)$. Experiments across text-to-image, text-to-text, and image-captioning settings demonstrate that PromptSplit accurately detects ground-truth behavioral differences and isolates the prompts responsible, offering an interpretable tool for detecting where generative models disagree.

*Yichen Xu,Yuyang Liang,Shan Dai,Tianyang Hu,Tsz Nam Chan,Chenhao Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified view of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) focusing on layer selection, using metrics like projected residual norm, activation energy, and layer coupling to optimize adaptation. A Layer Card diagnostic tool helps balance performance and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and inefficiency of uniform PEFT across all layers in large language models (LLMs) by developing a systematic approach for layerwise adaptation.

Method: Proposes a unified projected residual framework for PEFT, analyzing layerwise adaptation via projected residual norm, activation energy, and layer coupling. Introduces the Layer Card tool for layer selection.

Result: Selective adaptation based on Layer Card metrics achieves performance close to full-layer LoRA while reducing fine-tuning cost and inference overhead.

Conclusion: Layerwise PEFT guided by Layer Card offers a cost-performance-efficient alternative to uniform adaptation, improving scalability and deployment flexibility.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow, the cost of full-parameter fine-tuning has made parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) the default strategy for downstream adaptation. Constraints from inference latency in scalable serving and fine-tuning cost in edge or rapid-deployment settings make the choice of which layers to fine-tune unavoidable. Yet current practice typically applies PEFT uniformly across all layers, with limited understanding or leverage of layer selection. This paper develops a unified projected residual view of PEFT on top of a frozen base model. Under a local quadratic approximation, layerwise adaptation is governed by three quantities: (i) the projected residual norm (resnorm), which measures how much correctable bias a layer can capture; (ii) the activation energy, which determines feature conditioning; and (iii) layer coupling, which quantifies how strongly residuals interact across layers. We show that, for squared loss and linear adapters, the resnorm equals a normalized gradient norm, activation energy controls ill-conditioning and noise amplification, and weak coupling yields approximately additive layerwise contributions. Building on these insights, we introduce the Layer Card, a reusable diagnostic that summarizes residual signal strength, compute cost, and performance for each layer of a given model. With an identical model and LoRA configuration, Layer Card-guided placement refines the choice of adapted layers to flexibly prioritize different objectives, such as maximizing performance or reducing fine-tuning cost. Moreover, on Qwen3-8B, we show that selectively adapting a subset of layers can achieve performance close to full-layer LoRA while substantially reducing fine-tuning cost and the number of adapter-augmented layers during inference, offering a more cost-performance-aware alternative to full-layer insertion.

TL;DR: GROOVE is a semi-supervised multi-modal representation learning method for weakly-paired perturbation data, using GroupCLIP for contrastive learning and outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in contrastive learning for weakly-paired multi-modal data, where samples lack direct correspondence but share perturbation labels.

Method: Introduces GroupCLIP, a group-level contrastive loss, integrated with an autoencoder framework for entangled representations. Also includes a combinatorial evaluation framework.

Result: GROOVE matches or outperforms existing methods in cross-modal matching and imputation tasks, with GroupCLIP identified as key to performance gains.

Conclusion: Group-level constraints are crucial for effective multi-modal representation learning in weakly-paired scenarios.

Abstract: We present GROOVE, a semi-supervised multi-modal representation learning approach for high-content perturbation data where samples across modalities are weakly paired through shared perturbation labels but lack direct correspondence. Our primary contribution is GroupCLIP, a novel group-level contrastive loss that bridges the gap between CLIP for paired cross-modal data and SupCon for uni-modal supervised contrastive learning, addressing a fundamental gap in contrastive learning for weakly-paired settings. We integrate GroupCLIP with an on-the-fly backtranslating autoencoder framework to encourage cross-modally entangled representations while maintaining group-level coherence within a shared latent space. Critically, we introduce a comprehensive combinatorial evaluation framework that systematically assesses representation learners across multiple optimal transport aligners, addressing key limitations in existing evaluation strategies. This framework includes novel simulations that systematically vary shared versus modality-specific perturbation effects enabling principled assessment of method robustness. Our combinatorial benchmarking reveals that there is not yet an aligner that uniformly dominates across settings or modality pairs. Across simulations and two real single-cell genetic perturbation datasets, GROOVE performs on par with or outperforms existing approaches for downstream cross-modal matching and imputation tasks. Our ablation studies demonstrate that GroupCLIP is the key component driving performance gains. These results highlight the importance of leveraging group-level constraints for effective multi-modal representation learning in scenarios where only weak pairing is available.

*Pratyush Uppuluri,Shilpa Noushad,Sajan Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Bayesian framework detects malicious behavior in enterprise directories by modeling users and directories in an interaction graph, using opinion dynamics and anomaly scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting malicious user behavior in enterprise directories is challenging due to complex interactions and evolving access patterns.

Method: Uses a consensus-based Bayesian framework, modeling directories as topics and users as agents in an interaction graph. Logical dependencies and directory similarity are captured via dynamic matrices. Malicious behavior is detected through opinion dynamics and anomaly variance.

Result: Simulations show sensitivity to logical inconsistencies and robustness under dynamic perturbations.

Conclusion: The framework effectively detects malicious behavior in enterprise directories, offering theoretical guarantees and practical validation.

Abstract: This work presents a consensus-based Bayesian framework to detect malicious user behavior in enterprise directory access graphs. By modeling directories as topics and users as agents within a multi-level interaction graph, we simulate access evolution using influence-weighted opinion dynamics. Logical dependencies between users are encoded in dynamic matrices Ci, and directory similarity is captured via a shared influence matrix W. Malicious behavior is injected as cross-component logical perturbations that violate structural norms of strongly connected components(SCCs). We apply theoretical guarantees from opinion dynamics literature to determine topic convergence and detect anomaly via scaled opinion variance. To quantify uncertainty, we introduce a Bayesian anomaly scoring mechanism that evolves over time, using both static and online priors. Simulations over synthetic access graphs validate our method, demonstrating its sensitivity to logical inconsistencies and robustness under dynamic perturbation.

*Aditya Gorla,Ratish Puduppully*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study re-evaluates Tabula-8B's generalization claims, revealing performance largely stems from evaluation artifacts, contamination, and task familiarity rather than true tabular reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess whether Tabular Language Models (TLMs) like Tabula-8B genuinely achieve emergent generalization for tabular prediction.

Method: The study uses 165 datasets from the UniPredict benchmark, analyzing performance across binary, categorical, and quartile classifications, and checks for dataset contamination.

Result: Performance is driven by quartile tasks, contamination inflates results, and instruction-tuning without tabular exposure recovers most performance.

Conclusion: TLMs' claimed generalization likely reflects evaluation artifacts, not learned reasoning; stricter evaluation protocols are recommended.

Abstract: Tabular Language Models (TLMs) have been claimed to achieve emergent generalization for tabular prediction. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of Tabula-8B as a representative TLM, utilizing 165 datasets from the UniPredict benchmark. Our investigation reveals three findings. First, binary and categorical classification achieve near-zero median lift over majority-class baselines and strong aggregate performance is driven entirely by quartile classification tasks. Second, top-performing datasets exhibit pervasive contamination, including complete train-test overlap and task-level leakage that evades standard deduplication. Third, instruction-tuning without tabular exposure recovers 92.2% of standard classification performance and on quartile classification, format familiarity closes 71.3% of the gap with the residual attributable to contaminated datasets. These findings suggest claimed generalization likely reflects evaluation artifacts rather than learned tabular reasoning. We conclude with recommendations for strengthening TLM evaluation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses domain adaptation challenges in learning-based control by introducing DADP, which disentangles domain representations using lagged contexts and integrates them into a diffusion policy for robust zero-shot adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in generalizing policies across unseen transition dynamics, where existing methods entangle static and dynamic properties, limiting adaptation.

Method: DADP uses Lagged Context Dynamical Prediction to disentangle domain representations and integrates them via domain-aware diffusion injection.

Result: Experiments show DADP outperforms prior methods in locomotion and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: DADP effectively disentangles domain representations and enhances zero-shot adaptation through innovative diffusion-based policy learning.

Abstract: Learning domain adaptive policies that can generalize to unseen transition dynamics, remains a fundamental challenge in learning-based control. Substantial progress has been made through domain representation learning to capture domain-specific information, thus enabling domain-aware decision making. We analyze the process of learning domain representations through dynamical prediction and find that selecting contexts adjacent to the current step causes the learned representations to entangle static domain information with varying dynamical properties. Such mixture can confuse the conditioned policy, thereby constraining zero-shot adaptation. To tackle the challenge, we propose DADP (Domain Adaptive Diffusion Policy), which achieves robust adaptation through unsupervised disentanglement and domain-aware diffusion injection. First, we introduce Lagged Context Dynamical Prediction, a strategy that conditions future state estimation on a historical offset context; by increasing this temporal gap, we unsupervisedly disentangle static domain representations by filtering out transient properties. Second, we integrate the learned domain representations directly into the generative process by biasing the prior distribution and reformulating the diffusion target. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks across locomotion and manipulation demonstrate the superior performance, and the generalizability of DADP over prior methods. More visualization results are available on the https://outsider86.github.io/DomainAdaptiveDiffusionPolicy/.

### [186] [Partition Trees: Conditional Density Estimation over General Outcome Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04042)
*Felipe Angelim,Alessandro Leite*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Partition Trees offer a tree-based framework for conditional density estimation across general outcome spaces, unifying continuous and categorical variables. It minimizes conditional negative log-likelihood for scalable, nonparametric learning, with an ensemble variant, Partition Forests, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing probabilistic trees often rely on parametric assumptions. The authors aim to provide a scalable, nonparametric alternative for conditional density estimation that handles diverse outcome spaces without such constraints.

Method: Proposes Partition Trees, which model conditional distributions as piecewise-constant densities on data-adaptive partitions, learned by minimizing conditional negative log-likelihood. Extends this to Partition Forests via ensemble averaging.

Result: Empirical results show improved probabilistic prediction over CART-style trees and competitive/superior performance against state-of-the-art probabilistic tree methods and Random Forests. Demonstrates robustness to redundant features and heteroscedastic noise.

Conclusion: Partition Trees and Forests provide a flexible, scalable framework for conditional density estimation, outperforming existing methods while avoiding parametric assumptions.

Abstract: We propose Partition Trees, a tree-based framework for conditional density estimation over general outcome spaces, supporting both continuous and categorical variables within a unified formulation. Our approach models conditional distributions as piecewise-constant densities on data adaptive partitions and learns trees by directly minimizing conditional negative log-likelihood. This yields a scalable, nonparametric alternative to existing probabilistic trees that does not make parametric assumptions about the target distribution. We further introduce Partition Forests, an ensemble extension obtained by averaging conditional densities. Empirically, we demonstrate improved probabilistic prediction over CART-style trees and competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic tree methods and Random Forests, along with robustness to redundant features and heteroscedastic noise.

*Huahua Lin,Katayoun Farrahi,Xiaohao Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEIS introduces a new metric to analyze neural representations under geometric transformations, distinguishing equivariance from invariance without needing labels or transformation details. It reveals layer-wise transitions and effects of augmentation/multi-task learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack insight into how geometric information is organized internally and can't differentiate between information loss and re-encoding. SEIS addresses this gap.

Method: SEIS uses subspace metrics to disentangle equivariance and invariance in layer-wise representations, validated synthetically and applied to trained networks.

Result: SEIS shows equivariance-to-invariance transitions in layers, augmentation's impact, multi-task synergy, and skip connections restoring equivariance.

Conclusion: SEIS provides a nuanced understanding of geometric transformations in neural representations, offering insights for model design and analysis.

Abstract: Understanding how neural representations respond to geometric transformations is essential for evaluating whether learned features preserve meaningful spatial structure. Existing approaches primarily assess robustness by comparing model outputs under transformed inputs, offering limited insight into how geometric information is organized within internal representations and failing to distinguish between information loss and re-encoding. In this work, we introduce SEIS (Subspace-based Equivariance and Invariance Scores), a subspace metric for analyzing layer-wise feature representations under geometric transformations, disentangling equivariance from invariance without requiring labels or explicit knowledge of the transformation. Synthetic validation confirms that SEIS correctly recovers known transformations. Applied to trained classification networks, SEIS reveals a transition from equivariance in early layers to invariance in deeper layers, and that data augmentation increases invariance while preserving equivariance. We further show that multi-task learning induces synergistic gains in both properties at the shared encoder, and skip connections restore equivariance lost during decoding.

*Gautam Choudhary,Libin Zhou,Yeasir Rayhan,Walid G. Aref*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates ML-based distance indexes for shortest-path queries in road networks, comparing them with classical methods across training time, query latency, storage, and accuracy. It provides insights and releases an open-source codebase for reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern navigation systems and location-based services require fast and scalable solutions for shortest-path calculations. Classical algorithms are too slow for real-time use, prompting the exploration of ML-based approaches, which lack comprehensive evaluation.

Method: The study benchmarks ten ML techniques against classical baselines using seven real-world road networks and query datasets from trajectory data. Evaluations focus on training time, query latency, storage, and accuracy.

Result: The paper highlights key insights and trade-offs among ML-based techniques, comparing their performance with non-ML methods.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the potential of ML-based distance indexes for efficient query processing, supported by released open-source code for future research.

Abstract: The calculation of shortest-path distances in road networks is a core operation in navigation systems, location-based services, and spatial analytics. Although classical algorithms, e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, provide exact answers, their latency is prohibitive for modern real-time, large-scale deployments. Over the past two decades, numerous distance indexes have been proposed to speed up query processing for shortest distance queries. More recently, with the advancement in machine learning (ML), researchers have designed and proposed ML-based distance indexes to answer approximate shortest path and distance queries efficiently. However, a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these ML-based approaches is lacking. This paper presents the first empirical survey of ML-based distance indexes on road networks, evaluating them along four key dimensions: Training time, query latency, storage, and accuracy. Using seven real-world road networks and workload-driven query datasets derived from trajectory data, we benchmark ten representative ML techniques and compare them against strong classical non-ML baselines, highlighting key insights and practical trade-offs. We release a unified open-source codebase to support reproducibility and future research on learned distance indexes.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Dynamic Survey Framework to keep surveys updated with new research, treating them as living documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional surveys quickly become outdated due to rapid research growth, leading to redundancy and fragmentation.

Method: The Dynamic Survey Framework allows continuous updating of surveys by integrating new work incrementally.

Result: The framework effectively incorporates new research while maintaining survey coherence and structure.

Conclusion: Reframing surveys as living documents improves their longevity and relevance.

Abstract: Survey papers play a central role in synthesizing and organizing scientific knowledge, yet they are increasingly strained by the rapid growth of research output. As new work continues to appear after publication, surveys quickly become outdated, contributing to redundancy and fragmentation in the literature. We reframe survey writing as a long-horizon maintenance problem rather than a one-time generation task, treating surveys as living documents that evolve alongside the research they describe. We propose an agentic Dynamic Survey Framework that supports the continuous updating of existing survey papers by incrementally integrating new work while preserving survey structure and minimizing unnecessary disruption. Using a retrospective experimental setup, we demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively identifies and incorporates emerging research while preserving the coherence and structure of existing surveys.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BLUM, a framework using brain lesion-symptom mapping to evaluate LLM perturbations, showing strong alignment between LLM and human error profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of external validation methods for evaluating LLM components by leveraging established brain-behavior causal relationships.

Method: Developed BLUM, trained symptom-to-lesion models using stroke patient data, applied perturbations to LLM layers, and compared LLM and human error profiles.

Result: LLM error profiles matched human profiles significantly, with 67%-68.3% accuracy in predicting lesion locations, aligning semantic/phonemic errors with specific brain pathways.

Conclusion: BLUM provides a neuroscientifically validated method for LLM interpretability, suggesting potential shared computational principles between humans and artificial systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities, yet methods to verify which model components are truly necessary for language function remain limited. Current interpretability approaches rely on internal metrics and lack external validation. Here we present the Brain-LLM Unified Model (BLUM), a framework that leverages lesion-symptom mapping, the gold standard for establishing causal brain-behavior relationships for over a century, as an external reference structure for evaluating LLM perturbation effects. Using data from individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia (N = 410), we trained symptom-to-lesion models that predict brain damage location from behavioral error profiles, applied systematic perturbations to transformer layers, administered identical clinical assessments to perturbed LLMs and human patients, and projected LLM error profiles into human lesion space. LLM error profiles were sufficiently similar to human error profiles that predicted lesions corresponded to actual lesions in error-matched humans above chance in 67% of picture naming conditions (p < 10^{-23}) and 68.3% of sentence completion conditions (p < 10^{-61}), with semantic-dominant errors mapping onto ventral-stream lesion patterns and phonemic-dominant errors onto dorsal-stream patterns. These findings open a new methodological avenue for LLM interpretability in which clinical neuroscience provides external validation, establishing human lesion-symptom mapping as a reference framework for evaluating artificial language systems and motivating direct investigation of whether behavioral alignment reflects shared computational principles.

*Róisín Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning faces challenges in robustness and generalization. This thesis explores Lipschitz continuity principles in neural networks internally (training dynamics) and externally (frequency signal propagation).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critical challenges in deep learning, such as robustness and generalization, by understanding the underlying principles of Lipschitz continuity.

Method: Examines Lipschitz continuity from two perspectives: internal (training dynamics) and external (modulation of frequency signal propagation).

Result: Advances principled understanding of Lipschitz continuity's role in neural networks.

Conclusion: Exploring Lipschitz continuity provides insights into improving robustness and generalization in neural networks.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of domains, significantly expanding the frontiers of what is achievable in artificial intelligence. Yet, despite these advances, critical challenges remain -- most notably, ensuring robustness to small input perturbations and generalization to out-of-distribution data. These critical challenges underscore the need to understand the underlying fundamental principles that govern robustness and generalization. Among the theoretical tools available, Lipschitz continuity plays a pivotal role in governing the fundamental properties of neural networks related to robustness and generalization. It quantifies the worst-case sensitivity of network's outputs to small input perturbations. While its importance is widely acknowledged, prior research has predominantly focused on empirical regularization approaches based on Lipschitz constraints, leaving the underlying principles less explored. This thesis seeks to advance a principled understanding of the principles of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks within the paradigm of machine learning, examined from two complementary perspectives: an internal perspective -- focusing on the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks during training (i.e., training dynamics); and an external perspective -- investigating how Lipschitz continuity modulates the behavior of neural networks with respect to features in the input data, particularly its role in governing frequency signal propagation (i.e., modulation of frequency signal propagation).

*Yicheng Zou,Samuel Lanthaler,Hossein Salahshoor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Probabilistic neural operators outperform deterministic methods for high-frequency wave phenomena, offering robust predictions and capturing input uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic operators struggle with high-frequency waves due to sensitivity and spectral bias, prompting exploration of probabilistic approaches.

Method: A score-based conditional diffusion operator is developed, with stability analysis and numerical experiments benchmarked against other methods.

Result: The probabilistic neural operator achieves lowest errors in L2, H1, and energy norms and captures input uncertainties.

Conclusion: Probabilistic operator learning is effective for complex PDEs like Helmholtz in high-frequency regimes.

Abstract: Deterministic neural operators perform well on many PDEs but can struggle with the approximation of high-frequency wave phenomena, where strong input-to-output sensitivity makes operator learning challenging, and spectral bias blurs oscillations. We argue for adopting a probabilistic approach for approximating waves in high-frequency regime, and develop our probabilistic framework using a score-based conditional diffusion operator. After demonstrating a stability analysis of the Helmholtz operator, we present our numerical experiments across a wide range of frequencies, benchmarked against other popular data-driven and machine learning approaches for waves. We show that our probabilistic neural operator consistently produces robust predictions with the lowest errors in $L^2$, $H^1$, and energy norms. Moreover, unlike all the other tested deterministic approaches, our framework remarkably captures uncertainties in the input sound speed map propagated to the solution field. We envision that our results position probabilistic operator learning as a principled and effective approach for solving complex PDEs such as Helmholtz in the challenging high-frequency regime.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated Concept-based Models (F-CMs) integrate concept-based interpretability with federated learning, adapting dynamically to evolving concept supervision across institutions while preserving privacy and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of expensive concept annotations and lack of interpretability in federated learning, F-CMs aim to leverage distributed concept data without compromising privacy.

Method: F-CMs aggregate concept-level information across institutions and adapt model architectures dynamically as new concepts or institutions join the federated system.

Result: Empirically, F-CMs maintain accuracy and intervention effectiveness comparable to full-concept supervision settings and outperform non-adaptive federated baselines.

Conclusion: F-CMs offer a scalable, interpretable solution for federated learning, enabling inference on novel concepts while preserving institutional privacy.

Abstract: Concept-based models (CMs) enhance interpretability in deep learning by grounding predictions in human-understandable concepts. However, concept annotations are expensive to obtain and rarely available at scale within a single data source. Federated learning (FL) could alleviate this limitation by enabling cross-institutional training that leverages concept annotations distributed across multiple data owners. Yet, FL lacks interpretable modeling paradigms. Integrating CMs with FL is non-trivial: CMs assume a fixed concept space and a predefined model architecture, whereas real-world FL is heterogeneous and non-stationary, with institutions joining over time and bringing new supervision. In this work, we propose Federated Concept-based Models (F-CMs), a new methodology for deploying CMs in evolving FL settings. F-CMs aggregate concept-level information across institutions and efficiently adapt the model architecture in response to changes in the available concept supervision, while preserving institutional privacy. Empirically, F-CMs preserve the accuracy and intervention effectiveness of training settings with full concept supervision, while outperforming non-adaptive federated baselines. Notably, F-CMs enable interpretable inference on concepts not available to a given institution, a key novelty with respect to existing approaches.

*Kevin Zhai,Sabbir Mollah,Zhenyi Wang,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoRe improves decoding in Masked Diffusion Models by identifying and revising context-brittle tokens through targeted perturbations, enhancing performance on reasoning and code tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing revision strategies in MDMs rely on static confidence scores, which are unreliable due to their myopic nature, leading to cascade effects from early inconsistencies.

Method: CoRe introduces a training-free framework that probes token sensitivity to masked-context perturbations, formalizing revision as a robust optimization objective over context shifts.

Result: CoRe outperforms baselines on LLaDA-8B-Base, achieving up to a 9.2 percentage point improvement on the MBPP benchmark.

Conclusion: CoRe effectively addresses context rigidity in MDMs by dynamically identifying and revising unstable tokens, significantly enhancing model performance.

Abstract: Standard decoding in Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) is hindered by context rigidity: tokens are retained based on transient high confidence, often ignoring that early predictions lack full context. This creates cascade effects where initial inconsistencies misguide the remaining generation. Existing revision strategies attempt to mitigate this by relying on static confidence scores, but these signals are inherently myopic; inconsistent tokens can appear confident to the model itself. We propose Context-Robust Remasking (CoRe), a training-free framework for inference-time revision. Rather than trusting static token probabilities, CoRe identifies context-brittle tokens by probing their sensitivity to targeted masked-context perturbations. We formalize revision as a robust optimization objective over context shifts and efficiently approximate this objective to prioritize unstable tokens for revision. On LLaDA-8B-Base, CoRe delivers consistent improvements across reasoning and code benchmarks, outperforming compute-matched baselines and improving MBPP by up to 9.2 percentage points.

*Letian Cheng,Junyan Wang,Yan Gao,Elliott Wen,Ting Dang,Hong Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LengthBenchmark introduces a framework to evaluate LLMs by integrating input length, protocol design, and system costs, revealing biases in perplexity metrics tied to input length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perplexity, a common metric for LLMs, lacks reliability with varied input lengths, raising fairness and efficiency concerns in benchmarking and deployment.

Method: LengthBenchmark evaluates LLMs using two scoring protocols (direct accumulation and sliding window) across context lengths, measuring latency, memory, and cost alongside accuracy.

Result: Findings show sliding window evaluation inflates performance for short inputs, and models gain accuracy as segment length increases, regardless of precision or quantization.

Conclusion: Length bias affects fair cross-model comparison, emphasizing the need for system-conscious evaluation frameworks like LengthBenchmark.

Abstract: Perplexity is a widely adopted metric for assessing the predictive quality of large language models (LLMs) and often serves as a reference metric for downstream evaluations. However, recent evidence shows that perplexity can be unreliable, especially when irrelevant long inputs are used, raising concerns for both benchmarking and system deployment. While prior efforts have employed selective input filtering and curated datasets, the impact of input length on perplexity has not been systematically studied from a systems perspective and input length has rarely been treated as a first-class system variable affecting both fairness and efficiency. In this work, we close this gap by introducing LengthBenchmark, a system-conscious evaluation framework that explicitly integrates input length, evaluation protocol design, and system-level costs, evaluating representative LLMs under two scoring protocols (direct accumulation and fixed window sliding) across varying context lengths. Unlike prior work that focuses solely on accuracy-oriented metrics, LengthBenchmark additionally measures latency, memory footprint, and evaluation cost, thereby linking predictive metrics to deployment realities. We further incorporate quantized variants not as a main contribution, but as robustness checks, showing that length-induced biases persist across both full-precision and compressed models. This design disentangles the effects of evaluation logic, quantization, and input length, and demonstrates that length bias is a general phenomenon that undermines fair cross-model comparison. Our analysis yields two key observations: (i) sliding window evaluation consistently inflates performance on short inputs, and (ii) both full-precision and quantized models appear to realise gains as the evaluated segment length grows.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel information-theoretic framework for analyzing generalization in machine learning using lossy compression and finite blocklength analysis, deriving bounds on sample complexity and generalization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a clearer understanding of generalization by framing learning as lossy compression and distinguishing overfitting and inductive bias mismatch.

Method: Applies finite blocklength analysis to relate training data sampling (encoding) and model construction (decoding), deriving explicit bounds.

Result: Lower bounds on sample complexity and generalization error, with distinct terms for overfitting and inductive bias mismatch.

Conclusion: The framework unifies information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, offering a more nuanced understanding of generalization.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel information-theoretic perspective on generalization in machine learning by framing the learning problem within the context of lossy compression and applying finite blocklength analysis. In our approach, the sampling of training data formally corresponds to an encoding process, and the model construction to a decoding process. By leveraging finite blocklength analysis, we derive lower bounds on sample complexity and generalization error for a fixed randomized learning algorithm and its associated optimal sampling strategy. Our bounds explicitly characterize the degree of overfitting of the learning algorithm and the mismatch between its inductive bias and the task as distinct terms. This separation provides a significant advantage over existing frameworks. Additionally, we decompose the overfitting term to show its theoretical connection to existing metrics found in information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, unifying these perspectives under our proposed framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies and characterizes spurious solutions in semi-dual neural optimal transport for low-dimensional manifold data, proposes additive-noise smoothing as a solution, and derives a computable terminal noise level for optimal statistical rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address incorrect or degenerate transport maps in semi-dual neural optimal transport when data concentrate on low-dimensional manifolds.

Method: The method involves additive-noise smoothing and theoretical analysis of stability, bias, and finite-sample error, leading to a terminal noise level formula.

Result: The result includes new recovery guarantees, optimal statistical rates governed by intrinsic dimension, and insights into optimization conditioning.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the importance of stopping noise annealing at the derived terminal noise level to avoid worsening optimization without statistical benefit.

Abstract: Semi-dual neural optimal transport learns a transport map via a max-min objective, yet training can converge to incorrect or degenerate maps. We fully characterize these spurious solutions in the common regime where data concentrate on low-dimensional manifold: the objective is underconstrained off the data manifold, while the on-manifold transport signal remains identifiable. Following Choi, Choi, and Kwon (2025), we study additive-noise smoothing as a remedy and prove new map recovery guarantees as the noise vanishes. Our main practical contribution is a computable terminal noise level $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{stat}}(N)$ that attains the optimal statistical rate, with scaling governed by the intrinsic dimension $m$ of the data. The formula arises from a theoretical unified analysis of (i) quantitative stability of optimal plans, (ii) smoothing-induced bias, and (iii) finite-sample error, yielding rates that depend on $m$ rather than the ambient dimension. Finally, we show that the reduced semi-dual objective becomes increasingly ill-conditioned as $\varepsilon \downarrow 0$. This provides a principled stopping rule: annealing below $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{stat}}(N)$ can $\textit{worsen}$ optimization conditioning without improving statistical accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data-driven method to discover dynamical systems with time-varying parameters, improving modeling and forecasting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods assume time-invariant coefficients, limiting their ability to capture evolving dynamics.

Method: Learns time-varying parameters from data, integrates them into equations, and transforms the framework into a forecasting model.

Result: Achieves mean absolute error below 3% for learning and below 6% for forecasting, outperforming CNN-LSTM and GBM.

Conclusion: Incorporating time-varying parameters enhances modeling and forecasting accuracy in dynamical systems.

Abstract: The equations of complex dynamical systems may not be identified by expert knowledge, especially if the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Data-driven discovery methods address this challenge by inferring governing equations from time-series data using a library of functions constructed from the measured variables. However, these methods typically assume time-invariant coefficients, which limits their ability to capture evolving system dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we allow some of the parameters to vary over time, learn their temporal evolution directly from data, and infer a system of equations that incorporates both constant and time-varying parameters. We then transform this framework into a forecasting model by predicting the time-varying parameters and substituting these predictions into the learned equations. The model is validated using datasets for Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, Consumer--Resource, greenhouse gas concentration, and Cyanobacteria cell count. By dynamically adapting to temporal shifts, our proposed model achieved a mean absolute error below 3\% for learning a time series and below 6\% for forecasting up to a month ahead. We additionally compare forecasting performance against CNN-LSTM and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and show that our model outperforms these methods across most datasets. Our findings demonstrate that integrating time-varying parameters into data-driven discovery of differential equations improves both modeling accuracy and forecasting performance.

Motivation: Existing MGFMs lack explicit modality interaction and optimal alignment, limiting their ability to capture cross-modal semantics and bridge modal disparities.

Result: PLANET significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in graph-centric and multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: PLANET advances MGFMs by effectively modeling modality interaction and alignment, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have achieved remarkable success in generalizing across diverse domains. However, they mainly focus on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), leaving Multimodal-Attributed Graphs (MAGs) largely untapped. Developing Multimodal Graph Foundation Models (MGFMs) allows for leveraging the rich multimodal information in MAGs, and extends applicability to broader types of downstream tasks. While recent MGFMs integrate diverse modality information, our empirical investigation reveals two fundamental limitations of existing MGFMs: (1)they fail to explicitly model modality interaction, essential for capturing intricate cross-modal semantics beyond simple aggregation, and (2)they exhibit sub-optimal modality alignment, which is critical for bridging the significant semantic disparity between distinct modal spaces. To address these challenges, we propose PLANET (graPh topoLogy-aware modAlity iNteraction and alignmEnT), a novel framework employing a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to decouple modality interaction and alignment across distinct granularities. At the embedding granularity, (1)Embedding-wise Domain Gating (EDG) performs local semantic enrichment by adaptively infusing topology-aware cross-modal context, achieving modality interaction. At the node granularity, (2)Node-wise Discretization Retrieval (NDR) ensures global modality alignment by constructing a Discretized Semantic Representation Space (DSRS) to bridge modality gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLANET significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse graph-centric and multimodal generative tasks.

*Samaresh Kumar Singh,Joyjit Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Explainability-as-a-Service (XaaS), a distributed architecture that decouples inference from explanation generation in edge and IoT systems to reduce redundant computation and latency while maintaining explanation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI methods are inefficient for edge and IoT systems due to coupled inference and explanation generation, leading to high latency and poor scalability.

Method: The authors introduce XaaS with innovations including a distributed explanation cache, lightweight verification protocol, and adaptive explanation engine.

Result: XaaS reduces latency by 38% while maintaining high explanation quality across three real-world deployments.

Conclusion: XaaS bridges the gap between XAI research and edge-practicality, enabling transparent and accountable AI deployment in heterogeneous IoT systems.

Abstract: Though Explainable AI (XAI) has made significant advancements, its inclusion in edge and IoT systems is typically ad-hoc and inefficient. Most current methods are "coupled" in such a way that they generate explanations simultaneously with model inferences. As a result, these approaches incur redundant computation, high latency and poor scalability when deployed across heterogeneous sets of edge devices. In this work we propose Explainability-as-a-Service (XaaS), a distributed architecture for treating explainability as a first-class system service (as opposed to a model-specific feature). The key innovation in our proposed XaaS architecture is that it decouples inference from explanation generation allowing edge devices to request, cache and verify explanations subject to resource and latency constraints. To achieve this, we introduce three main innovations: (1) A distributed explanation cache with a semantic similarity based explanation retrieval method which significantly reduces redundant computation; (2) A lightweight verification protocol that ensures the fidelity of both cached and newly generated explanations; and (3) An adaptive explanation engine that chooses explanation methods based upon device capability and user requirement. We evaluated the performance of XaaS on three real-world edge-AI use cases: (i) manufacturing quality control; (ii) autonomous vehicle perception; and (iii) healthcare diagnostics. Experimental results show that XaaS reduces latency by 38\% while maintaining high explanation quality across three real-world deployments. Overall, this work enables the deployment of transparent and accountable AI across large scale, heterogeneous IoT systems, and bridges the gap between XAI research and edge-practicality.

*Mehrdad Moghimi,Anthony Coache,Hyejin Ku*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a flexible discounting framework in distributional RL to better capture temporal and risk preferences, addressing overlooked discount factor roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distributional RL approaches often treat the discount factor as fixed, overlooking its impact on policy learning and risk-sensitive objectives.

Method: Proposes a novel framework for flexible discounting and risk measure optimization in distributional RL, with multi-horizon extensions.

Result: The framework resolves issues in existing methods and demonstrates robustness through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Flexible discounting is crucial for expressive temporal and risk preferences in decision-making, especially in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Distributional reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains for its ability to optimize risk-sensitive objectives. However, the role of the discount factor is often overlooked, as it is typically treated as a fixed parameter of the Markov decision process or tunable hyperparameter, with little consideration of its effect on the learned policy. In the literature, it is well-known that the discounting function plays a major role in characterizing time preferences of an agent, which an exponential discount factor cannot fully capture. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework that supports flexible discounting of future rewards and optimization of risk measures in distributional RL. We provide a technical analysis of the optimality of our algorithms, show that our multi-horizon extension fixes issues raised with existing methodologies, and validate the robustness of our methods through extensive experiments. Our results highlight that discounting is a cornerstone in decision-making problems for capturing more expressive temporal and risk preferences profiles, with potential implications for real-world safety-critical applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight probabilistic head called Diffusion Last Layer (DLL) for neural operators to model predictive uncertainty in stochastic systems, improving generalization and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many practical systems are stochastic, requiring uncertainty quantification for reliable deployment of neural operators.

Method: DLL is a probabilistic head attached to neural operator backbones, using a low-rank Karhunen-Loève expansion to model output distributions efficiently.

Result: DLL enhances generalization, uncertainty-aware prediction, and rollout stability in stochastic PDE benchmarks.

Conclusion: DLL is a simple yet effective add-on for neural operators to improve uncertainty modeling and performance in both stochastic and deterministic settings.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning discretization-invariant function-to-function mappings in scientific computing. However, many practical systems are inherently stochastic, making principled uncertainty quantification essential for reliable deployment. To address this, we introduce a simple add-on, the diffusion last layer (DLL), a lightweight probabilistic head that can be attached to arbitrary neural operator backbones to model predictive uncertainty. Motivated by the relative smoothness and low-dimensional structure often exhibited by PDE solution distributions, DLL parameterizes the conditional output distribution directly in function space through a low-rank Karhunen-Loève expansion, enabling efficient and expressive uncertainty modeling. Across stochastic PDE operator learning benchmarks, DLL improves generalization and uncertainty-aware prediction. Moreover, even in deterministic long-horizon rollout settings, DLL enhances rollout stability and provides meaningful estimates of epistemic uncertainty for backbone neural operators.

*Jinyuan Li,Chengsong Huang,Langlin Huang,Shaoyang Xu,Haolin Liu,Wenxuan Zhang,Jiaxin Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Balanced-Information Score (BIS) to improve data efficiency in training Multimodal Process Reward Models (MPRMs), achieving full-data performance with only 10% of training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training MPRMs traditionally requires large-scale Monte Carlo-annotated corpora, which is costly. The study aims to enhance data efficiency by identifying redundant data.

Method: The paper introduces BIS, prioritizing label mixtures and reliability based on existing MC signals, optimizing subset selection without additional costs.

Result: BIS-selected subsets achieve or exceed full-data performance with only 10% of training data, outperforming random subsampling by 4.1%.

Conclusion: BIS effectively reduces training costs while maintaining performance, demonstrating significant potential for efficient MPRM training.

Abstract: Multimodal Process Reward Models (MPRMs) are central to step-level supervision for visual reasoning in MLLMs. Training MPRMs typically requires large-scale Monte Carlo (MC)-annotated corpora, incurring substantial training cost. This paper studies the data efficiency for MPRM training.Our preliminary experiments reveal that MPRM training quickly saturates under random subsampling of the training data, indicating substantial redundancy within existing MC-annotated corpora.To explain this, we formalize a theoretical framework and reveal that informative gradient updates depend on two factors: label mixtures of positive/negative steps and label reliability (average MC scores of positive steps). Guided by these insights, we propose the Balanced-Information Score (BIS), which prioritizes both mixture and reliability based on existing MC signals at the rollout level, without incurring any additional cost. Across two backbones (InternVL2.5-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B) on VisualProcessBench, BIS-selected subsets consistently match and even surpass the full-data performance at small fractions. Notably, the BIS subset reaches full-data performance using only 10% of the training data, improving over random subsampling by a relative 4.1%.

TL;DR: TL-GPSTGN improves graph-based multivariate time series forecasting by pruning non-optimal graph context, enhancing efficiency and generalization under data scarcity and cross-domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing performance degradation in spatiotemporal models due to data scarcity and cross-domain shifts by focusing on structure-aware context selection.

Method: Uses information-theoretic and correlation-based criteria to prune graph context, integrating the optimized results into a spatiotemporal convolutional architecture.

Result: Outperforms baselines in low-data transfer scenarios on traffic benchmarks, demonstrating improved robustness.

Conclusion: Explicit context pruning acts as a strong inductive bias for enhancing graph-based forecasting models' robustness.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting in graph-structured domains is critical for real-world applications, yet existing spatiotemporal models often suffer from performance degradation under data scarcity and cross-domain shifts. We address these challenges through the lens of structure-aware context selection. We propose TL-GPSTGN, a transfer-oriented spatiotemporal framework that enhances sample efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization by selectively pruning non-optimized graph context. Specifically, our method employs information-theoretic and correlation-based criteria to extract structurally informative subgraphs and features, resulting in a compact, semantically grounded representation. This optimized context is subsequently integrated into a spatiotemporal convolutional architecture to capture complex multivariate dynamics. Evaluations on large-scale traffic benchmarks demonstrate that TL-GPSTGN consistently outperforms baselines in low-data transfer scenarios. Our findings suggest that explicit context pruning serves as a powerful inductive bias for improving the robustness of graph-based forecasting models.

*Meiling Jin,Fei Wang,Xiaoyun Yuan,Chen Qian,Yuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TAR improves static sparsity in deep RL by reviving pruned connections once, boosting performance without dynamic rewiring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static sparse training can lead to brittle structures, especially in deep RL where training distributions shift. TAR addresses this by enhancing robustness post-pruning.

Method: TAR revives pruned connections in one step: allocates a reserve budget across layers, randomly reactivates pruned connections, and fixes the structure for training.

Result: TAR improves final return by up to +37.9% over static baselines and surpasses dynamic baselines with a +13.5% median gain.

Conclusion: TAR offers a lightweight, effective solution to enhance static sparsity robustness in deep RL without dynamic rewiring.

Abstract: Static sparse training is a promising route to efficient learning by committing to a fixed mask pattern, yet the constrained structure reduces robustness. Early pruning decisions can lock the network into a brittle structure that is difficult to escape, especially in deep reinforcement learning (RL) where the evolving policy continually shifts the training distribution. We propose Topology-Aware Revival (TAR), a lightweight one-shot post-pruning procedure that improves static sparsity without dynamic rewiring. After static pruning, TAR performs a single revival step by allocating a small reserve budget across layers according to topology needs, randomly uniformly reactivating a few previously pruned connections within each layer, and then keeping the resulting connectivity fixed for the remainder of training. Across multiple continuous-control tasks with SAC and TD3, TAR improves final return over static sparse baselines by up to +37.9% and also outperforms dynamic sparse training baselines with a median gain of +13.5%.

*Xiaoyu Qiu,Taewon Yang,Zhanhao Liu,Guanyang Wang,Liyue Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Plug-and-play diffusion priors (PnPDP) solvers, addressing the gap in current evaluations that ignore distributional characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of PnPDP solvers focus on point-estimate accuracy, neglecting the stochastic nature and intrinsic uncertainty of inverse problems, which are crucial for scientific tasks.

Method: The study designs a toy model simulation to evaluate UQ behavior of PnPDP solvers and proposes a UQ-driven categorization. Experiments are conducted on toy simulations and real-world inverse problems.

Result: The experiments reveal uncertainty behaviors aligning with the proposed taxonomy and theoretical justification, offering new insights into UQ for PnPDPs.

Conclusion: The work provides a systematic approach to benchmark UQ in PnPDP solvers, enhancing understanding and evaluation of uncertainty in inverse problems.

Abstract: Plug-and-play diffusion priors (PnPDP) have become a powerful paradigm for solving inverse problems in scientific and engineering domains. Yet, current evaluations of reconstruction quality emphasize point-estimate accuracy metrics on a single sample, which do not reflect the stochastic nature of PnPDP solvers and the intrinsic uncertainty of inverse problems, critical for scientific tasks. This creates a fundamental mismatch: in inverse problems, the desired output is typically a posterior distribution and most PnPDP solvers induce a distribution over reconstructions, but existing benchmarks only evaluate a single reconstruction, ignoring distributional characterization such as uncertainty. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic study to benchmark the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of existing diffusion inverse solvers. Specifically, we design a rigorous toy model simulation to evaluate the uncertainty behavior of various PnPDP solvers, and propose a UQ-driven categorization. Through extensive experiments on toy simulations and diverse real-world scientific inverse problems, we observe uncertainty behaviors consistent with our taxonomy and theoretical justification, providing new insights for evaluating and understanding the uncertainty for PnPDPs.

*Vivek Anand,Alec Helbling,Mark Davenport,Gordon Berman,Sankar Alagapan,Christopher Rozell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LORE (Low Rank Ordinal Embedding) is a scalable framework that jointly learns intrinsic dimensionality and ordinal embeddings from noisy triplet comparisons, offering interpretable and accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning intrinsic dimensionality from ordinal data in subjective perceptual spaces like taste or aesthetics, where existing methods require predefined embedding dimensions.

Method: LORE uses the nonconvex Schatten-$p$ quasi norm for regularization, enabling automatic recovery of dimensionality and embeddings. It employs an iteratively reweighted algorithm with proven convergence guarantees.

Result: LORE produces compact, interpretable, and accurate low-dimensional embeddings, successfully recovering latent geometry in synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: LORE advances perceptual modeling in psychophysics and machine learning by simultaneously inferring dimensionality and embeddings, enabling more interpretable and data-efficient solutions.

Abstract: Learning the intrinsic dimensionality of subjective perceptual spaces such as taste, smell, or aesthetics from ordinal data is a challenging problem. We introduce LORE (Low Rank Ordinal Embedding), a scalable framework that jointly learns both the intrinsic dimensionality and an ordinal embedding from noisy triplet comparisons of the form, "Is A more similar to B than C?". Unlike existing methods that require the embedding dimension to be set apriori, LORE regularizes the solution using the nonconvex Schatten-$p$ quasi norm, enabling automatic joint recovery of both the ordinal embedding and its dimensionality. We optimize this joint objective via an iteratively reweighted algorithm and establish convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, simulated perceptual spaces, and real world crowdsourced ordinal judgements show that LORE learns compact, interpretable and highly accurate low dimensional embeddings that recover the latent geometry of subjective percepts. By simultaneously inferring both the intrinsic dimensionality and ordinal embeddings, LORE enables more interpretable and data efficient perceptual modeling in psychophysics and opens new directions for scalable discovery of low dimensional structure from ordinal data in machine learning.

*Yanjie Tong,Peng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STRIDE is a two-stage framework using a temporal encoder and implicit neural representation decoder to reconstruct spatiotemporal fields from sparse measurements, outperforming baselines in sparse sensing and robustness to noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in generalizing across trajectories and parameter settings in high-dimensional spatiotemporal field reconstruction, where existing methods struggle with discretization-tied decoders.

Method: STRIDE employs a temporal encoder for latent state mapping and a modulated implicit neural representation decoder (FMMNN backbone) for arbitrary query location reconstruction.

Result: STRIDE excels in sparse sensing, supports super-resolution, and shows robustness to noise across chaotic dynamics and wave propagation benchmarks.

Conclusion: STRIDE's architecture is justified theoretically and practically, proving effective for high-dimensional spatiotemporal field reconstruction.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields from sparse point-sensor measurements is a central challenge in learning parametric PDE dynamics. Existing approaches often struggle to generalize across trajectories and parameter settings, or rely on discretization-tied decoders that do not naturally transfer across meshes and resolutions. We propose STRIDE (Spatio-Temporal Recurrent Implicit DEcoder), a two-stage framework that maps a short window of sensor measurements to a latent state with a temporal encoder and reconstructs the field at arbitrary query locations with a modulated implicit neural representation (INR) decoder. Using the Fourier Multi-Component and Multi-Layer Neural Network (FMMNN) as the INR backbone improves representation of complex spatial fields and yields more stable optimization than sine-based INRs. We provide a conditional theoretical justification: under stable delay observability of point measurements on a low-dimensional parametric invariant set, the reconstruction operator factors through a finite-dimensional embedding, making STRIDE-type architectures natural approximators. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks spanning chaotic dynamics and wave propagation show that STRIDE outperforms strong baselines under extremely sparse sensing, supports super-resolution, and remains robust to noise.

*Mohammadreza Maleki,Rushendra Sidibomma,Arman Adibi,Reza Samavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRV is a cascading robustness verification framework that combines multiple incomplete verifiers to enhance reliability and efficiency in certifying neural network robustness against adversarial examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robustness verification methods often rely on a single verifier, which can underestimate robustness due to loose approximations or misalignment with training methods. CRV addresses these limitations by leveraging multiple verifiers.

Method: CRV progressively applies multiple verifiers, starting with the least expensive, and halts once an input is certified as robust. For expensive methods, it uses a Stepwise Relaxation Algorithm to add constraints incrementally.

Result: CRV achieves equal or higher verified accuracy compared to powerful incomplete verifiers while reducing verification overhead by up to ~90%.

Conclusion: CRV provides a model-agnostic, efficient framework for robustness verification, balancing tightness and computational cost.

Abstract: Certifying neural network robustness against adversarial examples is challenging, as formal guarantees often require solving non-convex problems. Hence, incomplete verifiers are widely used because they scale efficiently and substantially reduce the cost of robustness verification compared to complete methods. However, relying on a single verifier can underestimate robustness because of loose approximations or misalignment with training methods. In this work, we propose Cascading Robustness Verification (CRV), which goes beyond an engineering improvement by exposing fundamental limitations of existing robustness metric and introducing a framework that enhances both reliability and efficiency. CRV is a model-agnostic verifier, meaning that its robustness guarantees are independent of the model's training process. The key insight behind the CRV framework is that, when using multiple verification methods, an input is certifiably robust if at least one method certifies it as robust. Rather than relying solely on a single verifier with a fixed constraint set, CRV progressively applies multiple verifiers to balance the tightness of the bound and computational cost. Starting with the least expensive method, CRV halts as soon as an input is certified as robust; otherwise, it proceeds to more expensive methods. For computationally expensive methods, we introduce a Stepwise Relaxation Algorithm (SR) that incrementally adds constraints and checks for certification at each step, thereby avoiding unnecessary computation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that CRV achieves equal or higher verified accuracy compared to powerful but computationally expensive incomplete verifiers in the cascade, while significantly reducing verification overhead. Empirical results confirm that CRV certifies at least as many inputs as benchmark approaches, while improving runtime efficiency by up to ~90%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a generalizable graph foundation model capable of representing diverse graphs for downstream tasks like classification and clustering.

Method: Multi-graph-based feature alignment, density maximization mean alignment, contrastive learning with GNNs, and a multi-layer reference distribution module without pooling.

Result: Outperforms baselines in few-shot graph classification and clustering.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively generalizes across domains and preserves structural/semantic information, improving performance on graph-level tasks.

Abstract: This paper aims to train a graph foundation model that is able to represent any graph as a vector preserving structural and semantic information useful for downstream graph-level tasks such as graph classification and graph clustering. To learn the features of graphs from diverse domains while maintaining strong generalization ability to new domains, we propose a multi-graph-based feature alignment method, which constructs weighted graphs using the attributes of all nodes in each dataset and then generates consistent node embeddings. To enhance the consistency of the features from different datasets, we propose a density maximization mean alignment algorithm with guaranteed convergence. The original graphs and generated node embeddings are fed into a graph neural network to achieve discriminative graph representations in contrastive learning. More importantly, to enhance the information preservation from node-level representations to the graph-level representation, we construct a multi-layer reference distribution module without using any pooling operation. We also provide a theoretical generalization bound to support the effectiveness of the proposed model. The experimental results of few-shot graph classification and graph clustering show that our model outperforms strong baselines.

TL;DR: The paper addresses label disambiguation and feature selection in partial multi-label learning (PML) by modeling them as POMDPs, improving PML risk minimization through reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in ambiguous candidate labels propagating errors downstream, motivating a joint approach for disambiguation and feature selection.

Method: Stage 1 trains a transformer policy via RL for hard pseudo-labels; Stage 2 uses sequential RL for interpretable feature ranking.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments confirm the framework's effectiveness across multiple metrics and datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed PML-POMDP framework successfully tackles label ambiguity and feature selection, validated by theory and experiments.

Abstract: In partial multi-label learning (PML), the true labels are unobserved, which makes label disambiguation important but difficult. A key challenge is that ambiguous candidate labels can propagate errors into downstream tasks such as feature engineering. To solve this issue, we jointly model the disambiguation and feature selection tasks as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) to turn PML risk minimization into expected-return maximization. Stage 1 trains a transformer policy via reinforcement learning to produce high-quality hard pseudo-labels; Stage 2 describes feature selection as a sequential reinforcement learning problem, selecting features step by step and outputting an interpretable global ranking. We further provide the theoretical analysis of PML-POMDP correspondence and the excess-risk bound that decompose the error into pseudo label quality term and sample size. Experiments in multiple metrics and data sets verify the advantages of the framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep Bernstein Networks use Bernstein polynomials as activation functions to eliminate vanishing gradients and outperform traditional activations without needing residual connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of residual connections and piecewise linear activations, which impose structural constraints and inefficient training.

Method: Utilizing Bernstein polynomials as activation functions to ensure bounded derivatives and exponential decay of approximation error with depth.

Result: Reduction of 'dead' neurons from 90% to less than 5% and superior performance compared to ReLU, Leaky ReLU, SeLU, and GeLU.

Conclusion: Deep Bernstein Networks offer a high-performance, residual-free architecture with enhanced expressive capacity.

Abstract: Residual connections are the de facto standard for mitigating vanishing gradients, yet they impose structural constraints and fail to address the inherent inefficiencies of piecewise linear activations. We show that Deep Bernstein Networks (which utilizes Bernstein polynomials as activation functions) can act as residual-free architecture while simultaneously optimize trainability and representation power. We provide a two-fold theoretical foundation for our approach. First, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the local derivative, proving it remains strictly bounded away from zero. This directly addresses the root cause of gradient stagnation; empirically, our architecture reduces ``dead'' neurons from 90\% in standard deep networks to less than 5\%, outperforming ReLU, Leaky ReLU, SeLU, and GeLU. Second, we establish that the approximation error for Bernstein-based networks decays exponentially with depth, a significant improvement over the polynomial rates of ReLU-based architectures. By unifying these results, we demonstrate that Bernstein activations provide a superior mechanism for function approximation and signal flow. Our experiments on HIGGS and MNIST confirm that Deep Bernstein Networks achieve high-performance training without skip-connections, offering a principled path toward deep, residual-free architectures with enhanced expressive capacity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR enhances LLMs but faces issues like entropy collapse and verbosity. T2T, a dynamic reward framework, introduces dual-phase rewards ('thickening' for exploration, 'thinning' for efficiency), outperforming baselines on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward schemes inadequately balance exploration during problem-solving and efficiency for mastered knowledge, limiting LLM reasoning enhancement.

Method: T2T uses a dual-phase mechanism: 'thickening' rewards longer trajectories for incorrect attempts to explore, and 'thinning' penalizes redundancy post-correctness to refine reasoning.

Result: T2T outperforms GRPO and other baselines significantly on mathematical benchmarks like MATH-500, AIME, and AMC.

Conclusion: T2T effectively balances exploration and efficiency, improving reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it frequently encounters challenges such as entropy collapse, excessive verbosity, and insufficient exploration for hard problems. Crucially, existing reward schemes fail to distinguish between the need for extensive search during problem-solving and the efficiency required for mastered knowledge. In this work, we introduce T2T(Thickening-to-Thinning), a dynamic reward framework inspired by human learning processes. Specifically, it implements a dual-phase mechanism: (1) On incorrect attempts, T2T incentivizes "thickening" (longer trajectories) to broaden the search space and explore novel solution paths; (2) Upon achieving correctness, it shifts to "thinning", imposing length penalties to discourage redundancy, thereby fostering model confidence and crystallizing reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks (MATH-500, AIME, AMC) across Qwen-series and Deepseek models demonstrate that T2T significantly outperforms standard GRPO and recent baselines, achieving superior performance.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Many fields collect large-scale temporal data through repeated measurements (trials), where each trial is labeled with a set of metadata variables spanning several categories. For example, a trial in a neuroscience study may be linked to a value from category (a): task difficulty, and category (b): animal choice. A critical challenge in time-series analysis is to understand how these labels are encoded within the multi-trial observations, and disentangle the distinct effect of each label entry across categories. Here, we present MILCCI, a novel data-driven method that i) identifies the interpretable components underlying the data, ii) captures cross-trial variability, and iii) integrates label information to understand each category's representation within the data. MILCCI extends a sparse per-trial decomposition that leverages label similarities within each category to enable subtle, label-driven cross-trial adjustments in component compositions and to distinguish the contribution of each category. MILCCI also learns each component's corresponding temporal trace, which evolves over time within each trial and varies flexibly across trials. We demonstrate MILCCI's performance through both synthetic and real-world examples, including voting patterns, online page view trends, and neuronal recordings.

Result: Optimized designs show 53% stiffness tunability, 50% durability improvement, and 43% vibration reduction. PSO and Bayesian Optimization proved effective for targeted and multi-objective refinement.

Conclusion: The framework successfully develops high-performance UPTIS spoke structures, offering a systematic approach for future applications.

Abstract: Non Pneumatic tires offer a promising alternative to pneumatic tires. However, their discontinuous spoke structures present challenges in stiffness tuning, durability, and high speed vibration. This study introduces an integrated generative design and machine learning driven framework to optimize UPTIS type spoke geometries for passenger vehicles. Upper and lower spoke profiles were parameterized using high order polynomial representations, enabling the creation of approximately 250 generative designs through PCHIP based geometric variation. Machine learning models like KRR for stiffness and XGBoost for durability and vibration achieved strong predictive accuracy, reducing the reliance on computationally intensive FEM simulations. Optimization using Particle Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization further enabled extensive performance refinement. The resulting designs demonstrate 53% stiffness tunability, up to 50% durability improvement, and 43% reduction in vibration compared to the baseline. PSO provided fast, targeted convergence, while Bayesian Optimization effectively explored multi objective tradeoffs. Overall, the proposed framework enables systematic development of high performance, next generation UPTIS spoke structures.

*Xingzhuo Chen,Anthony Poole,Ionut-Gabriel Farcas,David R. Hatch,Ulisses Braga-Neto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FI-Conv is a U-Net-based framework using ConvNeXt V2 blocks for predicting spatio-temporal dynamics and estimating PDE parameters, tested on turbulent plasma fields governed by HW equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting and modeling complex spatio-temporal dynamics, such as turbulence, with high accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: FI-Conv replaces U-Net convolutional layers with ConvNeXt V2 blocks, uses initial state and PDE parameters as input, and employs autoregressive forecasting and gradient-descent-based inverse estimation.

Result: Accurate short-term prediction (t ~ 3) and long-term statistical property capture (t ~ 100) of plasma state evolution, along with precise PDE parameter inference.

Conclusion: FI-Conv is an effective alternative to physics-informed ML methods for systems with complex dynamics, offering performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We propose the Convolutional Operator Network for Forward and Inverse Problems (FI-Conv), a framework capable of predicting system evolution and estimating parameters in complex spatio-temporal dynamics, such as turbulence. FI-Conv is built on a U-Net architecture, in which most convolutional layers are replaced by ConvNeXt V2 blocks. This design preserves U-Net performance on inputs with high-frequency variations while maintaining low computational complexity. FI-Conv uses an initial state, PDE parameters, and evolution time as input to predict the system future state. As a representative example of a system exhibiting complex dynamics, we evaluate the performance of FI-Conv on the task of predicting turbulent plasma fields governed by the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) equations. The HW system models two-dimensional electrostatic drift-wave turbulence and exhibits strongly nonlinear behavior, making accurate approximation and long-term prediction particularly challenging. Using an autoregressive forecasting procedure, FI-Conv achieves accurate forward prediction of the plasma state evolution over short times (t ~ 3) and captures the statistic properties of derived physical quantities of interest over longer times (t ~ 100). Moreover, we develop a gradient-descent-based inverse estimation method that accurately infers PDE parameters from plasma state evolution data, without modifying the trained model weights. Collectively, our results demonstrate that FI-Conv can be an effective alternative to existing physics-informed machine learning methods for systems with complex spatio-temporal dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end prediction of high-order crystal tensor properties from atomic structures is challenging due to high compute and memory costs of existing spherical-harmonic equivariant models.

Method: CEITNet constructs multi-channel Cartesian local environment tensors for atoms and uses learnable channel-space interactions for flexible many-body mixing, enabling efficient high-order tensor construction.

Result: CEITNet outperforms prior methods on benchmark datasets for predicting order-2 dielectric, order-3 piezoelectric, and order-4 elastic tensors.

Conclusion: CEITNet offers a computationally efficient and accurate solution for high-order tensor property prediction, advancing the field beyond traditional spherical-harmonic approaches.

Abstract: End-to-end prediction of high-order crystal tensor properties from atomic structures remains challenging: while spherical-harmonic equivariant models are expressive, their Clebsch-Gordan tensor products incur substantial compute and memory costs for higher-order targets. We propose the Cartesian Environment Interaction Tensor Network (CEITNet), an approach that constructs a multi-channel Cartesian local environment tensor for each atom and performs flexible many-body mixing via a learnable channel-space interaction. By performing learning in channel space and using Cartesian tensor bases to assemble equivariant outputs, CEITNet enables efficient construction of high-order tensor. Across benchmark datasets for order-2 dielectric, order-3 piezoelectric, and order-4 elastic tensor prediction, CEITNet surpasses prior high-order prediction methods on key accuracy criteria while offering high computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness metrics often obscure the specifics of disparities, making it hard to pinpoint issues under domain shift.

Method: RISE uses interactive visualization to convert sorted residuals into interpretable patterns, linking residual structures to fairness notions.

Result: RISE enables localized disparity diagnosis, subgroup comparison, and detection of hidden fairness issues, revealing accuracy-fairness trade-offs.

Conclusion: RISE improves fairness evaluation by providing actionable insights beyond aggregate statistics, aiding informed model selection.

Abstract: Evaluating fairness under domain shift is challenging because scalar metrics often obscure exactly where and how disparities arise. We introduce \textit{RISE} (Residual Inspection through Sorted Evaluation), an interactive visualization tool that converts sorted residuals into interpretable patterns. By connecting residual curve structures to formal fairness notions, RISE enables localized disparity diagnosis, subgroup comparison across environments, and the detection of hidden fairness issues. Through post-hoc analysis, RISE exposes accuracy-fairness trade-offs that aggregate statistics miss, supporting more informed model selection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UMF enhances Masked Diffusion Language Models with Monte Carlo Tree Search, outperforming existing scaling methods on coding and math tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the iterative and non-autoregressive generation process of MDLMs for advanced search strategies.

Method: UMF frames unmasking as a search tree and uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to optimize generation paths with deterministic partial unmasking.

Result: UMF consistently outperforms baselines on coding benchmarks and scales well on mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: UMF effectively improves MDLMs' performance through structured search strategies.

Abstract: Test-time scaling strategies have effectively leveraged inference-time compute to enhance the reasoning abilities of Autoregressive Large Language Models. In this work, we demonstrate that Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) are inherently amenable to advanced search strategies, owing to their iterative and non-autoregressive generation process. To leverage this, we propose UnMaskFork (UMF), a framework that formulates the unmasking trajectory as a search tree and employs Monte Carlo Tree Search to optimize the generation path. In contrast to standard scaling methods relying on stochastic sampling, UMF explores the search space through deterministic partial unmasking actions performed by multiple MDLMs. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that UMF consistently outperforms existing test-time scaling baselines on complex coding benchmarks, while also exhibiting strong scalability on mathematical reasoning tasks.

*Weikang Meng,Liangyu Huo,Yadan Luo,Yaowei Wang,Yingjian Li,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Linear attention (MirrorLA) improves performance over traditional linear attention by actively reorienting feature maps instead of passive truncation, achieving state-of-the-art results without sacrificing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance gap between linear attention and softmax-based attention stems from the non-negativity constraint's passive truncation of semantic information in negative domains.

Method: MirrorLA uses learnable Householder reflections to actively reorient feature geometry into the non-negative orthant, optimizing local discriminability, stabilizing long-context dynamics, and integrating subspaces via cross-head reflections.

Result: MirrorLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, proving linear efficiency can coexist with high representational fidelity.

Conclusion: MirrorLA's geometric framework successfully bridges the performance gap between linear and softmax-based attention by maximizing information retention through active reorientation.

Abstract: Linear attention significantly reduces the computational complexity of Transformers from quadratic to linear, yet it consistently lags behind softmax-based attention in performance. We identify the root cause of this degradation as the non-negativity constraint imposed on kernel feature maps: standard projections like ReLU act as "passive truncation" operators, indiscriminately discarding semantic information residing in the negative domain. We propose MirrorLA, a geometric framework that substitutes passive truncation with active reorientation. By leveraging learnable Householder reflections, MirrorLA rotates the feature geometry into the non-negative orthant to maximize information retention. Our approach restores representational density through a cohesive, multi-scale design: it first optimizes local discriminability via block-wise isometries, stabilizes long-context dynamics using variance-aware modulation to diversify activations, and finally, integrates dispersed subspaces via cross-head reflections to induce global covariance mixing. MirrorLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, demonstrating that strictly linear efficiency can be achieved without compromising representational fidelity.

Motivation: DL is needed for collaborative ML without centralized data hosting, but current methods suffer from communication inefficiencies.

Method: Mosaic Learning decomposes models into fragments and disseminates them independently, leveraging parameter correlation to reduce communication.

Result: Theoretically, it achieves state-of-the-art convergence and improves contraction. Empirically, it shows up to 12% higher accuracy than EL.

Conclusion: Mosaic Learning enhances DL performance without compromising utility or efficiency, setting a new standard.

Abstract: Decentralized learning (DL) enables collaborative machine learning (ML) without a central server, making it suitable for settings where training data cannot be centrally hosted. We introduce Mosaic Learning, a DL framework that decomposes models into fragments and disseminates them independently across the network. Fragmentation reduces redundant communication across correlated parameters and enables more diverse information propagation without increasing communication cost. We theoretically show that Mosaic Learning (i) shows state-of-the-art worst-case convergence rate, and (ii) leverages parameter correlation in an ML model, improving contraction by reducing the highest eigenvalue of a simplified system. We empirically evaluate Mosaic Learning on four learning tasks and observe up to 12 percentage points higher node-level test accuracy compared to epidemic learning (EL), a state-of-the-art baseline. In summary, Mosaic Learning improves DL performance without sacrificing its utility or efficiency, and positions itself as a new DL standard.

*Jiapeng Liu,Liang Li,Bing Li,Peng Fu,Xiyan Gao,Chengyang Fang,Xiaoshuai Hao,Can Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EXaMCaP uses entropy gain maximization to select high-diversity subsets from ChartU datasets, efficiently probing MLLMs' capability gains without full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of full-set fine-tuning MLLMs for assessing ChartU dataset gains, EXaMCaP leverages subset selection to reduce time costs.

Method: EXaMCaP iteratively selects samples maximizing entropy gain relative to the current set, approximating the maximum-entropy subset.

Result: EXaMCaP outperforms baselines in probing capability gains, works across subset sizes, and is compatible with various MLLMs.

Conclusion: EXaMCaP offers an efficient and effective alternative to full-set fine-tuning for dataset refinement in chart understanding tasks.

Abstract: Recent works focus on synthesizing Chart Understanding (ChartU) training sets to inject advanced chart knowledge into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where the sufficiency of the knowledge is typically verified by quantifying capability gains via the fine-tune-then-evaluate paradigm. However, full-set fine-tuning MLLMs to assess such gains incurs significant time costs, hindering the iterative refinement cycles of the ChartU dataset. Reviewing the ChartU dataset synthesis and data selection domains, we find that subsets can potentially probe the MLLMs' capability gains from full-set fine-tuning. Given that data diversity is vital for boosting MLLMs' performance and entropy reflects this feature, we propose EXaMCaP, which uses entropy gain maximization to select a subset. To obtain a high-diversity subset, EXaMCaP chooses the maximum-entropy subset from the large ChartU dataset. As enumerating all possible subsets is impractical, EXaMCaP iteratively selects samples to maximize the gain in set entropy relative to the current set, approximating the maximum-entropy subset of the full dataset. Experiments show that EXaMCaP outperforms baselines in probing the capability gains of the ChartU training set, along with its strong effectiveness across diverse subset sizes and compatibility with various MLLM architectures.

*Zongjiang Shang,Dongliang Cui,Binqing Wu,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MSH-LLM is a multi-scale hypergraph method aligning LLMs for time series analysis, improving modality alignment and leveraging multi-scale structures for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to fully utilize LLMs' capabilities for time series analysis by neglecting multi-scale structures of natural language and time series.

Method: MSH-LLM uses a hyperedging mechanism for multi-scale semantic enhancement, a CMA module for cross-modality alignment, and a MoP mechanism for contextual prompts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on 27 real-world datasets across 5 applications.

Conclusion: MSH-LLM effectively enhances LLMs for time series analysis by addressing multi-scale alignment and semantic understanding.

Abstract: Recently, there has been great success in leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series analysis. The core idea lies in effectively aligning the modality between natural language and time series. However, the multi-scale structures of natural language and time series have not been fully considered, resulting in insufficient utilization of LLMs capabilities. To this end, we propose MSH-LLM, a Multi-Scale Hypergraph method that aligns Large Language Models for time series analysis. Specifically, a hyperedging mechanism is designed to enhance the multi-scale semantic information of time series semantic space. Then, a cross-modality alignment (CMA) module is introduced to align the modality between natural language and time series at different scales. In addition, a mixture of prompts (MoP) mechanism is introduced to provide contextual information and enhance the ability of LLMs to understand the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series. Experimental results on 27 real-world datasets across 5 different applications demonstrate that MSH-LLM achieves the state-of-the-art results.

### [225] [Reducing the labeling burden in time-series mapping using Common Ground: a semi-automated approach to tracking changes in land cover and species over time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04373)
*Geethen Singh,Jasper A Slingsby,Tamara B Robinson,Glenn Moncrieff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that using a model trained on initial reference data (t0) can perform well on future data (t1) without needing updated labels, outperforming time-specific models. The 'Common Ground' method, which uses stable regions for implicit supervision, improves accuracy significantly in ecological mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting updated labeled data for Earth Observation is costly and challenging, especially in dynamic or remote areas. The study aims to reduce reliance on frequent label updates while maintaining classification accuracy.

Method: The 'Common Ground' approach combines change detection and semi-supervised learning (SSL) to leverage temporally stable regions as implicit supervision. It was tested across classifiers, sensors (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, airborne spectroscopy), and ecological use cases.

Result: For invasive tree species mapping, 'Common Ground' improved accuracy by 21-40% over naive temporal transfer and 10-16% over gold-standard models. For broad land cover mapping in Europe, accuracy improved modestly by 2%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that combining stable reference screening with SSL enables scalable and label-efficient multi-temporal classification, reducing the need for manual label updates.

Abstract: Reliable classification of Earth Observation data depends on consistent, up-to-date reference labels. However, collecting new labelled data at each time step remains expensive and logistically difficult, especially in dynamic or remote ecological systems. As a response to this challenge, we demonstrate that a model with access to reference data solely from time step t0 can perform competitively on both t0 and a future time step t1, outperforming models trained separately on time-specific reference data (the gold standard). This finding suggests that effective temporal generalization can be achieved without requiring manual updates to reference labels beyond the initial time step t0. Drawing on concepts from change detection and semi-supervised learning (SSL), the most performant approach, "Common Ground", uses a semi-supervised framework that leverages temporally stable regions-areas with little to no change in spectral or semantic characteristics between time steps-as a source of implicit supervision for dynamic regions. We evaluate this strategy across multiple classifiers, sensors (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral and airborne imaging spectroscopy), and ecological use cases. For invasive tree species mapping, we observed a 21-40% improvement in classification accuracy using Common Ground compared to naive temporal transfer, where models trained at a single time step are directly applied to a future time step. We also observe a 10 -16% higher accuracy for the introduced approach compared to a gold-standard approach. In contrast, when broad land cover categories were mapped across Europe, we observed a more modest 2% increase in accuracy compared to both the naive and gold-standard approaches. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining stable reference screening with SSL for scalable and label-efficient multi-temporal remote sensing classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data privacy concerns hindering collaboration among retailers to reduce food waste.

Method: Developed baseline predictive models for isolated retailers and introduced Blockchain-based FL for collaborative training.

Result: FL models performed nearly as well as ideal shared-data scenarios and better than isolated models, reducing waste and improving efficiency.

Conclusion: Blockchain-based FL offers a privacy-preserving, effective solution for demand forecasting in SSCM.

Abstract: Effective demand forecasting is crucial for reducing food waste. However, data privacy concerns often hinder collaboration among retailers, limiting the potential for improved predictive accuracy. In this study, we explore the application of Federated Learning (FL) in Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM), with a focus on the grocery retail sector dealing with perishable goods. We develop a baseline predictive model for demand forecasting and waste assessment in an isolated retailer scenario. Subsequently, we introduce a Blockchain-based FL model, trained collaboratively across multiple retailers without direct data sharing. Our preliminary results show that FL models have performance almost equivalent to the ideal setting in which parties share data with each other, and are notably superior to models built by individual parties without sharing data, cutting waste and boosting efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dataset of neural networks generated using LLMs addresses the lack of diverse benchmarks for evaluating NN verification tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of assessing NN verification tools due to limited datasets.

Method: Generate diverse NN architectures using LLMs, validate correctness via static analysis and symbolic tracing.

Result: A publicly available dataset of 608 NN samples covering various components and tasks.

Conclusion: This dataset supports research on NN reliability and adaptability.

Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly used to support decision-making. To verify their reliability and adaptability, researchers and practitioners have proposed a variety of tools and methods for tasks such as NN code verification, refactoring, and migration. These tools play a crucial role in guaranteeing both the correctness and maintainability of neural network architectures, helping to prevent implementation errors, simplify model updates, and ensure that complex networks can be reliably extended and reused. Yet, assessing their effectiveness remains challenging due to the lack of publicly diverse datasets of neural networks that would allow systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate a dataset of neural networks that can serve as a benchmark for validation. The dataset is designed to cover diverse architectural components and to handle multiple input data types and tasks. In total, 608 samples are generated, each conforming to a set of precise design choices. To further ensure their consistency, we validate the correctness of the generated networks using static analysis and symbolic tracing. We make the dataset publicly available to support the community in advancing research on neural network reliability and adaptability.

*Andrej Jovanović,Alex Iacob,Mher Safaryan,Ionut-Vlad Modoranu,Lorenzo Sani,William F. Shen,Xinchi Qiu,Dan Alistarh,Nicholas D. Lane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRDO is a framework combining low-rank optimization with infrequent synchronization to reduce communication bottlenecks in distributed training, achieving near-parity with low-rank DDP while cutting communication by ~10x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed training for foundation models faces bandwidth limits due to optimizer states' memory and communication demands. Existing low-rank optimizers struggle with local-update regimes lacking full-batch gradients.

Method: LoRDO integrates low-rank optimization with infrequent syncs, introducing a full-rank quasi-hyperbolic update to restore subspace exploration beyond global projections.

Result: LoRDO matches low-rank DDP performance in language modeling (125M--720M models) while reducing communication ~10x and excels in low-memory settings.

Conclusion: LoRDO effectively balances communication efficiency and performance, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Distributed training of foundation models via $\texttt{DDP}$ is limited by interconnect bandwidth. While infrequent communication strategies reduce synchronization frequency, they remain bottlenecked by the memory and communication requirements of optimizer states. Low-rank optimizers can alleviate these constraints; however, in the local-update regime, workers lack access to the full-batch gradients required to compute low-rank projections, which degrades performance. We propose $\texttt{LoRDO}$, a principled framework unifying low-rank optimization with infrequent synchronization. We first demonstrate that, while global projections based on pseudo-gradients are theoretically superior, they permanently restrict the optimization trajectory to a low-rank subspace. To restore subspace exploration, we introduce a full-rank quasi-hyperbolic update. $\texttt{LoRDO}$ achieves near-parity with low-rank $\texttt{DDP}$ in language modeling and downstream tasks at model scales of $125$M--$720$M, while reducing communication by $\approx 10 \times$. Finally, we show that $\texttt{LoRDO}$ improves performance even more in very low-memory settings with small rank/batch size.

TL;DR: The paper develops a general theory of speciation transitions in diffusion models, extending beyond Gaussian mixtures to arbitrary distributions with well-defined classes, using Bayes classification and free-entropy differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analyses of speciation transitions in diffusion models are limited to Gaussian mixtures with well-separated means. The paper aims to generalize this theory to arbitrary distributions.

Method: The study formalizes class structure via Bayes classification and characterizes speciation times using free-entropy differences. It applies the framework to mixtures of Ising models and Gaussians with distinct covariance structures.

Result: The theory recovers known results for Gaussian mixtures and extends to cases where classes differ in higher-order features. Explicit speciation times are derived for Ising models.

Conclusion: The framework provides a unified description of speciation transitions in diffusion models, applicable to diverse distributions and class structures.

Abstract: Diffusion Models generate data by reversing a stochastic diffusion process, progressively transforming noise into structured samples drawn from a target distribution. Recent theoretical work has shown that this backward dynamics can undergo sharp qualitative transitions, known as speciation transitions, during which trajectories become dynamically committed to data classes. Existing theoretical analyses, however, are limited to settings where classes are identifiable through first moments, such as mixtures of Gaussians with well-separated means. In this work, we develop a general theory of speciation in diffusion models that applies to arbitrary target distributions admitting well-defined classes. We formalize the notion of class structure through Bayes classification and characterize speciation times in terms of free-entropy difference between classes. This criterion recovers known results in previously studied Gaussian-mixture models, while extending to situations in which classes are not distinguishable by first moments and may instead differ through higher-order or collective features. Our framework also accommodates multiple classes and predicts the existence of successive speciation times associated with increasingly fine-grained class commitment. We illustrate the theory on two analytically tractable examples: mixtures of one-dimensional Ising models at different temperatures and mixtures of zero-mean Gaussians with distinct covariance structures. In the Ising case, we obtain explicit expressions for speciation times by mapping the problem onto a random-field Ising model and solving it via the replica method. Our results provide a unified and broadly applicable description of speciation transitions in diffusion-based generative models.

*Shizhou Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the trade-off between utility and fairness (separation) using an information-theoretic approach, characterizing the Pareto frontier and introducing a CMI-based regularizer for deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a theoretical and practical understanding of the trade-off between utility and separation fairness in predictive models, ensuring fairness without compromising accuracy.

Method: Uses information theory to characterize the utility-separation Pareto frontier and develops a conditional mutual information (CMI) regularizer for gradient-based optimization in deep models.

Result: Numerical experiments on datasets (COMPAS, UCI Adult, UCI Bank, CelebA) show the method reduces separation violations while maintaining or improving utility compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The study provides a provable, stable, and flexible approach to enforcing separation fairness in deep learning models.

Abstract: We study the Pareto frontier (optimal trade-off) between utility and separation, a fairness criterion requiring predictive independence from sensitive attributes conditional on the true outcome. Through an information-theoretic lens, we prove a characterization of the utility-separation Pareto frontier, establish its concavity, and thereby prove the increasing marginal cost of separation in terms of utility. In addition, we characterize the conditions under which this trade-off becomes strict, providing a guide for trade-off selection in practice. Based on the theoretical characterization, we develop an empirical regularizer based on conditional mutual information (CMI) between predictions and sensitive attributes given the true outcome. The CMI regularizer is compatible with any deep model trained via gradient-based optimization and serves as a scalar monitor of residual separation violations, offering tractable guarantees during training. Finally, numerical experiments support our theoretical findings: across COMPAS, UCI Adult, UCI Bank, and CelebA, the proposed method substantially reduces separation violations while matching or exceeding the utility of established baseline methods. This study thus offers a provable, stable, and flexible approach to enforcing separation in deep learning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes two techniques—EMA anchor policy and Top-k KL estimator—to enhance policy gradient algorithms for LLMs, achieving significant performance gains in math reasoning and agentic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the stability and performance of policy gradient algorithms in large language models (LLMs) by introducing novel techniques that combine the benefits of exact KL and sampled KL estimations.

Method: Two techniques are introduced: (1) Replacing the fixed anchor policy with an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for stability, and (2) Introducing the Top-k KL estimator for flexible interpolation between exact and sampled KL. These are combined with GRPO for evaluation.

Result: EMA-PG significantly outperforms GRPO, with gains like 53.9% vs. 50.8% on OlympiadBench and average improvements of 33.3% across agentic RL datasets like HotpotQA (29.7% to 44.1%) and 2WikiMultiHopQA (27.4% to 40.1%).

Conclusion: EMA-PG is a simple, principled, and effective approach for scaling reinforcement learning in LLMs, achieving substantial performance improvements in diverse tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to acquire increasingly complex reasoning and agentic behaviors. In this work, we propose two simple techniques to improve policy gradient algorithms for LLMs. First, we replace the fixed anchor policy during RL with an Exponential Moving Average (EMA), similar to a target network in deep Q-learning. Second, we introduce Top-k KL estimator, which allows for flexible interpolation between exact KL and sampled KL. We derive the stability conditions for using EMA anchor; moreover, we show that our Top-k KL estimator yields both unbiased KL values and unbiased gradients at any k, while bringing the benefits of exact KL. When combined with GRPO, the two techniques (EMA-PG) lead to a significant performance boost. On math reasoning, it allows R1-distilled Qwen-1.5B to reach 53.9% on OlympiadBench compared to 50.8% by GRPO. On agentic RL domains, with Qwen-3B base, EMA-PG improves GRPO by an average of 33.3% across 7 datasets of Q&A with search engines, including 29.7% $\rightarrow$ 44.1% on HotpotQA, 27.4% $\rightarrow$ 40.1% on 2WikiMultiHopQA. Overall, we show that EMA-PG is a simple, principled, and powerful approach to scaling RL for LLMs. Code: https://github.com/LunjunZhang/ema-pg

Motivation: The motivation stems from the safety risks posed by compromised agents in LLM-based multi-agent systems. The goal is to automate the design of systems that remain safe even when some agents behave adversarially.

Method: The challenge is framed as a Stackelberg security game. MaMa employs LLM-based adversarial search, where the Meta-Agent iteratively proposes designs and receives feedback from attacks simulated by the Meta-Adversary.

Result: Empirical evaluations show MaMa-designed systems defend against worst-case attacks without sacrificing task performance. They also generalize to stronger adversaries and different attack objectives.

Conclusion: MaMa effectively automates the design of robust and safe multi-agent systems, demonstrating resilience beyond the training setting.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but they also introduce significant safety risks when individual agents fail or behave adversarially. In this work, we study the automated design of agentic systems that remain safe even when a subset of agents is compromised. We formalize this challenge as a Stackelberg security game between a system designer (the Meta-Agent) and a best-responding Meta-Adversary that selects and compromises a subset of agents to minimize safety. We propose Meta-Adversary-Meta-Agent (MaMa), a novel algorithm for approximately solving this game and automatically designing safe agentic systems. Our approach uses LLM-based adversarial search, where the Meta-Agent iteratively proposes system designs and receives feedback based on the strongest attacks discovered by the Meta-Adversary. Empirical evaluations across diverse environments show that systems designed with MaMa consistently defend against worst-case attacks while maintaining performance comparable to systems optimized solely for task success. Moreover, the resulting systems generalize to stronger adversaries, as well as ones with different attack objectives or underlying LLMs, demonstrating robust safety beyond the training setting.

### [233] [Hand Gesture Recognition from Doppler Radar Signals Using Echo State Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04436)
*Towa Sano,Gouhei Tanaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Echo State Network (ESN) approach for radar-based hand gesture recognition (HGR), achieving high performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional deep learning methods for HGR are computationally expensive, especially for in-vehicle and robotic interfaces. The paper aims to address this with lightweight ESNs.

Method: Raw FMCW radar data is converted into feature maps (range-time and Doppler-time) and processed via recurrent neural network-based reservoirs, followed by readout classifiers.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches on 11-class and 4-class HGR tasks using the Soli and Dop-NET datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: Multi-reservoir ESNs efficiently recognize temporal patterns in feature maps, offering high performance with low computational cost for resource-constrained HCI applications.

Abstract: Hand gesture recognition (HGR) is a fundamental technology in human computer interaction (HCI).In particular, HGR based on Doppler radar signals is suited for in-vehicle interfaces and robotic systems, necessitating lightweight and computationally efficient recognition techniques. However, conventional deep learning-based methods still suffer from high computational costs. To address this issue, we propose an Echo State Network (ESN) approach for radar-based HGR, using frequency-modulated-continuous-wave (FMCW) radar signals. Raw radar data is first converted into feature maps, such as range-time and Doppler-time maps, which are then fed into one or more recurrent neural network-based reservoirs. The obtained reservoir states are processed by readout classifiers, including ridge regression, support vector machines, and random forests. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on an 11-class HGR task using the Soli dataset and surpasses existing deep learning models on a 4-class HGR task using the Dop-NET dataset. The results indicate that parallel processing using multi-reservoir ESNs are effective for recognizing temporal patterns from the multiple different feature maps in the time-space and time-frequency domains. Our ESN approaches achieve high recognition performance with low computational cost in HGR, showing great potential for more advanced HCI technologies, especially in resource-constrained environments.

*Xianbiao Qi,Marco Chen,Jiaquan Ye,Yelin He,Rong Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Muon optimizer's spectral properties, comparing it to Adam and other variants, finding RMS-normalized updates more stable but Muon not universally better than Adam.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand Muon optimizer's mechanisms and its relationship to adaptive optimizers like Adam through a spectral perspective.

Method: Introduces a family of spectral transformations (p=0, 1/4, 1/2, 1) applied to updates, develops efficient computation via coupled Newton iteration, and compares performance in controlled experiments.

Result: RMS-normalized updates are more stable; Muon (p=0) doesn't consistently outperform Adam, acting more as spectral normalization.

Conclusion: Muon is effective for spectral normalization but isn't universally superior to Adam.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has recently attracted considerable attention for its strong empirical performance and use of orthogonalized updates on matrix-shaped parameters, yet its underlying mechanisms and relationship to adaptive optimizers such as Adam remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we aim to address these questions through a unified spectral perspective. Specifically, we view Muon as the p = 0 endpoint of a family of spectral transformations of the form U \boldsymbolΣ^{p} V' , and consider additional variants with p = 1/2 , p = 1/4 , and p = 1 . These transformations are applied to both first-moment updates, as in momentum SGD, and to root-mean-square (RMS) normalized gradient updates as in Adam. To enable efficient computation, we develop a coupled Newton iteration that avoids explicit singular value decomposition. Across controlled experiments, we find that RMS-normalized updates yield more stable optimization than first-moment updates. Moreover, while spectral compression provides strong stabilization benefits under first-moment updates, the Muon update (p = 0) does not consistently outperform Adam. These results suggest that Muon is best understood as an effective form of spectral normalization, but not a universally superior optimization method. Our source code will be released at https://github.com/Ocram7/BeyondMuon.

*Giacomo Frisoni,Lorenzo Molfetta,Davide Freddi,Gianluca Moro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mixture-of-Masters (MoM) introduces a mixture-of-experts model for chess, combining small-sized GPT experts to emulate grandmasters, outperforming dense models and baselines while maintaining stylistic variety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the homogenization and mode-averaging behavior of monolithic chess language models, which blur stylistic boundaries and suppress rare strategies.

Method: MoM uses a mixture of small-sized GPT experts trained with self-supervised and reinforcement learning, guided by chess-specific rewards. A learnable gating network selects the most suitable expert for each move based on the game state.

Result: MoM outperforms dense individual expert networks and aggregated-data GPT baselines against Stockfish on unseen standard games, ensuring generation variety, control, and interpretability.

Conclusion: The MoM approach successfully counters homogenization in chess models by dynamically switching between grandmaster styles, achieving superior performance and diversity.

Abstract: Modern chess language models are dense transformers trained on millions of games played by thousands of high-rated individuals. However, these monolithic networks tend to collapse into mode-averaged behavior, where stylistic boundaries are blurred, and rare but effective strategies are suppressed. To counteract homogenization, we introduce Mixture-of-Masters (MoM), the first chess mixture-of-experts model with small-sized GPT experts emulating world-class grandmasters. Each expert is trained with a combination of self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning guided by chess-specific rewards. For each move, a post-hoc learnable gating network selects the most appropriate persona to channel depending on the game state, allowing MoM to switch its style dynamically$--$e.g., Tal's offensive vocation or Petrosian's defensive solidity. When evaluated against Stockfish on unseen standard games, MoM outperforms both dense individual expert networks and popular GPT baselines trained on aggregated data, while ensuring generation variety, control, and interpretability.

*Moritz Miller,Florent Draye,Bernhard Schölkopf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an orthogonality penalty to disentangle features in language models, improving interpretability and enabling isolated interventions without losing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce interference and superposition between features while maintaining model performance, aiming for identifiable and interpretable representations.

Method: Introduces an orthogonality penalty during fine-tuning of language models with sparse autoencoders, ensuring almost orthogonal features.

Result: Features become more orthogonal, interpretable, and allow for isolated interventions, aligning with causal principles.

Conclusion: Orthogonality penalties enhance feature modularity and interpretability, supporting causal interventions while preserving model performance.

Abstract: With recent progress on fine-tuning language models around a fixed sparse autoencoder, we disentangle the decoder matrix into almost orthogonal features. This reduces interference and superposition between the features, while keeping performance on the target dataset essentially unchanged. Our orthogonality penalty leads to identifiable features, ensuring the uniqueness of the decomposition. Further, we find that the distance between embedded feature explanations increases with stricter orthogonality penalty, a desirable property for interpretability. Invoking the $\textit{Independent Causal Mechanisms}$ principle, we argue that orthogonality promotes modular representations amenable to causal intervention. We empirically show that these increasingly orthogonalized features allow for isolated interventions. Our code is available under $\texttt{https://github.com/mrtzmllr/sae-icm}$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Data2Behavior and MDF to predict unintended LLM biases pre-training using lightweight data summarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inefficiencies in detecting unintended LLM biases post-training by predicting risks beforehand.

Method: Proposes Manipulating Data Features (MDF), injecting mean data representations into a base model to reveal biases without parameter updates.

Result: MDF reliably predicts biases using 20% of GPU resources vs fine-tuning, validated on models like Qwen3-14B and Gemma-3-12b-it.

Conclusion: MDF effectively anticipates unintended behaviors, offering insights into pre-training vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire unintended biases from seemingly benign training data even without explicit cues or malicious content. Existing methods struggle to detect such risks before fine-tuning, making post hoc evaluation costly and inefficient. To address this challenge, we introduce Data2Behavior, a new task for predicting unintended model behaviors prior to training. We also propose Manipulating Data Features (MDF), a lightweight approach that summarizes candidate data through their mean representations and injects them into the forward pass of a base model, allowing latent statistical signals in the data to shape model activations and reveal potential biases and safety risks without updating any parameters. MDF achieves reliable prediction while consuming only about 20% of the GPU resources required for fine-tuning. Experiments on Qwen3-14B, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12b-it confirm that MDF can anticipate unintended behaviors and provide insight into pre-training vulnerabilities.

*Yuxi Guo,Paul Sheridan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Greedy-Gnorm dynamically recalculates attention head importance during pruning using gradient norms, outperforming static methods and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve transformer model compression by addressing the limitation of static importance scores in existing pruning methods, which fail to adapt to the evolving roles of attention heads.

Method: Proposes Greedy-Gnorm, a pruning algorithm that dynamically scores heads using the elementwise product of Q/K/V gradient block l2-norms, recalculated iteratively.

Result: Outperforms attention entropy-based pruning, consistently preserving accuracy under substantial head removal across BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa.

Conclusion: Greedy-Gnorm offers an effective approach to energy-efficient transformer deployment by dynamically optimizing head removal while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Attention head pruning has emerged as an effective technique for transformer model compression, an increasingly important goal in the era of Green AI. However, existing pruning methods often rely on static importance scores, which fail to capture the evolving role of attention heads during iterative removal. We propose Greedy-Gradient norm (Greedy-Gnorm), a novel head pruning algorithm that dynamically recalculates head importance after each pruning step. Specifically, each head is scored by the elementwise product of the l2-norms of its Q/K/V gradient blocks, as estimated from a hold-out validation set and updated at every greedy iteration. This dynamic approach to scoring mitigates against stale rankings and better reflects gradient-informed importance as pruning progresses. Extensive experiments on BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa demonstrate that Greedy-Gnorm consistently preserves accuracy under substantial head removal, outperforming attention entropy. By effectively reducing model size while maintaining task performance, Greedy-Gnorm offers a promising step toward more energy-efficient transformer model deployment.

*Ishaq Aden-Ali,Noah Golowich,Allen Liu,Abhishek Shetty,Ankur Moitra,Nika Haghtalab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS), a method to uncover hidden effects in datasets influencing LLM behaviors, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse scenarios and model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how datasets influence LLM behaviors is crucial, especially since hidden signals in datasets can unexpectedly shape model properties.

Method: Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS) is proposed to select subsets of preference datasets, revealing hidden effects that persist across different models.

Result: LLS successfully identifies subsets causing specific behaviors, such as preferences, multilingual responses, or persona changes, proving its generality.

Conclusion: LLS provides a fundamental tool for dataset-centric analysis of LLM training, highlighting hidden subtexts' universal impact on model behaviors.

Abstract: Training modern large language models (LLMs) has become a veritable smorgasbord of algorithms and datasets designed to elicit particular behaviors, making it critical to develop techniques to understand the effects of datasets on the model's properties. This is exacerbated by recent experiments that show datasets can transmit signals that are not directly observable from individual datapoints, posing a conceptual challenge for dataset-centric understandings of LLM training and suggesting a missing fundamental account of such phenomena. Towards understanding such effects, inspired by recent work on the linear structure of LLMs, we uncover a general mechanism through which hidden subtexts can arise in generic datasets.
  We introduce Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS), a method that prescribes how to select subsets of a generic preference dataset to elicit a wide range of hidden effects. We apply LLS to discover subsets of real-world datasets so that models trained on them exhibit behaviors ranging from having specific preferences, to responding to prompts in a different language not present in the dataset, to taking on a different persona. Crucially, the effect persists for the selected subset, across models with varying architectures, supporting its generality and universality.

*Abdulrahman Alotaibi,Irene Tenison,Miriam Kim,Isaac Lee,Lalana Kagal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Iterative Federated Adaptation (IFA), a method to improve Federated Learning performance in non-IID web data settings by reinitializing some model parameters iteratively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning degrades under non-IID client distributions common in real-world web systems. The goal is to enhance generalization without centralizing sensitive data.

Method: IFA divides training into generations, reinitializing a fraction of parameters (randomly or from later layers) at the end of each generation to escape local minima and preserve global representations.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10, MIT-Indoors, and Stanford Dogs datasets show a 21.5% average improvement in global accuracy, especially for non-IID data.

Conclusion: IFA advances scalable, privacy-preserving machine learning for heterogeneous web systems, improving generalization without data centralization.

Abstract: The Web is naturally heterogeneous with user devices, geographic regions, browsing patterns, and contexts all leading to highly diverse, unique datasets. Federated Learning (FL) is an important paradigm for the Web because it enables privacy-preserving, collaborative machine learning across diverse user devices, web services and clients without needing to centralize sensitive data. However, its performance degrades severely under non-IID client distributions that is prevalent in real-world web systems. In this work, we propose a new training paradigm - Iterative Federated Adaptation (IFA) - that enhances generalization in heterogeneous federated settings through generation-wise forget and evolve strategy. Specifically, we divide training into multiple generations and, at the end of each, select a fraction of model parameters (a) randomly or (b) from the later layers of the model and reinitialize them. This iterative forget and evolve schedule allows the model to escape local minima and preserve globally relevant representations. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MIT-Indoors, and Stanford Dogs datasets show that the proposed approach improves global accuracy, especially when the data cross clients are Non-IID. This method can be implemented on top any federated algorithm to improve its generalization performance. We observe an average of 21.5%improvement across datasets. This work advances the vision of scalable, privacy-preserving intelligence for real-world heterogeneous and distributed web systems.

*Penghui Qi,Xiangxin Zhou,Zichen Liu,Tianyu Pang,Chao Du,Min Lin,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques PPO's ratio clipping mechanism for LLMs and proposes DPPO, a more principled approach using policy divergence constraints, showing better stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO's ratio clipping is inefficient and unstable for LLMs due to noisy estimates and misaligned penalties for token probabilities.

Method: Introduces DPPO, replacing clipping with direct policy divergence constraints (Total Variation or KL) and efficient Binary/Top-K approximations to reduce overhead.

Result: DPPO outperforms PPO in training stability and efficiency for RL-based LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DPPO provides a robust alternative to PPO for LLMs, addressing its structural limitations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as the de facto standard algorithm. Despite its ubiquity, we argue that the core ratio clipping mechanism in PPO is structurally ill-suited for the large vocabularies inherent to LLMs. PPO constrains policy updates based on the probability ratio of sampled tokens, which serves as a noisy single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of the true policy divergence. This creates a sub-optimal learning dynamic: updates to low-probability tokens are aggressively over-penalized, while potentially catastrophic shifts in high-probability tokens are under-constrained, leading to training inefficiency and instability. To address this, we propose Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO), which substitutes heuristic clipping with a more principled constraint based on a direct estimate of policy divergence (e.g., Total Variation or KL). To avoid huge memory footprint, we introduce the efficient Binary and Top-K approximations to capture the essential divergence with negligible overhead. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that DPPO achieves superior training stability and efficiency compared to existing methods, offering a more robust foundation for RL-based LLM fine-tuning.

TL;DR: The paper addresses catastrophic forgetting in neural networks by framing continual learning as a control problem, balancing learning new tasks with preserving old ones, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting hinders neural networks when tasks are learned sequentially. The work aims to mitigate this by treating continual learning as a control problem.

Method: The approach converts regularization penalties into preservation signals, minimizing control effort to integrate new tasks while protecting prior-task representations.

Result: The method recovers true prior-task curvature (continual-natural gradient) and excels in task discrimination, outperforming benchmarks without replay.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances learning and preservation, offering a novel solution to catastrophic forgetting in continual learning.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a fundamental challenge for neural networks when tasks are trained sequentially. In this work, we reformulate continual learning as a control problem where learning and preservation signals compete within neural activity dynamics. We convert regularization penalties into preservation signals that protect prior-task representations. Learning then proceeds by minimizing the control effort required to integrate new tasks while competing with the preservation of prior tasks. At equilibrium, the neural activities produce weight updates that implicitly encode the full prior-task curvature, a property we term the continual-natural gradient, requiring no explicit curvature storage. Experiments confirm that our learning framework recovers true prior-task curvature and enables task discrimination, outperforming existing methods on standard benchmarks without replay.

TL;DR: The paper presents a mathematical framework for analyzing gradient flow scaling regimes in large learning problems, using a power series expansion with Feynman-like diagrams. It identifies distinct learning phases for CP tensor decompositions and proposes a PDE-based method to solve the expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and predict the behavior of gradient flow in large-scale learning problems, particularly for CP tensor decompositions, by establishing a formal framework and deriving explicit solutions.

Method: Develops a power series expansion of the loss evolution with coefficients represented by Feynman-like diagrams, analyzes its large-size limit, and reduces the expansion to solvable PDEs using the method of characteristics.

Result: Identifies distinct gradient flow regimes (e.g., free evolution, NTK, mean-field) dependent on scaling, tensor order, and symmetry. Validates predictions experimentally with high accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework successfully captures complex learning dynamics and provides explicit solutions, offering insights into gradient flow behavior in large learning systems.

Abstract: We develop a general mathematical framework to analyze scaling regimes and derive explicit analytic solutions for gradient flow (GF) in large learning problems. Our key innovation is a formal power series expansion of the loss evolution, with coefficients encoded by diagrams akin to Feynman diagrams. We show that this expansion has a well-defined large-size limit that can be used to reveal different learning phases and, in some cases, to obtain explicit solutions of the nonlinear GF. We focus on learning Canonical Polyadic (CP) decompositions of high-order tensors, and show that this model has several distinct extreme lazy and rich GF regimes such as free evolution, NTK and under- and over-parameterized mean-field. We show that these regimes depend on the parameter scaling, tensor order, and symmetry of the model in a specific and subtle way. Moreover, we propose a general approach to summing the formal loss expansion by reducing it to a PDE; in a wide range of scenarios, it turns out to be 1st order and solvable by the method of characteristics. We observe a very good agreement of our theoretical predictions with experiment.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Douglas-Rachford Splitting (DRS) to decouple and negotiate plasticity and stability in continual learning, avoiding complex strategies like memory replay or regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting and inefficiency due to gradient conflicts and auxiliary modules.

Method: Reformulates continual learning using DRS to decouple plasticity and stability, solving them iteratively via proximal operators.

Result: Achieves efficient balance between stability and plasticity without auxiliary modules.

Conclusion: DRS offers a simpler, more principled solution for continual learning challenges.

Abstract: Learning from a stream of tasks usually pits plasticity against stability: acquiring new knowledge often causes catastrophic forgetting of past information. Most methods address this by summing competing loss terms, creating gradient conflicts that are managed with complex and often inefficient strategies such as external memory replay or parameter regularization. We propose a reformulation of the continual learning objective using Douglas-Rachford Splitting (DRS). This reframes the learning process not as a direct trade-off, but as a negotiation between two decoupled objectives: one promoting plasticity for new tasks and the other enforcing stability of old knowledge. By iteratively finding a consensus through their proximal operators, DRS provides a more principled and stable learning dynamic. Our approach achieves an efficient balance between stability and plasticity without the need for auxiliary modules or complex add-ons, providing a simpler yet more powerful paradigm for continual learning systems.

*Jonathan Klees,Tobias Riedlinger,Peter Stehr,Bennet Böddecker,Daniel Kondermann,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A probabilistic label spreading method is introduced to estimate label uncertainties efficiently, reducing annotation effort while improving label quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in ensuring safe AI perception tasks due to unreliable labels affected by aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Crowdsourcing multiple annotations is impractical at scale.

Method: A graph-based diffusion method propagates single annotations over the feature space, assuming label smoothness. It provides scalable estimates of label uncertainties.

Result: The method reduces annotation budget significantly and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Data-Centric Image Classification benchmark.

Conclusion: Probabilistic label spreading effectively estimates label uncertainties, enabling scalable and high-quality annotations for AI perception tasks.

Abstract: Safe artificial intelligence for perception tasks remains a major challenge, partly due to the lack of data with high-quality labels. Annotations themselves are subject to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, which is typically ignored during annotation and evaluation. While crowdsourcing enables collecting multiple annotations per image to estimate these uncertainties, this approach is impractical at scale due to the required annotation effort. We introduce a probabilistic label spreading method that provides reliable estimates of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of labels. Assuming label smoothness over the feature space, we propagate single annotations using a graph-based diffusion method. We prove that label spreading yields consistent probability estimators even when the number of annotations per data point converges to zero. We present and analyze a scalable implementation of our method. Experimental results indicate that, compared to baselines, our approach substantially reduces the annotation budget required to achieve a desired label quality on common image datasets and achieves a new state of the art on the Data-Centric Image Classification benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of additive-cost constraints and dual variables in CMDPs, aiming for better off-policy scalability.

Method: Uses Control as Inference with stochastic decision horizons, introducing survival-weighted objectives and two violation semantics (absorbing and virtual termination).

Result: Improved sample efficiency and better return-violation trade-offs on benchmarks. Virtual termination scales well to high-dimensional setups.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances CMDP handling in reinforcement learning, especially for off-policy scalability and complex environments.

Abstract: Constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) provide a principled model for handling constraints, such as safety and other auxiliary objectives, in reinforcement learning. The common approach of using additive-cost constraints and dual variables often hinders off-policy scalability. We propose a Control as Inference formulation based on stochastic decision horizons, where constraint violations attenuate reward contributions and shorten the effective planning horizon via state-action-dependent continuation. This yields survival-weighted objectives that remain replay-compatible for off-policy actor-critic learning. We propose two violation semantics, absorbing and virtual termination, that share the same survival-weighted return but result in distinct optimization structures that lead to SAC/MPO-style policy improvement. Experiments demonstrate improved sample efficiency and favorable return-violation trade-offs on standard benchmarks. Moreover, MPO with virtual termination (VT-MPO) scales effectively to our high-dimensional musculoskeletal Hyfydy setup.

*Maya Janvier,Julien Salomon,Etienne Meunier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes regularization methods for Neural Differential Equations (NDE) to improve stability and accuracy in long-term integration, using Jacobian directional derivatives during training. Two approaches are designed for known and unknown dynamics, both proving effective with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid models and NDEs face stability and accuracy challenges in long-term integration. Training on unrolled trajectories is computationally expensive, so the paper seeks a cost-effective solution to stabilize NDEs during integration.

Method: The authors introduce two regularization techniques: one for known dynamics, using direct derivatives, and another for unknown dynamics, approximating derivatives via finite differences. Both methods stabilize long-term simulations with reduced computational costs.

Result: The proposed methods successfully improve stability in long-term integration for various ordinary and partial differential equations, demonstrating effectiveness despite shorter training rollouts.

Conclusion: The paper's low-cost regularization approaches enable stable long-term integration for NDEs, making them feasible for large-scale systems and expanding their practical applications.

Abstract: Hybrid models and Neural Differential Equations (NDE) are getting increasingly important for the modeling of physical systems, however they often encounter stability and accuracy issues during long-term integration. Training on unrolled trajectories is known to limit these divergences but quickly becomes too expensive due to the need for computing gradients over an iterative process. In this paper, we demonstrate that regularizing the Jacobian of the NDE model via its directional derivatives during training stabilizes long-term integration in the challenging context of short training rollouts. We design two regularizations, one for the case of known dynamics where we can directly derive the directional derivatives of the dynamic and one for the case of unknown dynamics where they are approximated using finite differences. Both methods, while having a far lower cost compared to long rollouts during training, are successful in improving the stability of long-term simulations for several ordinary and partial differential equations, opening up the door to training NDE methods for long-term integration of large scale systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REDistill is a robust knowledge distillation framework that uses power divergence loss to handle noisy teacher predictions, improving student accuracy without extensive tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional KD relies on unreliable teacher predictions, requiring ad-hoc corrections and hyper-parameter tuning, which limits generalization.

Method: REDistill replaces KL divergence with power divergence loss to adaptively downweight noisy teacher outputs while preserving useful logit relationships.

Result: Experiments show REDistill improves student accuracy across architectures on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k without hyper-parameter tuning.

Conclusion: REDistill offers a robust, generalized solution for knowledge distillation, outperforming conventional methods.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student by aligning their predictive distributions. However, conventional KD formulations - typically based on Kullback-Leibler divergence - assume that the teacher provides reliable soft targets. In practice, teacher predictions are often noisy or overconfident, and existing correction-based approaches rely on ad-hoc heuristics and extensive hyper-parameter tuning, which hinders generalization. We introduce REDistill (Robust Estimator Distillation), a simple yet principled framework grounded in robust statistics. REDistill replaces the standard KD objective with a power divergence loss, a generalization of KL divergence that adaptively downweights unreliable teacher output while preserving informative logit relationships. This formulation provides a unified and interpretable treatment of teacher noise, requires only logits, integrates seamlessly into existing KD pipelines, and incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k demonstrate that REDistill consistently improves student accuracy in diverse teacher-student architectures. Remarkably, it achieves these gains without model-specific hyper-parameter tuning, underscoring its robustness and strong generalization to unseen teacher-student pairs.

*Chenxi Hu,Yue Ma,Yifan Wu,Yunhe Hou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaCNP is a probabilistic forecasting model designed for data-scarce conditions, addressing abrupt load pattern shifts during extreme weather by leveraging similarity learning in a shared embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme weather causes volatile electricity consumption, leading to inaccurate forecasts and power system risks. Existing methods struggle due to rare and irregular extreme samples.

Method: AdaCNP learns similarity in a shared embedding space, reweights historical context relevance for few-shot adaptation, and produces predictive distributions without fine-tuning.

Result: AdaCNP reduces mean squared error by 22% and achieves the lowest negative log-likelihood, showing robustness during extreme periods.

Conclusion: AdaCNP mitigates distribution shifts and scarce extreme samples, enhancing trustworthy forecasts for resilient power system operation.

Abstract: Extreme weather can substantially change electricity consumption behavior, causing load curves to exhibit sharp spikes and pronounced volatility. If forecasts are inaccurate during those periods, power systems are more likely to face supply shortfalls or localized overloads, forcing emergency actions such as load shedding and increasing the risk of service disruptions and public-safety impacts. This problem is inherently difficult because extreme events can trigger abrupt regime shifts in load patterns, while relevant extreme samples are rare and irregular, making reliable learning and calibration challenging. We propose AdaCNP, a probabilistic forecasting model for data-scarce condition. AdaCNP learns similarity in a shared embedding space. For each target data, it evaluates how relevant each historical context segment is to the current condition and reweights the context information accordingly. This design highlights the most informative historical evidence even when extreme samples are rare. It enables few-shot adaptation to previously unseen extreme patterns. AdaCNP also produces predictive distributions for risk-aware decision-making without expensive fine-tuning on the target domain. We evaluate AdaCNP on real-world power-system load data and compare it against a range of representative baselines. The results show that AdaCNP is more robust during extreme periods, reducing the mean squared error by 22\% relative to the strongest baseline while achieving the lowest negative log-likelihood, indicating more reliable probabilistic outputs. These findings suggest that AdaCNP can effectively mitigate the combined impact of abrupt distribution shifts and scarce extreme samples, providing a more trustworthy forecasting for resilient power system operation under extreme events.

*Doyeon Lee,Eunyi Lyou,Hyunsoo Cho,Sookyung Kim,Joonseok Lee,Jaemoo Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QUATRO improves RL-based LLM fine-tuning by enforcing exact trust-region constraints, leading to stable, entropy-controlled optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GRPO-style RL methods use heuristic approximations, causing brittle optimization due to inadequate regulation of importance ratios.

Method: Proposes QUATRO, a method that enforces exact trust-region constraints for stable policy updates and entropy control.

Result: QUATRO shows stable training under aggressive learning rates and policy staleness, maintaining controlled entropy.

Conclusion: QUATRO offers a principled optimization approach for RL-based fine-tuning, addressing stability and entropy control challenges.

Abstract: GRPO-style reinforcement learning (RL)-based LLM fine-tuning algorithms have recently gained popularity. Relying on heuristic trust-region approximations, however, they can lead to brittle optimization behavior, as global importance-ratio clipping and group-wise normalization fail to regulate samples whose importance ratios fall outside the clipping range. We propose Query-Adaptive Trust-Region policy Optimization (QUATRO), which directly enforces trust-region constraints through a principled optimization. This yields a clear and interpretable objective that enables explicit control over policy updates and stable, entropy-controlled optimization, with a stabilizer terms arising intrinsically from the exact trust-region formulation. Empirically verified on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks, QUATRO shows stable training under increased policy staleness and aggressive learning rates, maintaining well-controlled entropy throughout training.

*Mingyang Deng,He Li,Tianhong Li,Yilun Du,Kaiming He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Drifting Models, a new paradigm for generative modeling that evolves the pushforward distribution during training, enabling one-step inference and achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve generative modeling by allowing the pushforward distribution to evolve during training, simplifying inference to a single step while maintaining high-quality results.

Method: The method involves introducing a drifting field that governs sample movement and achieves equilibrium when distributions match. This is trained using a neural network optimizer to evolve the distribution.

Result: The model achieves an FID of 1.54 in latent space and 1.61 in pixel space on ImageNet at 256 x 256 resolution, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Drifting Models offer a promising approach for high-quality one-step generation, opening new opportunities in generative modeling.

Abstract: Generative modeling can be formulated as learning a mapping f such that its pushforward distribution matches the data distribution. The pushforward behavior can be carried out iteratively at inference time, for example in diffusion and flow-based models. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm called Drifting Models, which evolve the pushforward distribution during training and naturally admit one-step inference. We introduce a drifting field that governs the sample movement and achieves equilibrium when the distributions match. This leads to a training objective that allows the neural network optimizer to evolve the distribution. In experiments, our one-step generator achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet at 256 x 256 resolution, with an FID of 1.54 in latent space and 1.61 in pixel space. We hope that our work opens up new opportunities for high-quality one-step generation.

*Hannah Pinson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how gradient descent reduces neural networks' theoretical capacity to an effective one during training, identifying three dynamical principles—mutual alignment, unlocking, and racing—to explain phenomena like merging neurons or pruning weights. It also clarifies the lottery ticket conjecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why and how gradient descent reduces neural networks' theoretical capacity to fit tasks effectively, despite limited theoretical comprehension of their empirical success.

Method: Analyzes learning dynamics at the neuron level in single hidden layer ReLU networks, identifying three key dynamical principles: mutual alignment, unlocking, and racing.

Result: The principles explain successful capacity reduction post-training via merging equivalent neurons or pruning low-norm weights, and clarify the lottery ticket conjecture's mechanism.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into neural network training dynamics, explaining capacity reduction and the lottery ticket conjecture through identified dynamical principles.

Abstract: Our theoretical understanding of neural networks is lagging behind their empirical success. One of the important unexplained phenomena is why and how, during the process of training with gradient descent, the theoretical capacity of neural networks is reduced to an effective capacity that fits the task. We here investigate the mechanism by which gradient descent achieves this through analyzing the learning dynamics at the level of individual neurons in single hidden layer ReLU networks. We identify three dynamical principles -- mutual alignment, unlocking and racing -- that together explain why we can often successfully reduce capacity after training through the merging of equivalent neurons or the pruning of low norm weights. We specifically explain the mechanism behind the lottery ticket conjecture, or why the specific, beneficial initial conditions of some neurons lead them to obtain higher weight norms.

### [253] [MTS-JEPA: Multi-Resolution Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture for Time-Series Anomaly Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04643)
*Yanan He,Yunshi Wen,Xin Wang,Tengfei Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MTS-JEPA, a specialized JEPA architecture for multivariate time series, prevents representation collapse and captures precursor signals by integrating multi-resolution prediction and a soft codebook bottleneck, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting anomalies in multivariate time series is crucial for proactive risk mitigation in critical infrastructure, but current JEPA frameworks face representation collapse and struggle with precursor signal detection across temporal scales.

Method: MTS-JEPA integrates a multi-resolution predictive objective with a soft codebook bottleneck to decouple transient shocks from long-term trends and capture discrete regime transitions, serving as an intrinsic regularizer.

Result: Empirical evaluations show MTS-JEPA effectively prevents degenerate solutions and achieves state-of-the-art performance under early-warning protocols.

Conclusion: MTS-JEPA addresses key limitations of JEPA frameworks for multivariate time series, offering improved anomaly prediction and stability.

Abstract: Multivariate time series underpin modern critical infrastructure, making the prediction of anomalies a vital necessity for proactive risk mitigation. While Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) offer a promising framework for modeling the latent evolution of these systems, their application is hindered by representation collapse and an inability to capture precursor signals across varying temporal scales. To address these limitations, we propose MTS-JEPA, a specialized architecture that integrates a multi-resolution predictive objective with a soft codebook bottleneck. This design explicitly decouples transient shocks from long-term trends, and utilizes the codebook to capture discrete regime transitions. Notably, we find this constraint also acts as an intrinsic regularizer to ensure optimization stability. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks confirm that our approach effectively prevents degenerate solutions and achieves state-of-the-art performance under the early-warning protocol.

### [254] [SAFE: Stable Alignment Finetuning with Entropy-Aware Predictive Control for RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04651)
*Dipan Maity*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFE introduces a stable RLHF algorithm addressing PPO's instability issues with dynamic KL regulation and adaptive thresholds, achieving better reward and KL control with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO's heuristic and ad-hoc KL-divergence handling leads to instability (e.g., reward oscillations, entropy collapse), prompting the need for a more stable method.

Method: SAFE combines a Double Soft-Min Critic for pessimistic value estimation with entropy-gated KL regulation and PID-controlled adaptive thresholds.

Result: SAFE outperforms PPO (+5.15% reward), avoids reward crashes, and maintains superior KL control with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: SAFE provides a stable, interpretable RLHF framework suitable for production, balancing aggressive learning with long-horizon stability.

Abstract: Optimization (PPO) has been positioned by recent literature as the canonical method for the RL part of RLHF. PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner and suffers form reward oscillations, entropy collapse, value function drift, and sudden policy divergence that require frequent restarts and extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we develop a new pure on policy actor-critic RL method for the LM-RLHF setting. We present SAFE (Stable Alignment Finetuning with Entropy-aware control),a novel RLHF algorithm that combines a Double Soft-Min Critic for pessimistic value estimation with a new multi-layer stabilization framework combining entropy-gated KL regulation, and PID-controlled adaptive thresholds. Unlike standard PPO's symmetric KL penalties, SAFE distinguishes high-entropy exploration from low-entropy mode collapse and adjusts penalties dynamically based on reward velocity. Experiments on a 3B parameter model show SAFE achieves +5.15\% training-average reward than PPO (0.725 vs 0.689), negligible reward crashes, and superior KL control than ppo . Our method adds minimal computational overhead and provides an interpretable, crash-resistant RLHF framework that maintains aggressive learning speed while ensuring stable long-horizon optimization suitable for production deployment.

*Jaemoo Choi,Yuchen Zhu,Wei Guo,Petr Molodyk,Bo Yuan,Jinbin Bai,Yi Xin,Molei Tao,Yongxin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes RL design space for diffusion models, identifying ELBO-based likelihood estimators as key for efficient optimization, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models' intractable likelihoods hinder RL application; current ad hoc estimators lack systematic evaluation.

Method: Disentangles policy-gradient objectives, likelihood estimators, and rollout sampling; emphasizes ELBO-based estimators.

Result: ELBO-based estimators enable stable RL optimization; method improves GenEval score significantly with higher efficiency.

Conclusion: ELBO-based likelihood estimation is crucial for effective RL in diffusion models, outperforming current methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to diffusion and flow models for visual tasks such as text-to-image generation. However, these tasks remain challenging because diffusion models have intractable likelihoods, which creates a barrier for directly applying popular policy-gradient type methods. Existing approaches primarily focus on crafting new objectives built on already heavily engineered LLM objectives, using ad hoc estimators for likelihood, without a thorough investigation into how such estimation affects overall algorithmic performance. In this work, we provide a systematic analysis of the RL design space by disentangling three factors: i) policy-gradient objectives, ii) likelihood estimators, and iii) rollout sampling schemes. We show that adopting an evidence lower bound (ELBO) based model likelihood estimator, computed only from the final generated sample, is the dominant factor enabling effective, efficient, and stable RL optimization, outweighing the impact of the specific policy-gradient loss functional. We validate our findings across multiple reward benchmarks using SD 3.5 Medium, and observe consistent trends across all tasks. Our method improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.95 in 90 GPU hours, which is $4.6\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO and $2\times$ more efficient than the SOTA method DiffusionNFT without reward hacking.

*Panagiotis Theodoropoulos,Juno Nam,Evangelos Theodorou,Jaemoo Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GSBoG, a scalable framework for learning executable CTMC policies on graphs, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-transport methods struggle with restrictive assumptions, poor generalization, and scalability, necessitating a more flexible and scalable solution.

Method: GSBoG uses a likelihood optimization approach to learn trajectory-level policies, avoiding dense global solvers and optimizing intermediate behavior under state costs.

Result: GSBoG reliably learns accurate, topology-respecting policies and optimizes intermediate state costs on real-world graphs.

Conclusion: GSBoG offers a scalable, cost-aware solution for dynamical transport on graphs, broadening applicability.

Abstract: Transportation on graphs is a fundamental challenge across many domains, where decisions must respect topological and operational constraints. Despite the need for actionable policies, existing graph-transport methods lack this expressivity. They rely on restrictive assumptions, fail to generalize across sparse topologies, and scale poorly with graph size and time horizon. To address these issues, we introduce Generalized Schrödinger Bridge on Graphs (GSBoG), a novel scalable data-driven framework for learning executable controlled continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) policies on arbitrary graphs under state cost augmented dynamics. Notably, GSBoG learns trajectory-level policies, avoiding dense global solvers and thereby enhancing scalability. This is achieved via a likelihood optimization approach, satisfying the endpoint marginals, while simultaneously optimizing intermediate behavior under state-dependent running costs. Extensive experimentation on challenging real-world graph topologies shows that GSBoG reliably learns accurate, topology-respecting policies while optimizing application-specific intermediate state costs, highlighting its broad applicability and paving new avenues for cost-aware dynamical transport on general graphs.

*Zhen Zhou,Zhirui Wang,Qi Hong,Yunyang Shi,Ziyuan Gu,Zhiyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Multi-Expert Learning Distributional Labels (LDL) framework is proposed for time series forecasting, balancing accuracy and interpretable uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods lack robust uncertainty quantification, and existing probabilistic approaches struggle with efficiency and interpretability. The need for high accuracy and interpretability in real-world applications drives this work.

Method: Introduced two methods: Multi-Expert LDL for capturing diverse temporal patterns and Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE for decomposing time series into interpretable components (trend, seasonality, etc.). Both use distributional learning for uncertainty quantification via Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD).

Result: Tested on M5 sales data, showing superior performance over baselines. Multi-Expert LDL excels in overall performance, while Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE enhances interpretability through component analysis.

Conclusion: The frameworks effectively balance accuracy and interpretability, making them suitable for real-world forecasting where actionable insights are key.

Abstract: Time series forecasting in real-world applications requires both high predictive accuracy and interpretable uncertainty quantification. Traditional point prediction methods often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in time series data, while existing probabilistic approaches struggle to balance computational efficiency with interpretability. We propose a novel Multi-Expert Learning Distributional Labels (LDL) framework that addresses these challenges through mixture-of-experts architectures with distributional learning capabilities. Our approach introduces two complementary methods: (1) Multi-Expert LDL, which employs multiple experts with different learned parameters to capture diverse temporal patterns, and (2) Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE, which explicitly decomposes time series into interpretable components (trend, seasonality, changepoints, volatility) through specialized sub-experts. Both frameworks extend traditional point prediction to distributional learning, enabling rich uncertainty quantification through Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We evaluate our methods on aggregated sales data derived from the M5 dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline approaches. The continuous Multi-Expert LDL achieves the best overall performance, while the Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE provides enhanced interpretability through component-wise analysis. Our frameworks successfully balance predictive accuracy with interpretability, making them suitable for real-world forecasting applications where both performance and actionable insights are crucial.

*Mahima Lakra,Ronan Fablet,Lucas Drumetz,Etienne Pauthenet,Elodie Martinez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study demonstrates that deep learning models, particularly UNet, can effectively predict phytoplankton biomass distributions using satellite and environmental data, with UNet outperforming other architectures. An auto-regressive UNet version improves short-term forecasts but declines over longer periods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately simulating phytoplankton dynamics is challenging due to limited data and oceanic complexity. Deep learning offers a solution to these limitations.

Method: The study tests deep learning architectures (UNet, CNNs, ConvLSTM, 4CastNet) using satellite and environmental data, and evaluates an auto-regressive UNet for temporal predictions.

Result: UNet accurately reproduces phytoplankton biomass patterns but underestimates low-frequency changes. Auto-regressive UNet performs well for short-term forecasts (up to five months).

Conclusion: Deep learning models combined with ocean data can reconstruct and predict phytoplankton dynamics, aiding ocean health monitoring and ecosystem management amidst climate change.

Abstract: Phytoplankton is the basis of marine food webs, driving both ecological processes and global biogeochemical cycles. Despite their ecological and climatic significance, accurately simulating phytoplankton dynamics remains a major challenge for biogeochemical numerical models due to limited parameterizations, sparse observational data, and the complexity of oceanic processes. Here, we explore how deep learning models can be used to address these limitations predicting the spatio-temporal distribution of phytoplankton biomass in the global ocean based on satellite observations and environmental conditions. First, we investigate several deep learning architectures. Among the tested models, the UNet architecture stands out for its ability to reproduce the seasonal and interannual patterns of phytoplankton biomass more accurately than other models like CNNs, ConvLSTM, and 4CastNet. When using one to two months of environmental data as input, UNet performs better, although it tends to underestimate the amplitude of low-frequency changes in phytoplankton biomass. Thus, to improve predictions over time, an auto-regressive version of UNet was also tested, where the model uses its own previous predictions to forecast future conditions. This approach works well for short-term forecasts (up to five months), though its performance decreases for longer time scales. Overall, our study shows that combining ocean physical predictors with deep learning allows for reconstruction and short-term prediction of phytoplankton dynamics. These models could become powerful tools for monitoring ocean health and supporting marine ecosystem management, especially in the context of climate change.

*Andreas Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes limitations of MPNNs, identifying SCA and CD as key issues, and proposes frameworks (MRS, MIMO-GC, LMGC) and a PageRank-inspired variant to mitigate these problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented understanding and theoretical gaps limiting MPNN performance in real-world applications.

Method: Theoretical analysis identifies SCA and CD, leading to frameworks like MRS and MIMO-GC, and a PageRank-inspired variant for CD.

Result: Improved understanding of MPNN limitations (e.g., rank collapse) and solutions to avoid SCA/CD, enhancing performance.

Conclusion: The findings deepen MPNN theory, enabling targeted solutions and better communication in the field.

Abstract: While message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) have shown promising results, their real-world impact remains limited. Although various limitations have been identified, their theoretical foundations remain poorly understood, leading to fragmented research efforts. In this thesis, we provide an in-depth theoretical analysis and identify several key properties limiting the performance of MPNNs. Building on these findings, we propose several frameworks that address these shortcomings. We identify two properties exhibited by many MPNNs: shared component amplification (SCA), where each message-passing iteration amplifies the same components across all feature channels, and component dominance (CD), where a single component gets increasingly amplified as more message-passing steps are applied. These properties lead to the observable phenomenon of rank collapse of node representations, which generalizes the established over-smoothing phenomenon. By generalizing and decomposing over-smoothing, we enable a deeper understanding of MPNNs, more targeted solutions, and more precise communication within the field. To avoid SCA, we show that utilizing multiple computational graphs or edge relations is necessary. Our multi-relational split (MRS) framework transforms any existing MPNN into one that leverages multiple edge relations. Additionally, we introduce the spectral graph convolution for multiple feature channels (MIMO-GC), which naturally uses multiple computational graphs. A localized variant, LMGC, approximates the MIMO-GC while inheriting its beneficial properties. To address CD, we demonstrate a close connection between MPNNs and the PageRank algorithm. Based on personalized PageRank, we propose a variant of MPNNs that allows for infinitely many message-passing iterations, while preserving initial node features. Collectively, these results deepen the theoretical understanding of MPNNs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses multi-horizon time-series forecasting with abstention, proposing three abstention strategies tailored for structured predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mispredictions in multi-horizon forecasting can be costly and reduce trust, necessitating better abstention strategies.

Method: The authors formalize abstention for multi-horizon forecasting, propose three abstention notions, derive optimal strategies, and implement them.

Result: Experiments on 24 datasets show the proposed algorithms outperform existing baselines.

Conclusion: The structured nature of multi-horizon forecasting enables richer abstention strategies, improving prediction reliability.

Abstract: Multi-horizon time-series forecasting involves simultaneously making predictions for a consecutive sequence of subsequent time steps. This task arises in many application domains, such as healthcare and finance, where mispredictions can have a high cost and reduce trust. The learning with abstention framework tackles these problems by allowing a model to abstain from offering a prediction when it is at an elevated risk of making a misprediction. Unfortunately, existing abstention strategies are ill-suited for the multi-horizon setting: they target problems where a model offers a single prediction for each instance. Hence, they ignore the structured and correlated nature of the predictions offered by a multi-horizon forecaster. We formalize the problem of learning with abstention for multi-horizon forecasting setting and show that its structured nature admits a richer set of abstention problems. Concretely, we propose three natural notions of how a model could abstain for multi-horizon forecasting. We theoretically analyze each problem to derive the optimal abstention strategy and propose an algorithm that implements it. Extensive evaluation on 24 datasets shows that our proposed algorithms significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inconsistency of PPG-based blood pressure models in meeting clinical standards by introducing a standardized dataset (NBPDB) and improving model accuracy with demographic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PPG-based blood pressure models fail to meet clinical accuracy standards (AAMI/ISO 81060-2) due to heterogeneous datasets and lack of physiological controls.

Method: Created a standardized benchmarking dataset (NBPDB) from MIMIC-III and VitalDB, tested state-of-the-art models, and enhanced them by adding demographic data (age, sex, BMI).

Result: No existing models met clinical standards initially; modified models, especially MInception, improved accuracy (23% error reduction) and met AAMI/ISO limits.

Conclusion: Demographic data significantly enhances PPG-based blood pressure model accuracy, bridging the gap to clinical practicality.

Abstract: Cuffless blood pressure screening based on easily acquired photoplethysmography (PPG) signals offers a practical pathway toward scalable cardiovascular health assessment. Despite rapid progress, existing PPG-based blood pressure estimation models have not consistently achieved the established clinical numerical limits such as AAMI/ISO 81060-2, and prior evaluations often lack the rigorous experimental controls necessary for valid clinical assessment. Moreover, the publicly available datasets commonly used are heterogeneous and lack physiologically controlled conditions for fair benchmarking. To enable fair benchmarking under physiologically controlled conditions, we created a standardized benchmarking subset NBPDB comprising 101,453 high-quality PPG segments from 1,103 healthy adults, derived from MIMIC-III and VitalDB. Using this dataset, we systematically benchmarked several state-of-the-art PPG-based models. The results showed that none of the evaluated models met the AAMI/ISO 81060-2 accuracy requirements (mean error $<$ 5 mmHg and standard deviation $<$ 8 mmHg). To improve model accuracy, we modified these models and added patient demographic data such as age, sex, and body mass index as additional inputs. Our modifications consistently improved performance across all models. In particular, the MInception model reduced error by 23\% after adding the demographic data and yielded mean absolute errors of 4.75 mmHg (SBP) and 2.90 mmHg (DBP), achieves accuracy comparable to the numerical limits defined by AAMI/ISO accuracy standards. Our results show that existing PPG-based BP estimation models lack clinical practicality under standardized conditions, while incorporating demographic information markedly improves their accuracy and physiological validity.

TL;DR: DMFlow is a generative framework for disordered crystals, introducing unified representations and a flow matching model to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the neglect of disordered materials in deep generative models.

Method: Uses Riemannian flow matching with spherical reparameterization and a specialized GNN.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CSP and DNG tasks.

Conclusion: Provides a foundation for AI-driven discovery of disordered materials.

Abstract: The design of materials with tailored properties is crucial for technological progress. However, most deep generative models focus exclusively on perfectly ordered crystals, neglecting the important class of disordered materials. To address this gap, we introduce DMFlow, a generative framework specifically designed for disordered crystals. Our approach introduces a unified representation for ordered, Substitutionally Disordered (SD), and Positionally Disordered (PD) crystals, and employs a flow matching model to jointly generate all structural components. A key innovation is a Riemannian flow matching framework with spherical reparameterization, which ensures physically valid disorder weights on the probability simplex. The vector field is learned by a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) that incorporates physical symmetries and a specialized message-passing scheme. Finally, a two-stage discretization procedure converts the continuous weights into multi-hot atomic assignments. To support research in this area, we release a benchmark containing SD, PD, and mixed structures curated from the Crystallography Open Database. Experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and De Novo Generation (DNG) tasks demonstrate that DMFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines adapted from ordered crystal generation. We hope our work provides a foundation for the AI-driven discovery of disordered materials.

TL;DR: The paper introduces rationality measures for RL agents, defining rational actions and risks, and decomposing risks into extrinsic and intrinsic components. It provides theoretical bounds and validates hypotheses with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the overlooked yet critical property of rationality in RL agents, ensuring actions maximize true value functions effectively.

Method: The method involves defining rational actions, expected rational risk, and rational risk gap, decomposing it into extrinsic and intrinsic components with theoretical bounds.

Result: Results show empirical validation of hypotheses regarding regularisers, domain randomisation benefits, and harms from environment shifts.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the framework's effectiveness in measuring and improving RL agent rationality, supported by theory and experiments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a suite of rationality measures and associated theory for reinforcement learning agents, a property increasingly critical yet rarely explored. We define an action in deployment to be perfectly rational if it maximises the hidden true value function in the steepest direction. The expected value discrepancy of a policy's actions against their rational counterparts, culminating over the trajectory in deployment, is defined to be expected rational risk; an empirical average version in training is also defined. Their difference, termed as rational risk gap, is decomposed into (1) an extrinsic component caused by environment shifts between training and deployment, and (2) an intrinsic one due to the algorithm's generalisability in a dynamic environment. They are upper bounded by, respectively, (1) the $1$-Wasserstein distance between transition kernels and initial state distributions in training and deployment, and (2) the empirical Rademacher complexity of the value function class. Our theory suggests hypotheses on the benefits from regularisers (including layer normalisation, $\ell_2$ regularisation, and weight normalisation) and domain randomisation, as well as the harm from environment shifts. Experiments are in full agreement with these hypotheses. The code is available at https://github.com/EVIEHub/Rationality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Transformer models attend to certain tokens by analyzing the QK space.

Method: Proposes a contrastive covariance method to break down the QK space into low-rank, interpretable components.

Result: Identifies human-interpretable QK subspaces for semantic and binding features in large language models.

Conclusion: The method successfully attributes attention scores to specific features, enhancing interpretability of Transformer attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Despite the central role of attention heads in Transformers, we lack tools to understand why a model attends to a particular token. To address this, we study the query-key (QK) space -- the bilinear joint embedding space between queries and keys. We present a contrastive covariance method to decompose the QK space into low-rank, human-interpretable components. It is when features in keys and queries align in these low-rank subspaces that high attention scores are produced. We first study our method both analytically and empirically in a simplified setting. We then apply our method to large language models to identify human-interpretable QK subspaces for categorical semantic features and binding features.

### [265] [A Dual-TransUNet Deep Learning Framework for Multi-Source Precipitation Merging and Improving Seasonal and Extreme Estimates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04757)
*Yuchen Ye,Zixuan Qi,Shixuan Li,Wei Qi,Yanpeng Cai,Chaoxia Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DDL-MSPMF, a TransUNet-based framework merging multi-source precipitation data, improving accuracy and extreme-event detection in China.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing biases and limited skill in multi-source precipitation products (MSPs) for hydroclimatic monitoring, especially for extreme events.

Method: A dual-stage TransUNet framework integrates MSPs and ERA5 predictors: a classifier estimates precipitation occurrence, and a regressor fuses data for daily estimates.

Result: DDL-MSPMF outperforms baselines (R=0.75, RMSE=2.70 mm/day), improves extreme-event detection, and works well in data-scarce regions like Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

Conclusion: The framework provides scalable, explainable precipitation fusion with enhanced extreme-event assessment capabilities.

Abstract: Multi-source precipitation products (MSPs) from satellite retrievals and reanalysis are widely used for hydroclimatic monitoring, yet spatially heterogeneous biases and limited skill for extremes still constrain their hydrologic utility. Here we develop a dual-stage TransUNet-based multi-source precipitation merging framework (DDL-MSPMF) that integrates six MSPs with four ERA5 near-surface physical predictors. A first-stage classifier estimates daily precipitation occurrence probability, and a second-stage regressor fuses the classifier outputs together with all predictors to estimate daily precipitation amount at 0.25 degree resolution over China for 2001-2020. Benchmarking against multiple deep learning and hybrid baselines shows that the TransUNet - TransUNet configuration yields the best seasonal performance (R = 0.75; RMSE = 2.70 mm/day) and improves robustness relative to a single-regressor setting. For heavy precipitation (>25 mm/day), DDL-MSPMF increases equitable threat scores across most regions of eastern China and better reproduces the spatial pattern of the July 2021 Zhengzhou rainstorm, indicating enhanced extreme-event detection beyond seasonal-mean corrections. Independent evaluation over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using TPHiPr further supports its applicability in data-scarce regions. SHAP analysis highlights the importance of precipitation occurrence probabilities and surface pressure, providing physically interpretable diagnostics. The proposed framework offers a scalable and explainable approach for precipitation fusion and extreme-event assessment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Improved gradient-variation analysis in Bandit Convex Optimization with two-point feedback, enhancing dimension dependence and enabling broader applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-variation online learning is understudied in bandit feedback settings despite its importance in game theory and optimization.

Method: Refined analysis of non-consecutive gradient variation in BCO with two-point feedback, extending to one-point bandit linear optimization.

Result: Better dimension dependence for convex/strongly convex functions, gradient-variance guarantees, and first gradient-variation bounds for dynamic/universal regret.

Conclusion: The technique's versatility validates effectiveness in dynamic regret, universal regret, and bandit games, broadening practical applications.

Abstract: Gradient-variation online learning has drawn increasing attention due to its deep connections to game theory, optimization, etc. It has been studied extensively in the full-information setting, but is underexplored with bandit feedback. In this work, we focus on gradient variation in Bandit Convex Optimization (BCO) with two-point feedback. By proposing a refined analysis on the non-consecutive gradient variation, a fundamental quantity in gradient variation with bandits, we improve the dimension dependence for both convex and strongly convex functions compared with the best known results (Chiang et al., 2013). Our improved analysis for the non-consecutive gradient variation also implies other favorable problem-dependent guarantees, such as gradient-variance and small-loss regrets. Beyond the two-point setup, we demonstrate the versatility of our technique by achieving the first gradient-variation bound for one-point bandit linear optimization over hyper-rectangular domains. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our results in more challenging tasks such as dynamic/universal regret minimization and bandit games, establishing the first gradient-variation dynamic and universal regret bounds for two-point BCO and fast convergence rates in bandit games.

*Rui Liu,Pratap Tokekar,Ming Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A2MAML is a framework for multi-agent systems that improves robustness by modeling uncertainty at the modality level, actively selecting reliable modalities, and using Bayesian aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems often assume homogeneous sensing and handle uncertainty implicitly, which limits robustness under sensor corruption.

Method: A2MAML models modality-specific features with uncertainty prediction, actively selects reliable agent-modality pairs, and aggregates information via Bayesian inverse-variance weighting.

Result: A2MAML outperforms single-agent and collaborative baselines by up to 18.7% in collaborative accident detection.

Conclusion: A2MAML provides fine-grained, uncertainty-aware modality-level fusion, enhancing robustness and performance in multi-agent scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems are increasingly equipped with heterogeneous multimodal sensors, enabling richer perception but introducing modality-specific and agent-dependent uncertainty. Existing multi-agent collaboration frameworks typically reason at the agent level, assume homogeneous sensing, and handle uncertainty implicitly, limiting robustness under sensor corruption. We propose Active Asymmetric Multi-Agent Multimodal Learning under Uncertainty (A2MAML), a principled approach for uncertainty-aware, modality-level collaboration. A2MAML models each modality-specific feature as a stochastic estimate with uncertainty prediction, actively selects reliable agent-modality pairs, and aggregates information via Bayesian inverse-variance weighting. This formulation enables fine-grained, modality-level fusion, supports asymmetric modality availability, and provides a principled mechanism to suppress corrupted or noisy modalities. Extensive experiments on connected autonomous driving scenarios for collaborative accident detection demonstrate that A2MAML consistently outperforms both single-agent and collaborative baselines, achieving up to 18.7% higher accident detection rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending the success of foundation models from language and vision to graph-structured data, which is critical for many applications, presents unique challenges.

Method: Develops GraphBFF, a flexible and scalable Transformer architecture, with methodologies for data batching, pretraining, and fine-tuning. Introduces neural scaling laws for graphs.

Result: Achieves remarkable zero-shot and probing performance across ten diverse downstream tasks, with improvements up to 31 PRAUC points.

Conclusion: GraphBFF provides a practical foundation for graph learning at scale, though challenges remain for industrial adoption.

Abstract: Graph-structured data underpins many critical applications. While foundation models have transformed language and vision via large-scale pretraining and lightweight adaptation, extending this paradigm to general, real-world graphs is challenging. In this work, we present Graph Billion- Foundation-Fusion (GraphBFF): the first end-to-end recipe for building billion-parameter Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for arbitrary heterogeneous, billion-scale graphs. Central to the recipe is the GraphBFF Transformer, a flexible and scalable architecture designed for practical billion-scale GFMs. Using the GraphBFF, we present the first neural scaling laws for general graphs and show that loss decreases predictably as either model capacity or training data scales, depending on which factor is the bottleneck. The GraphBFF framework provides concrete methodologies for data batching, pretraining, and fine-tuning for building GFMs at scale. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework with an evaluation of a 1.4 billion-parameter GraphBFF Transformer pretrained on one billion samples. Across ten diverse, real-world downstream tasks on graphs unseen during training, spanning node- and link-level classification and regression, GraphBFF achieves remarkable zero-shot and probing performance, including in few-shot settings, with large margins of up to 31 PRAUC points. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open opportunities for making GFMs a practical and principled foundation for graph learning at industrial scale.

TL;DR: NeuroCanvas is a novel framework for efficient seizure detection from EEG signals, addressing channel heterogeneity and computational inefficiency with Entropy-guided Channel Selector and Canvas of Neuron Signal modules, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual EEG review is labor-intensive, and existing LLM-based solutions struggle with multi-channel heterogeneity and computational inefficiency.

Method: NeuroCanvas integrates two modules: ECS selects relevant EEG channels, and CNS converts them into structured visual tokens for LLMs.

Result: NeuroCanvas improves F1 score by 20% and reduces inference latency by 88% across datasets.

Conclusion: NeuroCanvas offers a scalable, efficient solution for real-time seizure detection in clinical settings.

Abstract: Accurate and timely seizure detection from Electroencephalography (EEG) is critical for clinical intervention, yet manual review of long-term recordings is labor-intensive. Recent efforts to encode EEG signals into large language models (LLMs) show promise in handling neural signals across diverse patients, but two significant challenges remain: (1) multi-channel heterogeneity, as seizure-relevant information varies substantially across EEG channels, and (2) computing inefficiency, as the EEG signals need to be encoded into a massive number of tokens for the prediction. To address these issues, we draw the EEG signal and propose the novel NeuroCanvas framework. Specifically, NeuroCanvas consists of two modules: (i) The Entropy-guided Channel Selector (ECS) selects the seizure-relevant channels input to LLM and (ii) the following Canvas of Neuron Signal (CNS) converts selected multi-channel heterogeneous EEG signals into structured visual representations. The ECS module alleviates the multi-channel heterogeneity issue, and the CNS uses compact visual tokens to represent the EEG signals that improve the computing efficiency. We evaluate NeuroCanvas across multiple seizure detection datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement of $20\%$ in F1 score and reductions of $88\%$ in inference latency. These results highlight NeuroCanvas as a scalable and effective solution for real-time and resource-efficient seizure detection in clinical practice.The code will be released at https://github.com/Yanchen30247/seizure_detect.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Team-then-Trim (T²), a framework using LLMs to synthesize high-quality tabular data with a quality control pipeline, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality tabular data is hard to acquire due to labor-intensive processes and issues like class imbalance. T² aims to address these challenges leveraging LLMs.

Method: T² involves specialized LLMs generating tabular data components sequentially, followed by a three-stage quality control pipeline.

Result: Empirical results show T² outperforms state-of-the-art methods in producing high-quality synthetic tabular data.

Conclusion: T² demonstrates potential to support downstream ML models when direct data collection is infeasible.

Abstract: While tabular data is fundamental to many real-world machine learning (ML) applications, acquiring high-quality tabular data is usually labor-intensive and expensive. Limited by the scarcity of observations, tabular datasets often exhibit critical deficiencies, such as class imbalance, selection bias, and low fidelity. To address these challenges, building on recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper introduces Team-then-Trim (T$^2$), a framework that synthesizes high-quality tabular data through a collaborative team of LLMs, followed by a rigorous three-stage plug-in data quality control (QC) pipeline. In T$^2$, tabular data generation is conceptualized as a manufacturing process: specialized LLMs, guided by domain knowledge, are tasked with generating different data components sequentially, and the resulting products, i.e., the synthetic data, are systematically evaluated across multiple dimensions of QC. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that T$^2$ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in producing high-quality tabular data, highlighting its potential to support downstream models when direct data collection is practically infeasible.

### [271] [Beyond Rewards in Reinforcement Learning for Cyber Defence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04809)
*Elizabeth Bates,Chris Hicks,Vasilios Mavroudis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how sparse rewards outperform dense rewards in training autonomous cyber defense agents, offering better reliability, effectiveness, and lower-risk policies without explicit penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interest in autonomous cyber defense agents trained with deep reinforcement learning has grown, but dense reward functions may bias agents toward suboptimal solutions.

Method: The study evaluates sparse and dense reward functions using two cyber gyms, various network sizes, and policy gradient/value-based RL algorithms, aided by a ground truth evaluation approach.

Result: Sparse rewards, if goal-aligned and frequently encountered, enhance training reliability and produce more effective, lower-risk defense policies, even without explicit penalties.

Conclusion: Sparse rewards uniquely improve cyber defense agent performance and policy alignment, suggesting their superiority over dense rewards in complex cyber environments.

Abstract: Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in autonomous cyber defence agents trained to defend computer networks using deep reinforcement learning. These agents are typically trained in cyber gym environments using dense, highly engineered reward functions which combine many penalties and incentives for a range of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Dense rewards help alleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments but risk biasing agents towards suboptimal and potentially riskier solutions, a critical issue in complex cyber environments. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of reward function structure on learning and policy behavioural characteristics using a variety of sparse and dense reward functions, two well-established cyber gyms, a range of network sizes, and both policy gradient and value-based RL algorithms. Our evaluation is enabled by a novel ground truth evaluation approach which allows directly comparing between different reward functions, illuminating the nuanced inter-relationships between rewards, action space and the risks of suboptimal policies in cyber environments. Our results show that sparse rewards, provided they are goal aligned and can be encountered frequently, uniquely offer both enhanced training reliability and more effective cyber defence agents with lower-risk policies. Surprisingly, sparse rewards can also yield policies that are better aligned with cyber defender goals and make sparing use of costly defensive actions without explicit reward-based numerical penalties.

*Yuqi Li,Matthew M. Engelhard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an uncertainty-aware ROC framework for interval-valued predictions with new measures $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$, enabling reliable ranking and selective prediction by addressing predictive uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluation tools like ROC and AUC are limited to point scores and ignore predictive uncertainty, which is critical in high-stakes decision-making.

Method: Proposes a framework with $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$ to decompose the ROC plane into regions for correct, incorrect, and uncertain rankings, supporting selective prediction.

Result: The measures provide formal bounds on the theoretical optimal AUC, validated on real-world datasets using bootstrap-based intervals.

Conclusion: The framework enhances uncertainty-aware evaluation and decision-making, applicable broadly to interval-valued prediction models.

Abstract: In high-stakes risk prediction, quantifying uncertainty through interval-valued predictions is essential for reliable decision-making. However, standard evaluation tools like the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) are designed for point scores and fail to capture the impact of predictive uncertainty on ranking performance. We propose an uncertainty-aware ROC framework specifically for interval-valued predictions, introducing two new measures: $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$. This framework enables an informative three-region decomposition of the ROC plane, partitioning pairwise rankings into correct, incorrect, and uncertain orderings. This approach naturally supports selective prediction by allowing models to abstain from ranking cases with overlapping intervals, thereby optimizing the trade-off between abstention rate and discriminative reliability. We prove that under valid class-conditional coverage, $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$ provide formal lower and upper bounds on the theoretical optimal AUC ($AUC^*$), characterizing the physical limit of achievable discrimination. The proposed framework applies broadly to interval-valued prediction models, regardless of the interval construction method. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets, using bootstrap-based intervals as one instantiation, validate the framework's correctness and demonstrate its practical utility for uncertainty-aware evaluation and decision-making.

*Emil Albrychiewicz,Andrés Franco Valiente,Li-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a theoretical framework for coupled diffusion models, explaining multimodal generation via a spectral hierarchy of interaction timescales and introducing the concept of a 'synchronization gap'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of diffusion models in high-dimensional data synthesis, the theoretical understanding of multimodal generation remains limited. The study aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors use coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and nonequilibrium statistical physics to analyze multimodal generation. They derive analytical conditions for speciation and collapse times under different coupling regimes.

Result: The study identifies a 'synchronization gap' and demonstrates that coupling strength acts as a spectral filter, enforcing a tunable temporal hierarchy. Controlled experiments with MNIST datasets support these findings.

Conclusion: The results suggest time-dependent coupling schedules as a potential alternative to ad hoc guidance tuning, offering theoretical insights into multimodal generation in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion based generative models have achieved unprecedented fidelity in synthesizing high dimensional data, yet the theoretical mechanisms governing multimodal generation remain poorly understood. Here, we present a theoretical framework for coupled diffusion models, using coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes as a tractable model. By using the nonequilibrium statistical physics of dynamical phase transitions, we demonstrate that multimodal generation is governed by a spectral hierarchy of interaction timescales rather than simultaneous resolution. A key prediction is the ``synchronization gap'', a temporal window during the reverse generative process where distinct eigenmodes stabilize at different rates, providing a theoretical explanation for common desynchronization artifacts. We derive analytical conditions for speciation and collapse times under both symmetric and anisotropic coupling regimes, establishing strict bounds for coupling strength to avoid unstable symmetry breaking. We show that the coupling strength acts as a spectral filter that enforces a tunable temporal hierarchy on generation. We support these predictions through controlled experiments with diffusion models trained on MNIST datasets and exact score samplers. These results motivate time dependent coupling schedules that target mode specific timescales, offering a potential alternative to ad hoc guidance tuning.

*Mumin Zhang,Haochen Zhang,Xin Zhi Khoo,Yilin Zhang,Nuo Chen,Ting Zhang,Junjie Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ensemble model, WMF-CPK-MSLMU, for accurate, fast, and robust short-term wind speed prediction in clustered wind farms, leveraging spatial-temporal correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate wind speed prediction is crucial for power system operation, especially with clustered wind farms. Existing methods lack efficiency in capturing spatial-temporal correlations.

Method: The method involves data pre-processing with weighted mean filtering (WMF), forecasting using a multi-slice Legendre memory unit (MSLMU) with CPK-based compensation, and spatial data complementation.

Result: The proposed model outperforms existing methods in short-term wind speed prediction for clustered wind farms, demonstrating higher accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The WMF-CPK-MSLMU model effectively addresses spatial-temporal correlations in wind farm clusters, enhancing prediction accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: With more wind farms clustered for integration, the short-term wind speed prediction of such wind farm clusters is critical for normal operation of power systems. This paper focuses on achieving accurate, fast, and robust wind speed prediction by full use of cluster data with spatial-temporal correlation. First, weighted mean filtering (WMF) is applied to denoise wind speed data at the single-farm level. The Legendre memory unit (LMU) is then innovatively applied for the wind speed prediction, in combination with the Compensating Parameter based on Kendall rank correlation coefficient (CPK) of wind farm cluster data, to construct the multi-slice LMU (MSLMU). Finally, an innovative ensemble model WMF-CPK-MSLMU is proposed herein, with three key blocks: data pre-processing, forecasting, and multi-slice compensation. Advantages include: 1) LMU jointly models linear and nonlinear dependencies among farms to capture spatial-temporal correlations through backpropagation; 2) MSLMU enhances forecasting by using CPK-derived weights instead of random initialization, allowing spatial correlations to fully activate hidden nodes across clustered wind farms.; 3) CPK adaptively weights the compensation model in MSLMU and complements missing data spatially, to facilitate the whole model highly accurate and robust. Test results on different wind farm clusters indicate the effectiveness and superiority of proposed ensemble model WMF-CPK-MSLMU in the short-term prediction of wind farm clusters compared to the existing models.

Motivation: Urban traffic management requires systems that predict, detect anomalies, and act safely with reliability guarantees.

Method: Introduces PU-GAT+ for forecasting, CRFN-BY for anomaly detection, and LyCon-WRL+ for safe policy learning, all with uncertainty propagation and theoretical guarantees.

Result: Achieves 91.4% coverage efficiency, 4.1% FDR control, 95.2% safety rate, and 23ms latency, outperforming standard methods.

Conclusion: STREAM-RL is the first framework with end-to-end uncertainty propagation and theoretical guarantees, demonstrating superior performance in real-world traffic scenarios.

Abstract: Urban traffic management demands systems that simultaneously predict future conditions, detect anomalies, and take safe corrective actions -- all while providing reliability guarantees. We present STREAM-RL, a unified framework that introduces three novel algorithmic contributions: (1) PU-GAT+, an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Conformal Forecaster that uses prediction uncertainty to dynamically reweight graph attention via confidence-monotonic attention, achieving distribution-free coverage guarantees; (2) CRFN-BY, a Conformal Residual Flow Network that models uncertainty-normalized residuals via normalizing flows with Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR control under arbitrary dependence; and (3) LyCon-WRL+, an Uncertainty-Guided Safe World-Model RL agent with Lyapunov stability certificates, certified Lipschitz bounds, and uncertainty-propagated imagination rollouts. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to propagate calibrated uncertainty from forecasting through anomaly detection to safe policy learning with end-to-end theoretical guarantees. Experiments on multiple real-world traffic trajectory data demonstrate that STREAM-RL achieves 91.4\% coverage efficiency, controls FDR at 4.1\% under verified dependence, and improves safety rate to 95.2\% compared to 69\% for standard PPO while achieving higher reward, with 23ms end-to-end inference latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make the information transmitted by attention explicit and measurable in vision transformers, allowing for controllable and analyzable model behavior.

Method: Insert variational information bottlenecks on attention-mediated writes to the residual stream, training models with an explicit information cost.

Result: Achieves a controllable spectrum from independent patch processing to global attention, providing insights into information routing and classification behavior on ImageNet-100.

Conclusion: The approach yields models more tractable for mechanistic analysis and control, enhancing understanding of global visual representation emergence.

Abstract: We make the information transmitted by attention an explicit, measurable quantity in vision transformers. By inserting variational information bottlenecks on all attention-mediated writes to the residual stream -- without other architectural changes -- we train models with an explicit information cost and obtain a controllable spectrum from independent patch processing to fully expressive global attention. On ImageNet-100, we characterize how classification behavior and information routing evolve across this spectrum, and provide initial insights into how global visual representations emerge from local patch processing by analyzing the first attention heads that transmit information. By biasing learning toward solutions with constrained internal communication, our approach yields models that are more tractable for mechanistic analysis and more amenable to control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT) to efficiently evaluate MLIPs' ability to reproduce quantum PES smoothness, addressing limitations of existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for MLIPs are costly and limited to near-equilibrium states, often missing non-smoothness issues.

Method: The BSCT benchmark probes PES via controlled bond deformations, detecting discontinuities and artificial features efficiently.

Result: BSCT correlates with MD stability at lower cost and guides iterative model design, improving MLIP performance.

Conclusion: BSCT serves as a valuable validation and design tool for MLIPs, enhancing their accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) sometimes fail to reproduce the physical smoothness of the quantum potential energy surface (PES), leading to erroneous behavior in downstream simulations that standard energy and force regression evaluations can miss. Existing evaluations, such as microcanonical molecular dynamics (MD), are computationally expensive and primarily probe near-equilibrium states. To improve evaluation metrics for MLIPs, we introduce the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT). This efficient benchmark probes the PES via controlled bond deformations and detects non-smoothness, including discontinuities, artificial minima, and spurious forces, both near and far from equilibrium. We show that BSCT correlates strongly with MD stability while requiring a fraction of the cost of MD. To demonstrate how BSCT can guide iterative model design, we utilize an unconstrained Transformer backbone as a testbed, illustrating how refinements such as a new differentiable $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and temperature-controlled attention reduce artifacts identified by our metric. By optimizing model design systematically based on BSCT, the resulting MLIP simultaneously achieves a low conventional E/F regression error, stable MD simulations, and robust atomistic property predictions. Our results establish BSCT as both a validation metric and as an "in-the-loop" model design proxy that alerts MLIP developers to physical challenges that cannot be efficiently evaluated by current MLIP benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Maximum-Volume NMF (MaxVol NMF), a dual approach to Minimum-Volume NMF (MinVol NMF), maximizing the volume of matrix H instead of minimizing W. It shows better performance in noisy conditions, avoids rank-deficient solutions, and extracts sparser decompositions. Two algorithms are proposed, along with a normalized variant improving performance further. Applications include hyperspectral unmixing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of MinVol NMF by exploring its dual approach, MaxVol NMF, which offers improved interpretability, uniqueness, and robustness against noise, particularly in sparse decompositions.

Method: The method involves developing MaxVol NMF, which maximizes the volume of H instead of minimizing W. The paper proposes two algorithms for solving MaxVol NMF and introduces a normalized variant bridging standard and orthogonal NMF.

Result: MaxVol NMF outperforms MinVol NMF in noisy scenarios, avoids rank-deficient solutions, and extracts sparser decompositions. The normalized variant shows better performance than both standard NMF and MaxVol NMF.

Conclusion: MaxVol NMF and its normalized variant provide effective alternatives to MinVol NMF, offering enhanced performance, interpretability, and robustness, particularly in applications like hyperspectral unmixing.

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular data embedding technique. Given a nonnegative data matrix $X$, it aims at finding two lower dimensional matrices, $W$ and $H$, such that $X\approx WH$, where the factors $W$ and $H$ are constrained to be element-wise nonnegative. The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF). MaxVol NMF is identifiable under the same conditions as MinVol NMF in the noiseless case, but it behaves rather differently in the presence of noise. In practice, MaxVol NMF is much more effective to extract a sparse decomposition and does not generate rank-deficient solutions. In fact, we prove that the solutions of MaxVol NMF with the largest volume correspond to clustering the columns of $X$ in disjoint clusters, while the solutions of MinVol NMF with smallest volume are rank deficient. We propose two algorithms to solve MaxVol NMF. We also present a normalized variant of MaxVol NMF that exhibits better performance than MinVol NMF and MaxVol NMF, and can be interpreted as a continuum between standard NMF and orthogonal NMF. We illustrate our results in the context of hyperspectral unmixing.

TL;DR: Afferent Learning produces Computational Afferent Traces (CATs) as adaptive risk signals for damage-avoidance learning, using evolutionary optimization and reinforcement learning to improve efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by biological systems and aims to formalize afferent sensing as an inductive bias for efficient learning, particularly in long-term biomechanical contexts.

Method: The framework employs a two-level architecture: evolutionary optimization (outer loop) designs sensing architectures, while reinforcement learning (inner loop) trains policies using these signals.

Result: CAT-based architectures outperform hand-designed baselines, achieving 23% fewer high-risk actions and better age-robustness.

Conclusion: Afferent Learning enhances damage-avoidance policies by leveraging evolved sensing architectures, validated by ablation studies and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We introduce Afferent Learning, a framework that produces Computational Afferent Traces (CATs) as adaptive, internal risk signals for damage-avoidance learning. Inspired by biological systems, the framework uses a two-level architecture: evolutionary optimization (outer loop) discovers afferent sensing architectures that enable effective policy learning, while reinforcement learning (inner loop) trains damage-avoidance policies using these signals. This formalizes afferent sensing as providing an inductive bias for efficient learning: architectures are selected based on their ability to enable effective learning (rather than directly minimizing damage). We provide theoretical convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded-noise assumptions. We illustrate the general approach in the challenging context of biomechanical digital twins operating over long time horizons (multiple decades of the life-course). Here, we find that CAT-based evolved architectures achieve significantly higher efficiency and better age-robustness than hand-designed baselines, enabling policies that exhibit age-dependent behavioral adaptation (23% reduction in high-risk actions). Ablation studies validate CAT signals, evolution, and predictive discrepancy as essential. We release code and data for reproducibility.

Method: Developed CRoSS benchmarks using Gazebo simulator with two robotic platforms: a differential-drive robot for line-following/object-pushing and a robotic arm for goal-reaching tasks. Includes kinematics-only variants for faster simulation.

Result: CRoSS offers scalable, reproducible benchmarks with realistic sensors and performance reports of standard RL algorithms like DQN and policy gradient methods.

Conclusion: CRoSS is a valuable tool for advancing continual RL research in robotics, combining realism, extensibility, and ease of use.

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) requires agents to learn from a sequence of tasks without forgetting previously acquired policies. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark suite for CRL based on realistically simulated robots in the Gazebo simulator. Our Continual Robotic Simulation Suite (CRoSS) benchmarks rely on two robotic platforms: a two-wheeled differential-drive robot with lidar, camera and bumper sensor, and a robotic arm with seven joints. The former represent an agent in line-following and object-pushing scenarios, where variation of visual and structural parameters yields a large number of distinct tasks, whereas the latter is used in two goal-reaching scenarios with high-level cartesian hand position control (modeled after the Continual World benchmark), and low-level control based on joint angles. For the robotic arm benchmarks, we provide additional kinematics-only variants that bypass the need for physical simulation (as long as no sensor readings are required), and which can be run two orders of magnitude faster. CRoSS is designed to be easily extensible and enables controlled studies of continual reinforcement learning in robotic settings with high physical realism, and in particular allow the use of almost arbitrary simulated sensors. To ensure reproducibility and ease of use, we provide a containerized setup (Apptainer) that runs out-of-the-box, and report performances of standard RL algorithms, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and policy gradient methods. This highlights the suitability as a scalable and reproducible benchmark for CRL research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance robustness and generalization in predicting links within heterogeneous legal citation networks.

Method: Incorporates edge dropout and feature concatenation for robust representations, and multilingual node features with an asymmetric decoder for compatibility.

Result: Error rates reduced by up to 45%, with improved inductive transferability between disjoint legal systems.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptations significantly improve link prediction performance and generalization across diverse legal systems.

Abstract: Recent work has applied link prediction to large heterogeneous legal citation networks \new{with rich meta-features}. We find that this approach can be improved by including edge dropout and feature concatenation for the learning of more robust representations, which reduces error rates by up to 45%. We also propose an approach based on multilingual node features with an improved asymmetric decoder for compatibility, which allows us to generalize and extend the prediction to more, geographically and linguistically disjoint, data from New Zealand. Our adaptations also improve inductive transferability between these disjoint legal systems.

TL;DR: The paper discusses contrastive continual learning (CCL) for IoT, addressing challenges like dynamic environments, TinyML constraints, and privacy, while proposing solutions and highlighting open challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT operates in dynamic, nonstationary environments with challenges like sensor drift and evolving user behavior. Continual learning (CL) and contrastive learning are combined to enhance adaptation and robustness.

Method: The paper reviews CCL for IoT, connects algorithmic designs with IoT system realities, and proposes a unifying problem formulation, objectives blending contrastive/distillation losses, and an IoT-oriented architecture.

Result: A reference architecture for on-device, edge, and cloud-based CCL is presented, along with evaluation protocols and metrics.

Conclusion: Open challenges for IoT-specific CCL include handling tabular/streaming data, concept drift, federated settings, and energy-aware training.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) deployments operate in nonstationary, dynamic environments where factors such as sensor drift, evolving user behavior, and heterogeneous user privacy requirements can affect application utility. Continual learning (CL) addresses this by adapting models over time without catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful representation-learning paradigm that improves robustness and sample efficiency in a self-supervised manner. This paper reviews the usage of \emph{contrastive continual learning} (CCL) for IoT, connecting algorithmic design (replay, regularization, distillation, prompts) with IoT system realities (TinyML constraints, intermittent connectivity, privacy). We present a unifying problem formulation, derive common objectives that blend contrastive and distillation losses, propose an IoT-oriented reference architecture for on-device, edge, and cloud-based CCL, and provide guidance on evaluation protocols and metrics. Finally, we highlight open unique challenges with respect to the IoT domain, such as spanning tabular and streaming IoT data, concept drift, federated settings, and energy-aware training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAR is a multi-scale autoregressive framework for protein backbone generation, using coarse-to-fine prediction, autoregressive transformers, and flow-based decoders, with techniques to address exposure bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating high-quality protein backbones by leveraging the hierarchical nature of proteins and overcoming exposure bias.

Method: PAR employs multi-scale downsampling, autoregressive transformers for encoding, and flow-based decoders, supplemented by noisy context learning and scheduled sampling.

Result: PAR achieves robust backbone generation, strong zero-shot generalization, and high-quality designs on unconditional benchmarks.

Conclusion: PAR is a scalable and effective framework for protein structure generation, offering flexibility and quality improvements.

Abstract: We present protein autoregressive modeling (PAR), the first multi-scale autoregressive framework for protein backbone generation via coarse-to-fine next-scale prediction. Using the hierarchical nature of proteins, PAR generates structures that mimic sculpting a statue, forming a coarse topology and refining structural details over scales. To achieve this, PAR consists of three key components: (i) multi-scale downsampling operations that represent protein structures across multiple scales during training; (ii) an autoregressive transformer that encodes multi-scale information and produces conditional embeddings to guide structure generation; (iii) a flow-based backbone decoder that generates backbone atoms conditioned on these embeddings. Moreover, autoregressive models suffer from exposure bias, caused by the training and the generation procedure mismatch, and substantially degrades structure generation quality. We effectively alleviate this issue by adopting noisy context learning and scheduled sampling, enabling robust backbone generation. Notably, PAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, supporting flexible human-prompted conditional generation and motif scaffolding without requiring fine-tuning. On the unconditional generation benchmark, PAR effectively learns protein distributions and produces backbones of high design quality, and exhibits favorable scaling behavior. Together, these properties establish PAR as a promising framework for protein structure generation.

### [284] [The Key to State Reduction in Linear Attention: A Rank-based Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04852)
*Philipp Nazari,T. Konstantin Rusch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the low-rank structure in linear attention models, linking it to increased query noise and proposing a hardware-aware pruning method to reduce state size without significant performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear attention models underexploit their capacity due to low-rank states, which amplify query noise. The study aims to address this inefficiency.

Method: A hardware-aware approach prunes key and query matrices, using adapted pruning strategies and a novel rank-revealing QR decomposition method.

Result: Empirical results show removing 50% of query and key channels causes only marginal perplexity increases, improving efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively reduces state size in linear attention models, maintaining performance while enhancing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Linear attention offers a computationally efficient yet expressive alternative to softmax attention. However, recent empirical results indicate that the state of trained linear attention models often exhibits a low-rank structure, suggesting that these models underexploit their capacity in practice. To illuminate this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis of the role of rank in linear attention, revealing that low effective rank can affect retrieval error by amplifying query noise. In addition to these theoretical insights, we conjecture that the low-rank states can be substantially reduced post-training with only minimal performance degradation, yielding faster and more memory-efficient models. To this end, we propose a novel hardware-aware approach that structurally prunes key and query matrices, reducing the state size while retaining compatibility with existing CUDA kernels. We adapt several existing pruning strategies to fit our framework and, building on our theoretical analysis, propose a novel structured pruning method based on a rank-revealing QR decomposition. Our empirical results, evaluated across models of varying sizes and on various downstream tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of our state reduction framework. We highlight that our framework enables the removal of 50% of the query and key channels at only a marginal increase in perplexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) training faces issues like high communication costs, load imbalance, and metadata exchange. Multi-Head LatentMoE with Head Parallel (HP) addresses these, offering O(1) communication cost, balanced traffic, and deterministic communication, improving training speed by 1.61×.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are costly to train. Existing Expert Parallel (EP) methods for MoE suffer from scalability issues, high communication costs, and load imbalance, limiting efficiency.

Method: Proposes Multi-Head LatentMoE and Head Parallel (HP), featuring IO-aware routing and expert computation. This achieves O(1) communication cost, balanced traffic, and deterministic communication.

Result: Multi-Head LatentMoE with HP trains up to 1.61× faster than MoE with EP while maintaining identical performance. With doubled granularity, it further improves performance and remains 1.11× faster.

Conclusion: The method enhances the efficiency of training multi-billion-parameter foundation models, making large-scale research more accessible.

Abstract: Large language models have transformed many applications but remain expensive to train. Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) addresses this through conditional computation, with Expert Parallel (EP) as the standard distributed training method. However, EP has three limitations: communication cost grows linearly with the number of activated experts $k$, load imbalance affects latency and memory usage, and data-dependent communication requires metadata exchange. We propose Multi-Head LatentMoE and Head Parallel (HP), a new architecture and parallelism achieving $O(1)$ communication cost regardless of $k$, completely balanced traffic, and deterministic communication, all while remaining compatible with EP. To accelerate Multi-Head LatentMoE, we propose IO-aware routing and expert computation. Compared to MoE with EP, Multi-Head LatentMoE with HP trains up to $1.61\times$ faster while having identical performance. With doubled granularity, it achieves higher overall performance while still being $1.11\times$ faster. Our method makes multi-billion-parameter foundation model research more accessible.

### [286] [Knowledge Model Prompting Increases LLM Performance on Planning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03900)
*Erik Goh,John Kos,Ashok Goel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using the TMK framework to enhance LLM reasoning, showing significant improvement in planning tasks compared to traditional methods like CoT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address LLMs' limitations in reasoning and planning by leveraging the TMK framework, which offers structured task decomposition and causal reasoning.

Method: The TMK framework is applied to the PlanBench benchmark, specifically the Blocksworld domain, to evaluate its impact on LLM reasoning and planning.

Result: TMK prompting boosted accuracy from 31.5% to 97.3% in symbolic tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in bridging semantic and symbolic reasoning gaps.

Conclusion: TMK not only provides context but also guides LLMs toward formal reasoning pathways, offering a promising solution for improving their reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) can struggle with reasoning ability and planning tasks. Many prompting techniques have been developed to assist with LLM reasoning, notably Chain-of-Thought (CoT); however, these techniques, too, have come under scrutiny as LLMs' ability to reason at all has come into question. Borrowing from the domain of cognitive and educational science, this paper investigates whether the Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) framework can improve LLM reasoning capabilities beyond its previously demonstrated success in educational applications. The TMK framework's unique ability to capture causal, teleological, and hierarchical reasoning structures, combined with its explicit task decomposition mechanisms, makes it particularly well-suited for addressing language model reasoning deficiencies, and unlike other hierarchical frameworks such as HTN and BDI, TMK provides explicit representations of not just what to do and how to do it, but also why actions are taken. The study evaluates TMK by experimenting on the PlanBench benchmark, focusing on the Blocksworld domain to test for reasoning and planning capabilities, examining whether TMK-structured prompting can help language models better decompose complex planning problems into manageable sub-tasks. Results also highlight significant performance inversion in reasoning models. TMK prompting enables the reasoning model to achieve up to an accuracy of 97.3\% on opaque, symbolic tasks (Random versions of Blocksworld in PlanBench) where it previously failed (31.5\%), suggesting the potential to bridge the gap between semantic approximation and symbolic manipulation. Our findings suggest that TMK functions not merely as context, but also as a mechanism that steers reasoning models away from their default linguistic modes to engage formal, code-execution pathways in the context of the experiments.

TL;DR: IIPC is a new method combining iterative program refinement with LLMs' Chain-of-thought reasoning, outperforming existing approaches in mathematical problem-solving benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of reliably revisable reasoning representations in current multi-agent LLM systems, which hinder symbolic reasoning accuracy.

Method: Introduces Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC), refining programmatic reasoning chains iteratively and combining execution feedback with Chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: IIPC surpasses competing methods in most reasoning benchmarks across multiple base LLMs.

Conclusion: IIPC effectively enhances mathematical reasoning by integrating iterative refinement and execution feedback, with code released openly.

Abstract: Mathematical problem solving is a fundamental benchmark for assessing the reasoning capabilities of artificial intelligence and a gateway to applications in education, science, and engineering where reliable symbolic reasoning is essential. Although recent advances in multi-agent LLM-based systems have enhanced their mathematical reasoning capabilities, they still lack a reliably revisable representation of the reasoning process. Existing agents either operate in rigid sequential pipelines that cannot correct earlier steps or rely on heuristic self-evaluation that can fail to identify and fix errors. In addition, programmatic context can distract language models and degrade accuracy. To address these gaps, we introduce Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC), a reasoning method that iteratively refines programmatic reasoning chains and combines execution feedback with the native Chain-of-thought abilities of the base LLM to maintain high-level contextual focus. IIPC surpasses competing approaches in the majority of reasoning benchmarks on multiple base LLMs. All code and implementations are released as open source.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost and error propagation of LLM multi-agent systems by distilling their interactions into a single model.

Method: Proposes three hierarchical distillation strategies: reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning, trajectory-based augmentation, and process-aware distillation.

Result: Distilled models maintain efficiency while showing strong reasoning, self-correction, robustness, and generalization.

Conclusion: AgentArk offers a promising approach for efficient and robust multi-agent development, shifting computational burden to training.

Abstract: While large language model (LLM) multi-agent systems achieve superior reasoning performance through iterative debate, practical deployment is limited by their high computational cost and error propagation. This paper proposes AgentArk, a novel framework to distill multi-agent dynamics into the weights of a single model, effectively transforming explicit test-time interactions into implicit model capabilities. This equips a single agent with the intelligence of multi-agent systems while remaining computationally efficient. Specifically, we investigate three hierarchical distillation strategies across various models, tasks, scaling, and scenarios: reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning; trajectory-based augmentation; and process-aware distillation. By shifting the burden of computation from inference to training, the distilled models preserve the efficiency of one agent while exhibiting strong reasoning and self-correction performance of multiple agents. They further demonstrate enhanced robustness and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. We hope this work can shed light on future research on efficient and robust multi-agent development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AEC introduces an epistemic-categorical planning layer for partial observability, balancing environment queries with belief simulations to improve efficiency and success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planning in partially observable environments is difficult due to unknown task-critical preconditions and costly grounding through interaction.

Method: AEC combines model-based belief management with categorical feasibility checks, separating grounded facts for commitment from beliefs for pruning. It queries the environment or simulates predicates based on uncertainty.

Result: AEC outperforms LLM-agent baselines in ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, achieving competitive success with fewer replanning rounds.

Conclusion: AEC effectively manages uncertainty and improves planning efficiency in interactive environments.

Abstract: Planning in interactive environments is challenging under partial observability: task-critical preconditions (e.g., object locations or container states) may be unknown at decision time, yet grounding them through interaction is costly. Learned world models can cheaply predict missing facts, but prediction errors can silently induce infeasible commitments. We present \textbf{Active Epistemic Control (AEC)}, an epistemic-categorical planning layer that integrates model-based belief management with categorical feasibility checks. AEC maintains a strict separation between a \emph{grounded fact store} used for commitment and a \emph{belief store} used only for pruning candidate plans. At each step, it either queries the environment to ground an unresolved predicate when uncertainty is high or predictions are ambiguous, or simulates the predicate to filter hypotheses when confidence is sufficient. Final commitment is gated by grounded precondition coverage and an SQ-BCP pullback-style compatibility check, so simulated beliefs affect efficiency but cannot directly certify feasibility. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld show that AEC achieves competitive success with fewer replanning rounds than strong LLM-agent baselines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a selective verification framework for LLM reasoning to reduce redundant verifier calls, achieving higher accuracy with fewer verifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time computation in LLM reasoning is bottlenecked by expensive verification, especially for redundant or unpromising hypotheses.

Method: Introduces a state-level selective verification framework combining deterministic feasibility gating, pre-verification ranking, and adaptive verifier allocation.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy than baseline methods (best-of-N, majority voting, beam search) while reducing verifier calls by 44%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework efficiently allocates verification effort, improving reasoning performance and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Test-time computation has become a primary driver of progress in large language model (LLM) reasoning, but it is increasingly bottlenecked by expensive verification. In many reasoning systems, a large fraction of verifier calls are spent on redundant or unpromising intermediate hypotheses. We study reasoning under a \emph{verification-cost-limited} setting and ask how verification effort should be allocated across intermediate states. We propose a state-level selective verification framework that combines (i) deterministic feasibility gating over a structured move interface, (ii) pre-verification ranking using a hybrid of learned state-distance and residual scoring, and (iii) adaptive allocation of verifier calls based on local uncertainty. Unlike solution-level best-of-$N$ or uniform intermediate verification, our method distributes verification where it is most informative. On the \textsc{MATH} benchmark, our approach achieves higher accuracy than best-of-$N$, majority voting, and beam search while using 44\% fewer verifier calls.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Monitorability of CoT traces in LRMs varies, influenced by data diversity and instruction-following data during RLVR training, but improvements in reasoning don't guarantee transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions under which monitorability of CoT traces in LRMs improves or fails during RLVR training.

Method: Systematic evaluation across model families and training domains, focusing on data diversity and instruction-following data. Mechanistic analysis was conducted to attribute monitorability gains.

Result: Monitorability improvements are data-dependent, driven by entropy reduction and prompt attention, not reasoning capability. Dynamics vary with training and evaluation difficulty.

Conclusion: Monitorability gains under RLVR are not universal; they depend on specific data conditions and training factors, offering insights into when transparency improvements are achievable.

Abstract: As Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are increasingly deployed, auditing their chain-of-thought (CoT) traces for safety becomes critical. Recent work has reported that monitorability--the degree to which CoT faithfully and informatively reflects internal computation--can appear as a "free gift" during the early stages of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We make this observation concrete through a systematic evaluation across model families and training domains. Our results show that this effect is not universal: monitorability improvements are strongly data-dependent. In particular, we demonstrate the critical role of data diversity and instruction-following data during RLVR training. We further show that monitorability is orthogonal to capability--improvements in reasoning performance do not imply increased transparency. Through mechanistic analysis, we attribute monitorability gains primarily to response distribution sharpening (entropy reduction) and increased attention to the prompt, rather than stronger causal reliance on reasoning traces. We also reveal how monitorability dynamics vary with controlled training and evaluation difficulty. Together, these findings provide a holistic view of how monitorability emerges under RLVR, clarifying when gains are likely to occur and when they are not.

TL;DR: PCE framework converts latent LLM assumptions into structured decision trees for uncertainty-aware planning, reducing communication costs and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency and disruption caused by frequent inter-agent communication in multi-agent environments, leveraging LLMs' capabilities.

Method: Introduces Planner-Composer-Evaluator (PCE), which structures LLM reasoning traces into decision trees scored by likelihood, gain, and cost.

Result: PCE outperforms baselines in success rate and task efficiency across benchmarks and LLM backbones, with comparable token usage.

Conclusion: PCE demonstrates structured uncertainty handling complements LLM scaling, improving reliability and human-perceived efficiency.

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in multi-agent, partially observable, and decentralized environments must plan and act despite pervasive uncertainty about hidden objects and collaborators' intentions. Recent advances in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to embodied agents have addressed many long-standing challenges, such as high-level goal decomposition and online adaptation. Yet, uncertainty is still primarily mitigated through frequent inter-agent communication. This incurs substantial token and time costs, and can disrupt established workflows, when human partners are involved. We introduce PCE, a Planner-Composer-Evaluator framework that converts the fragmented assumptions latent in LLM reasoning traces into a structured decision tree. Internal nodes encode environment assumptions and leaves map to actions; each path is then scored by scenario likelihood, goal-directed gain, and execution cost to guide rational action selection without heavy communication. Across two challenging multi-agent benchmarks (C-WAH and TDW-MAT) and three diverse LLM backbones, PCE consistently outperforms communication-centric baselines in success rate and task efficiency while showing comparable token usage. Ablation results indicate that the performance gains obtained by scaling model capacity or reasoning depth persist even when PCE is applied, while PCE consistently raises the baseline across both capacity and reasoning-depth scales, confirming that structured uncertainty handling complements both forms of scaling. A user study further demonstrates that PCE produces communication patterns that human partners perceive as more efficient and trustworthy. Together, these results establish a principled route for turning latent LLM assumptions into reliable strategies for uncertainty-aware planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AEAs manipulate LLM-generated explanations to deceive users into trusting incorrect AI outputs, exploiting cognitive vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how adversarial framing of explanations can exploit human trust in AI systems, particularly in decision-making contexts.

Method: Conducted a controlled experiment (n=205) varying explanation framing dimensions (reasoning mode, evidence type, communication style, presentation format) to measure trust miscalibration.

Result: Adversarial explanations maintained high user trust (~same as benign ones), especially with expert-like framing. Vulnerabilities were highest for hard tasks, fact-driven domains, and less educated/younger/highly trusting users.

Conclusion: AEAs pose a significant threat by exploiting cognitive trust channels, revealing the need for safeguards in AI-human communication.

Abstract: Most adversarial threats in artificial intelligence target the computational behavior of models rather than the humans who rely on them. Yet modern AI systems increasingly operate within human decision loops, where users interpret and act on model recommendations. Large Language Models generate fluent natural-language explanations that shape how users perceive and trust AI outputs, revealing a new attack surface at the cognitive layer: the communication channel between AI and its users. We introduce adversarial explanation attacks (AEAs), where an attacker manipulates the framing of LLM-generated explanations to modulate human trust in incorrect outputs. We formalize this behavioral threat through the trust miscalibration gap, a metric that captures the difference in human trust between correct and incorrect outputs under adversarial explanations. By incorporating this gap, AEAs explore the daunting threats in which persuasive explanations reinforce users' trust in incorrect predictions. To characterize this threat, we conducted a controlled experiment (n = 205), systematically varying four dimensions of explanation framing: reasoning mode, evidence type, communication style, and presentation format. Our findings show that users report nearly identical trust for adversarial and benign explanations, with adversarial explanations preserving the vast majority of benign trust despite being incorrect. The most vulnerable cases arise when AEAs closely resemble expert communication, combining authoritative evidence, neutral tone, and domain-appropriate reasoning. Vulnerability is highest on hard tasks, in fact-driven domains, and among participants who are less formally educated, younger, or highly trusting of AI. This is the first systematic security study that treats explanations as an adversarial cognitive channel and quantifies their impact on human trust in AI-assisted decision making.

TL;DR: WideSeek-R1 is a multi-agent framework using MARL to enhance parallel execution in broad information-seeking tasks, matching single-agent performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs focus on depth scaling; this work explores width scaling via multi-agent systems to handle broader tasks efficiently.

Method: Proposes WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained with MARL, using shared LLMs with isolated contexts and specialized tools.

Result: Achieves 40.0% F1 on WideSearch benchmark, comparable to a single-agent model with fewer parameters; scales well with more subagents.

Conclusion: Width scaling via multi-agent systems is effective for broad tasks, offering scalable performance with parallel execution.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have largely focused on depth scaling, where a single agent solves long-horizon problems with multi-turn reasoning and tool use. However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B. Furthermore, WideSeek-R1-4B exhibits consistent performance gains as the number of parallel subagents increases, highlighting the effectiveness of width scaling.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an axiomatic framework for counterfactual explainers in autonomous systems, identifying five distinct types of counterfactuals and analyzing their properties and computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve trust in autonomous systems by addressing gaps in understanding and generating counterfactual explanations, both locally and globally.

Method: Proposes an axiomatic framework with desirable properties for counterfactual explainers, proving impossibility theorems and establishing representation theorems.

Result: Identifies five fundamentally different types of counterfactuals, some local and others global, and situates existing explainers within this taxonomy.

Conclusion: The framework provides a systematic understanding of counterfactual explanations, enhancing trust and transparency in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Explaining autonomous and intelligent systems is critical in order to improve trust in their decisions. Counterfactuals have emerged as one of the most compelling forms of explanation. They address ``why not'' questions by revealing how decisions could be altered. Despite the growing literature, most existing explainers focus on a single type of counterfactual and are restricted to local explanations, focusing on individual instances. There has been no systematic study of alternative counterfactual types, nor of global counterfactuals that shed light on a system's overall reasoning process.
  This paper addresses the two gaps by introducing an axiomatic framework built on a set of desirable properties for counterfactual explainers. It proves impossibility theorems showing that no single explainer can satisfy certain axiom combinations simultaneously, and fully characterizes all compatible sets. Representation theorems then establish five one-to-one correspondences between specific subsets of axioms and the families of explainers that satisfy them. Each family gives rise to a distinct type of counterfactual explanation, uncovering five fundamentally different types of counterfactuals. Some of these correspond to local explanations, while others capture global explanations. Finally, the framework situates existing explainers within this taxonomy, formally characterizes their behavior, and analyzes the computational complexity of generating such explanations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ORBIT, a framework for training LLMs to improve in-context online learning, showing significant performance gains on unseen tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with online decision-making tasks requiring interaction and delayed feedback, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: ORBIT uses multi-task, multi-episode meta-reinforcement learning to train LLMs for in-context adaptation.

Result: A smaller model trained with ORBIT matches GPT-5.2's performance and outperforms standard RL fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Training LLMs with ORBIT enhances their online learning capabilities, with potential for further improvement through scaling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance when all task-relevant information is available upfront, as in static prediction and instruction-following problems. However, many real-world decision-making tasks are inherently online: crucial information must be acquired through interaction, feedback is delayed, and effective behavior requires balancing information collection and exploitation over time. While in-context learning enables adaptation without weight updates, existing LLMs often struggle to reliably leverage in-context interaction experience in such settings. In this work, we show that this limitation can be addressed through training. We introduce ORBIT, a multi-task, multi-episode meta-reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to learn from interaction in context. After meta-training, a relatively small open-source model (Qwen3-14B) demonstrates substantially improved in-context online learning on entirely unseen environments, matching the performance of GPT-5.2 and outperforming standard RL fine-tuning by a large margin. Scaling experiments further reveal consistent gains with model size, suggesting significant headroom for learn-at-inference-time decision-making agents.

*Harsha Vardhan Khurdula,Vineet Agarwal,Yoeven D Khemlani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Interfaze combines heterogeneous DNNs, small LMs, and tools to build and act over context efficiently, avoiding reliance on monolithic LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLM applications require efficient context handling and action execution, not just monolithic model selection.

Method: Integrates perception modules (DNNs + small LMs), context-construction layer (crawling, indexing), and action layer (browsing, code execution) with a controller managing the stack.

Result: Achieves strong scores on benchmarks like MMLU-Pro (83.6%), MMLU (91.4%), and multimodal tasks (e.g., AI2D at 91.5%), with most queries handled by small models/tools.

Conclusion: Interfaze shifts computation from expensive LLMs to efficient small models/tools while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: We present Interfaze, a system that treats modern LLM applications as a problem of building and acting over context, not just picking the right monolithic model. Instead of a single transformer, we combine (i) a stack of heterogeneous DNNs paired with small language models as perception modules for OCR involving complex PDFs, charts and diagrams, and multilingual ASR with (ii) a context-construction layer that crawls, indexes, and parses external sources (web pages, code, PDFs) into compact structured state, and (iii) an action layer that can browse, retrieve, execute code in a sandbox, and drive a headless browser for dynamic web pages. A thin controller sits on top of this stack and exposes a single, OpenAI-style endpoint: it decides which small models and actions to run and always forwards the distilled context to a user-selected LLM that produces the final response.
  On this architecture, Interfaze-Beta achieves 83.6% on MMLU-Pro, 91.4% on MMLU, 81.3% on GPQA-Diamond, 57.8% on LiveCodeBench v5, and 90.0% on AIME-2025, along with strong multimodal scores on MMMU (val) (77.3%), AI2D (91.5%), ChartQA (90.9%), and Common Voice v16 (90.8%). We show that most queries are handled primarily by the small-model and tool stack, with the large LLM operating only on distilled context, yielding competitive accuracy while shifting the bulk of computation away from the most expensive and monolithic models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OMG-Agent is a novel framework addressing data incompleteness in multimodal systems by decoupling tasks into three stages: Semantic Planner, Evidence Retriever, and Retrieval-Injected Executor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations of existing reconstruction methods—parametric/generative models' hallucinations and retrieval-augmented frameworks' rigidity—due to Semantic-Detail Entanglement.

Method: Dynamic coarse-to-fine Agentic Workflow with three stages: Semantic Planner, Evidence Retriever, and Retrieval-Injected Executor.

Result: OMG-Agent outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing robustness even under high missing rates.

Conclusion: OMG-Agent successfully addresses fidelity issues in multimodal systems by decoupling reasoning and synthesis.

Abstract: Data incompleteness severely impedes the reliability of multimodal systems. Existing reconstruction methods face distinct bottlenecks: conventional parametric/generative models are prone to hallucinations due to over-reliance on internal memory, while retrieval-augmented frameworks struggle with retrieval rigidity. Critically, these end-to-end architectures are fundamentally constrained by Semantic-Detail Entanglement -- a structural conflict between logical reasoning and signal synthesis that compromises fidelity. In this paper, we present \textbf{\underline{O}}mni-\textbf{\underline{M}}odality \textbf{\underline{G}}eneration Agent (\textbf{OMG-Agent}), a novel framework that shifts the paradigm from static mapping to a dynamic coarse-to-fine Agentic Workflow. By mimicking a \textit{deliberate-then-act} cognitive process, OMG-Agent explicitly decouples the task into three synergistic stages: (1) an MLLM-driven Semantic Planner that resolves input ambiguity via Progressive Contextual Reasoning, creating a deterministic structured semantic plan; (2) a non-parametric Evidence Retriever that grounds abstract semantics in external knowledge; and (3) a Retrieval-Injected Executor that utilizes retrieved evidence as flexible feature prompts to overcome rigidity and synthesize high-fidelity details. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that OMG-Agent consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, maintaining robustness under extreme missingness, e.g., a $2.6$-point gain on CMU-MOSI at $70$\% missing rates.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of humans effectively guiding AI systems on complex tasks they can't fully specify or verify, proposing Scalable Interactive Oversight to decompose tasks into manageable decisions for better supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The supervision gap arises as AI models perform complex tasks beyond human ability to specify or verify, necessitating scalable oversight methods.

Method: Proposes Scalable Interactive Oversight, decomposing tasks into recursive trees of manageable decisions, collecting low-burden feedback at each node to aggregate precise guidance.

Result: Validated in web development, enabling non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents with 54% improved alignment; optimized via Reinforcement Learning using user feedback.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical solution for maintaining human control over AI as it scales, leveraging recursive decomposition and Reinforcement Learning.

Abstract: As Large Language Models increasingly automate complex, long-horizon tasks such as \emph{vibe coding}, a supervision gap has emerged. While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54\% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales.

*Feiyu Gavin Zhu,Jean Oh,Reid Simmons*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InterPReT is a method enabling laypersons to teach AI agents interactively, yielding more robust policies than generic imitation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lowering the barrier for end-users without technical backgrounds to teach AI agents by simplifying the demonstration and training process.

Method: Interactive Policy Restructuring and Training (InterPReT) updates policy structure and parameters based on user instructions and demonstrations.

Result: A user study showed InterPReT produces more robust policies without compromising usability compared to generic imitation learning.

Conclusion: InterPReT is effective for non-technical users to train dependable AI policies.

Abstract: Imitation learning has shown success in many tasks by learning from expert demonstrations. However, most existing work relies on large-scale demonstrations from technical professionals and close monitoring of the training process. These are challenging for a layperson when they want to teach the agent new skills. To lower the barrier of teaching AI agents, we propose Interactive Policy Restructuring and Training (InterPReT), which takes user instructions to continually update the policy structure and optimize its parameters to fit user demonstrations. This enables end-users to interactively give instructions and demonstrations, monitor the agent's performance, and review the agent's decision-making strategies. A user study (N=34) on teaching an AI agent to drive in a racing game confirms that our approach yields more robust policies without impairing system usability, compared to a generic imitation learning baseline, when a layperson is responsible for both giving demonstrations and determining when to stop. This shows that our method is more suitable for end-users without much technical background in machine learning to train a dependable policy

*Hao Lu,Haoyuan Huang,Yulin Zhou,Chen Li,Ningxin Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Empirical-MCTS introduces a dual-loop framework combining local exploration and global memory optimization to enhance LLM reasoning, outperforming stateless MCTS and experience-driven agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MCTS approaches in LLMs are stateless, failing to accumulate wisdom like humans. Empirical-MCTS aims to bridge this gap by integrating continuous learning.

Method: The framework uses Pairwise-Experience-Evolutionary Meta-Prompting (PE-EMP) for local exploration and a Memory Optimization Agent for global memory management.

Result: Empirical-MCTS outperforms stateless MCTS and standalone agents on benchmarks like AIME25, ARC-AGI-2, and MathArena Apex.

Conclusion: Coupling structured search with empirical accumulation is essential for mastering complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling strategies, particularly Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current approaches remain predominantly stateless, discarding successful reasoning patterns after each problem instance and failing to mimic the empirical accumulation of wisdom characteristic of human problem-solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empirical-MCTS, a dual-loop framework that transforms stateless search into a continuous, non-parametric learning process. The framework unifies local exploration with global memory optimization through two novel mechanisms: Pairwise-Experience-Evolutionary Meta-Prompting (PE-EMP) and a Memory Optimization Agent. PE-EMP functions as a reflexive optimizer within the local search, utilizing pairwise feedback to dynamically synthesize adaptive criteria and evolve meta-prompts (system prompts) in real-time. Simultaneously, the Memory Optimization Agent manages a global repository as a dynamic policy prior, employing atomic operations to distill high-quality insights across problems. Extensive evaluations on complex reasoning benchmarks, including AIME25, ARC-AGI-2, and MathArena Apex, demonstrate that Empirical-MCTS significantly outperforms both stateless MCTS strategies and standalone experience-driven agents. These results underscore the critical necessity of coupling structured search with empirical accumulation for mastering complex, open-ended reasoning tasks.

*Yansong Ning,Jun Fang,Naiqiang Tan,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agent-Omit, a framework for LLM agents to adaptively skip redundant thoughts and observations, improving efficiency without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat all agent-environment interactions equally, ignoring varying necessity of thoughts and utility of observations across turns, leading to inefficiency.

Method: Agent-Omit synthesizes cold-start data for fine-tuning and employs an omit-aware reinforcement learning approach with dual sampling and tailored rewards to teach agents when to omit.

Result: Agent-Omit-8B matches performance of top LLM agents and achieves the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-off compared to seven efficient methods.

Conclusion: Agent-Omit effectively balances performance and efficiency by adaptively omitting redundant agent thoughts and observations, validated across five benchmarks.

Abstract: Managing agent thought and observation during multi-turn agent-environment interactions is an emerging strategy to improve agent efficiency. However, existing studies treat the entire interaction trajectories equally, overlooking the thought necessity and observation utility varies across turns. To this end, we first conduct quantitative investigations into how thought and observation affect agent effectiveness and efficiency. Based on our findings, we propose Agent-Omit, a unified training framework that empowers LLM agents to adaptively omit redundant thoughts and observations. Specifically, we first synthesize a small amount of cold-start data, including both single-turn and multi-turn omission scenarios, to fine-tune the agent for omission behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce an omit-aware agentic reinforcement learning approach, incorporating a dual sampling mechanism and a tailored omission reward to incentivize the agent's adaptive omission capability. Theoretically, we prove that the deviation of our omission policy is upper-bounded by KL-divergence. Experimental results on five agent benchmarks show that our constructed Agent-Omit-8B could obtain performance comparable to seven frontier LLM agent, and achieve the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-off than seven efficient LLM agents methods.

Result: The approach effectively accelerates deployment of intelligent services in complex industrial environments.

Conclusion: The modular and interoperable solution enhances AI integration in CPS, addressing scalability and configuration challenges.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), particularly in the industrial domain, has amplified the challenges associated with the effective integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Fragmentation across IoT and IIoT technologies, manifested through diverse communication protocols, data formats and device capabilities, creates a substantial gap between low-level physical layers and high-level intelligent functionalities. Recently, Digital Twin (DT) technology has emerged as a promising solution, offering structured, interoperable and semantically rich digital representations of physical assets. Current approaches are often siloed and tightly coupled, limiting scalability and reuse of AI functionalities. This work proposes a modular and interoperable solution that enables seamless AI pipeline integration into CPS by minimizing configuration and decoupling the roles of DTs and AI components. We introduce the concept of Zero Configuration (ZeroConf) AI pipelines, where DTs orchestrate data management and intelligent augmentation. The approach is demonstrated in a MicroFactory scenario, showing support for concurrent ML models and dynamic data processing, effectively accelerating the deployment of intelligent services in complex industrial settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of current large language models in expert-level scientific reasoning, particularly rigid tool pipelines and inefficient scaling.

Method: ReThinker uses a Solver-Critic-Selector architecture for dynamic computation allocation, alongside reverse data synthesis and adaptive trajectory recycling for training.

Result: ReThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on expert-level reasoning benchmarks like HLE, GAIA, and XBench.

Conclusion: ReThinker's adaptive framework and scalable training methods significantly advance expert-level reasoning capabilities in large language models.

Abstract: Expert-level scientific reasoning remains challenging for large language models, particularly on benchmarks such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), where rigid tool pipelines, brittle multi-agent coordination, and inefficient test-time scaling often limit performance. We introduce ReThinker, a confidence-aware agentic framework that orchestrates retrieval, tool use, and multi-agent reasoning through a stage-wise Solver-Critic-Selector architecture. Rather than following a fixed pipeline, ReThinker dynamically allocates computation based on model confidence, enabling adaptive tool invocation, guided multi-dimensional reflection, and robust confidence-weighted selection. To support scalable training without human annotation, we further propose a reverse data synthesis pipeline and an adaptive trajectory recycling strategy that transform successful reasoning traces into high-quality supervision. Experiments on HLE, GAIA, and XBench demonstrate that ReThinker consistently outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models with tools and existing deep research systems, achieving state-of-the-art results on expert-level reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: A framework for sequential interaction between GenAI and Q&A forums is proposed to address the paradox of AI dependence on forum data while drawing users away. Simulations show incentive misalignment but potential for sustainable collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the paradox where Generative AI systems rely on Q&A forum data for improvement but also divert users from these forums, impacting knowledge-sharing ecosystems.

Method: Proposes a framework of sequential interaction where a GenAI system suggests questions to forums, with simulations using real Stack Exchange data and LLMs to model the collaboration.

Result: Empirical evidence shows incentive misalignment, but players can achieve about half the utility of an ideal full-information scenario, indicating potential for sustainable collaboration.

Conclusion: The study highlights the possibility of sustainable collaboration between GenAI systems and human knowledge platforms, preserving effective knowledge sharing despite challenges.

Abstract: While Generative AI (GenAI) systems draw users away from (Q&A) forums, they also depend on the very data those forums produce to improve their performance. Addressing this paradox, we propose a framework of sequential interaction, in which a GenAI system proposes questions to a forum that can publish some of them. Our framework captures several intricacies of such a collaboration, including non-monetary exchanges, asymmetric information, and incentive misalignment. We bring the framework to life through comprehensive, data-driven simulations using real Stack Exchange data and commonly used LLMs. We demonstrate the incentive misalignment empirically, yet show that players can achieve roughly half of the utility in an ideal full-information scenario. Our results highlight the potential for sustainable collaboration that preserves effective knowledge sharing between AI systems and human knowledge platforms.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: For the past decade, the trajectory of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been dominated by a model-centric paradigm driven by scaling laws. Despite significant leaps in visual fidelity, this approach has encountered a ``usability ceiling'' manifested as the Intent-Execution Gap (i.e., the fundamental disparity between a creator's high-level intent and the stochastic, black-box nature of current single-shot models). In this paper, inspired by the Vibe Coding, we introduce the \textbf{Vibe AIGC}, a new paradigm for content generation via agentic orchestration, which represents the autonomous synthesis of hierarchical multi-agent workflows.
  Under this paradigm, the user's role transcends traditional prompt engineering, evolving into a Commander who provides a Vibe, a high-level representation encompassing aesthetic preferences, functional logic, and etc. A centralized Meta-Planner then functions as a system architect, deconstructing this ``Vibe'' into executable, verifiable, and adaptive agentic pipelines. By transitioning from stochastic inference to logical orchestration, Vibe AIGC bridges the gap between human imagination and machine execution. We contend that this shift will redefine the human-AI collaborative economy, transforming AI from a fragile inference engine into a robust system-level engineering partner that democratizes the creation of complex, long-horizon digital assets.

*Shubham Vatsal,Harsh Dubey,Aditi Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews 49 studies on LLM-based agents in healthcare using a seven-dimensional taxonomy, highlighting gaps and prevalent capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a structured review of LLM-based agents in healthcare, addressing the lack of a common framework in existing literature.

Method: Analyzed 49 studies using a seven-dimensional taxonomy with 29 sub-dimensions, applying explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria and labeling for implementation status.

Result: Found asymmetries in capability realization (e.g., high in External Knowledge Integration, low in Event-Triggered Activation) and prevalent architectural patterns (e.g., Multi-Agent Design).

Conclusion: LLM-based agents excel in information-centric tasks but lack in action-oriented areas like treatment planning, suggesting opportunities for improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents that plan, use tools and act has begun to shape healthcare and medicine. Reported studies demonstrate competence on various tasks ranging from EHR analysis and differential diagnosis to treatment planning and research workflows. Yet the literature largely consists of overviews which are either broad surveys or narrow dives into a single capability (e.g., memory, planning, reasoning), leaving healthcare work without a common frame. We address this by reviewing 49 studies using a seven-dimensional taxonomy: Cognitive Capabilities, Knowledge Management, Interaction Patterns, Adaptation & Learning, Safety & Ethics, Framework Typology and Core Tasks & Subtasks with 29 operational sub-dimensions. Using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria and a labeling rubric (Fully Implemented, Partially Implemented, Not Implemented), we map each study to the taxonomy and report quantitative summaries of capability prevalence and co-occurrence patterns. Our empirical analysis surfaces clear asymmetries. For instance, the External Knowledge Integration sub-dimension under Knowledge Management is commonly realized (~76% Fully Implemented) whereas Event-Triggered Activation sub-dimenison under Interaction Patterns is largely absent (~92% Not Implemented) and Drift Detection & Mitigation sub-dimension under Adaptation & Learning is rare (~98% Not Implemented). Architecturally, Multi-Agent Design sub-dimension under Framework Typology is the dominant pattern (~82% Fully Implemented) while orchestration layers remain mostly partial. Across Core Tasks & Subtasks, information centric capabilities lead e.g., Medical Question Answering & Decision Support and Benchmarking & Simulation, while action and discovery oriented areas such as Treatment Planning & Prescription still show substantial gaps (~59% Not Implemented).

TL;DR: The paper challenges the METR report's claim of exponential AI capability growth, arguing the inflection point has already passed and proposing a nuanced model to support near-term inflection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counter the METR report's assertion of exponential AI growth and highlight the fragility of such forecasts by presenting alternative evidence.

Method: Fitting sigmoid curves to METR's data and decomposing AI capabilities into base and reasoning components to analyze improvement rates.

Result: The inflection point has already passed, and a more complex model supports near-term inflection rather than exponential growth.

Conclusion: Existing forecasts of exponential AI growth are fragile; a nuanced model suggests near-term inflection.

Abstract: Rapidly increasing AI capabilities have substantial real-world consequences, ranging from AI safety concerns to labor market consequences. The Model Evaluation & Threat Research (METR) report argues that AI capabilities have exhibited exponential growth since 2019. In this note, we argue that the data does not support exponential growth, even in shorter-term horizons. Whereas the METR study claims that fitting sigmoid/logistic curves results in inflection points far in the future, we fit a sigmoid curve to their current data and find that the inflection point has already passed. In addition, we propose a more complex model that decomposes AI capabilities into base and reasoning capabilities, exhibiting individual rates of improvement. We prove that this model supports our hypothesis that AI capabilities will exhibit an inflection point in the near future. Our goal is not to establish a rigorous forecast of our own, but to highlight the fragility of existing forecasts of exponential growth.

TL;DR: Group-Evolving Agents (GEA) introduces a new paradigm for open-ended self-improvement by treating agent groups as evolutionary units, enabling better experience sharing and outperforming existing methods on coding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reduce reliance on human intervention by enabling agents to autonomously improve their designs, addressing inefficiencies in current self-evolving paradigms.

Method: GEA treats a group of agents as the evolutionary unit, promoting explicit experience sharing within the group, unlike isolated tree-structured evolution methods.

Result: GEA outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving methods (71.0% vs. 56.7%, 88.3% vs. 68.3%) and matches or exceeds human-designed frameworks on coding benchmarks. It also shows better robustness and efficiency in fixing bugs.

Conclusion: GEA's group-based approach effectively converts exploratory diversity into sustained progress, offering superior performance and transferability in open-ended self-improvement scenarios.

Abstract: Open-ended self-improving agents can autonomously modify their own structural designs to advance their capabilities and overcome the limits of pre-defined architectures, thus reducing reliance on human intervention. We introduce Group-Evolving Agents (GEA), a new paradigm for open-ended self-improvements, which treats a group of agents as the fundamental evolutionary unit, enabling explicit experience sharing and reuse within the group throughout evolution. Unlike existing open-ended self-evolving paradigms that adopt tree-structured evolution, GEA overcomes the limitation of inefficient utilization of exploratory diversity caused by isolated evolutionary branches. We evaluate GEA on challenging coding benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving methods (71.0% vs. 56.7% on SWE-bench Verified, 88.3% vs. 68.3% on Polyglot) and matches or exceeds top human-designed agent frameworks (71.8% and 52.0% on two benchmarks, respectively). Analysis reveals that GEA more effectively converts early-stage exploratory diversity into sustained, long-term progress, achieving stronger performance under the same number of evolved agents. Furthermore, GEA exhibits consistent transferability across different coding models and greater robustness, fixing framework-level bugs in 1.4 iterations on average, versus 5 for self-evolving methods.

TL;DR: The paper explores how reasoning language models like QwQ-32B improve their internal representations during abstract problem-solving, focusing on structural information and adaptive encodings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the internal mechanisms that enable reasoning models to outperform non-reasoning models on abstract tasks.

Method: The authors conduct a mechanistic analysis of QwQ-32B, a model trained for extensive reasoning, using the Mystery Blocksworld domain. They perform steering experiments to test causal relationships.

Result: QwQ-32B refines its internal representations during reasoning, focusing on structure. Injecting refined representations improves accuracy, while symbolic replacements minimize performance loss.

Conclusion: The study identifies Fluid Reasoning Representations as a key factor in reasoning model performance, highlighting adaptive token refinement.

Abstract: Reasoning language models, which generate long chains of thought, dramatically outperform non-reasoning language models on abstract problems. However, the internal model mechanisms that allow this superior performance remain poorly understood. We present a mechanistic analysis of how QwQ-32B - a model specifically trained to produce extensive reasoning traces - process abstract structural information. On Mystery Blocksworld - a semantically obfuscated planning domain - we find that QwQ-32B gradually improves its internal representation of actions and concepts during reasoning. The model develops abstract encodings that focus on structure rather than specific action names. Through steering experiments, we establish causal evidence that these adaptations improve problem solving: injecting refined representations from successful traces boosts accuracy, while symbolic representations can replace many obfuscated encodings with minimal performance loss. We find that one of the factors driving reasoning model performance is in-context refinement of token representations, which we dub Fluid Reasoning Representations.
