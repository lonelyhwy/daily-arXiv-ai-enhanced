*Zhuosen Bao,Xia Du,Zheng Lin,Jizhe Zhou,Zihan Fang,Jiening Wu,Yuxin Zhang,Zhe Chen,Chi-man Pun,Wei Ni,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIDeR decouples facial identity and appearance for privacy, generates anonymous adversarial faces, and offers reversible restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting facial privacy in online services requires decoupling identity from visual data.

Method: SIDeR splits images into identity vectors and semantic components, using diffusion models and optimization.

Result: Achieves 99% attack success rate and better restoration quality than baselines.

Conclusion: SIDeR effectively balances privacy and utility with high performance.

Abstract: With the deep integration of facial recognition into online banking, identity verification, and other networked services, achieving effective decoupling of identity information from visual representations during image storage and transmission has become a critical challenge for privacy protection. To address this issue, we propose SIDeR, a Semantic decoupling-driven framework for unrestricted face privacy protection. SIDeR decomposes a facial image into a machine-recognizable identity feature vector and a visually perceptible semantic appearance component. By leveraging semantic-guided recomposition in the latent space of a diffusion model, it generates visually anonymous adversarial faces while maintaining machine-level identity consistency. The framework incorporates momentum-driven unrestricted perturbation optimization and a semantic-visual balancing factor to synthesize multiple visually diverse, highly natural adversarial samples. Furthermore, for authorized access, the protected image can be restored to its original form when the correct password is provided. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that SIDeR achieves a 99% attack success rate in black-box scenarios and outperforms baseline methods by 41.28% in PSNR-based restoration quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior graph-based MOT methods that require redesigning tracking architectures, UniTrack aims to provide a universal training objective integrating detection accuracy, identity preservation, and spatiotemporal consistency without modifying existing systems.

Method: UniTrack uses differentiable graph representation learning to create a unified end-to-end trainable loss function, enabling networks to learn holistic representations of motion and identity relationships across frames.

Result: Evaluations show significant improvements, including a 53% reduction in identity switches and 12% IDF1 gains across benchmarks, with GTR achieving 9.7% MOTA improvement on SportsMOT.

Conclusion: UniTrack effectively enhances multi-object tracking performance universally across diverse models and benchmarks without architectural changes, proving its versatility and impact.

Abstract: We present UniTrack, a plug-and-play graph-theoretic loss function designed to significantly enhance multi-object tracking (MOT) performance by directly optimizing tracking-specific objectives through unified differentiable learning. Unlike prior graph-based MOT methods that redesign tracking architectures, UniTrack provides a universal training objective that integrates detection accuracy, identity preservation, and spatiotemporal consistency into a single end-to-end trainable loss function, enabling seamless integration with existing MOT systems without architectural modifications. Through differentiable graph representation learning, UniTrack enables networks to learn holistic representations of motion continuity and identity relationships across frames. We validate UniTrack across diverse tracking models and multiple challenging benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements across all tested architectures and datasets including Trackformer, MOTR, FairMOT, ByteTrack, GTR, and MOTE. Extensive evaluations show up to 53\% reduction in identity switches and 12\% IDF1 improvements across challenging benchmarks, with GTR achieving peak performance gains of 9.7\% MOTA on SportsMOT.

### [3] [VISTA: Enhancing Visual Conditioning via Track-Following Preference Optimization in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05049)
*Yiye Chen,Yanan Jian,Xiaoyi Dong,Shuxin Cao,Jing Wu,Patricio Vela,Benjamin E. Lundell,Dongdong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses vision-action misalignment in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models by strengthening visual conditioning, improving task performance without architectural changes or extra data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite their success, VLA models often suffer from weak dependence on visual states, leading to unreliable actions. The study aims to enhance the alignment between vision and action.

Method: The proposed framework aligns action prediction with visual input using preference optimization on a track-following task, then transfers this alignment to instruction-following tasks via latent-space distillation.

Result: The method improves visual conditioning and task performance for discrete OpenVLA and shows consistent gains in the continuous OpenVLA-OFT setting.

Conclusion: Strengthening visual conditioning in VLA models enhances their reliability and performance without requiring additional data or changes to the model architecture.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks. Despite the success, extending large pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to the action space can induce vision-action misalignment, where action predictions exhibit weak dependence on the current visual state, leading to unreliable action outputs. In this work, we study VLA models through the lens of visual conditioning and empirically show that successful rollouts consistently exhibit stronger visual dependence than failed ones. Motivated by this observation, we propose a training framework that explicitly strengthens visual conditioning in VLA models. Our approach first aligns action prediction with visual input via preference optimization on a track-following surrogate task, and then transfers the enhanced alignment to instruction-following task through latent-space distillation during supervised finetuning. Without introducing architectural modifications or additional data collection, our method improves both visual conditioning and task performance for discrete OpenVLA, and further yields consistent gains when extended to the continuous OpenVLA-OFT setting.

### [4] [Food Portion Estimation: From Pixels to Calories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05078)
*Gautham Vinod,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Summary of strategies for accurate portion estimation in image-based dietary assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate dietary assessment is crucial for health monitoring and chronic disease prevention, but estimating food size from 2D images is challenging.

Method: Strategies include auxiliary inputs (depth maps, multi-view), model-based approaches (template matching), and deep learning (monocular or combined inputs).

Result: Various methods are explored to bridge the gap in estimating food portions from images.

Conclusion: The paper reviews different approaches to improve portion estimation accuracy in dietary assessment.

Abstract: Reliance on images for dietary assessment is an important strategy to accurately and conveniently monitor an individual's health, making it a vital mechanism in the prevention and care of chronic diseases and obesity. However, image-based dietary assessment suffers from estimating the three dimensional size of food from 2D image inputs. Many strategies have been devised to overcome this critical limitation such as the use of auxiliary inputs like depth maps, multi-view inputs, or model-based approaches such as template matching. Deep learning also helps bridge the gap by either using monocular images or combinations of the image and the auxillary inputs to precisely predict the output portion from the image input. In this paper, we explore the different strategies employed for accurate portion estimation.

*Joseph D. Janizek,Sonnet Xu,Junayd Lateef,Roxana Daneshjou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Visual Concept Ranking (VCR) to audit large multimodal models (LMMs) for biases and performance gaps in medical tasks, focusing on skin lesion classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure reliability of LMMs in healthcare by identifying and addressing unexpected performance gaps, especially across demographic subgroups.

Method: Uses VCR to identify important visual concepts in LMMs, validated through manual interventions, applied to skin lesion classification and other medical/natural images.

Result: VCR uncovers visual feature dependencies and biases in LMMs, revealing performance disparities between demographic subgroups.

Conclusion: VCR is effective for auditing LMMs, highlighting biases and performance gaps, which is crucial for improving reliability in safety-critical domains like healthcare.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of machine learning models in safety-critical domains such as healthcare requires auditing methods that can uncover model shortcomings. We introduce a method for identifying important visual concepts within large multimodal models (LMMs) and use it to investigate the behaviors these models exhibit when prompted with medical tasks. We primarily focus on the task of classifying malignant skin lesions from clinical dermatology images, with supplemental experiments including both chest radiographs and natural images. After showing how LMMs display unexpected gaps in performance between different demographic subgroups when prompted with demonstrating examples, we apply our method, Visual Concept Ranking (VCR), to these models and prompts. VCR generates hypotheses related to different visual feature dependencies, which we are then able to validate with manual interventions.

### [6] [CLEAR-HPV: Interpretable Concept Discovery for HPV-Associated Morphology in Whole-Slide Histology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05126)
*Weiyi Qin,Yingci Liu-Swetz,Shiwei Tan,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLEAR-HPV introduces a concept-level explainable framework for HPV-related cancer analysis, improving interpretability while maintaining predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current attention-based MIL models for HPV-related cancers lack morphologic interpretability despite strong slide-level predictions.

Method: CLEAR-HPV restructures the MIL latent space using attention-weighted concepts, automatically discovering morphologic features without labeled training data.

Result: The framework reduces feature dimensions to 10 interpretable concepts, preserving predictive accuracy across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: CLEAR-HPV enhances interpretability in HPV-related cancer analysis, offering a backbone-agnostic solution for MIL models.

Abstract: Human papillomavirus (HPV) status is a critical determinant of prognosis and treatment response in head and neck and cervical cancers. Although attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) achieves strong slide-level prediction for HPV-related whole-slide histopathology, it provides limited morphologic interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Concept-Level Explainable Attention-guided Representation for HPV (CLEAR-HPV), a framework that restructures the MIL latent space using attention to enable concept discovery without requiring concept labels during training. Operating in an attention-weighted latent space, CLEAR-HPV automatically discovers keratinizing, basaloid, and stromal morphologic concepts, generates spatial concept maps, and represents each slide using a compact concept-fraction vector. CLEAR-HPV's concept-fraction vectors preserve the predictive information of the original MIL embeddings while reducing the high-dimensional feature space (e.g., 1536 dimensions) to only 10 interpretable concepts. CLEAR-HPV generalizes consistently across TCGA-HNSCC, TCGA-CESC, and CPTAC-HNSCC, providing compact, concept-level interpretability through a general, backbone-agnostic framework for attention-based MIL models of whole-slide histopathology.

### [7] [ARGaze: Autoregressive Transformers for Online Egocentric Gaze Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05132)
*Jia Li,Wenjie Zhao,Shijian Deng,Bolin Lai,Yuheng Wu,RUijia Chen,Jon E. Froehlich,Yuhang Zhao,Yapeng Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARGaze reformulates egocentric gaze estimation as sequential prediction using autoregressive decoding with visual features and recent gaze history, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric gaze estimation lacks explicit signals like head or eye movements, requiring inference from sparse cues. Temporal continuity of gaze during activities motivates leveraging recent gaze history for better prediction.

Method: Proposes ARGaze, a transformer decoder that predicts gaze sequentially by conditioning on current visual features and a fixed-length Gaze Context Window of recent gaze targets. Ensures causality and efficient streaming inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on egocentric benchmarks under online evaluation. Ablations confirm autoregressive modeling with bounded gaze history is key.

Conclusion: ARGaze demonstrates robust egocentric gaze estimation by leveraging temporal continuity, enabling practical applications like AR and assistive technologies. Code and models will be released.

Abstract: Online egocentric gaze estimation predicts where a camera wearer is looking from first-person video using only past and current frames, a task essential for augmented reality and assistive technologies. Unlike third-person gaze estimation, this setting lacks explicit head or eye signals, requiring models to infer current visual attention from sparse, indirect cues such as hand-object interactions and salient scene content. We observe that gaze exhibits strong temporal continuity during goal-directed activities: knowing where a person looked recently provides a powerful prior for predicting where they look next. Inspired by vision-conditioned autoregressive decoding in vision-language models, we propose ARGaze, which reformulates gaze estimation as sequential prediction: at each timestep, a transformer decoder predicts current gaze by conditioning on (i) current visual features and (ii) a fixed-length Gaze Context Window of recent gaze target estimates. This design enforces causality and enables bounded-resource streaming inference. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple egocentric benchmarks under online evaluation, with extensive ablations validating that autoregressive modeling with bounded gaze history is critical for robust prediction. We will release our source code and pre-trained models.

### [8] [AirGlove: Exploring Egocentric 3D Hand Tracking and Appearance Generalization for Sensing Gloves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05159)
*Wenhui Cui,Ziyi Kou,Chuan Qin,Ergys Ristani,Li Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates vision-based hand tracking models on gloved hands, highlighting performance drops due to appearance gaps. It proposes AirGlove to generalize models to new gloves with limited data, showing significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sensor-based glove tracking suffers from accuracy issues due to signal and calibration quality, while vision-based models perform well on bare hands but poorly on gloved hands due to appearance differences.

Method: AirGlove leverages existing gloves to generalize learned representations to new glove designs with limited data, tested under zero-shot and fine-tuning setups.

Result: AirGlove outperforms existing methods, effectively adapting hand pose models to new glove designs and achieving significant performance boosts.

Conclusion: Vision-based models struggle with gloved hands due to appearance gaps, but AirGlove provides a robust solution by generalizing learned representations to new gloves.

Abstract: Sensing gloves have become important tools for teleoperation and robotic policy learning as they are able to provide rich signals like speed, acceleration and tactile feedback. A common approach to track gloved hands is to directly use the sensor signals (e.g., angular velocity, gravity orientation) to estimate 3D hand poses. However, sensor-based tracking can be restrictive in practice as the accuracy is often impacted by sensor signal and calibration quality. Recent advances in vision-based approaches have achieved strong performance on human hands via large-scale pre-training, but their performance on gloved hands with distinct visual appearances remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of vision-based hand tracking models on gloved hands under both zero-shot and fine-tuning setups. Our analysis shows that existing bare-hand models suffer from substantial performance degradation on sensing gloves due to large appearance gap between bare-hand and glove designs. We therefore propose AirGlove, which leverages existing gloves to generalize the learned glove representations towards new gloves with limited data. Experiments with multiple sensing gloves show that AirGlove effectively generalizes the hand pose models to new glove designs and achieves a significant performance boost over the compared schemes.

### [9] [SHaSaM: Submodular Hard Sample Mining for Fair Facial Attribute Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05162)
*Anay Majee,Rishabh Iyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHaSaM introduces a combinatorial approach for fairness-driven representation learning, mitigating data imbalance and reducing bias in deep neural networks without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often inherit biases from annotated data, causing unfair predictions. Existing methods worsen fairness due to data imbalance and focus on sensitive attributes.

Method: SHaSaM uses a two-stage approach: SHaSaM-MINE mines hard positives/negatives via submodular subset selection, and SHaSaM-LEARN employs combinatorial loss functions to minimize sensitive attribute influence.

Result: Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace show SHaSaM improves fairness (2.7 points in Equalized Odds) and accuracy (3.5%) within fewer epochs.

Conclusion: SHaSaM effectively enhances fairness and performance in biased datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often inherit social and demographic biases from annotated data during model training, leading to unfair predictions, especially in the presence of sensitive attributes like race, age, gender etc. Existing methods fall prey to the inherent data imbalance between attribute groups and inadvertently emphasize on sensitive attributes, worsening unfairness and performance. To surmount these challenges, we propose SHaSaM (Submodular Hard Sample Mining), a novel combinatorial approach that models fairness-driven representation learning as a submodular hard-sample mining problem. Our two-stage approach comprises of SHaSaM-MINE, which introduces a submodular subset selection strategy to mine hard positives and negatives - effectively mitigating data imbalance, and SHaSaM-LEARN, which introduces a family of combinatorial loss functions based on Submodular Conditional Mutual Information to maximize the decision boundary between target classes while minimizing the influence of sensitive attributes. This unified formulation restricts the model from learning features tied to sensitive attributes, significantly enhancing fairness without sacrificing performance. Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace demonstrate that SHaSaM achieves state-of-the-art results, with up to 2.7 points improvement in model fairness (Equalized Odds) and a 3.5% gain in Accuracy, within fewer epochs as compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater photography suffers from contrast loss, blur, and color distortions, requiring extensive post-processing. The goal is to automate correction of these issues.

Method: An image-to-image pipeline employs synthetic corruption and diffusion-based generation to reverse underwater degradations, trained on a small high-quality dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion-based method effectively corrects underwater photography distortions with limited training resources.

Abstract: Underwater photography presents significant inherent challenges including reduced contrast, spatial blur, and wavelength-dependent color distortions. These effects can obscure the vibrancy of marine life and awareness photographers in particular are often challenged with heavy post-processing pipelines to correct for these distortions.
  We develop an image-to-image pipeline that learns to reverse underwater degradations by introducing a synthetic corruption pipeline and learning to reverse its effects with diffusion-based generation. Training and evaluation are performed on a small high-quality dataset of awareness photography images by Keith Ellenbogen. The proposed methodology achieves high perceptual consistency and strong generalization in synthesizing 512x768 images using a model of ~11M parameters after training from scratch on ~2.5k images.

*Zhe Li,Bernhard Kainz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShapePuri is a defense framework that improves robustness against adversarial attacks by aligning model representations with stable structural invariants, achieving high accuracy with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defenses like adversarial training or purification suffer from high computational costs or information loss.

Method: ShapePuri combines a Shape Encoding Module (SEM) for geometric guidance using Signed Distance Functions (SDF) and a Global Appearance Debiasing (GAD) module to reduce appearance bias through stochastic transformations.

Result: ShapePuri achieves 84.06% clean accuracy and 81.64% robust accuracy under AutoAttack, surpassing the 80% threshold on this benchmark.

Conclusion: ShapePuri offers a scalable, efficient adversarial defense that maintains prediction stability without extra modules or computational cost.

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate impressive performance in visual recognition, but they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that is imperceptible to the human. Although existing defense strategies such as adversarial training and purification have achieved progress, diffusion-based purification often involves high computational costs and information loss. To address these challenges, we introduce Shape Guided Purification (ShapePuri), a novel defense framework enhances robustness by aligning model representations with stable structural invariants. ShapePuri integrates two components: a Shape Encoding Module (SEM) that provides dense geometric guidance through Signed Distance Functions (SDF), and a Global Appearance Debiasing (GAD) module that mitigates appearance bias via stochastic transformations. In our experiments, ShapePuri achieves $84.06\%$ clean accuracy and $81.64\%$ robust accuracy under the AutoAttack protocol, representing the first defense framework to surpass the $80\%$ threshold on this benchmark. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient adversarial defense that preserves prediction stability during inference without requiring auxiliary modules or additional computational cost.

### [12] [PoseGaussian: Pose-Driven Novel View Synthesis for Robust 3D Human Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05190)
*Ju Shen,Chen Chen,Tam V. Nguyen,Vijayan K. Asari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseGaussian is a pose-guided Gaussian Splatting framework for high-fidelity human novel view synthesis, using human body pose for depth refinement and temporal consistency, achieving real-time rendering at 100 FPS with state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The framework addresses challenges in dynamic human scenes, like articulated motion and self-occlusion, by embedding pose signals into geometric and temporal stages for improved robustness and generalization.

Method: PoseGaussian integrates human body pose as a structural prior (fused with a color encoder) and a temporal cue (processed by a pose encoder) into a differentiable, end-to-end trainable pipeline.

Result: Achieves real-time rendering at 100 FPS with high perceptual quality and structural accuracy (PSNR 30.86, SSIM 0.979, LPIPS 0.028) on ZJU-MoCap, THuman2.0, and in-house datasets.

Conclusion: PoseGaussian demonstrates superior performance in human novel view synthesis by leveraging pose signals effectively, maintaining efficiency while addressing dynamic scene challenges.

Abstract: We propose PoseGaussian, a pose-guided Gaussian Splatting framework for high-fidelity human novel view synthesis. Human body pose serves a dual purpose in our design: as a structural prior, it is fused with a color encoder to refine depth estimation; as a temporal cue, it is processed by a dedicated pose encoder to enhance temporal consistency across frames. These components are integrated into a fully differentiable, end-to-end trainable pipeline. Unlike prior works that use pose only as a condition or for warping, PoseGaussian embeds pose signals into both geometric and temporal stages to improve robustness and generalization. It is specifically designed to address challenges inherent in dynamic human scenes, such as articulated motion and severe self-occlusion. Notably, our framework achieves real-time rendering at 100 FPS, maintaining the efficiency of standard Gaussian Splatting pipelines. We validate our approach on ZJU-MoCap, THuman2.0, and in-house datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in perceptual quality and structural accuracy (PSNR 30.86, SSIM 0.979, LPIPS 0.028).

### [13] [GT-SVJ: Generative-Transformer-Based Self-Supervised Video Judge For Efficient Video Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05202)
*Shivanshu Shekhar,Uttaran Bhattacharya,Raghavendra Addanki,Mehrab Tanjim,Somdeb Sarkhel,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to aligning video generative models with human preferences by repurposing them as reward models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for reward modeling fail to capture subtle temporal dynamics in videos.

Method: The paper introduces the Generative-Transformer-based Self-Supervised Video Judge (GTSVJ), transforming video generation models into temporally-aware reward models using energy-based modeling and contrastive training with synthetic negative videos.

Result: GTSVJ outperforms existing VLM-based methods on GenAI-Bench and MonteBench, requiring significantly fewer human annotations (30K vs. 6x–65x more).

Conclusion: Repurposing generative models as reward models is effective for capturing temporal dynamics and improving alignment with human preferences.

Abstract: Aligning video generative models with human preferences remains challenging: current approaches rely on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for reward modeling, but these models struggle to capture subtle temporal dynamics. We propose a fundamentally different approach: repurposing video generative models, which are inherently designed to model temporal structure, as reward models. We present the Generative-Transformer-based Self-Supervised Video Judge (\modelname), a novel evaluation model that transforms state-of-the-art video generation models into powerful temporally-aware reward models. Our key insight is that generative models can be reformulated as energy-based models (EBMs) that assign low energy to high-quality videos and high energy to degraded ones, enabling them to discriminate video quality with remarkable precision when trained via contrastive objectives. To prevent the model from exploiting superficial differences between real and generated videos, we design challenging synthetic negative videos through controlled latent-space perturbations: temporal slicing, feature swapping, and frame shuffling, which simulate realistic but subtle visual degradations. This forces the model to learn meaningful spatiotemporal features rather than trivial artifacts. \modelname achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenAI-Bench and MonteBench using only 30K human-annotations: $6\times$ to $65\times$ fewer than existing VLM-based approaches.

### [14] [Dual-Representation Image Compression at Ultra-Low Bitrates via Explicit Semantics and Implicit Textures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05213)
*Chuqin Zhou,Xiaoyue Ling,Yunuo Chen,Jincheng Dai,Guo Lu,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework combining explicit and implicit representations to improve ultra-low bitrate neural codecs, achieving state-of-the-art performance without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative compression methods struggle with balancing semantic faithfulness and perceptual realism, limiting their effectiveness under ultra-low bitrate conditions.

Method: The framework integrates explicit high-level semantics with implicit fine-grained details via a diffusion model and reverse-channel coding, alongside a plug-in encoder for distortion-perception control.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches, showing significant improvements (up to 29.92%) in rate-perception performance on standard datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between explicit and implicit representations, offering flexible and superior compression performance for ultra-low bitrate scenarios.

Abstract: While recent neural codecs achieve strong performance at low bitrates when optimized for perceptual quality, their effectiveness deteriorates significantly under ultra-low bitrate conditions. To mitigate this, generative compression methods leveraging semantic priors from pretrained models have emerged as a promising paradigm. However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by a tradeoff between semantic faithfulness and perceptual realism. Methods based on explicit representations preserve content structure but often lack fine-grained textures, whereas implicit methods can synthesize visually plausible details at the cost of semantic drift. In this work, we propose a unified framework that bridges this gap by coherently integrating explicit and implicit representations in a training-free manner. Specifically, We condition a diffusion model on explicit high-level semantics while employing reverse-channel coding to implicitly convey fine-grained details. Moreover, we introduce a plug-in encoder that enables flexible control of the distortion-perception tradeoff by modulating the implicit information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art rate-perception performance, outperforming existing methods and surpassing DiffC by 29.92%, 19.33%, and 20.89% in DISTS BD-Rate on the Kodak, DIV2K, and CLIC2020 datasets, respectively.

*Jiahao Nie,Wenbin An,Gongjie Zhang,Yicheng Xu,Yap-Peng Tan,Alex C. Kot,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E.M.Ground introduces a novel approach for Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) using holistic event perception, outperforming existing methods by addressing semantic continuity and noise issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TVG methods struggle with semantic continuity and integrity due to frame-by-frame matching and reliance on exact timestamps, leading to ambiguities.

Method: Proposes E.M.Ground with three innovations: <event> token for semantic continuity, Savitzky-Golay smoothing for noise reduction, and multi-grained frame feature aggregation for reliability.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs significantly on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: E.M.Ground effectively addresses TVG challenges by focusing on holistic event perception and robust feature processing.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs), Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which aims to precisely localize time segments corresponding to query events, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often match start and end frames by comparing frame features with two separate tokens, relying heavily on exact timestamps. However, this approach fails to capture the event's semantic continuity and integrity, leading to ambiguities. To address this, we propose E.M.Ground, a novel Vid-LLM for TVG that focuses on holistic and coherent event perception. E.M.Ground introduces three key innovations: (i) a special <event> token that aggregates information from all frames of a query event, preserving semantic continuity for accurate event matching; (ii) Savitzky-Golay smoothing to reduce noise in token-to-frame similarities across timestamps, improving prediction accuracy; (iii) multi-grained frame feature aggregation to enhance matching reliability and temporal understanding, compensating for compression-induced information loss. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that E.M.Ground consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs by significant margins.

### [16] [Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation via Multi-view Progressive Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05217)
*Jiahao Nie,Guanqiao Fu,Wenbin An,Yap-Peng Tan,Alex C. Kot,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Multi-view Progressive Adaptation (MPA) to improve Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation by addressing limited target samples and domain gaps through data augmentation and multi-view prediction strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with limited target data diversity and domain gaps, hindering effective adaptation. The goal is to enhance few-shot segmentation performance in target domains.

Method: MPA uses Hybrid Progressive Augmentation for diverse data views and Dual-chain Multi-view Prediction for robust learning. These strategies progressively adapt few-shot capability.

Result: MPA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.0%, demonstrating effective adaptation to target domains.

Conclusion: MPA successfully bridges domain gaps and improves few-shot segmentation through progressive data and strategy adaptation.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation aims to segment categories in data-scarce domains conditioned on a few exemplars. Typical methods first establish few-shot capability in a large-scale source domain and then adapt it to target domains. However, due to the limited quantity and diversity of target samples, existing methods still exhibit constrained performance. Moreover, the source-trained model's initially weak few-shot capability in target domains, coupled with substantial domain gaps, severely hinders the effective utilization of target samples and further impedes adaptation. To this end, we propose Multi-view Progressive Adaptation, which progressively adapts few-shot capability to target domains from both data and strategy perspectives. (i) From the data perspective, we introduce Hybrid Progressive Augmentation, which progressively generates more diverse and complex views through cumulative strong augmentations, thereby creating increasingly challenging learning scenarios. (ii) From the strategy perspective, we design Dual-chain Multi-view Prediction, which fully leverages these progressively complex views through sequential and parallel learning paths under extensive supervision. By jointly enforcing prediction consistency across diverse and complex views, MPA achieves both robust and accurate adaptation to target domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-based methods struggle with Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) due to domain shifts disrupting point interactions. The proposed Conditional Point Sparsification (CPS) adapts point density using reference exemplars for better segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAM-based methods for few-shot segmentation perform poorly in cross-domain scenarios due to domain shifts disrupting learned point-image interactions.

Method: Introduces Conditional Point Sparsification (CPS), a training-free approach that adapts SAM interactions for cross-domain images by sparsifying dense matched points based on reference exemplars.

Result: CPS outperforms existing training-free SAM-based methods across diverse CD-FSS datasets.

Conclusion: Adapting point density based on reference exemplars improves SAM-based segmentation accuracy in cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Motivated by the success of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in promptable segmentation, recent studies leverage SAM to develop training-free solutions for few-shot segmentation, which aims to predict object masks in the target image based on a few reference exemplars. These SAM-based methods typically rely on point matching between reference and target images and use the matched dense points as prompts for mask prediction. However, we observe that dense points perform poorly in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS), where target images are from medical or satellite domains. We attribute this issue to large domain shifts that disrupt the point-image interactions learned by SAM, and find that point density plays a crucial role under such conditions. To address this challenge, we propose Conditional Point Sparsification (CPS), a training-free approach that adaptively guides SAM interactions for cross-domain images based on reference exemplars. Leveraging ground-truth masks, the reference images provide reliable guidance for adaptively sparsifying dense matched points, enabling more accurate segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPS outperforms existing training-free SAM-based methods across diverse CD-FSS datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a cost-effective solution for reliable medical AI development with limited expert resources.

Abstract: Automated detection of electron dense deposits (EDD) in glomerular disease is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality labeled data. While crowdsourcing reduces annotation cost, it introduces label noise. We propose an active label cleaning method to efficiently denoise crowdsourced datasets. Our approach uses active learning to select the most valuable noisy samples for expert re-annotation, building high-accuracy cleaning models. A Label Selection Module leverages discrepancies between crowdsourced labels and model predictions for both sample selection and instance-level noise grading. Experiments show our method achieves 67.18% AP\textsubscript{50} on a private dataset, an 18.83% improvement over training on noisy labels. This performance reaches 95.79% of that with full expert annotation while reducing annotation cost by 73.30%. The method provides a practical, cost-effective solution for developing reliable medical AI with limited expert resources.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RFM-Pose accelerates category-level 6D object pose estimation using flow-matching generative models and reinforcement learning, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiency of score-based diffusion models in object pose estimation and aims to improve sampling efficiency and hypothesis evaluation.

Method: The RFM-Pose framework uses flow-matching generative models for efficient pose candidate generation and leverages reinforcement learning (proximal policy optimization) to refine these candidates.

Result: Experiments on the REAL275 benchmark show RFM-Pose achieves strong performance with reduced computational costs and adapts well to object pose tracking.

Conclusion: RFM-Pose offers an efficient and effective solution for category-level 6D object pose estimation, with potential applications in pose tracking.

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a fundamental problem in computer vision and plays a critical role in virtual reality and embodied intelligence, where agents must understand and interact with objects in 3D space. Recently, score based generative models have to some extent solved the rotational symmetry ambiguity problem in category level pose estimation, but their efficiency remains limited by the high sampling cost of score-based diffusion. In this work, we propose a new framework, RFM-Pose, that accelerates category-level 6D object pose generation while actively evaluating sampled hypotheses. To improve sampling efficiency, we adopt a flow-matching generative model and generate pose candidates along an optimal transport path from a simple prior to the pose distribution. To further refine these candidates, we cast the flow-matching sampling process as a Markov decision process and apply proximal policy optimization to fine-tune the sampling policy. In particular, we interpret the flow field as a learnable policy and map an estimator to a value network, enabling joint optimization of pose generation and hypothesis scoring within a reinforcement learning framework. Experiments on the REAL275 benchmark demonstrate that RFM-Pose achieves favorable performance while significantly reducing computational cost. Moreover, similar to prior work, our approach can be readily adapted to object pose tracking and attains competitive results in this setting.

Conclusion: ReGLA is a state-of-the-art solution for high-resolution visual tasks.

Abstract: Balancing accuracy and latency on high-resolution images is a critical challenge for lightweight models, particularly for Transformer-based architectures that often suffer from excessive latency. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{ReGLA}, a series of lightweight hybrid networks, which integrates efficient convolutions for local feature extraction with ReLU-based gated linear attention for global modeling. The design incorporates three key innovations: the Efficient Large Receptive Field (ELRF) module for enhancing convolutional efficiency while preserving a large receptive field; the ReLU Gated Modulated Attention (RGMA) module for maintaining linear complexity while enhancing local feature representation; and a multi-teacher distillation strategy to boost performance on downstream tasks. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ReGLA; particularly the ReGLA-M achieves \textbf{80.85\%} Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K at $224px$, with only \textbf{4.98 ms} latency at $512px$. Furthermore, ReGLA outperforms similarly scaled iFormer models in downstream tasks, achieving gains of \textbf{3.1\%} AP on COCO object detection and \textbf{3.6\%} mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation, establishing it as a state-of-the-art solution for high-resolution visual applications.

*Shengqin Jiang,Xiaoran Feng,Yuankai Qi,Haokui Zhang,Renlong Hang,Qingshan Liu,Lina Yao,Quan Z. Sheng,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) by fine-tuning prototypes instead of the feature extractor, addressing representation bias and data scarcity effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FSCIL methods struggle with representation bias and limited data, prompting the need for a new perspective that optimizes decision regions in a static feature space.

Method: The paper introduces a prototype fine-tuning framework with dual-calibration (class-specific and task-aware offsets) to enhance discriminative power for incremental classes.

Result: The method achieves superior performance on benchmarks with minimal learnable parameters, demonstrating effectiveness in FSCIL.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning prototypes within a static feature space is a viable solution to FSCIL challenges, offering improved discriminative capacity.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) seeks to continuously learn new classes from very limited samples while preserving previously acquired knowledge. Traditional methods often utilize a frozen pre-trained feature extractor to generate static class prototypes, which suffer from the inherent representation bias of the backbone. While recent prompt-based tuning methods attempt to adapt the backbone via minimal parameter updates, given the constraint of extreme data scarcity, the model's capacity to assimilate novel information and substantively enhance its global discriminative power is inherently limited. In this paper, we propose a novel shift in perspective: freezing the feature extractor while fine-tuning the prototypes. We argue that the primary challenge in FSCIL is not feature acquisition, but rather the optimization of decision regions within a static, high-quality feature space. To this end, we introduce an efficient prototype fine-tuning framework that evolves static centroids into dynamic, learnable components. The framework employs a dual-calibration method consisting of class-specific and task-aware offsets. These components function synergistically to improve the discriminative capacity of prototypes for ongoing incremental classes. Extensive results demonstrate that our method attains superior performance across multiple benchmarks while requiring minimal learnable parameters.

TL;DR: Magic-MM-Embedding improves multimodal retrieval efficiency and performance using visual token compression and multi-stage training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing high computational costs in MLLMs for practical multimodal retrieval applications.

Method: Combines efficient MLLM architecture with visual token compression and multi-stage training (pretraining, contrastive learning, fine-tuning).

Result: Outperforms existing methods significantly with higher inference efficiency.

Conclusion: Magic-MM-Embedding achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown immense promise in universal multimodal retrieval, which aims to find relevant items of various modalities for a given query. But their practical application is often hindered by the substantial computational cost incurred from processing a large number of tokens from visual inputs. In this paper, we propose Magic-MM-Embedding, a series of novel models that achieve both high efficiency and state-of-the-art performance in universal multimodal embedding. Our approach is built on two synergistic pillars: (1) a highly efficient MLLM architecture incorporating visual token compression to drastically reduce inference latency and memory footprint, and (2) a multi-stage progressive training strategy designed to not only recover but significantly boost performance. This coarse-to-fine training paradigm begins with extensive continue pretraining to restore multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, progresses to large-scale contrastive pretraining and hard negative mining to enhance discriminative power, and culminates in a task-aware fine-tuning stage guided by an MLLM-as-a-Judge for precise data curation. Comprehensive experiments show that our model outperforms existing methods by a large margin while being more inference-efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3D's inference latency hinders its deployment, prompting the first systematic investigation into its dynamics, revealing brittleness in generic acceleration strategies due to multi-level heterogeneity.

Method: Fast-SAM3D introduces three heterogeneity-aware mechanisms: Modality-Aware Step Caching, Joint Spatiotemporal Token Carving, and Spectral-Aware Token Aggregation.

Result: The framework achieves a 2.67× end-to-end speedup with negligible fidelity loss, setting a new Pareto frontier for efficient single-view 3D generation.

Conclusion: Fast-SAM3D successfully addresses SAM3D's heterogeneity challenges, offering significant speed improvements without compromising quality.

Abstract: SAM3D enables scalable, open-world 3D reconstruction from complex scenes, yet its deployment is hindered by prohibitive inference latency. In this work, we conduct the \textbf{first systematic investigation} into its inference dynamics, revealing that generic acceleration strategies are brittle in this context. We demonstrate that these failures stem from neglecting the pipeline's inherent multi-level \textbf{heterogeneity}: the kinematic distinctiveness between shape and layout, the intrinsic sparsity of texture refinement, and the spectral variance across geometries. To address this, we present \textbf{Fast-SAM3D}, a training-free framework that dynamically aligns computation with instantaneous generation complexity. Our approach integrates three heterogeneity-aware mechanisms: (1) \textit{Modality-Aware Step Caching} to decouple structural evolution from sensitive layout updates; (2) \textit{Joint Spatiotemporal Token Carving} to concentrate refinement on high-entropy regions; and (3) \textit{Spectral-Aware Token Aggregation} to adapt decoding resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fast-SAM3D delivers up to \textbf{2.67$\times$} end-to-end speedup with negligible fidelity loss, establishing a new Pareto frontier for efficient single-view 3D generation.

TL;DR: FlashBlock reduces overhead in block diffusion by reusing stable attention outputs from prior steps, boosting efficiency without sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current block diffusion methods face inefficiency due to redundant attention computations over growing KV caches in long-context settings.

Method: Proposes FlashBlock, a mechanism leveraging stable attention outputs outside the current block, reducing redundant calculations and KV cache access.

Result: Achieves up to 1.44× higher token throughput and 1.6× faster attention time with minimal quality impact.

Conclusion: FlashBlock effectively improves efficiency in diffusion models for language and video tasks while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Generating long-form content, such as minute-long videos and extended texts, is increasingly important for modern generative models. Block diffusion improves inference efficiency via KV caching and block-wise causal inference and has been widely adopted in diffusion language models and video generation. However, in long-context settings, block diffusion still incurs substantial overhead from repeatedly computing attention over a growing KV cache. We identify an underexplored property of block diffusion: cross-step redundancy of attention within a block. Our analysis shows that attention outputs from tokens outside the current block remain largely stable across diffusion steps, while block-internal attention varies significantly. Based on this observation, we propose FlashBlock, a cached block-external attention mechanism that reuses stable attention output, reducing attention computation and KV cache access without modifying the diffusion process. Moreover, FlashBlock is orthogonal to sparse attention and can be combined as a complementary residual reuse strategy, substantially improving model accuracy under aggressive sparsification. Experiments on diffusion language models and video generation demonstrate up to 1.44$\times$ higher token throughput and up to 1.6$\times$ reduction in attention time, with negligible impact on generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods assume rectified or pinhole camera images, limiting real-world applicability for fisheye or panoramic cameras. Wid3R aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Uses a ray representation with spherical harmonics and a novel camera model token for distortion-aware 3D reconstruction, supporting 360 imagery.

Result: Demonstrates strong zero-shot robustness and outperforms prior methods significantly on Stanford2D3D.

Conclusion: Wid3R is a generalizable, distortion-aware 3D reconstruction method, setting a new benchmark for wide field-of-view camera models.

Abstract: We present Wid3R, a feed-forward neural network for visual geometry reconstruction that supports wide field-of-view camera models. Prior methods typically assume that input images are rectified or captured with pinhole cameras, since both their architectures and training datasets are tailored to perspective images only. These assumptions limit their applicability in real-world scenarios that use fisheye or panoramic cameras and often require careful calibration and undistortion. In contrast, Wid3R is a generalizable multi-view 3D estimation method that can model wide field-of-view camera types. Our approach leverages a ray representation with spherical harmonics and a novel camera model token within the network, enabling distortion-aware 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, Wid3R is the first multi-view foundation model to support feed-forward 3D reconstruction directly from 360 imagery. It demonstrates strong zero-shot robustness and consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving improvements of up to +77.33 on Stanford2D3D.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTPano is a multi-task panoramic foundation model addressing challenges like data scarcity and task interference in panoramic scene understanding by leveraging perspective priors and a novel architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in panoramic scene understanding, such as geometric distortions, coordinate discrepancies, and lack of multi-task annotations.

Method: MTPano uses label-free training with perspective-derived pseudo-labels, categorizes tasks into rotation-invariant/variant groups, and employs Panoramic Dual BridgeNet with geometry-aware modulation.

Result: MTPano achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and competes with task-specific panoramic models.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses panoramic scene understanding challenges through innovative training and architecture, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: Comprehensive panoramic scene understanding is critical for immersive applications, yet it remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-resolution, multi-task annotations. While perspective foundation models have achieved success through data scaling, directly adapting them to the panoramic domain often fails due to severe geometric distortions and coordinate system discrepancies. Furthermore, the underlying relations between diverse dense prediction tasks in spherical spaces are underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose MTPano, a robust multi-task panoramic foundation model established by a label-free training pipeline. First, to circumvent data scarcity, we leverage powerful perspective dense priors. We project panoramic images into perspective patches to generate accurate, domain-gap-free pseudo-labels using off-the-shelf foundation models, which are then re-projected to serve as patch-wise supervision. Second, to tackle the interference between task types, we categorize tasks into rotation-invariant (e.g., depth, segmentation) and rotation-variant (e.g., surface normals) groups. We introduce the Panoramic Dual BridgeNet, which disentangles these feature streams via geometry-aware modulation layers that inject absolute position and ray direction priors. To handle the distortion from equirectangular projections (ERP), we incorporate ERP token mixers followed by a dual-branch BridgeNet for interactions with gradient truncation, facilitating beneficial cross-task information sharing while blocking conflicting gradients from incompatible task attributes. Additionally, we introduce auxiliary tasks (image gradient, point map, etc.) to fertilize the cross-task learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTPano achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and delivers competitive results against task-specific panoramic specialist foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAIRed Erasing (PAIR) reframes concept erasure by using unsafe-safe pairs for consistency-preserving semantic realignment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods lack guidance for safe alternatives, leading to inconsistency. PAIR addresses this by leveraging unsafe-safe pairs.

Method: PAIR uses Paired Semantic Realignment and Fisher-weighted Initialization for DoRA to align unsafe inputs with safe counterparts while preserving fidelity.

Result: PAIR outperforms baselines, achieving effective erasure with maintained structural integrity, semantic coherence, and generation quality.

Conclusion: PAIR provides a robust framework for selective concept erasure with semantic consistency, advancing text-to-image model safety.

Abstract: With the increasing versatility of text-to-image diffusion models, the ability to selectively erase undesirable concepts (e.g., harmful content) has become indispensable. However, existing concept erasure approaches primarily focus on removing unsafe concepts without providing guidance toward corresponding safe alternatives, which often leads to failure in preserving the structural and semantic consistency between the original and erased generations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, PAIRed Erasing (PAIR), which reframes concept erasure from simple removal to consistency-preserving semantic realignment using unsafe-safe pairs. We first generate safe counterparts from unsafe inputs while preserving structural and semantic fidelity, forming paired unsafe-safe multimodal data. Leveraging these pairs, we introduce two key components: (1) Paired Semantic Realignment, a guided objective that uses unsafe-safe pairs to explicitly map target concepts to semantically aligned safe anchors; and (2) Fisher-weighted Initialization for DoRA, which initializes parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation matrices using unsafe-safe pairs, encouraging the generation of safe alternatives while selectively suppressing unsafe concepts. Together, these components enable fine-grained erasure that removes only the targeted concepts while maintaining overall semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving effective concept erasure while preserving structural integrity, semantic coherence, and generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype-based methods suffer from Static Homogeneity Assumption and Learning-Inference Disconnect, limiting performance.

Method: APEX uses Adaptive Prototype Manifold (APM) and Posterior-Aware OOD Scoring (PAOS) for better feature optimization.

Result: APEX achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: APEX effectively addresses limitations of current methods and enhances OOD detection.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task for the safe deployment of machine learning models in the real world. Existing prototype-based representation learning methods have demonstrated exceptional performance. Specifically, we identify two fundamental flaws that universally constrain these methods: the Static Homogeneity Assumption (fixed representational resources for all classes) and the Learning-Inference Disconnect (discarding rich prototype quality knowledge at inference). These flaws fundamentally limit the model's capacity and performance. To address these issues, we propose APEX (Adaptive Prototype for eXtensive OOD Detection), a novel OOD detection framework designed via a Two-Stage Repair process to optimize the learned feature manifold. APEX introduces two key innovations to address these respective flaws: (1) an Adaptive Prototype Manifold (APM), which leverages the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to automatically determine the optimal prototype complexity $K_c^*$ for each class, thereby fundamentally resolving prototype collision; and (2) a Posterior-Aware OOD Scoring (PAOS) mechanism, which quantifies prototype quality (cohesion and separation) to bridge the learning-inference disconnect. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-100 validate the superiority of our method, where APEX achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Proposes HIVE, a framework for multimodal latent reasoning using hierarchical visual cues to improve efficiency and reduce hallucinations in MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses inefficiencies and verbosity in current 'fast thinking' MLLMs by enabling robust reasoning in a latent space.

Method: Recursively extends transformer blocks and injects hierarchical visual cues into latent representations for iterative refinement.

Result: Enhances scene understanding and test-time scaling with vision knowledge.

Conclusion: HIVE enables grounded, multi-step inference in latent space, improving MLLM reasoning.

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has enabled impressive perception capabilities. However, their reasoning process often remains a "fast thinking" paradigm, reliant on end-to-end generation or explicit, language-centric chains of thought (CoT), which can be inefficient, verbose, and prone to hallucination. This work posits that robust reasoning should evolve within a latent space, integrating multimodal signals seamlessly. We propose multimodal latent reasoning via HIerarchical Visual cuEs injection (\emph{HIVE}), a novel framework that instills deliberate, "slow thinking" without depending on superficial textual rationales. Our method recursively extends transformer blocks, creating an internal loop for iterative reasoning refinement. Crucially, it injectively grounds this process with hierarchical visual cues from global scene context to fine-grained regional details directly into the model's latent representations. This enables the model to perform grounded, multi-step inference entirely in the aligned latent space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that test-time scaling is effective when incorporating vision knowledge, and that integrating hierarchical information significantly enhances the model's understanding of complex scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a Simplicity Paradox in SOTA OOD detection models, where they perform well on subtle semantic OOD samples but fail on structurally distinct or noisy ones due to Semantic Hegemony. It proposes D-KNN, a geometric decoupling framework, to address this issue, showing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection models exhibit a counter-intuitive weakness (Simplicity Paradox) despite their sensitivity to subtle semantic shifts. The authors aim to uncover the root cause (Semantic Hegemony) and provide a solution.

Method: The authors propose D-KNN, a training-free framework using orthogonal decomposition to separate semantic and structural components, with dual-space calibration to enhance sensitivity to residual signals.

Result: D-KNN significantly improves OOD detection, reducing FPR95 from 31.3% to 2.3% and boosting AUROC from 79.7% to 94.9% for noisy samples.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the Simplicity Paradox by mitigating Semantic Hegemony, establishing D-KNN as a new SOTA method for OOD detection on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: While feature-based post-hoc methods have made significant strides in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, we uncover a counter-intuitive Simplicity Paradox in existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models: these models exhibit keen sensitivity in distinguishing semantically subtle OOD samples but suffer from severe Geometric Blindness when confronting structurally distinct yet semantically simple samples or high-frequency sensor noise. We attribute this phenomenon to Semantic Hegemony within the deep feature space and reveal its mathematical essence through the lens of Neural Collapse. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the spectral concentration bias, induced by the high variance of the principal subspace, numerically masks the structural distribution shift signals that should be significant in the residual subspace. To address this issue, we propose D-KNN, a training-free, plug-and-play geometric decoupling framework. This method utilizes orthogonal decomposition to explicitly separate semantic components from structural residuals and introduces a dual-space calibration mechanism to reactivate the model's sensitivity to weak residual signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-KNN effectively breaks Semantic Hegemony, establishing new SOTA performance on both CIFAR and ImageNet benchmarks. Notably, in resolving the Simplicity Paradox, it reduces the FPR95 from 31.3% to 2.3%; when addressing sensor failures such as Gaussian noise, it boosts the detection performance (AUROC) from a baseline of 79.7% to 94.9%.

TL;DR: CityGenAgent is a framework for generating high-quality 3D cities using natural language, with superior controllability and visual quality compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The automated generation of interactive 3D cities is crucial for applications like autonomous driving and virtual reality, but current methods lack high-fidelity asset creation and controllability.

Method: CityGenAgent decomposes city generation into Block Program and Building Program, using supervised fine-tuning for schema adherence and reinforcement learning for spatial and visual alignment.

Result: The framework achieves better semantic alignment, visual quality, and controllability than existing methods.

Conclusion: CityGenAgent provides a scalable and robust solution for 3D city generation, supporting natural language editing.

Abstract: The automated generation of interactive 3D cities is a critical challenge with broad applications in autonomous driving, virtual reality, and embodied intelligence. While recent advances in generative models and procedural techniques have improved the realism of city generation, existing methods often struggle with high-fidelity asset creation, controllability, and manipulation. In this work, we introduce CityGenAgent, a natural language-driven framework for hierarchical procedural generation of high-quality 3D cities. Our approach decomposes city generation into two interpretable components, Block Program and Building Program. To ensure structural correctness and semantic alignment, we adopt a two-stage learning strategy: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We train BlockGen and BuildingGen to generate valid programs that adhere to schema constraints, including non-self-intersecting polygons and complete fields; (2) Reinforcement Learning (RL). We design Spatial Alignment Reward to enhance spatial reasoning ability and Visual Consistency Reward to bridge the gap between textual descriptions and the visual modality. Benefiting from the programs and the models' generalization, CityGenAgent supports natural language editing and manipulation. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate superior semantic alignment, visual quality, and controllability compared to existing methods, establishing a robust foundation for scalable 3D city generation.

### [33] [SAIL: Self-Amplified Iterative Learning for Diffusion Model Alignment with Minimal Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05380)
*Xiaoxuan He,Siming Fu,Wanli Li,Zhiyuan Li,Dacheng Yin,Kang Rong,Fengyun Rao,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAIL is a novel framework for aligning diffusion models with human preferences using minimal feedback, leveraging iterative self-improvement and ranked preference mixup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alignment of diffusion models with human preferences is challenging without reward models or large-scale datasets, prompting exploration of latent model capabilities.

Method: SAIL uses self-amplified iterative learning: the model generates samples, self-annotates preferences, and refines itself with minimal human feedback.

Result: SAIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods with only 6% of the required preference data, demonstrating strong self-improvement capabilities.

Conclusion: Diffusion models can effectively align with human preferences using minimal feedback, reducing reliance on large-scale annotation and external reward models.

Abstract: Aligning diffusion models with human preferences remains challenging, particularly when reward models are unavailable or impractical to obtain, and collecting large-scale preference datasets is prohibitively expensive. \textit{This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve effective alignment using only minimal human feedback, without auxiliary reward models, by unlocking the latent capabilities within diffusion models themselves?} In this paper, we propose \textbf{SAIL} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{A}mplified \textbf{I}terative \textbf{L}earning), a novel framework that enables diffusion models to act as their own teachers through iterative self-improvement. Starting from a minimal seed set of human-annotated preference pairs, SAIL operates in a closed-loop manner where the model progressively generates diverse samples, self-annotates preferences based on its evolving understanding, and refines itself using this self-augmented dataset. To ensure robust learning and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a ranked preference mixup strategy that carefully balances exploration with adherence to initial human priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAIL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks while using merely 6\% of the preference data required by existing approaches, revealing that diffusion models possess remarkable self-improvement capabilities that, when properly harnessed, can effectively replace both large-scale human annotation and external reward models.

### [34] [VRIQ: Benchmarking and Analyzing Visual-Reasoning IQ of VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05382)
*Tina Khezresmaeilzadeh,Jike Zhong,Konstantinos Psounis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VRIQ, a benchmark to assess VLMs' nonverbal reasoning, finding weak performance on abstract and natural tasks. Failures are mostly due to perception issues, with minimal improvement from reasoning tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate VLMs' ability to perform nonverbal reasoning and identify weaknesses in their perception and reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces VRIQ benchmark with abstract puzzle-style and natural-image tasks, evaluates models, and uses diagnostic probes to pinpoint failure sources.

Result: VLMs perform poorly on abstract tasks (28% accuracy) and modestly on natural tasks (45%). Failures are 56% perception-based, 43% perception-reasoning combined, and 1% reasoning alone.

Conclusion: Current VLMs struggle with abstract reasoning, largely due to perception limitations, highlighting the need for improvement in multimodal systems.

Abstract: Recent progress in Vision Language Models (VLMs) has raised the question of whether they can reliably perform nonverbal reasoning. To this end, we introduce VRIQ (Visual Reasoning IQ), a novel benchmark designed to assess and analyze the visual reasoning ability of VLMs. We evaluate models on two sets of tasks: abstract puzzle-style and natural-image reasoning tasks. We find that on abstract puzzles, performance remains near random with an average accuracy of around 28%, while natural tasks yield better but still weak results with 45% accuracy. We also find that tool-augmented reasoning demonstrates only modest improvements. To uncover the source of this weakness, we introduce diagnostic probes targeting perception and reasoning. Our analysis demonstrates that around 56% of failures arise from perception alone, 43% from both perception and reasoning, and only a mere 1% from reasoning alone. This motivates us to design fine-grained diagnostic probe questions targeting specific perception categories (e.g., shape, count, position, 3D/depth), revealing that certain categories cause more failures than others. Our benchmark and analysis establish that current VLMs, even with visual reasoning tools, remain unreliable abstract reasoners, mostly due to perception limitations, and offer a principled basis for improving visual reasoning in multimodal systems.

### [35] [Dolphin-v2: Universal Document Parsing via Scalable Anchor Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05384)
*Hao Feng,Wei Shi,Ke Zhang,Xiang Fei,Lei Liao,Dingkang Yang,Yongkun Du,Xuecheng Wu,Jingqun Tang,Yang Liu,Hong Chen,Can Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dolphin-v2 is an advanced document image parsing model that improves layout analysis and parsing for both digital-born and photographed documents, offering finer-grained detection, semantic extraction, and robustness against distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fragmentation of specialized models and limitations in handling distorted or photographed documents motivate the development of Dolphin-v2 for scalable and efficient document parsing.

Method: Dolphin-v2 uses a two-stage approach: document type classification and layout analysis in the first stage, followed by hybrid parsing (holistic for photographed, element-wise for digital-born) guided by layout anchors.

Result: The model achieves +14.78 points overall on OmniDocBench, reduces errors by 91% on photographed documents, and supports finer-grained detection and semantic extraction.

Conclusion: Dolphin-v2 significantly advances document parsing by addressing fragmentation and distortion challenges, offering robust performance and efficient inference.

Abstract: Document parsing has garnered widespread attention as vision-language models (VLMs) advance OCR capabilities. However, the field remains fragmented across dozens of specialized models with varying strengths, forcing users to navigate complex model selection and limiting system scalability. Moreover, existing two-stage approaches depend on axis-aligned bounding boxes for layout detection, failing to handle distorted or photographed documents effectively. To this end, we present Dolphin-v2, a two-stage document image parsing model that substantially improves upon the original Dolphin. In the first stage, Dolphin-v2 jointly performs document type classification (digital-born versus photographed) alongside layout analysis. For digital-born documents, it conducts finer-grained element detection with reading order prediction. In the second stage, we employ a hybrid parsing strategy: photographed documents are parsed holistically as complete pages to handle geometric distortions, while digital-born documents undergo element-wise parallel parsing guided by the detected layout anchors, enabling efficient content extraction. Compared with the original Dolphin, Dolphin-v2 introduces several crucial enhancements: (1) robust parsing of photographed documents via holistic page-level understanding, (2) finer-grained element detection (21 categories) with semantic attribute extraction such as author information and document metadata, and (3) code block recognition with indentation preservation, which existing systems typically lack. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on DocPTBench, OmniDocBench, and our self-constructed RealDoc-160 benchmark. The results demonstrate substantial improvements: +14.78 points overall on the challenging OmniDocBench and 91% error reduction on photographed documents, while maintaining efficient inference through parallel processing.

*Zolnamar Dorjsembe,Hung-Yi Chen,Furen Xiao,Hsing-Kuo Pao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Parallel Swin Transformer-Enhanced Med2Transformer for synthetic CT generation from MRI to simplify radiotherapy workflows, improving anatomical fidelity and dosimetric accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI lacks electron density info needed for radiotherapy dose calculation, requiring combined MRI-CT workflows, which are complex and introduce registration errors. Synthetic CT generation can streamline this.

Method: A 3D architecture combining convolutional encoding with dual Swin Transformer branches captures local details and long-range context. Multi-scale shifted window attention enhances anatomical fidelity.

Result: The method outperforms baselines in image similarity and geometric accuracy. Dosimetric evaluation shows a mean target dose error of 1.69%, clinically acceptable.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively generates synthetic CTs from MRIs, reducing reliance on CT scans and improving radiotherapy planning accuracy.

Abstract: MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast without ionizing radiation; however, the absence of electron density information limits its direct use for dose calculation. As a result, current radiotherapy workflows rely on combined MRI and CT acquisitions, increasing registration uncertainty and procedural complexity. Synthetic CT generation enables MRI only planning but remains challenging due to nonlinear MRI-CT relationships and anatomical variability. We propose Parallel Swin Transformer-Enhanced Med2Transformer, a 3D architecture that integrates convolutional encoding with dual Swin Transformer branches to model both local anatomical detail and long-range contextual dependencies. Multi-scale shifted window attention with hierarchical feature aggregation improves anatomical fidelity. Experiments on public and clinical datasets demonstrate higher image similarity and improved geometric accuracy compared with baseline methods. Dosimetric evaluation shows clinically acceptable performance, with a mean target dose error of 1.69%. Code is available at: https://github.com/mobaidoctor/med2transformer.

### [37] [Dataset Distillation via Relative Distribution Matching and Cognitive Heritage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05391)
*Qianxin Xia,Jiawei Du,Yuhan Zhang,Jielei Wang,Guoming Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces statistical flow matching, a more efficient and stable method for dataset distillation, reducing computational and memory costs while maintaining or improving performance compared to existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to reduce the computational and memory overhead of dataset distillation methods, while maintaining performance, drives this work.

Method: The paper proposes statistical flow matching, which aligns synthetic images with constant statistical flows from target class centers to non-target class centers, and a classifier inheritance strategy for efficient inference.

Result: The method achieves comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art techniques with 10x lower GPU memory usage and 4x shorter runtime.

Conclusion: Statistical flow matching and classifier inheritance offer a computationally efficient and high-performing solution for dataset distillation.

Abstract: Dataset distillation seeks to synthesize a highly compact dataset that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset on downstream tasks. For the classification task that use pre-trained self-supervised models as backbones, previous linear gradient matching optimizes synthetic images by encouraging them to mimic the gradient updates induced by real images on the linear classifier. However, this batch-level formulation requires loading thousands of real images and applying multiple rounds of differentiable augmentations to synthetic images at each distillation step, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we introduce statistical flow matching , a stable and efficient supervised learning framework that optimizes synthetic images by aligning constant statistical flows from target class centers to non-target class centers in the original data. Our approach loads raw statistics only once and performs a single augmentation pass on the synthetic data, achieving performance comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods with 10x lower GPU memory usage and 4x shorter runtime. Furthermore, we propose a classifier inheritance strategy that reuses the classifier trained on the original dataset for inference, requiring only an extremely lightweight linear projector and marginal storage while achieving substantial performance gains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Manifold-Aware Diffusion (MAD) for biologically plausible cell nuclei editing in pathomics, addressing feature correlation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathomics features are hard to interpret across clinical contexts, and existing methods ignore feature correlations, leading to unrealistic artifacts.

Method: MAD uses a VAE-learned disentangled latent space to regulate feature trajectories and guides a conditional diffusion model for realistic edits.

Result: MAD outperforms baselines in feature editing while maintaining structural coherence.

Conclusion: The framework enables interpretable and realistic pathomics feature manipulation, advancing explainability in digital pathology.

Abstract: Pathomics is a recent approach that offers rich quantitative features beyond what black-box deep learning can provide, supporting more reproducible and explainable biomarkers in digital pathology. However, many derived features (e.g., "second-order moment") remain difficult to interpret, especially across different clinical contexts, which limits their practical adoption. Conditional diffusion models show promise for explainability through feature editing, but they typically assume feature independence**--**an assumption violated by intrinsically correlated pathomics features. Consequently, editing one feature while fixing others can push the model off the biological manifold and produce unrealistic artifacts. To address this, we propose a Manifold-Aware Diffusion (MAD) framework for controllable and biologically plausible cell nuclei editing. Unlike existing approaches, our method regularizes feature trajectories within a disentangled latent space learned by a variational auto-encoder (VAE). This ensures that manipulating a target feature automatically adjusts correlated attributes to remain within the learned distribution of real cells. These optimized features then guide a conditional diffusion model to synthesize high-fidelity images. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to navigate the manifold of pathomics features when editing those features. The proposed method outperforms baseline methods in conditional feature editing while preserving structural coherence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TSBOW, a comprehensive dataset for occluded vehicle detection in various extreme weather conditions, addressing limitations in existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global warming's impact on weather events degrades CCTV and traffic quality, increasing accidents. Existing datasets lack extreme weather coverage, necessitating TSBOW.

Method: TSBOW includes over 32 hours of real-world traffic data, with 48,000 manually annotated and 3.2M semi-labeled frames across eight participant classes.

Result: The dataset establishes a benchmark for object detection under occlusion and adverse weather, aiding Intelligent Transportation Systems.

Conclusion: TSBOW advances CCTV-based traffic monitoring and opens new research avenues, with the dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Global warming has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, which degrade CCTV signal and video quality while disrupting traffic flow, thereby increasing traffic accident rates. Existing datasets, often limited to light haze, rain, and snow, fail to capture extreme weather conditions. To address this gap, this study introduces the Traffic Surveillance Benchmark for Occluded vehicles under various Weather conditions (TSBOW), a comprehensive dataset designed to enhance occluded vehicle detection across diverse annual weather scenarios. Comprising over 32 hours of real-world traffic data from densely populated urban areas, TSBOW includes more than 48,000 manually annotated and 3.2 million semi-labeled frames; bounding boxes spanning eight traffic participant classes from large vehicles to micromobility devices and pedestrians. We establish an object detection benchmark for TSBOW, highlighting challenges posed by occlusions and adverse weather. With its varied road types, scales, and viewpoints, TSBOW serves as a critical resource for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems. Our findings underscore the potential of CCTV-based traffic monitoring, pave the way for new research and applications.

*Ningkang Peng,Qianfeng Yu,Yuhao Zhang,Yafei Liu,Xiaoqian Peng,Peirong Ma,Yi Chen,Peiheng Li,Yanhui Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel data-free framework for OOD detection under long-tailed distributions introduces virtual outlier synthesis and dual-granularity semantic loss to eliminate reliance on external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods depend heavily on large external datasets, which are costly and privacy-sensitive. The goal is to develop a data-free solution.

Method: Proposes Geometry-guided virtual Outlier Synthesis (GOS) using vMF distribution for directional sampling and Dual-Granularity Semantic Loss (DGS) via contrastive learning.

Result: The framework outperforms SOTA methods using real external datasets on benchmarks like CIFAR-LT.

Conclusion: The study successfully eliminates external data reliance while maintaining superior OOD detection performance.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection under long-tailed distributions is a highly challenging task because the scarcity of samples in tail classes leads to blurred decision boundaries in the feature space. Current state-of-the-art (sota) methods typically employ Outlier Exposure (OE) strategies, relying on large-scale real external datasets (such as 80 Million Tiny Images) to regularize the feature space. However, this dependence on external data often becomes infeasible in practical deployment due to high data acquisition costs and privacy sensitivity. To this end, we propose a novel data-free framework aimed at completely eliminating reliance on external datasets while maintaining superior detection performance. We introduce a Geometry-guided virtual Outlier Synthesis (GOS) strategy that models statistical properties using the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a hypersphere. Specifically, we locate a low-likelihood annulus in the feature space and perform directional sampling of virtual outliers in this region. Simultaneously, we introduce a new Dual-Granularity Semantic Loss (DGS) that utilizes contrastive learning to maximize the distinction between in-distribution (ID) features and these synthesized boundary outliers. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms sota approaches that utilize external real images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Disco, a framework for cell instance segmentation in dense and complex cellular regions, addressing limitations of existing methods by analyzing chromatic properties of cell graphs and proposing a novel adjacency-aware coloring approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex and dense cellular regions. Graph coloring-based methods offer potential but lack validation in real-world scenarios, prompting the creation of a new dataset (GBC-FS 2025) and systematic analysis of chromatic properties.

Method: Proposes Disco, combining a data-driven topological labeling strategy ('Explicit Marking') and a constrained deep learning system ('Implicit Disambiguation') to resolve adjacency conflicts through recursive decomposition and feature dissimilarity enforcement.

Result: Reveals that real-world cell graphs are non-bipartite with odd-length cycles, making 2-coloring insufficient. Disco effectively handles dense overlaps and complex topologies by addressing adjacency conflicts.

Conclusion: Disco outperforms traditional methods by integrating topological insights and deep learning, providing a robust solution for dense cell instance segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate cell instance segmentation is foundational for digital pathology analysis. Existing methods based on contour detection and distance mapping still face significant challenges in processing complex and dense cellular regions. Graph coloring-based methods provide a new paradigm for this task, yet the effectiveness of this paradigm in real-world scenarios with dense overlaps and complex topologies has not been verified. Addressing this issue, we release a large-scale dataset GBC-FS 2025, which contains highly complex and dense sub-cellular nuclear arrangements. We conduct the first systematic analysis of the chromatic properties of cell adjacency graphs across four diverse datasets and reveal an important discovery: most real-world cell graphs are non-bipartite, with a high prevalence of odd-length cycles (predominantly triangles). This makes simple 2-coloring theory insufficient for handling complex tissues, while higher-chromaticity models would cause representational redundancy and optimization difficulties. Building on this observation of complex real-world contexts, we propose Disco (Densely-overlapping Cell Instance Segmentation via Adjacency-aware COllaborative Coloring), an adjacency-aware framework based on the "divide and conquer" principle. It uniquely combines a data-driven topological labeling strategy with a constrained deep learning system to resolve complex adjacency conflicts. First, "Explicit Marking" strategy transforms the topological challenge into a learnable classification task by recursively decomposing the cell graph and isolating a "conflict set." Second, "Implicit Disambiguation" mechanism resolves ambiguities in conflict regions by enforcing feature dissimilarity between different instances, enabling the model to learn separable feature representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeVStereo integrates NeRF-based novel view synthesis (NVS) and multi-view stereo for accurate poses, depth, rendering, and surfaces from RGB-only inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either lack explicit NVS output (feed-forward systems) or rely on fixed camera poses (neural rendering), making it challenging to achieve all desired outputs in one framework.

Method: NeVStereo combines NeRF-based NVS for stereo renderings, confidence-guided depth estimation, NeRF-coupled pose refinement, and iterative refinement to improve geometric consistency.

Result: NeVStereo achieves 36% lower depth error, 10.4% better pose accuracy, 4.5% higher NVS fidelity, and state-of-the-art mesh quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: NeVStereo successfully unifies accurate poses, depth, rendering, and surface reconstruction in a single framework, outperforming existing methods across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: In modern dense 3D reconstruction, feed-forward systems (e.g., VGGT, pi3) focus on end-to-end matching and geometry prediction but do not explicitly output the novel view synthesis (NVS). Neural rendering-based approaches offer high-fidelity NVS and detailed geometry from posed images, yet they typically assume fixed camera poses and can be sensitive to pose errors. As a result, it remains non-trivial to obtain a single framework that can offer accurate poses, reliable depth, high-quality rendering, and accurate 3D surfaces from casually captured views. We present NeVStereo, a NeRF-driven NVS-stereo architecture that aims to jointly deliver camera poses, multi-view depth, novel view synthesis, and surface reconstruction from multi-view RGB-only inputs. NeVStereo combines NeRF-based NVS for stereo-friendly renderings, confidence-guided multi-view depth estimation, NeRF-coupled bundle adjustment for pose refinement, and an iterative refinement stage that updates both depth and the radiance field to improve geometric consistency. This design mitigated the common NeRF-based issues such as surface stacking, artifacts, and pose-depth coupling. Across indoor, outdoor, tabletop, and aerial benchmarks, our experiments indicate that NeVStereo achieves consistently strong zero-shot performance, with up to 36% lower depth error, 10.4% improved pose accuracy, 4.5% higher NVS fidelity, and state-of-the-art mesh quality (F1 91.93%, Chamfer 4.35 mm) compared to existing prestigious methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-AD, a CNN-based unsupervised anomaly detection model using SE blocks and knowledge distillation, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in medical and industrial domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of annotated data in cross-domain anomaly detection, crucial for early disease diagnosis and industrial defect detection.

Method: Uses SE blocks for feature extraction, knowledge distillation for learning normal-anomaly differences, and a discriminator network to enhance detection. Multi-scale features detect varying anomaly sizes.

Result: Achieved best average AUROC scores (81.4%-99.6% for image-level, 97.0%-98.4% for pixel-level) on medical and industrial datasets.

Conclusion: Multi-AD generalizes well across domains, making it effective for real-world anomaly detection applications.

Abstract: Traditional deep learning models often lack annotated data, especially in cross-domain applications such as anomaly detection, which is critical for early disease diagnosis in medicine and defect detection in industry. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-AD, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for robust unsupervised anomaly detection across medical and industrial images. Our approach employs the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block to enhance feature extraction via channel-wise attention, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant features and detect subtle anomalies. Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers informative features from the teacher to the student model, enabling effective learning of the differences between normal and anomalous data. Then, the discriminator network further enhances the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous data. At the inference stage, by integrating multi-scale features, the student model can detect anomalies of varying sizes. The teacher-student (T-S) architecture ensures consistent representation of high-dimensional features while adapting them to enhance anomaly detection. Multi-AD was evaluated on several medical datasets, including brain MRI, liver CT, and retina OCT, as well as industrial datasets, such as MVTec AD, demonstrating strong generalization across multiple domains. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach consistently outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving the best average AUROC for both image-level (81.4% for medical and 99.6% for industrial) and pixel-level (97.0% for medical and 98.4% for industrial) tasks, making it effective for real-world applications.

*Sanghoon Jeon,Gihyun Jung,Suhyeon Ka,Jae-Sang Hyun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LD-SLRO, a latent diffusion-based method to improve 3D reconstruction of highly reflective objects by restoring distorted fringe patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High reflectivity and low surface roughness in objects cause severe distortion or loss of fringe patterns in 3D reconstruction, necessitating an effective solution.

Method: LD-SLRO encodes latent representations from fringe images, uses a diffusion model to suppress artifacts, and incorporates specialized modules like specular reflection encoders and attention mechanisms.

Result: The method reduces reconstruction error significantly, from 1.8176 mm to 0.9619 mm, outperforming existing techniques.

Conclusion: LD-SLRO effectively addresses reflection-induced artifacts, enhancing fringe quality and 3D reconstruction accuracy for glossy surfaces.

Abstract: Fringe projection profilometry-based 3-D reconstruction of objects with high reflectivity and low surface roughness remains a significant challenge. When measuring such glossy surfaces, specular reflection and indirect illumination often lead to severe distortion or loss of the projected fringe patterns. To address these issues, we propose a latent diffusion-based structured light for reflective objects (LD-SLRO). Phase-shifted fringe images captured from highly reflective surfaces are first encoded to extract latent representations that capture surface reflectance characteristics. These latent features are then used as conditional inputs to a latent diffusion model, which probabilistically suppresses reflection-induced artifacts and recover lost fringe information, yielding high-quality fringe images. The proposed components, including the specular reflection encoder, time-variant channel affine layer, and attention modules, further improve fringe restoration quality. In addition, LD-SLRO provides high flexibility in configuring the input and output fringe sets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves both fringe quality and 3-D reconstruction accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, reducing the average root-mean-squared error from 1.8176 mm to 0.9619 mm.

*Donglin Yang,Yongxing Zhang,Xin Yu,Liang Hou,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Xiaojuan Qi,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stable Velocity, a framework addressing high-variance issues in flow matching by improving training and sampling efficiency without compromising quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow matching's reliance on single-sample conditional velocities causes high-variance training targets, destabilizing optimization and slowing convergence.

Method: Proposes Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM) for variance reduction and Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA) for adaptive supervision. Also introduces Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS) for inference acceleration.

Result: Demonstrates improved training efficiency and over 2× faster sampling on ImageNet and large pretrained models without quality loss.

Conclusion: Stable Velocity effectively reduces training variance and accelerates sampling, making it a practical enhancement for flow matching.

Abstract: While flow matching is elegant, its reliance on single-sample conditional velocities leads to high-variance training targets that destabilize optimization and slow convergence. By explicitly characterizing this variance, we identify 1) a high-variance regime near the prior, where optimization is challenging, and 2) a low-variance regime near the data distribution, where conditional and marginal velocities nearly coincide. Leveraging this insight, we propose Stable Velocity, a unified framework that improves both training and sampling. For training, we introduce Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM), an unbiased variance-reduction objective, along with Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA), which adaptively strengthen auxiliary supervision in the low-variance regime. For inference, we show that dynamics in the low-variance regime admit closed-form simplifications, enabling Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS), a finetuning-free acceleration. Extensive experiments on ImageNet $256\times256$ and large pretrained text-to-image and text-to-video models, including SD3.5, Flux, Qwen-Image, and Wan2.2, demonstrate consistent improvements in training efficiency and more than $2\times$ faster sampling within the low-variance regime without degrading sample quality.

Result: Variable and arbitrarily large synthetic datasets with pixel-perfect annotations, including rare defects.

Conclusion: The approach enables scalable synthetic data generation for various NDT methods, enhancing automated defect detection training.

Abstract: In industry, defect detection is crucial for quality control. Non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are preferred as they do not influence the functionality of the object while inspecting. Automated data evaluation for automated defect detection is a growing field of research. In particular, machine learning approaches show promising results. To provide training data in sufficient amount and quality, synthetic data can be used. Rule-based approaches enable synthetic data generation in a controllable environment. Therefore, a digital twin of the inspected object including synthetic defects is needed. We present parametric methods to model 3d mesh objects of various defect types that can then be added to the object geometry to obtain synthetic defective objects. The models are motivated by common defects in metal casting but can be transferred to other machining procedures that produce similar defect shapes. Synthetic data resembling the real inspection data can then be created by using a physically based Monte Carlo simulation of the respective testing method. Using our defect models, a variable and arbitrarily large synthetic data set can be generated with the possibility to include rarely occurring defects in sufficient quantity. Pixel-perfect annotation can be created in parallel. As an example, we will use visual surface inspection, but the procedure can be applied in combination with simulations for any other NDT method.

*Chang Zou,Changlin Li,Yang Li,Patrol Li,Jianbing Wu,Xiao He,Songtao Liu,Zhao Zhong,Kailin Huang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a learnable feature caching mechanism compatible with distillation to accelerate diffusion models in video generation, achieving 11.8× speedup without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like Feature Caching and step-distillation face quality degradation in video generation with high compression or fewer steps. The paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The authors propose a lightweight learnable neural predictor for feature caching and introduce a Restricted MeanFlow approach for stable distillation in large-scale video models.

Result: The method achieves an 11.8× acceleration while preserving generation quality, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed distillation-compatible learnable feature caching and Restricted MeanFlow approach effectively balance speed and quality in video generation.

Abstract: While diffusion models have achieved great success in the field of video generation, this progress is accompanied by a rapidly escalating computational burden. Among the existing acceleration methods, Feature Caching is popular due to its training-free property and considerable speedup performance, but it inevitably faces semantic and detail drop with further compression. Another widely adopted method, training-aware step-distillation, though successful in image generation, also faces drastic degradation in video generation with a few steps. Furthermore, the quality loss becomes more severe when simply applying training-free feature caching to the step-distilled models, due to the sparser sampling steps. This paper novelly introduces a distillation-compatible learnable feature caching mechanism for the first time. We employ a lightweight learnable neural predictor instead of traditional training-free heuristics for diffusion models, enabling a more accurate capture of the high-dimensional feature evolution process. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of highly compressed distillation on large-scale video models and propose a conservative Restricted MeanFlow approach to achieve more stable and lossless distillation. By undertaking these initiatives, we further push the acceleration boundaries to $11.8\times$ while preserving generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is in the supplementary materials and will be publicly available.

*Yue Lu,Xiangyu Zhou,Shizhou Zhang,Yinghui Xing,Guoqiang Liang,Wencong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel attention-retaining framework mitigates catastrophic forgetting in Vision Transformers by preventing attention drift during continual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting hinders continual learning; attention drift in Vision Transformers is identified as a key issue.

Method: The framework uses gradient masking via instance-adaptive binary masks and scaled updates to retain attention from previous tasks.

Result: The method effectively reduces forgetting, preserves visual concepts, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses attention drift, enhancing continual learning robustness.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers AI systems to progressively acquire knowledge from non-stationary data streams. However, catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge. In this work, we identify attention drift in Vision Transformers as a primary source of catastrophic forgetting, where the attention to previously learned visual concepts shifts significantly after learning new tasks. Inspired by neuroscientific insights into the selective attention in the human visual system, we propose a novel attention-retaining framework to mitigate forgetting in CL. Our method constrains attention drift by explicitly modifying gradients during backpropagation through a two-step process: 1) extracting attention maps of the previous task using a layer-wise rollout mechanism and generating instance-adaptive binary masks, and 2) when learning a new task, applying these masks to zero out gradients associated with previous attention regions, thereby preventing disruption of learned visual concepts. For compatibility with modern optimizers, the gradient masking process is further enhanced by scaling parameter updates proportionally to maintain their relative magnitudes. Experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and preserving visual concepts. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits robust generalizability across diverse CL scenarios.

*Dekang Qi,Shuang Zeng,Xinyuan Chang,Feng Xiong,Shichao Xie,Xiaolong Wu,Mu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Memory-Execute-Review framework for Visual Language Navigation (VLN), aiming to improve success rates and generalization simultaneously, outperforming existing methods in both Training-Free and Supervised Fine-Tuning settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN methods struggle to achieve high success rates and strong generalization simultaneously, prompting the development of a new framework.

Method: Proposes a Memory-Execute-Review framework with hierarchical memory, execute, and review modules to enhance navigation performance.

Result: Achieved absolute improvements of 7% and 5% in success rates under Training-Free and Zero-Shot settings, respectively, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances success rates and generalization, demonstrating superior performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is one of the fundamental capabilities for embodied intelligence and a critical challenge that urgently needs to be addressed. However, existing methods are still unsatisfactory in terms of both success rate (SR) and generalization: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) approaches typically achieve higher SR, while Training-Free (TF) approaches often generalize better, but it is difficult to obtain both simultaneously. To this end, we propose a Memory-Execute-Review framework. It consists of three parts: a hierarchical memory module for providing information support, an execute module for routine decision-making and actions, and a review module for handling abnormal situations and correcting behavior. We validated the effectiveness of this framework on the Object Goal Navigation task. Across 4 datasets, our average SR achieved absolute improvements of 7% and 5% compared to all baseline methods under TF and Zero-Shot (ZS) settings, respectively. On the most commonly used HM3D_v0.1 and the more challenging open vocabulary dataset HM3D_OVON, the SR improved by 8% and 6%, under ZS settings. Furthermore, on the MP3D and HM3D_OVON datasets, our method not only outperformed all TF methods but also surpassed all SFT methods, achieving comprehensive leadership in both SR (5% and 2%) and generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces SOMA-1M, a large, precisely aligned SAR-optical dataset for multi-scale foundation models, enhancing performance in vision tasks like image matching and fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcomes limitations of single-modality datasets with insufficient scale and alignment accuracy to support robust multimodal algorithms.

Method: Develops a coarse-to-fine image matching framework for pixel-level alignment and integrates multi-source imagery for global coverage.

Result: Supervised training on SOMA-1M boosts performance in four vision tasks, achieving SOTA in MRSI matching.

Conclusion: SOMA-1M is a foundational resource for multimodal remote sensing algorithms and foundation models.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery provide complementary strengths that constitute the critical foundation for transcending single-modality constraints and facilitating cross-modal collaborative processing and intelligent interpretation. However, existing benchmark datasets often suffer from limitations such as single spatial resolution, insufficient data scale, and low alignment accuracy, making them inadequate for supporting the training and generalization of multi-scale foundation models. To address these challenges, we introduce SOMA-1M (SAR-Optical Multi-resolution Alignment), a pixel-level precisely aligned dataset containing over 1.3 million pairs of georeferenced images with a specification of 512 x 512 pixels. This dataset integrates imagery from Sentinel-1, PIESAT-1, Capella Space, and Google Earth, achieving global multi-scale coverage from 0.5 m to 10 m. It encompasses 12 typical land cover categories, effectively ensuring scene diversity and complexity. To address multimodal projection deformation and massive data registration, we designed a rigorous coarse-to-fine image matching framework ensuring pixel-level alignment. Based on this dataset, we established comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for four hierarchical vision tasks, including image matching, image fusion, SAR-assisted cloud removal, and cross-modal translation, involving over 30 mainstream algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that supervised training on SOMA-1M significantly enhances performance across all tasks. Notably, multimodal remote sensing image (MRSI) matching performance achieves current state-of-the-art (SOTA) levels. SOMA-1M serves as a foundational resource for robust multimodal algorithms and remote sensing foundation models. The dataset will be released publicly at: https://github.com/PeihaoWu/SOMA-1M.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The report presents PFSeq dataset and experiments to find optimal feature detectors/descriptors for fisheye images, focusing on self-calibration for urban visual odometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the chicken-and-egg problem of needing good features for calibration while requiring calibration for optimal feature detection in fisheye images.

Method: Uses fisheye sequences (PFSeq dataset) and evaluates feature detectors/descriptors for self-calibration, targeting zenith-mounted car cameras.

Result: Provides a dataset (PFSeq) and experimental insights but lacks peer review or updates post-2014.

Conclusion: The work serves as foundational research for fisheye-based visual odometry, though outdated and unpublished.

Abstract: What is this report: This is a scientific report, contributing with a detailed bibliography, a dataset which we will call now PFSeq for ''Photorealistic Fisheye Sequence'' and make available at https://doi.org/10. 57745/DYIVVU, and comprehensive experiments. This work should be considered as a draft, and has been done during my PhD thesis ''Construction of 3D models from fisheye video data-Application to the localisation in urban area'' in 2014 [Mor16]. These results have never been published. The aim was to find the best features detector and descriptor for fisheye images, in the context of selfcalibration, with cameras mounted on the top of a car and aiming at the zenith (to proceed then fisheye visual odometry and stereovision in urban scenes). We face a chicken and egg problem, because we can not take advantage of an accurate projection model for an optimal features detection and description, and we rightly need good features to perform the calibration (i.e. to compute the accurate projection model of the camera). What is not this report: It does not contribute with new features algorithm. It does not compare standard features algorithms to algorithms designed for omnidirectional images (unfortunately). It has not been peer-reviewed. Discussions have been translated and enhanced but the experiments have not been run again and the report has not been updated accordingly to the evolution of the state-of-the-art (read this as a 2014 report).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGGT-Motion proposes a calibration-free SLAM system addressing severe scale drift in long sequences with motion-aware submap construction and efficient alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle severe scale drift and computational inefficiency in calibration-free monocular SLAM for long sequences.

Method: Uses motion-aware submap construction guided by optical flow, anchor-driven Sim(3) registration, and lightweight pose graph optimization.

Result: Significantly improves trajectory accuracy and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: VGGT-Motion efficiently ensures global consistency in long-range, calibration-free SLAM.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in calibration-free monocular SLAM via 3D vision foundation models, scale drift remains severe on long sequences. Motion-agnostic partitioning breaks contextual coherence and causes zero-motion drift, while conventional geometric alignment is computationally expensive. To address these issues, we propose VGGT-Motion, a calibration-free SLAM system for efficient and robust global consistency over kilometer-scale trajectories. Specifically, we first propose a motion-aware submap construction mechanism that uses optical flow to guide adaptive partitioning, prune static redundancy, and encapsulate turns for stable local geometry. We then design an anchor-driven direct Sim(3) registration strategy. By exploiting context-balanced anchors, it achieves search-free, pixel-wise dense alignment and efficient loop closure without costly feature matching. Finally, a lightweight submap-level pose graph optimization enforces global consistency with linear complexity, enabling scalable long-range operation. Experiments show that VGGT-Motion markedly improves trajectory accuracy and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, long-range calibration-free monocular SLAM.

*Jeongbin You,Donggun Kim,Sejun Park,Seungsang Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mapper-GIN uses topology-inspired decomposition and graph classification for robust 3D point cloud classification, achieving competitive results with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robustness in 3D point cloud classification through structural abstraction rather than scaling up backbones or specialized data augmentation.

Method: Mapper-GIN partitions point clouds into overlapping regions using Mapper (PCA lens, cubical cover, density-based clustering), constructs a region graph, and classifies it with a Graph Isomorphism Network.

Result: Achieves competitive and stable accuracy on ModelNet40-C benchmark under Noise and Transformation corruptions with only 0.5M parameters.

Conclusion: Region-graph structure provides efficient and interpretable robustness for 3D visual recognition.

Abstract: Robust 3D point cloud classification is often pursued by scaling up backbones or relying on specialized data augmentation. We instead ask whether structural abstraction alone can improve robustness, and study a simple topology-inspired decomposition based on the Mapper algorithm. We propose Mapper-GIN, a lightweight pipeline that partitions a point cloud into overlapping regions using Mapper (PCA lens, cubical cover, and followed by density-based clustering), constructs a region graph from their overlaps, and performs graph classification with a Graph Isomorphism Network. On the corruption benchmark ModelNet40-C, Mapper-GIN achieves competitive and stable accuracy under Noise and Transformation corruptions with only 0.5M parameters. In contrast to prior approaches that require heavier architectures or additional mechanisms to gain robustness, Mapper-GIN attains strong corruption robustness through simple region-level graph abstraction and GIN message passing. Overall, our results suggest that region-graph structure offers an efficient and interpretable source of robustness for 3D visual recognition.

TL;DR: Self-supervised learning (SSL) improves transferability of deep learning models across microscopy domains, with domain-relevant pretraining (HPA) yielding the best performance on protein localization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task-specific microscopy datasets are often small, limiting robust feature learning. SSL can help by pretraining on large unlabeled datasets, but transferability across domains is unclear.

Method: Investigated cross-domain transferability using DINO-pretrained Vision Transformers on OpenCell dataset. Evaluated embeddings from ImageNet-1k, HPA, and OpenCell-pretrained models via supervised classification.

Result: All pretrained models transferred well, with HPA-pretrained model achieving best performance (mean macro F1-score = 0.8221). Domain-relevant SSL representations generalize effectively.

Conclusion: Large-scale pretraining and domain-relevant SSL representations enable strong downstream performance even with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Task-specific microscopy datasets are often too small to train deep learning models that learn robust feature representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can mitigate this by pretraining on large unlabeled datasets, but it remains unclear how well such representations transfer across microscopy domains with different staining protocols and channel configurations. We investigate the cross-domain transferability of DINO-pretrained Vision Transformers for protein localization on the OpenCell dataset. We generate image embeddings using three DINO backbones pretrained on ImageNet-1k, the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and OpenCell, and evaluate them by training a supervised classification head on OpenCell labels. All pretrained models transfer well, with the microscopy-specific HPA-pretrained model achieving the best performance (mean macro $F_1$-score = 0.8221 \pm 0.0062), slightly outperforming a DINO model trained directly on OpenCell (0.8057 \pm 0.0090). These results highlight the value of large-scale pretraining and indicate that domain-relevant SSL representations can generalize effectively to related but distinct microscopy datasets, enabling strong downstream performance even when task-specific labeled data are limited.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSG improves VAR image generation by ensuring each scale contributes unique high-frequency content, mitigating drift issues with training-free guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses hierarchy drift in VAR models during inference by leveraging information-theoretic insights.

Method: Introduces Scaled Spatial Guidance (SSG) and Discrete Spatial Enhancement (DSE) for frequency-aware generation.

Result: SSG enhances fidelity and diversity in image synthesis while maintaining low latency.

Conclusion: SSG unlocks untapped efficiency in coarse-to-fine image generation.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (VAR) models generate images through next-scale prediction, naturally achieving coarse-to-fine, fast, high-fidelity synthesis mirroring human perception. In practice, this hierarchy can drift at inference time, as limited capacity and accumulated error cause the model to deviate from its coarse-to-fine nature. We revisit this limitation from an information-theoretic perspective and deduce that ensuring each scale contributes high-frequency content not explained by earlier scales mitigates the train-inference discrepancy. With this insight, we propose Scaled Spatial Guidance (SSG), training-free, inference-time guidance that steers generation toward the intended hierarchy while maintaining global coherence. SSG emphasizes target high-frequency signals, defined as the semantic residual, isolated from a coarser prior. To obtain this prior, we leverage a principled frequency-domain procedure, Discrete Spatial Enhancement (DSE), which is devised to sharpen and better isolate the semantic residual through frequency-aware construction. SSG applies broadly across VAR models leveraging discrete visual tokens, regardless of tokenization design or conditioning modality. Experiments demonstrate SSG yields consistent gains in fidelity and diversity while preserving low latency, revealing untapped efficiency in coarse-to-fine image generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D person detection is crucial for safety in robotics, industrial monitoring, and surveillance, prompting a systematic evaluation of different detection methods.

Method: Three models—BEVDepth (camera), PointPillars (LiDAR), and DAL (fusion)—are compared using the JRDB dataset across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes, analyzing performance under occlusion, distance, sensor corruptions, and misalignments.

Result: Fusion-based DAL consistently outperforms single-modality models but remains sensitive to sensor misalignment and LiDAR corruptions. BEVDepth showed the lowest performance and highest vulnerability to challenges.

Conclusion: Sensor fusion enhances 3D person detection, but ongoing research is needed to address vulnerabilities like sensor misalignment and corruption resilience.

Abstract: Accurate 3D person detection is critical for safety in applications such as robotics, industrial monitoring, and surveillance. This work presents a systematic evaluation of 3D person detection using camera-only, LiDAR-only, and camera-LiDAR fusion. While most existing research focuses on autonomous driving, we explore detection performance and robustness in diverse indoor and outdoor scenes using the JRDB dataset. We compare three representative models - BEVDepth (camera), PointPillars (LiDAR), and DAL (camera-LiDAR fusion) - and analyze their behavior under varying occlusion and distance levels. Our results show that the fusion-based approach consistently outperforms single-modality models, particularly in challenging scenarios. We further investigate robustness against sensor corruptions and misalignments, revealing that while DAL offers improved resilience, it remains sensitive to sensor misalignment and certain LiDAR-based corruptions. In contrast, the camera-based BEVDepth model showed the lowest performance and was most affected by occlusion, distance, and noise. Our findings highlight the importance of utilizing sensor fusion for enhanced 3D person detection, while also underscoring the need for ongoing research to address the vulnerabilities inherent in these systems.

TL;DR: FastVMT addresses computational redundancies in video motion transfer using Diffusion Transformers (DiT), achieving a 3.43x speedup without compromising quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods using DiT fail to address structural inefficiencies, specifically motion and gradient redundancies, leading to unnecessary computations.

Method: FastVMT mitigates motion redundancy by masking attention layers to local neighborhoods and exploits gradient redundancy by reusing gradients from previous diffusion steps.

Result: The approach achieves a 3.43x speedup while maintaining visual fidelity and temporal consistency in generated videos.

Conclusion: FastVMT successfully eliminates identified redundancies, significantly improving runtime efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Video motion transfer aims to synthesize videos by generating visual content according to a text prompt while transferring the motion pattern observed in a reference video. Recent methods predominantly use the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. To achieve satisfactory runtime, several methods attempt to accelerate the computations in the DiT, but fail to address structural sources of inefficiency. In this work, we identify and remove two types of computational redundancy in earlier work: motion redundancy arises because the generic DiT architecture does not reflect the fact that frame-to-frame motion is small and smooth; gradient redundancy occurs if one ignores that gradients change slowly along the diffusion trajectory. To mitigate motion redundancy, we mask the corresponding attention layers to a local neighborhood such that interaction weights are not computed unnecessarily distant image regions. To exploit gradient redundancy, we design an optimization scheme that reuses gradients from previous diffusion steps and skips unwarranted gradient computations. On average, FastVMT achieves a 3.43x speedup without degrading the visual fidelity or the temporal consistency of the generated videos.

The dataset provides a realistic and application-relevant testbed for benchmarking these methods in the context of industrial robotics bridging the gap between lab-based research and deployment in real-world manufacturing scenarios. Unlike many previous datasets that focus on household or consumer products or use synthetic, clean tabletop datasets, or objects captured solely in controlled lab environments, IndustryShapes introduces five new object types with challenging properties, also captured in realistic industrial assembly settings. The dataset has diverse complexity, from simple to more challenging scenes, with single and multiple objects, including scenes with multiple instances of the same object and it is organized in two parts: the classic set and the extended set. The classic set includes a total of 4,6k images and 6k annotated poses. The extended set introduces additional data modalities to support the evaluation of model-free and sequence-based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, IndustryShapes is the first dataset to offer RGB-D static onboarding sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between geometric localization and actionable world models for robotic applications.

Method: Jointly estimates multi-class 6-DoF poses and class-specific parametric attributes using modular heads.

Result: Achieves detection mAP of 0.919 on real outdoor LiDAR scans without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: PIRATR introduces pose-aware, parameterized perception, scalable for dynamic robotic environments.

Abstract: We present PIRATR, an end-to-end 3D object detection framework for robotic use cases in point clouds. Extending PI3DETR, our method streamlines parametric 3D object detection by jointly estimating multi-class 6-DoF poses and class-specific parametric attributes directly from occlusion-affected point cloud data. This formulation enables not only geometric localization but also the estimation of task-relevant properties for parametric objects, such as a gripper's opening, where the 3D model is adjusted according to simple, predefined rules. The architecture employs modular, class-specific heads, making it straightforward to extend to novel object types without re-designing the pipeline. We validate PIRATR on an automated forklift platform, focusing on three structurally and functionally diverse categories: crane grippers, loading platforms, and pallets. Trained entirely in a synthetic environment, PIRATR generalizes effectively to real outdoor LiDAR scans, achieving a detection mAP of 0.919 without additional fine-tuning. PIRATR establishes a new paradigm of pose-aware, parameterized perception. This bridges the gap between low-level geometric reasoning and actionable world models, paving the way for scalable, simulation-trained perception systems that can be deployed in dynamic robotic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a foundational geometric model for autonomous driving that is scalable, simple, and adaptable to diverse sensor setups.

Method: ViGT uses a calibration-free architecture and self-supervised training with synchronized image-LiDAR pairs to infer continuous 3D occupancy fields in BEV.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on pointmap estimation and comparable results to supervised methods on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark.

Conclusion: ViGT demonstrates scalability and generalization, offering a promising solution for geometric tasks in autonomous driving.

Abstract: We introduce the Visual Implicit Geometry Transformer (ViGT), an autonomous driving geometric model that estimates continuous 3D occupancy fields from surround-view camera rigs. ViGT represents a step towards foundational geometric models for autonomous driving, prioritizing scalability, architectural simplicity, and generalization across diverse sensor configurations. Our approach achieves this through a calibration-free architecture, enabling a single model to adapt to different sensor setups. Unlike general-purpose geometric foundational models that focus on pixel-aligned predictions, ViGT estimates a continuous 3D occupancy field in a birds-eye-view (BEV) addressing domain-specific requirements. ViGT naturally infers geometry from multiple camera views into a single metric coordinate frame, providing a common representation for multiple geometric tasks. Unlike most existing occupancy models, we adopt a self-supervised training procedure that leverages synchronized image-LiDAR pairs, eliminating the need for costly manual annotations. We validate the scalability and generalizability of our approach by training our model on a mixture of five large-scale autonomous driving datasets (NuScenes, Waymo, NuPlan, ONCE, and Argoverse) and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the pointmap estimation task, with the best average rank across all evaluated baselines. We further evaluate ViGT on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, where ViGT achieves comparable performance with supervised methods.

In the early stages, overlapping clinical features often lead to misdiagnosis as Parkinson's disease (PD). Identifying reliable imaging biomarkers for early differential diagnosis remains a critical challenge. In this study, we propose a hybrid framework combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with machine learning (ML) techniques to classify APD subtypes versus PD and distinguish between the subtypes themselves: PSP vs. PD, MSA vs. PD, and PSP vs. MSA. The model leverages multi-modal input data, including T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), segmentation masks of 12 deep brain structures associated with APD, and their corresponding volumetric measurements. By integrating these complementary modalities, including image data, structural segmentation masks, and quantitative volume features, the hybrid approach achieved promising classification performance with area under the curve (AUC) scores of 0.95 for PSP vs. PD, 0.86 for MSA vs. PD, and 0.92 for PSP vs. MSA. These results highlight the potential of combining spatial and structural information for robust subtype differentiation. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that fusing CNN-based image features with volume-based ML inputs improves classification accuracy for APD subtypes. The proposed approach may contribute to more reliable early-stage diagnosis, facilitating timely and targeted interventions in clinical practice.

### [63] [LoGoSeg: Integrating Local and Global Features for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05578)
*Junyang Chen,Xiangbo Lv,Zhiqiang Kou,Xingdong Sheng,Ning Xu,Yiguo Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoGoSeg is a single-stage framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation that integrates object priors, region-level alignment, and dual-stream fusion to improve accuracy and efficiency without extra resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods relying on image-level pretraining suffer from poor spatial alignment and object hallucination, degrading segmentation performance.

Method: LoGoSeg uses (i) object existence priors, (ii) region-aware alignment, and (iii) dual-stream fusion to refine segmentation without external proposals or datasets.

Result: Experiments on six benchmarks show competitive performance and strong generalization in open-vocabulary settings.

Conclusion: LoGoSeg addresses limitations of existing approaches by integrating object priors and region-level constraints, achieving efficient and accurate segmentation.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) extends traditional closed-set segmentation by enabling pixel-wise annotation for both seen and unseen categories using arbitrary textual descriptions. While existing methods leverage vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, their reliance on image-level pretraining often results in imprecise spatial alignment, leading to mismatched segmentations in ambiguous or cluttered scenes. However, most existing approaches lack strong object priors and region-level constraints, which can lead to object hallucination or missed detections, further degrading performance. To address these challenges, we propose LoGoSeg, an efficient single-stage framework that integrates three key innovations: (i) an object existence prior that dynamically weights relevant categories through global image-text similarity, effectively reducing hallucinations; (ii) a region-aware alignment module that establishes precise region-level visual-textual correspondences; and (iii) a dual-stream fusion mechanism that optimally combines local structural information with global semantic context. Unlike prior works, LoGoSeg eliminates the need for external mask proposals, additional backbones, or extra datasets, ensuring efficiency. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks (A-847, PC-459, A-150, PC-59, PAS-20, and PAS-20b) demonstrate its competitive performance and strong generalization in open-vocabulary settings.

### [64] [Geometric Observability Index: An Operator-Theoretic Framework for Per-Feature Sensitivity, Weak Observability, and Dynamic Effects in SE(3) Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05582)
*Joe-Mei Feng,Sheng-Wei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Geometric Observability Index (GOI) to analyze feature sensitivity in camera pose estimation on SE(3), unifying conditioning analysis, Fisher information, and influence function theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in classical sensitivity tools for modern SLAM and structure-from-motion systems, particularly in understanding how individual features influence pose estimates and why inconsistent observations distort results.

Method: Extends influence function theory to matrix Lie groups, derives an intrinsic perturbation operator for M-estimators on SE(3), and introduces GOI to quantify feature contributions through curvature and Lie algebra.

Result: GOI provides spectral decomposition revealing weak observability and sensitivity, coincides with Fisher information geometry in the population regime, and explains classical degeneracies and dynamic feature amplification.

Conclusion: GOI offers a geometrically consistent framework for measurement influence, unifying multiple theories and providing lightweight diagnostic tools for identifying dynamic features and weak observability in SLAM systems.

Abstract: We present a unified operator-theoretic framework for analyzing per-feature sensitivity in camera pose estimation on the Lie group SE(3). Classical sensitivity tools - conditioning analyses, Euclidean perturbation arguments, and Fisher information bounds - do not explain how individual image features influence the pose estimate, nor why dynamic or inconsistent observations can disproportionately distort modern SLAM and structure-from-motion systems. To address this gap, we extend influence function theory to matrix Lie groups and derive an intrinsic perturbation operator for left-trivialized M-estimators on SE(3).
  The resulting Geometric Observability Index (GOI) quantifies the contribution of a single measurement through the curvature operator and the Lie algebraic structure of the observable subspace. GOI admits a spectral decomposition along the principal directions of the observable curvature, revealing a direct correspondence between weak observability and amplified sensitivity. In the population regime, GOI coincides with the Fisher information geometry on SE(3), yielding a single-measurement analogue of the Cramer-Rao bound.
  The same spectral mechanism explains classical degeneracies such as pure rotation and vanishing parallax, as well as dynamic feature amplification along weak curvature directions. Overall, GOI provides a geometrically consistent description of measurement influence that unifies conditioning analysis, Fisher information geometry, influence function theory, and dynamic scene detectability through the spectral geometry of the curvature operator. Because these quantities arise directly within Gauss-Newton pipelines, the curvature spectrum and GOI also yield lightweight, training-free diagnostic signals for identifying dynamic features and detecting weak observability configurations without modifying existing SLAM architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A mixed reality (MR) system for childbirth training combines virtual guidance with tactile manikin interaction, improving learning efficiency and reducing clinician burden. It outperforms VR-based training in user studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical students lack practical childbirth experience due to limited clinical rotations and patient reluctance. The MR system aims to provide realistic, independent training without continuous expert supervision.

Method: The system uses MR with tactile manikin interaction, leveraging a calibrated RGB-D camera and fiducial markers for spatial accuracy. A coarse-to-fine localization pipeline aligns the manikin and neonatal head for virtual guidance.

Result: The MR system achieved stable manikin localization on a standalone headset. In a study with 83 medical students, MR training scored higher than VR-based training in delivery, post-delivery, and overall performance.

Conclusion: The MR system effectively enhances childbirth training, providing realistic haptic feedback and outperforming VR-based alternatives, making it a practical solution for medical education.

Abstract: Opportunities for medical students to gain practical experience in vaginal births are increasingly constrained by shortened clinical rotations, patient reluctance, and the unpredictable nature of labour. To alleviate clinicians' instructional burden and enhance trainees' learning efficiency, we introduce a mixed reality (MR) system for childbirth training that combines virtual guidance with tactile manikin interaction, thereby preserving authentic haptic feedback while enabling independent practice without continuous on-site expert supervision. The system extends the passthrough capability of commercial head-mounted displays (HMDs) by spatially calibrating an external RGB-D camera, allowing real-time visual integration of physical training objects. Building on this capability, we implement a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline that first aligns the maternal manikin with fiducial markers to define a delivery region and then registers the pre-scanned neonatal head within this area. This process enables spatially accurate overlay of virtual guiding hands near the manikin, allowing trainees to follow expert trajectories reinforced by haptic interaction. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the system achieves accurate and stable manikin localization on a standalone headset, ensuring practical deployment without external computing resources. A large-scale user study involving 83 fourth-year medical students was subsequently conducted to compare MR-based and virtual reality (VR)-based childbirth training. Four senior obstetricians independently assessed performance using standardized criteria. Results showed that MR training achieved significantly higher scores in delivery, post-delivery, and overall task performance, and was consistently preferred by trainees over VR training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoPoseVR is an end-to-end framework for accurate egocentric full-body pose estimation in VR, combining headset motion cues and RGB-D observations via dual-modality fusion. It outperforms state-of-the-art models and improves accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VR head-mounted camera-based pose estimation methods face challenges like temporal instability, inaccurate lower-body tracking, and lack of real-time performance. EgoPoseVR aims to address these limitations.

Method: EgoPoseVR integrates headset motion cues with RGB-D observations using a dual-modality fusion pipeline. It employs a spatiotemporal encoder and cross-attention for fusion, followed by kinematic optimization for enhanced accuracy.

Result: EgoPoseVR outperforms existing models and achieves high subjective ratings in accuracy, stability, and user embodiment. It also introduces a large synthetic dataset for training and evaluation.

Conclusion: EgoPoseVR provides robust full-body pose tracking for VR, eliminating the need for additional sensors or room-scale systems, and offers practical improvements for VR embodiment.

Abstract: Immersive virtual reality (VR) applications demand accurate, temporally coherent full-body pose tracking. Recent head-mounted camera-based approaches show promise in egocentric pose estimation, but encounter challenges when applied to VR head-mounted displays (HMDs), including temporal instability, inaccurate lower-body estimation, and the lack of real-time performance. To address these limitations, we present EgoPoseVR, an end-to-end framework for accurate egocentric full-body pose estimation in VR that integrates headset motion cues with egocentric RGB-D observations through a dual-modality fusion pipeline. A spatiotemporal encoder extracts frame- and joint-level representations, which are fused via cross-attention to fully exploit complementary motion cues across modalities. A kinematic optimization module then imposes constraints from HMD signals, enhancing the accuracy and stability of pose estimation. To facilitate training and evaluation, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of over 1.8 million temporally aligned HMD and RGB-D frames across diverse VR scenarios. Experimental results show that EgoPoseVR outperforms state-of-the-art egocentric pose estimation models. A user study in real-world scenes further shows that EgoPoseVR achieved significantly higher subjective ratings in accuracy, stability, embodiment, and intention for future use compared to baseline methods. These results show that EgoPoseVR enables robust full-body pose tracking, offering a practical solution for accurate VR embodiment without requiring additional body-worn sensors or room-scale tracking systems.

*Aon Safdar,Mohamed Saadeldin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAViT introduces dynamic channel-wise attention alongside spatial self-attention in Vision Transformers, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static channel mixing in ViTs lacks adaptability, prompting the development of CAViT for dynamic feature interaction.

Method: CAViT replaces fixed MLPs with dual-attention (spatial and channel-wise) blocks, enabling context-aware feature recalibration.

Result: CAViT outperforms ViT baselines by up to 3.6% accuracy, reduces parameters/FLOPs by 30%, and shows sharper attention patterns.

Conclusion: CAViT's dynamic token mixing enhances representational power efficiently, validated across diverse vision tasks.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong performance across a range of computer vision tasks by modeling long-range spatial interactions via self-attention. However, channel-wise mixing in ViTs remains static, relying on fixed multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) that lack adaptability to input content. We introduce 'CAViT', a dual-attention architecture that replaces the static MLP with a dynamic, attention-based mechanism for feature interaction. Each Transformer block in CAViT performs spatial self-attention followed by channel-wise self-attention, allowing the model to dynamically recalibrate feature representations based on global image context. This unified and content-aware token mixing strategy enhances representational expressiveness without increasing depth or complexity. We validate CAViT across five benchmark datasets spanning both natural and medical domains, where it outperforms the standard ViT baseline by up to +3.6% in accuracy, while reducing parameter count and FLOPs by over 30%. Qualitative attention maps reveal sharper and semantically meaningful activation patterns, validating the effectiveness of our attention-driven token mixing.

*Zongliang Zhang,Shuxiang Li,Xingwang Huang,Zongyue Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to robustly fit multiple instances of non-classical models (e.g., spirals, free-form surfaces) from noisy data using a novel estimator and meta-heuristic optimizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust fitting methods focus on classical models or single instances of non-classical models, leaving a gap for multi-instance fitting of complex shapes.

Method: The approach formulates the task as an optimization problem with a model-to-data error estimator (handling outliers without thresholds) and a meta-heuristic optimizer for non-differentiable cases.

Result: Experiments validate the method's effectiveness across diverse non-classical models.

Conclusion: The proposed solution successfully addresses multi-instance fitting for non-classical models, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Most existing robust fitting methods are designed for classical models, such as lines, circles, and planes. In contrast, fewer methods have been developed to robustly handle non-classical models, such as spiral curves, procedural character models, and free-form surfaces. Furthermore, existing methods primarily focus on reconstructing a single instance of a non-classical model. This paper aims to reconstruct multiple instances of non-classical models from noisy data. We formulate this multi-instance fitting task as an optimization problem, which comprises an estimator and an optimizer. Specifically, we propose a novel estimator based on the model-to-data error, capable of handling outliers without a predefined error threshold. Since the proposed estimator is non-differentiable with respect to the model parameters, we employ a meta-heuristic algorithm as the optimizer to seek the global optimum. The effectiveness of our method are demonstrated through experimental results on various non-classical models. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangzongliang/fitting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGUT splatting methods struggle with cyclic projection and time discontinuities at azimuth boundaries in spherical cameras, leading to incorrect projections. The framework aims to address these limitations.

Method: XSIM introduces a phase modeling mechanism for temporal and shape discontinuities and extends 3D Gaussian representation with two opacity parameters for better geometry-color alignment.

Result: The framework outperforms baselines on Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse 2, and PandaSet, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: XSIM provides enhanced scene representation with improved geometric consistency and photorealistic appearance, validated by superior performance on autonomous driving datasets.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce \textbf{XSIM}, a sensor simulation framework for autonomous driving. XSIM extends 3DGUT splatting with a generalized rolling-shutter modeling tailored for autonomous driving applications. Our framework provides a unified and flexible formulation for appearance and geometric sensor modeling, enabling rendering of complex sensor distortions in dynamic environments. We identify spherical cameras, such as LiDARs, as a critical edge case for existing 3DGUT splatting due to cyclic projection and time discontinuities at azimuth boundaries leading to incorrect particle projection. To address this issue, we propose a phase modeling mechanism that explicitly accounts temporal and shape discontinuities of Gaussians projected by the Unscented Transform at azimuth borders. In addition, we introduce an extended 3D Gaussian representation that incorporates two distinct opacity parameters to resolve mismatches between geometry and color distributions. As a result, our framework provides enhanced scene representations with improved geometric consistency and photorealistic appearance. We evaluate our framework extensively on multiple autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse 2, and PandaSet. Our framework consistently outperforms strong recent baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.

TL;DR: Proposed ROMAN, an ADS testing approach using multi-head attention and traffic law weighting to generate high-risk violation scenarios, outperforming existing tools ABLE and LawBreaker in violation count and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ADS testing lacks ability to generate complex, high-risk law-breaking scenarios and fails to account for multi-vehicle interactions, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: ROMAN combines multi-head attention to model interactions and a traffic law weighting mechanism using LLMs to evaluate violations by severity and occurrence.

Result: ROMAN surpassed ABLE and LawBreaker with higher violation counts (7.91% and 55.96%, respectively) and greater diversity, generating scenarios for all input traffic law clauses.

Conclusion: ROMAN enhances ADS testing by effectively generating high-risk violation scenarios, identifying more violations than existing methods.

Abstract: Automated Driving System (ADS) acts as the brain of autonomous vehicles, responsible for their safety and efficiency. Safe deployment requires thorough testing in diverse real-world scenarios and compliance with traffic laws like speed limits, signal obedience, and right-of-way rules. Violations like running red lights or speeding pose severe safety risks. However, current testing approaches face significant challenges: limited ability to generate complex and high-risk law-breaking scenarios, and failing to account for complex interactions involving multiple vehicles and critical situations. To address these challenges, we propose ROMAN, a novel scenario generation approach for ADS testing that combines a multi-head attention network with a traffic law weighting mechanism. ROMAN is designed to generate high-risk violation scenarios to enable more thorough and targeted ADS evaluation. The multi-head attention mechanism models interactions among vehicles, traffic signals, and other factors. The traffic law weighting mechanism implements a workflow that leverages an LLM-based risk weighting module to evaluate violations based on the two dimensions of severity and occurrence. We have evaluated ROMAN by testing the Baidu Apollo ADS within the CARLA simulation platform and conducting extensive experiments to measure its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ROMAN surpassed state-of-the-art tools ABLE and LawBreaker by achieving 7.91% higher average violation count than ABLE and 55.96% higher than LawBreaker, while also maintaining greater scenario diversity. In addition, only ROMAN successfully generated violation scenarios for every clause of the input traffic laws, enabling it to identify more high-risk violations than existing approaches.

TL;DR: UniSurg introduces a video-native foundation model focusing on latent motion prediction for surgical video analysis, outperforming existing methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical video analysis models waste capacity on low-level details like smoke and reflections, neglecting semantic structures crucial for understanding.

Method: UniSurg uses motion-guided latent prediction, spatiotemporal affinity self-distillation, and feature diversity regularization to improve surgical video understanding.

Result: UniSurg achieves significant improvements on workflow recognition (+14.6% F1), action triplet recognition (39.54% mAP-IVT), and other tasks.

Conclusion: UniSurg sets a new standard for universal, motion-oriented surgical video understanding.

Abstract: While foundation models have advanced surgical video analysis, current approaches rely predominantly on pixel-level reconstruction objectives that waste model capacity on low-level visual details - such as smoke, specular reflections, and fluid motion - rather than semantic structures essential for surgical understanding. We present UniSurg, a video-native foundation model that shifts the learning paradigm from pixel-level reconstruction to latent motion prediction. Built on the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), UniSurg introduces three key technical innovations tailored to surgical videos: 1) motion-guided latent prediction to prioritize semantically meaningful regions, 2) spatiotemporal affinity self-distillation to enforce relational consistency, and 3) feature diversity regularization to prevent representation collapse in texture-sparse surgical scenes. To enable large-scale pretraining, we curate UniSurg-15M, the largest surgical video dataset to date, comprising 3,658 hours of video from 50 sources across 13 anatomical regions. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks demonstrate that UniSurg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on surgical workflow recognition (+14.6% F1 on EgoSurgery, +10.3% on PitVis), action triplet recognition (39.54% mAP-IVT on CholecT50), skill assessment, polyp segmentation, and depth estimation. These results establish UniSurg as a new standard for universal, motion-oriented surgical video understanding.

TL;DR: The paper explores using finer hierarchical levels (facets and nuances) of the Big-Five Personality Model to improve personality recognition from audiovisual data, showing significant performance gains with nuance-level models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses challenges in personality recognition, such as reliance on broad trait scores and limited training data, by leveraging more granular levels of personality assessment.

Method: A transformer-based model with cross-modal (audiovisual) and cross-subject (dyad-aware) attention mechanisms was trained on the UDIVA v0.5 dataset to predict personality at facet and nuance levels.

Result: Nuance-level models outperformed facet and trait-level models, reducing mean squared error by up to 74% across interaction scenarios.

Conclusion: Granular hierarchical levels (nuances) of personality assessment significantly enhance recognition accuracy, offering promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Personality is a complex, hierarchical construct typically assessed through item-level questionnaires aggregated into broad trait scores. Personality recognition models aim to infer personality traits from different sources of behavioral data. However, reliance on broad trait scores as ground truth, combined with limited training data, poses challenges for generalization, as similar trait scores can manifest through diverse, context dependent behaviors. In this work, we explore the predictive impact of the more granular hierarchical levels of the Big-Five Personality Model, facets and nuances, to enhance personality recognition from audiovisual interaction data. Using the UDIVA v0.5 dataset, we trained a transformer-based model including cross-modal (audiovisual) and cross-subject (dyad-aware) attention mechanisms. Results show that nuance-level models consistently outperform facet and trait-level models, reducing mean squared error by up to 74% across interaction scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise 3D manipulation remains challenging due to trade-offs between controllability, consistency, and scalability in existing frameworks.

Method: ShapeUP trains on triplets (source 3D shape, edited 2D image, edited 3D shape) using a 3D DiT to learn latent-to-latent mapping, enabling fine-grained control.

Result: ShapeUP outperforms baselines in identity preservation and edit fidelity, maintaining structural consistency and achieving implicit localization.

Conclusion: ShapeUP provides a robust, scalable solution for native 3D editing by leveraging supervised training and pretrained 3D foundation models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D foundation models have enabled the generation of high-fidelity assets, yet precise 3D manipulation remains a significant challenge. Existing 3D editing frameworks often face a difficult trade-off between visual controllability, geometric consistency, and scalability. Specifically, optimization-based methods are prohibitively slow, multi-view 2D propagation techniques suffer from visual drift, and training-free latent manipulation methods are inherently bound by frozen priors and cannot directly benefit from scaling. In this work, we present ShapeUP, a scalable, image-conditioned 3D editing framework that formulates editing as a supervised latent-to-latent translation within a native 3D representation. This formulation allows ShapeUP to build on a pretrained 3D foundation model, leveraging its strong generative prior while adapting it to editing through supervised training. In practice, ShapeUP is trained on triplets consisting of a source 3D shape, an edited 2D image, and the corresponding edited 3D shape, and learns a direct mapping using a 3D Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This image-as-prompt approach enables fine-grained visual control over both local and global edits and achieves implicit, mask-free localization, while maintaining strict structural consistency with the original asset. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ShapeUP consistently outperforms current trained and training-free baselines in both identity preservation and edit fidelity, offering a robust and scalable paradigm for native 3D content creation.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting tampering in smart cameras capturing still images, proposing rule-based and deep-learning methods. It evaluates their performance in accuracy, computational demands, and training data needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart cameras in outdoor settings are vulnerable to tampering, which hampers surveillance. Detecting tampering in still images is harder than in videos due to lack of continuous frames.

Method: Two approaches: rule-based and deep-learning-based methods. Evaluated for accuracy, computational requirements, and data needs in real-world use.

Result: Deep-learning model achieves higher accuracy, while rule-based method suits resource-limited scenarios with impractical calibration phases.

Conclusion: The study highlights trade-offs between accuracy and resource efficiency, providing datasets (normal, blurred, rotated images) to aid future research in tampering detection.

Abstract: Recently, the use of smart cameras in outdoor settings has grown to improve surveillance and security. Nonetheless, these systems are susceptible to tampering, whether from deliberate vandalism or harsh environmental conditions, which can undermine their monitoring effectiveness. In this context, detecting camera tampering is more challenging when a camera is capturing still images rather than video as there is no sequence of continuous frames over time. In this study, we propose two approaches for detecting tampered images: a rule-based method and a deep-learning-based method. The aim is to evaluate how each method performs in terms of accuracy, computational demands, and the data required for training when applied to real-world scenarios. Our results show that the deep-learning model provides higher accuracy, while the rule-based method is more appropriate for scenarios where resources are limited and a prolonged calibration phase is impractical. We also offer publicly available datasets with normal, blurred, and rotated images to support the development and evaluation of camera tampering detection methods, addressing the need for such resources.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-task learning framework using point supervision to enhance temporal understanding for Temporal Action Localization (PTAL). It introduces three self-supervised tasks to improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PTAL methods lack explicit modeling of temporal relationships among frames, which is crucial for accurately localizing actions. This work aims to address this gap by leveraging point supervision for better temporal understanding.

Method: A multi-task learning framework is designed with three self-supervised tasks: Action Completion, Action Order Understanding, and Action Regularity Understanding. These tasks utilize point supervision to enhance temporal consistency modeling.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness on four benchmark datasets, outperforming several state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully leverages point supervision and self-supervised tasks to improve temporal understanding in PTAL, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Point-supervised Temporal Action Localization (PTAL) adopts a lightly frame-annotated paradigm (\textit{i.e.}, labeling only a single frame per action instance) to train a model to effectively locate action instances within untrimmed videos. Most existing approaches design the task head of models with only a point-supervised snippet-level classification, without explicit modeling of understanding temporal relationships among frames of an action. However, understanding the temporal relationships of frames is crucial because it can help a model understand how an action is defined and therefore benefits localizing the full frames of an action. To this end, in this paper, we design a multi-task learning framework that fully utilizes point supervision to boost the model's temporal understanding capability for action localization. Specifically, we design three self-supervised temporal understanding tasks: (i) Action Completion, (ii) Action Order Understanding, and (iii) Action Regularity Understanding. These tasks help a model understand the temporal consistency of actions across videos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explicitly explore temporal consistency for point supervision action localization. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: AGFF-Embed combines global and fine-grained semantic information in MLLM embeddings using adaptive fusion and gradient amplification for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal embeddings lack hybrid perceptual patterns of global and fine-grained elements, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios.

Method: AGFF-Embed generates multiple embeddings focusing on different semantic dimensions and adaptively aggregates them, enhanced by Explicit Gradient Amplification (EGA).

Result: AGFF-Embed achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMEB and MMVP-VLM benchmarks for general and fine-grained understanding.

Conclusion: AGFF-Embed addresses the limitations of current multimodal embeddings by integrating adaptive fusion and gradient techniques, outperforming existing models.

Abstract: Multimodal embeddings serve as a bridge for aligning vision and language, with the two primary implementations -- CLIP-based and MLLM-based embedding models -- both limited to capturing only global semantic information. Although numerous studies have focused on fine-grained understanding, we observe that complex scenarios currently targeted by MLLM embeddings often involve a hybrid perceptual pattern of both global and fine-grained elements, thus necessitating a compatible fusion mechanism. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Global and Fine-grained perceptual Fusion for MLLM Embeddings (AGFF-Embed), a method that prompts the MLLM to generate multiple embeddings focusing on different dimensions of semantic information, which are then adaptively and smoothly aggregated. Furthermore, we adapt AGFF-Embed with the Explicit Gradient Amplification (EGA) technique to achieve in-batch hard negatives enhancement without requiring fine-grained editing of the dataset. Evaluation on the MMEB and MMVP-VLM benchmarks shows that AGFF-Embed comprehensively achieves state-of-the-art performance in both general and fine-grained understanding compared to other multimodal embedding models.

*Moussa Kassem Sbeyti,Nadja Klein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthPrior leverages depth as prior knowledge to improve detection of small, distant objects without modifying detector architectures, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting small and distant objects is challenging due to scale variation, low resolution, and clutter. Depth information can help but existing methods require complex architectural changes.

Method: DepthPrior uses depth-based loss weighting (DLW), loss stratification (DLS), and depth-aware confidence thresholding (DCT) during training and inference, avoiding architectural modifications.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks show DepthPrior improves small object detection (+9% mAP$_S$, +7% mAR$_S$) with high inference recovery rates (95:1) and no additional costs.

Conclusion: DepthPrior effectively uses depth as prior knowledge, enhancing detection performance without architectural changes or overhead beyond initial depth estimation.

Abstract: Detecting small and distant objects remains challenging for object detectors due to scale variation, low resolution, and background clutter. Safety-critical applications require reliable detection of these objects for safe planning. Depth information can improve detection, but existing approaches require complex, model-specific architectural modifications. We provide a theoretical analysis followed by an empirical investigation of the depth-detection relationship. Together, they explain how depth causes systematic performance degradation and why depth-informed supervision mitigates it. We introduce DepthPrior, a framework that uses depth as prior knowledge rather than as a fused feature, providing comparable benefits without modifying detector architectures. DepthPrior consists of Depth-Based Loss Weighting (DLW) and Depth-Based Loss Stratification (DLS) during training, and Depth-Aware Confidence Thresholding (DCT) during inference. The only overhead is the initial cost of depth estimation. Experiments across four benchmarks (KITTI, MS COCO, VisDrone, SUN RGB-D) and two detectors (YOLOv11, EfficientDet) demonstrate the effectiveness of DepthPrior, achieving up to +9% mAP$_S$ and +7% mAR$_S$ for small objects, with inference recovery rates as high as 95:1 (true vs. false detections). DepthPrior offers these benefits without additional sensors, architectural changes, or performance costs. Code is available at https://github.com/mos-ks/DepthPrior.

*Luca Ciampi,Ludovico Iannello,Fabrizio Tonelli,Gabriele Lagani,Angelo Di Garbo,Federico Cremisi,Giuseppe Amato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neuro-inspired reservoir computing system uses living cortical neurons in vitro as a biological reservoir, achieving accurate static visual pattern recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage natural neural dynamics for computing and explore biological integration into machine learning.

Method: High-density multi-electrode array stimulates and records neuron responses, with a linear readout layer for classification.

Result: Accurate classification despite biological variability, demonstrating effective use of living neurons as reservoirs.

Conclusion: Living neural networks can integrate into neuromorphic computing, offering biologically grounded computational models.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neuro-inspired approach to reservoir computing (RC) in which a network of in vitro cultured cortical neurons serves as the physical reservoir. Rather than relying on artificial recurrent models to approximate neural dynamics, our biological reservoir computing (BRC) system leverages the spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity of living neural circuits as its computational substrate. A high-density multi-electrode array (HD-MEA) provides simultaneous stimulation and readout across hundreds of channels: input patterns are delivered through selected electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting high-dimensional neural responses, yielding a biologically grounded feature representation. A linear readout layer (single-layer perceptron) is then trained to classify these reservoir states, enabling the living neural network to perform static visual pattern-recognition tasks within a computer-vision framework. We evaluate the system across a sequence of tasks of increasing difficulty, ranging from pointwise stimuli to oriented bars, clock-digit-like shapes, and handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Despite the inherent variability of biological neural responses-arising from noise, spontaneous activity, and inter-session differences-the system consistently generates high-dimensional representations that support accurate classification. These results demonstrate that in vitro cortical networks can function as effective reservoirs for static visual pattern recognition, opening new avenues for integrating living neural substrates into neuromorphic computing frameworks. More broadly, this work contributes to the effort to incorporate biological principles into machine learning and supports the goals of neuro-inspired vision by illustrating how living neural systems can inform the design of efficient and biologically grounded computational models.

### [79] [FMPose3D: monocular 3D pose estimation via flow matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05755)
*Ti Wang,Xiaohang Yu,Mackenzie Weygandt Mathis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMPose3D introduces a novel generative framework using Flow Matching for efficient monocular 3D pose estimation, outperforming existing methods on human and animal pose benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D pose estimation faces challenges like depth ambiguity and occlusions, requiring probabilistic methods to generate plausible hypotheses. Existing diffusion models are computationally expensive, prompting the use of Flow Matching for efficiency.

Method: FMPose3D leverages Flow Matching to learn a velocity field via an ODE, enabling efficient 3D pose generation with few steps. It transports samples from a Gaussian prior to plausible 3D poses conditioned on 2D inputs. A Reprojection-based Posterior Expectation Aggregation (RPEA) module refines hypotheses into accurate predictions.

Result: FMPose3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, Animal3D, and CtrlAni3D benchmarks.

Conclusion: FMPose3D demonstrates superior efficiency and accuracy in monocular 3D pose estimation for both humans and animals, validated by benchmark results.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is fundamentally ill-posed due to depth ambiguity and occlusions, thereby motivating probabilistic methods that generate multiple plausible 3D pose hypotheses. In particular, diffusion-based models have recently demonstrated strong performance, but their iterative denoising process typically requires many timesteps for each prediction, making inference computationally expensive. In contrast, we leverage Flow Matching (FM) to learn a velocity field defined by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE), enabling efficient generation of 3D pose samples with only a few integration steps. We propose a novel generative pose estimation framework, FMPose3D, that formulates 3D pose estimation as a conditional distribution transport problem. It continuously transports samples from a standard Gaussian prior to the distribution of plausible 3D poses conditioned only on 2D inputs. Although ODE trajectories are deterministic, FMPose3D naturally generates various pose hypotheses by sampling different noise seeds. To obtain a single accurate prediction from those hypotheses, we further introduce a Reprojection-based Posterior Expectation Aggregation (RPEA) module, which approximates the Bayesian posterior expectation over 3D hypotheses. FMPose3D surpasses existing methods on the widely used human pose estimation benchmarks Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, and further achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3D animal pose datasets Animal3D and CtrlAni3D, demonstrating strong performance across both 3D pose domains.

*Timur Mamedov,Karina Kvanchiani,Anton Konushin,Vadim Konushin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReText is a novel method for generalizable image-based person re-identification (Re-ID) that combines multi-camera Re-ID data with textual descriptions of single-camera data to enhance semantic cues. It jointly optimizes Re-ID, image-text matching, and text-guided image reconstruction, achieving superior cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of single-camera data, which lacks cross-view variation, by enriching it with textual descriptions to improve generalization in unseen domains.

Method: ReText trains on a mix of multi-camera Re-ID data and text-complemented single-camera data. It jointly optimizes three tasks: Re-ID, image-text matching, and text-guided image reconstruction.

Result: ReText outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain Re-ID benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that multimodal joint learning on mixed data is effective for generalizable Re-ID, marking the first exploration of this approach in the field.

Abstract: Generalizable image-based person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to recognize individuals across cameras in unseen domains without retraining. While multiple existing approaches address the domain gap through complex architectures, recent findings indicate that better generalization can be achieved by stylistically diverse single-camera data. Although this data is easy to collect, it lacks complexity due to minimal cross-view variation. We propose ReText, a novel method trained on a mixture of multi-camera Re-ID data and single-camera data, where the latter is complemented by textual descriptions to enrich semantic cues. During training, ReText jointly optimizes three tasks: (1) Re-ID on multi-camera data, (2) image-text matching, and (3) image reconstruction guided by text on single-camera data. Experiments demonstrate that ReText achieves strong generalization and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain Re-ID benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore multimodal joint learning on a mixture of multi-camera and single-camera data in image-based person Re-ID.

*Hengyi Wang,Ruiqiang Zhang,Chang Liu,Guanjie Wang,Zehua Ma,Han Fang,Weiming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses VLMs' brittleness in allocentric spatial tasks by introducing Allocentric Perceiver, a training-free method leveraging geometric experts to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with allocentric spatial queries requiring perspective shifts, prompting the need for a solution to enhance their performance in such tasks.

Method: Allocentric Perceiver uses off-the-shelf geometric experts to recover metric 3D states, transforms geometry into target frames, and prompts VLMs with structured, geometry-grounded representations.

Result: The method achieves ~10% gains on allocentric tasks while maintaining egocentric performance, outperforming finetuned and state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Allocentric Perceiver effectively enhances VLMs' allocentric reasoning by shifting mental rotation to explicit computation, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: With the rising need for spatially grounded tasks such as Vision-Language Navigation/Action, allocentric perception capabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are receiving growing focus. However, VLMs remain brittle on allocentric spatial queries that require explicit perspective shifts, where the answer depends on reasoning in a target-centric frame rather than the observed camera view. Thus, we introduce Allocentric Perceiver, a training-free strategy that recovers metric 3D states from one or more images with off-the-shelf geometric experts, and then instantiates a query-conditioned allocentric reference frame aligned with the instruction's semantic intent. By deterministically transforming reconstructed geometry into the target frame and prompting the backbone VLM with structured, geometry-grounded representations, Allocentric Perceriver offloads mental rotation from implicit reasoning to explicit computation. We evaluate Allocentric Perciver across multiple backbone families on spatial reasoning benchmarks, observing consistent and substantial gains ($\sim$10%) on allocentric tasks while maintaining strong egocentric performance, and surpassing both spatial-perception-finetuned models and state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models.

*Enwei Tong,Yuanchao Bai,Yao Zhu,Junjun Jiang,Xianming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSR is a human-inspired pruning framework for VLMs that balances local and global context efficiently, improving accuracy-latency trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs generate excessive visual tokens, increasing latency and memory. Existing pruning methods struggle to balance local evidence and global context.

Method: FSR mimics human behavior: focusing on key evidence, scanning globally if needed, and refining context without exceeding token limits.

Result: FSR outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods across various VLM benchmarks, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: FSR effectively balances local and global context, offering a plug-and-play solution for token pruning in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often generate massive visual tokens that greatly increase inference latency and memory footprint; while training-free token pruning offers a practical remedy, existing methods still struggle to balance local evidence and global context under aggressive compression. We propose Focus-Scan-Refine (FSR), a human-inspired, plug-and-play pruning framework that mimics how humans answer visual questions: focus on key evidence, then scan globally if needed, and refine the scanned context by aggregating relevant details. FSR first focuses on key evidence by combining visual importance with instruction relevance, avoiding the bias toward visually salient but query-irrelevant regions. It then scans for complementary context conditioned on the focused set, selecting tokens that are most different from the focused evidence. Finally, FSR refines the scanned context by aggregating nearby informative tokens into the scan anchors via similarity-based assignment and score-weighted merging, without increasing the token budget. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM backbones and vision-language benchmarks show that FSR consistently improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off over existing state-of-the-art pruning methods.

*Musawar Ali,Manuel Carranza-García,Nicola Fioraio,Samuele Salti,Luigi Di Stefano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NVS-HO is a new benchmark for novel view synthesis of handheld objects using RGB inputs, featuring two sequences (handheld and board) and highlighting performance gaps in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of real-world benchmarks for novel view synthesis of handheld objects, NVS-HO introduces a dataset with complementary RGB sequences to evaluate and improve NVS models.

Method: NVS-HO uses two RGB sequences (handheld and board) with ground-truth poses, testing classical SfM and VGGT as pose estimators, and NeRF/Gaussian Splatting for NVS modeling.

Result: Current methods show significant performance gaps in unconstrained handheld conditions, emphasizing the need for more robust approaches.

Conclusion: NVS-HO provides a challenging real-world benchmark to advance RGB-based novel view synthesis of handheld objects.

Abstract: We propose NVS-HO, the first benchmark designed for novel view synthesis of handheld objects in real-world environments using only RGB inputs. Each object is recorded in two complementary RGB sequences: (1) a handheld sequence, where the object is manipulated in front of a static camera, and (2) a board sequence, where the object is fixed on a ChArUco board to provide accurate camera poses via marker detection. The goal of NVS-HO is to learn a NVS model that captures the full appearance of an object from (1), whereas (2) provides the ground-truth images used for evaluation. To establish baselines, we consider both a classical SfM pipeline and a state-of-the-art pre-trained feed-forward neural network (VGGT) as pose estimators, and train NVS models based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting. Our experiments reveal significant performance gaps in current methods under unconstrained handheld conditions, highlighting the need for more robust approaches. NVS-HO thus offers a challenging real-world benchmark to drive progress in RGB-based novel view synthesis of handheld objects.

*Hai Zhang,Siqi Liang,Li Chen,Yuxian Li,Yukuan Xu,Yichao Zhong,Fu Zhang,Hongyang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SparseVideoNav, leveraging video generation models for Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN), achieving faster inference and higher success rates than LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language navigation relies on detailed instructions, which contradicts real-world autonomy needs. BVN requires navigating unseen targets with minimal guidance.

Method: Introduces video generation models for BVN, addressing LLM short-sightedness with long-horizon supervision. SparseVideoNav optimizes speed by generating sparse futures.

Result: Achieves 27x speed-up and 2.5x higher success rate than LLM baselines, including successful navigation in night scenes.

Conclusion: SparseVideoNav demonstrates superior performance in BVN, showcasing the potential of video generation models for autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Why must vision-language navigation be bound to detailed and verbose language instructions? While such details ease decision-making, they fundamentally contradict the goal for navigation in the real-world. Ideally, agents should possess the autonomy to navigate in unknown environments guided solely by simple and high-level intents. Realizing this ambition introduces a formidable challenge: Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN), where agents must locate distant, unseen targets without dense and step-by-step guidance. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods, though adept at following dense instructions, often suffer from short-sighted behaviors due to their reliance on short-horimzon supervision. Simply extending the supervision horizon, however, destabilizes LLM training. In this work, we identify that video generation models inherently benefit from long-horizon supervision to align with language instructions, rendering them uniquely suitable for BVN tasks. Capitalizing on this insight, we propose introducing the video generation model into this field for the first time. Yet, the prohibitive latency for generating videos spanning tens of seconds makes real-world deployment impractical. To bridge this gap, we propose SparseVideoNav, achieving sub-second trajectory inference guided by a generated sparse future spanning a 20-second horizon. This yields a remarkable 27x speed-up compared to the unoptimized counterpart. Extensive real-world zero-shot experiments demonstrate that SparseVideoNav achieves 2.5x the success rate of state-of-the-art LLM baselines on BVN tasks and marks the first realization of such capability in challenging night scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-centric Chain-of-Thought approaches suffer from representational mismatch and limited perceptual acuity in video reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposes Weaver, a system that dynamically invokes tools and uses reinforcement learning for strategy exploration.

Result: Weaver improves performance on complex video reasoning benchmarks, especially for long videos.

Conclusion: Weaver addresses limitations of existing methods by integrating multimodal tools and reinforcement learning, enhancing video reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Video reasoning constitutes a comprehensive assessment of a model's capabilities, as it demands robust perceptual and interpretive skills, thereby serving as a means to explore the boundaries of model performance. While recent research has leveraged text-centric Chain-of-Thought reasoning to augment these capabilities, such approaches frequently suffer from representational mismatch and restricted by limited perceptual acuity. To address these limitations, we propose Weaver, a novel, end-to-end trainable multimodal reasoning agentic system. Weaver empowers its policy model to dynamically invoke diverse tools throughout the reasoning process, enabling progressive acquisition of crucial visual cues and construction of authentic multimodal reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, we integrate a reinforcement learning algorithm to allow the system to freely explore strategies for employing and combining these tools with trajectory-free data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Weaver, enhances performance on several complex video reasoning benchmarks, particularly those involving long videos.

TL;DR: UI-Mem enhances online RL for GUI agents with a Hierarchical Experience Memory for efficient credit assignment and experience transfer, outperforming traditional RL baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in credit assignment and lack of experience transfer in online RL for GUI agents.

Method: Introduces UI-Mem with Hierarchical Experience Memory, Stratified Group Sampling, and a Self-Evolving Loop for continuous memory alignment.

Result: UI-Mem outperforms traditional RL baselines and static reuse strategies, showing strong generalization to unseen applications.

Conclusion: UI-Mem provides a scalable solution for improving online RL in GUI tasks through structured memory and continuous learning.

Abstract: Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising paradigm for enhancing GUI agents through direct environment interaction. However, its effectiveness is severely hindered by inefficient credit assignment in long-horizon tasks and repetitive errors across tasks due to the lack of experience transfer. To address these challenges, we propose UI-Mem, a novel framework that enhances GUI online RL with a Hierarchical Experience Memory. Unlike traditional replay buffers, our memory accumulates structured knowledge, including high-level workflows, subtask skills, and failure patterns. These experiences are stored as parameterized templates that enable cross-task and cross-application transfer. To effectively integrate memory guidance into online RL, we introduce Stratified Group Sampling, which injects varying levels of guidance across trajectories within each rollout group to maintain outcome diversity, driving the unguided policy toward internalizing guided behaviors. Furthermore, a Self-Evolving Loop continuously abstracts novel strategies and errors to keep the memory aligned with the agent's evolving policy. Experiments on online GUI benchmarks demonstrate that UI-Mem significantly outperforms traditional RL baselines and static reuse strategies, with strong generalization to unseen applications.

TL;DR: The paper identifies instability in predictor-based SSL frameworks with multi-crop strategies and proposes using separate predictors per view type and adding masked views, improving stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised learning methods using Siamese networks face instability when incorporating multi-crop strategies, especially in predictor-based architectures like BYOL, SimSiam, and MoCo v3.

Method: Assigns a separate predictor to each view type and introduces cutout views (masked portions of images) to create a multi-task framework combining global, local, and masked views.

Result: The approach stabilizes training and enhances performance across ResNet and ViT models on ImageNet.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a stable, versatile solution for SSL frameworks, improving performance without architectural constraints.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods based on Siamese networks learn visual representations by aligning different views of the same image. The multi-crop strategy, which incorporates small local crops to global ones, enhances many SSL frameworks but causes instability in predictor-based architectures such as BYOL, SimSiam, and MoCo v3. We trace this failure to the shared predictor used across all views and demonstrate that assigning a separate predictor to each view type stabilizes multi-crop training, resulting in significant performance gains. Extending this idea, we treat each spatial transformation as a distinct alignment task and add cutout views, where part of the image is masked before encoding. This yields a simple multi-task formulation of asymmetric Siamese SSL that combines global, local, and masked views into a single framework. The approach is stable, generally applicable across backbones, and consistently improves the performance of ResNet and ViT models on ImageNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address error accumulation in long-sequence video generation with distilled autoregressive diffusion models.

Method: Introduce Test-Time Correction (TTC), leveraging the initial frame to calibrate intermediate states.

Result: TTC extends generation lengths with minimal overhead, matching quality of training-based methods on 30-second benchmarks.

Conclusion: TTC effectively stabilizes long-sequence generation without additional training.

Abstract: Distilled autoregressive diffusion models facilitate real-time short video synthesis but suffer from severe error accumulation during long-sequence generation. While existing Test-Time Optimization (TTO) methods prove effective for images or short clips, we identify that they fail to mitigate drift in extended sequences due to unstable reward landscapes and the hypersensitivity of distilled parameters. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Test-Time Correction (TTC), a training-free alternative. Specifically, TTC utilizes the initial frame as a stable reference anchor to calibrate intermediate stochastic states along the sampling trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method seamlessly integrates with various distilled models, extending generation lengths with negligible overhead while matching the quality of resource-intensive training-based methods on 30-second benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper presents a lightweight diffusion-based pipeline for boundary detection of irregular and translucent objects in low-data regimes, outperforming SOTA baselines and improving inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the understudied challenge of boundary detection in low-data scenarios, crucial for applications like medical imaging and environmental monitoring.

Method: Uses a CNN with self-attention layers and a simplified diffusion process to iteratively refine sparse contours, focusing on efficiency and minimal post-processing.

Result: Outperforms baselines on medical (KVASIR), skin lesion (HAM10K), and wildfire (Smoke) datasets, achieving a 3.5X faster inference framerate.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective and efficient for boundary detection in low-data settings, with broader applicability.

Abstract: Boundary detection of irregular and translucent objects is an important problem with applications in medical imaging, environmental monitoring and manufacturing, where many of these applications are plagued with scarce labeled data and low in situ computational resources. While recent image segmentation studies focus on segmentation mask alignment with ground-truth, the task of boundary detection remains understudied, especially in the low data regime. In this work, we present a lightweight discrete diffusion contour refinement pipeline for robust boundary detection in the low data regime. We use a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) architecture with self-attention layers as the core of our pipeline, and condition on a segmentation mask, iteratively denoising a sparse contour representation. We introduce multiple novel adaptations for improved low-data efficacy and inference efficiency, including using a simplified diffusion process, a customized model architecture, and minimal post processing to produce a dense, isolated contour given a dataset of size <500 training images. Our method outperforms several SOTA baselines on the medical imaging dataset KVASIR, is competitive on HAM10K and our custom wildfire dataset, Smoke, while improving inference framerate by 3.5X.

TL;DR: The paper proposes EoCD, a simple and effective change detection method that replaces traditional decoders with a parameter-free multiscale feature fusion module, reducing model complexity while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current change detection methods are computationally expensive and overly complex, often relying on sophisticated decoders. EoCD aims to simplify the process by focusing on encoder efficiency.

Method: EoCD uses early fusion of temporal data and replaces the decoder with a parameter-free multiscale feature fusion module. It highlights the encoder's role over the decoder.

Result: EoCD achieves optimal balance between performance and speed across various encoder architectures, outperforming traditional methods on four datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that change detection performance depends more on the encoder network, making decoders unnecessary additions.

Abstract: Being a cornerstone of temporal analysis, change detection has been playing a pivotal role in modern earth observation. Existing change detection methods rely on the Siamese encoder to individually extract temporal features followed by temporal fusion. Subsequently, these methods design sophisticated decoders to improve the change detection performance without taking into consideration the complexity of the model. These aforementioned issues intensify the overall computational cost as well as the network's complexity which is undesirable. Alternatively, few methods utilize the early fusion scheme to combine the temporal images. These methods prevent the extra overhead of Siamese encoder, however, they also rely on sophisticated decoders for better performance. In addition, these methods demonstrate inferior performance as compared to late fusion based methods. To bridge these gaps, we introduce encoder only change detection (EoCD) that is a simple and effective method for the change detection task. The proposed method performs the early fusion of the temporal data and replaces the decoder with a parameter-free multiscale feature fusion module thereby significantly reducing the overall complexity of the model. EoCD demonstrate the optimal balance between the change detection performance and the prediction speed across a variety of encoder architectures. Additionally, EoCD demonstrate that the performance of the model is predominantly dependent on the encoder network, making the decoder an additional component. Extensive experimentation on four challenging change detection datasets reveals the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Result: Achieves an average Dice coefficient of 0.86 ± 0.04 and lower volume errors than Simpson's biplane rule (e.g., 4.88 ± 4.26 mL vs. 8.14 ± 6.04 mL for the left ventricle).

Conclusion: The method provides a viable solution for more accurate 3D chamber quantification in 2D TTE, outperforming current clinical standards.

Abstract: Accurate 3D representations of cardiac structures allow quantitative analysis of anatomy and function. In this work, we propose a method for reconstructing complete 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of sparse planes in CT angiography (CTA) for application in 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Our method uses a neural implicit function to reconstruct the 3D shape of the cardiac chambers and left-ventricle myocardium from sparse CTA planes. To investigate the feasibility of achieving 3D reconstruction from 2D TTE, we select planes that mimic the standard apical 2D TTE views. During training, a multi-layer perceptron learns shape priors from 3D segmentations of the target structures in CTA. At test time, the network reconstructs 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of TTE-mimicking CTA planes by jointly optimizing the latent code and the rigid transforms that map the observed planes into 3D space. For each heart, we simulate four realistic apical views, and we compare reconstructed multi-class volumes with the reference CTA volumes. On a held-out set of CTA segmentations, our approach achieves an average Dice coefficient of 0.86 $\pm$ 0.04 across all structures. Our method also achieves markedly lower volume errors than the clinical standard, Simpson's biplane rule: 4.88 $\pm$ 4.26 mL vs. 8.14 $\pm$ 6.04 mL, respectively, for the left ventricle; and 6.40 $\pm$ 7.37 mL vs. 37.76 $\pm$ 22.96 mL, respectively, for the left atrium. This suggests that our approach offers a viable route to more accurate 3D chamber quantification in 2D transthoracic echocardiography.

TL;DR: CLIP-Map is a novel mapping-based framework for compressing CLIP models, outperforming select-based methods by preserving more information from original weights and reducing optimization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP suffers from high memory and computation costs, limiting its use in resource-limited scenarios. Existing compression methods often compromise feature representation.

Method: CLIP-Map uses learnable matrices and Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization to map and combine pretrained weights, along with Diagonal Inheritance Initialization for efficient optimization.

Result: CLIP-Map performs better than select-based methods across various compression ratios, especially under high compression.

Conclusion: Mapping-based compression preserves more information and offers superior performance, making CLIP-Map a promising solution for resource-efficient CLIP applications.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved widely applications in various computer vision tasks, e.g., text-to-image generation, Image-Text retrieval and Image captioning. However, CLIP suffers from high memory and computation cost, which prohibits its usage to the resource-limited application scenarios. Existing CLIP compression methods typically reduce the size of pre-trained CLIP weights by selecting their subset as weight inheritance for further retraining via mask optimization or important weight measurement. However, these select-based weight inheritance often compromises the feature presentation ability, especially on the extreme compression. In this paper, we propose a novel mapping-based CLIP compression framework, CLIP-Map. It leverages learnable matrices to map and combine pretrained weights by Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization, aiming to preserve as much information from the original weights as possible. To mitigate the optimization challenges introduced by the learnable mapping, we propose Diagonal Inheritance Initialization to reduce the distribution shifting problem for efficient and effective mapping learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP-Map outperforms select-based frameworks across various compression ratios, with particularly significant gains observed under high compression settings.

*Lingrui Li,Yanfeng Zhou,Nan Pu,Xin Chen,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGIPT is a novel prompt-tuning method for continual test-time adaptation in medical image segmentation, addressing scale diversity and instance-specific knowledge while ensuring privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution shifts in medical images across domains hinder pre-trained models' deployment, necessitating robust adaptation methods.

Method: MGIPT uses Adaptive-scale Instance Prompt (AIP) and Multi-scale Global-level Prompt (MGP) for dual-level adaptation.

Result: MGIPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in medical image segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: MGIPT offers robust adaptation across changing domains by integrating global and local knowledge.

Abstract: Distribution shift is a common challenge in medical images obtained from different clinical centers, significantly hindering the deployment of pre-trained semantic segmentation models in real-world applications across multiple domains. Continual Test-Time Adaptation(CTTA) has emerged as a promising approach to address cross-domain shifts during continually evolving target domains. Most existing CTTA methods rely on incrementally updating model parameters, which inevitably suffer from error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting, especially in long-term adaptation. Recent prompt-tuning-based works have shown potential to mitigate the two issues above by updating only visual prompts. While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance, several limitations remain:1)lacking multi-scale prompt diversity, 2)inadequate incorporation of instance-specific knowledge, and 3)risk of privacy leakage. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning(MGIPT), to enhance scale diversity of prompts and capture both global- and instance-level knowledge for robust CTTA. Specifically, MGIPT consists of an Adaptive-scale Instance Prompt(AIP) and a Multi-scale Global-level Prompt(MGP). AIP dynamically learns lightweight and instance-specific prompts to mitigate error accumulation with adaptive optimal-scale selection mechanism. MGP captures domain-level knowledge across different scales to ensure robust adaptation with anti-forgetting capabilities. These complementary components are combined through a weighted ensemble approach, enabling effective dual-level adaptation that integrates both global and local information. Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our MGIPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving robust adaptation across continually changing target domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper advocates for optimizing the source distribution in flow matching models for text-to-image generation, showing it improves performance and convergence compared to standard Gaussian source distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow matching approaches often default to Gaussian source distributions without optimizing them, missing potential benefits from better exploiting conditioning signals.

Method: Proposes learning a condition-dependent source distribution with variance regularization and directional alignment to prevent collapse and instability.

Result: Demonstrates robust improvements in text-to-image benchmarks, including up to 3x faster FID convergence.

Conclusion: Principled source distribution design enhances flow matching performance, highlighting its feasibility and benefits in modern text-to-image systems.

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a promising alternative to diffusion-based generative models, particularly for text-to-image generation. Despite its flexibility in allowing arbitrary source distributions, most existing approaches rely on a standard Gaussian distribution, a choice inherited from diffusion models, and rarely consider the source distribution itself as an optimization target in such settings. In this work, we show that principled design of the source distribution is not only feasible but also beneficial at the scale of modern text-to-image systems. Specifically, we propose learning a condition-dependent source distribution under flow matching objective that better exploit rich conditioning signals. We identify key failure modes that arise when directly incorporating conditioning into the source, including distributional collapse and instability, and show that appropriate variance regularization and directional alignment between source and target are critical for stable and effective learning. We further analyze how the choice of target representation space impacts flow matching with structured sources, revealing regimes in which such designs are most effective. Extensive experiments across multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate consistent and robust improvements, including up to a 3x faster convergence in FID, highlighting the practical benefits of a principled source distribution design for conditional flow matching.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LSA improves video generation by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated clips, enhancing temporal consistency without external controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on control signals during inference, limiting scalability and generalizability in video generation.

Method: LSA fine-tunes pre-trained models by comparing semantic features around dynamic objects, combining consistency loss with diffusion loss.

Result: The model outperforms baselines in video generation metrics and shows improved temporal consistency (mAP, mIoU).

Conclusion: LSA effectively enhances temporal consistency without extra inference controls or computational costs.

Abstract: Controllable video generation has emerged as a versatile tool for autonomous driving, enabling realistic synthesis of traffic scenarios. However, existing methods depend on control signals at inference time to guide the generative model towards temporally consistent generation of dynamic objects, limiting their utility as scalable and generalizable data engines. In this work, we propose Localized Semantic Alignment (LSA), a simple yet effective framework for fine-tuning pre-trained video generation models. LSA enhances temporal consistency by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips. Specifically, we compare the output of an off-the-shelf feature extraction model between the ground-truth and generated video clips localized around dynamic objects inducing a semantic feature consistency loss. We fine-tune the base model by combining this loss with the standard diffusion loss. The model fine-tuned for a single epoch with our novel loss outperforms the baselines in common video generation evaluation metrics. To further test the temporal consistency in generated videos we adapt two additional metrics from object detection task, namely mAP and mIoU. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing temporal consistency in video generation without the need for external control signals during inference and any computational overheads.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the under-explored capability of generative video models to internalize and reason over implicit world rules.

Method: The authors create RISE-Video, a benchmark with 467 human-annotated samples across eight categories, and propose a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol aided by Large Multimodal Models.

Result: Experiments on 11 TI2V models reveal significant limitations in simulating complex scenarios under implicit constraints.

Conclusion: RISE-Video provides critical insights for advancing future generative models focused on world simulation and reasoning.

Abstract: While generative video models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity, their capacity to internalize and reason over implicit world rules remains a critical yet under-explored frontier. To bridge this gap, we present RISE-Video, a pioneering reasoning-oriented benchmark for Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) synthesis that shifts the evaluative focus from surface-level aesthetics to deep cognitive reasoning. RISE-Video comprises 467 meticulously human-annotated samples spanning eight rigorous categories, providing a structured testbed for probing model intelligence across diverse dimensions, ranging from commonsense and spatial dynamics to specialized subject domains. Our framework introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol consisting of four metrics: \textit{Reasoning Alignment}, \textit{Temporal Consistency}, \textit{Physical Rationality}, and \textit{Visual Quality}. To further support scalable evaluation, we propose an automated pipeline leveraging Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to emulate human-centric assessment. Extensive experiments on 11 state-of-the-art TI2V models reveal pervasive deficiencies in simulating complex scenarios under implicit constraints, offering critical insights for the advancement of future world-simulating generative models.

*Jie Deng,Kaichun Yao,Libo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisRefiner improves screenshot-to-code generation by training models to learn from visual differences between rendered predictions and reference designs, enhancing layout fidelity and self-refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack iterative feedback from visual outcomes, unlike human developers who learn from visual differences to refine code. VisRefiner aims to bridge this gap.

Method: VisRefiner uses difference-aligned supervision to link visual discrepancies with code edits and incorporates reinforcement learning for self-refinement by observing rendered outputs and target designs.

Result: Experiments show VisRefiner improves single-step generation quality and layout fidelity, along with strong self-refinement capabilities.

Conclusion: Learning from visual differences significantly advances screenshot-to-code generation, demonstrating VisRefiner's effectiveness.

Abstract: Screenshot-to-code generation aims to translate user interface screenshots into executable frontend code that faithfully reproduces the target layout and style. Existing multimodal large language models perform this mapping directly from screenshots but are trained without observing the visual outcomes of their generated code. In contrast, human developers iteratively render their implementation, compare it with the design, and learn how visual differences relate to code changes. Inspired by this process, we propose VisRefiner, a training framework that enables models to learn from visual differences between rendered predictions and reference designs. We construct difference-aligned supervision that associates visual discrepancies with corresponding code edits, allowing the model to understand how appearance variations arise from implementation changes. Building on this, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage for self-refinement, where the model improves its generated code by observing both the rendered output and the target design, identifying their visual differences, and updating the code accordingly. Experiments show that VisRefiner substantially improves single-step generation quality and layout fidelity, while also endowing models with strong self-refinement ability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of learning from visual differences for advancing screenshot-to-code generation.

TL;DR: The paper critiques traditional pointwise scoring for visual generation evaluation, proposing GenArena for stable, human-aligned pairwise comparisons, boosting accuracy by 20% and outperforming proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation methods lag behind visual generation advancements, lacking reliability and human alignment.

Method: GenArena uses pairwise comparison to replace absolute pointwise scoring for more stable and human-aligned evaluations.

Result: GenArena improves accuracy by over 20%, achieves 0.86 Spearman correlation, and outperforms proprietary models.

Conclusion: GenArena provides a rigorous, automated standard for evaluating visual generation models, addressing limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of visual generation models has outpaced traditional evaluation approaches, necessitating the adoption of Vision-Language Models as surrogate judges. In this work, we systematically investigate the reliability of the prevailing absolute pointwise scoring standard, across a wide spectrum of visual generation tasks. Our analysis reveals that this paradigm is limited due to stochastic inconsistency and poor alignment with human perception. To resolve these limitations, we introduce GenArena, a unified evaluation framework that leverages a pairwise comparison paradigm to ensure stable and human-aligned evaluation. Crucially, our experiments uncover a transformative finding that simply adopting this pairwise protocol enables off-the-shelf open-source models to outperform top-tier proprietary models. Notably, our method boosts evaluation accuracy by over 20% and achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.86 with the authoritative LMArena leaderboard, drastically surpassing the 0.36 correlation of pointwise methods. Based on GenArena, we benchmark state-of-the-art visual generation models across diverse tasks, providing the community with a rigorous and automated evaluation standard for visual generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Context Forcing trains a long-context student using a long-context teacher, eliminating supervision mismatch and enabling long-term consistency in video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the student-teacher mismatch in current streaming tuning strategies for long video generation, where short-context teachers fail to guide students on global temporal dependencies.

Method: Introduces Context Forcing with a Slow-Fast Memory architecture to manage growing context efficiently, reducing visual redundancy.

Result: Achieves effective context lengths exceeding 20 seconds, 2-10 times longer than state-of-the-art methods, improving long-term consistency.

Conclusion: Context Forcing surpasses existing methods in long video evaluation metrics by leveraging extended context.

Abstract: Recent approaches to real-time long video generation typically employ streaming tuning strategies, attempting to train a long-context student using a short-context (memoryless) teacher. In these frameworks, the student performs long rollouts but receives supervision from a teacher limited to short 5-second windows. This structural discrepancy creates a critical \textbf{student-teacher mismatch}: the teacher's inability to access long-term history prevents it from guiding the student on global temporal dependencies, effectively capping the student's context length. To resolve this, we propose \textbf{Context Forcing}, a novel framework that trains a long-context student via a long-context teacher. By ensuring the teacher is aware of the full generation history, we eliminate the supervision mismatch, enabling the robust training of models capable of long-term consistency. To make this computationally feasible for extreme durations (e.g., 2 minutes), we introduce a context management system that transforms the linearly growing context into a \textbf{Slow-Fast Memory} architecture, significantly reducing visual redundancy. Extensive results demonstrate that our method enables effective context lengths exceeding 20 seconds -- 2 to 10 times longer than state-of-the-art methods like LongLive and Infinite-RoPE. By leveraging this extended context, Context Forcing preserves superior consistency across long durations, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines on various long video evaluation metrics.

*David Shavin,Sagie Benaim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Splat and Distill, a framework to enhance 3D awareness in 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) using a feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of VFMs in 2D tasks, they lack 3D awareness. The authors aim to bridge this gap.

Method: The framework lifts 2D features into a 3D Gaussian representation, splats them onto novel viewpoints for supervision, and distills 3D knowledge into the student model.

Result: The method outperforms prior works, improving 3D awareness and semantic richness of 2D features in downstream tasks like depth estimation and segmentation.

Conclusion: Splat and Distill effectively instills 3D awareness into 2D VFMs, advancing their performance in diverse tasks.

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have achieved remarkable success when applied to various downstream 2D tasks. Despite their effectiveness, they often exhibit a critical lack of 3D awareness. To this end, we introduce Splat and Distill, a framework that instills robust 3D awareness into 2D VFMs by augmenting the teacher model with a fast, feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline. Given 2D features produced by a teacher model, our method first lifts these features into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation, in a feedforward manner. These 3D features are then ``splatted" onto novel viewpoints, producing a set of novel 2D feature maps used to supervise the student model, ``distilling" geometrically grounded knowledge. By replacing slow per-scene optimization of prior work with our feed-forward lifting approach, our framework avoids feature-averaging artifacts, creating a dynamic learning process where the teacher's consistency improves alongside that of the student. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on a suite of downstream tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation. Our method significantly outperforms prior works, not only achieving substantial gains in 3D awareness but also enhancing the underlying semantic richness of 2D features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V-Retrver is an evidence-driven retrieval framework that improves multimodal retrieval by integrating dynamic visual inspection and interleaved reasoning, trained via curriculum learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal retrieval methods rely heavily on static visual encodings and lack active visual verification, leading to speculative reasoning in ambiguous cases.

Method: V-Retrver uses an MLLM to selectively gather visual evidence via external tools, alternating between hypothesis generation and visual verification. Training involves curriculum learning with supervised activation, rejection refinement, and reinforcement learning.

Result: V-Retrver achieves a 23.0% average improvement in retrieval accuracy across benchmarks, with better reasoning reliability and generalization.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses limitations of static visual encodings by integrating dynamic evidence gathering, enhancing multimodal retrieval performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently been applied to universal multimodal retrieval, where Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves candidate reranking. However, existing approaches remain largely language-driven, relying on static visual encodings and lacking the ability to actively verify fine-grained visual evidence, which often leads to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases. We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective. Experiments across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy (with 23.0% improvements on average), perception-driven reasoning reliability, and generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InterPrior is a scalable framework combining imitation learning and reinforcement learning to enable humanoid robots to generalize loco-manipulation skills while maintaining whole-body coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of scaling physical and motor priors for humanoid robots to generalize complex interactions with objects.

Method: Combines imitation pretraining to distill a variational policy and reinforcement learning finetuning with data augmentation.

Result: The framework successfully generalizes beyond training data, enabling interactions with unseen objects and potential real-world deployment.

Conclusion: InterPrior demonstrates effectiveness in scalable, generalized control for humanoid robots.

Abstract: Humans rarely plan whole-body interactions with objects at the level of explicit whole-body movements. High-level intentions, such as affordance, define the goal, while coordinated balance, contact, and manipulation can emerge naturally from underlying physical and motor priors. Scaling such priors is key to enabling humanoids to compose and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination. To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects. We further demonstrate its effectiveness for user-interactive control and its potential for real robot deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoThinker is a framework for active perception in spatial reasoning, replacing passive fusion with selective geometric evidence retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing integration strategies for spatial reasoning in MLLMs passively fuse geometry, leading to misalignment and redundancy.

Method: GeoThinker uses Spatial-Grounded Fusion and Importance Gating to selectively retrieve and integrate task-relevant geometry via cross-attention.

Result: GeoThinker achieves a peak score of 72.6 on VSI-Bench and demonstrates robust generalization in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: Active integration of spatial structures is crucial for advancing spatial intelligence.

Abstract: Recent progress in spatial reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly leverages geometric priors from 3D encoders. However, most existing integration strategies remain passive: geometry is exposed as a global stream and fused in an indiscriminate manner, which often induces semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals. We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench. Furthermore, GeoThinker demonstrates robust generalization and significantly improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving. Our results indicate that the ability to actively integrate spatial structures is essential for next-generation spatial intelligence. Code can be found at https://github.com/Li-Hao-yuan/GeoThinker.

TL;DR: SwimBird is a multimodal LLM that dynamically switches between text, vision, or interleaved reasoning modes to improve performance on both textual and vision-intensive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs rely heavily on textual reasoning, limiting their effectiveness on vision-intensive tasks. Fixed visual reasoning patterns often degrade text-based logic, highlighting the need for adaptive reasoning modes.

Method: SwimBird introduces a hybrid autoregressive formulation for next-token (text) and next-embedding (visual) prediction. It uses a curated dataset (SwimBird-SFT-92K) covering three reasoning modes: text-only, vision-only, and interleaved.

Result: SwimBird achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse benchmarks, balancing strong textual logic with improved vision-dense task results.

Conclusion: Dynamic, query-adaptive reasoning mode selection in SwimBird outperforms fixed-pattern MLLMs, demonstrating robust gains in both textual and visual understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in multimodal perception and reasoning by bridging vision and language. However, most existing MLLMs perform reasoning primarily with textual CoT, which limits their effectiveness on vision-intensive tasks. Recent approaches inject a fixed number of continuous hidden states as "visual thoughts" into the reasoning process and improve visual performance, but often at the cost of degraded text-based logical reasoning. We argue that the core limitation lies in a rigid, pre-defined reasoning pattern that cannot adaptively choose the most suitable thinking modality for different user queries. We introduce SwimBird, a reasoning-switchable MLLM that dynamically switches among three reasoning modes conditioned on the input: (1) text-only reasoning, (2) vision-only reasoning (continuous hidden states as visual thoughts), and (3) interleaved vision-text reasoning. To enable this capability, we adopt a hybrid autoregressive formulation that unifies next-token prediction for textual thoughts with next-embedding prediction for visual thoughts, and design a systematic reasoning-mode curation strategy to construct SwimBird-SFT-92K, a diverse supervised fine-tuning dataset covering all three reasoning patterns. By enabling flexible, query-adaptive mode selection, SwimBird preserves strong textual logic while substantially improving performance on vision-dense tasks. Experiments across diverse benchmarks covering textual reasoning and challenging visual understanding demonstrate that SwimBird achieves state-of-the-art results and robust gains over prior fixed-pattern multimodal reasoning methods.

TL;DR: CAMCUE is a pose-aware multi-image framework improving 3D reasoning from multi-view observations by using camera pose as a geometric anchor, achieving significant accuracy and efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with multi-image spatial reasoning and perspective taking, requiring coherent 3D understanding across viewpoints.

Method: CAMCUE integrates camera pose into visual tokens, grounds language descriptions to target poses, and synthesizes pose-conditioned views for reasoning.

Result: CAMCUE improves accuracy by 9.06%, achieves high pose prediction accuracy, and reduces inference time from 256.6s to 1.45s per example.

Conclusion: CAMCUE advances multi-view reasoning with direct pose grounding, enabling fast and accurate perspective-shift answers in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-image spatial reasoning remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While single-view perception is inherently 2D, reasoning over multiple views requires building a coherent scene understanding across viewpoints. In particular, we study perspective taking, where a model must build a coherent 3D understanding from multi-view observations and use it to reason from a new, language-specified viewpoint. We introduce CAMCUE, a pose-aware multi-image framework that uses camera pose as an explicit geometric anchor for cross-view fusion and novel-view reasoning. CAMCUE injects per-view pose into visual tokens, grounds natural-language viewpoint descriptions to a target camera pose, and synthesizes a pose-conditioned imagined target view to support answering. To support this setting, we curate CAMCUE-DATA with 27,668 training and 508 test instances pairing multi-view images and poses with diverse target-viewpoint descriptions and perspective-shift questions. We also include human-annotated viewpoint descriptions in the test split to evaluate generalization to human language. CAMCUE improves overall accuracy by 9.06% and predicts target poses from natural-language viewpoint descriptions with over 90% rotation accuracy within 20° and translation accuracy within a 0.5 error threshold. This direct grounding avoids expensive test-time search-and-match, reducing inference time from 256.6s to 1.45s per example and enabling fast, interactive use in real-world scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing reliance on LLMs for biomedical question answering necessitates reliable evaluation methods due to the complexity of expert verification and medical terminology.

Method: BioACE evaluates answers and citations using automated metrics like completeness, correctness, precision, and recall, integrating approaches such as NLI and pre-trained models.

Result: Extensive experiments show correlations between automated metrics and human evaluations, identifying optimal methods for biomedical answer and citation assessment.

Conclusion: BioACE provides an effective automated solution for evaluating biomedical LLM outputs, offering a standardized framework for quality assessment.

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) for generating answers to biomedical questions, it is crucial to evaluate the quality of the generated answers and the references provided to support the facts in the generated answers. Evaluation of text generated by LLMs remains a challenge for question answering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), summarization, and many other natural language processing tasks in the biomedical domain, due to the requirements of expert assessment to verify consistency with the scientific literature and complex medical terminology. In this work, we propose BioACE, an automated framework for evaluating biomedical answers and citations against the facts stated in the answers. The proposed BioACE framework considers multiple aspects, including completeness, correctness, precision, and recall, in relation to the ground-truth nuggets for answer evaluation. We developed automated approaches to evaluate each of the aforementioned aspects and performed extensive experiments to assess and analyze their correlation with human evaluations. In addition, we considered multiple existing approaches, such as natural language inference (NLI) and pre-trained language models and LLMs, to evaluate the quality of evidence provided to support the generated answers in the form of citations into biomedical literature. With the detailed experiments and analysis, we provide the best approaches for biomedical answer and citation evaluation as a part of BioACE (https://github.com/deepaknlp/BioACE) evaluation package.

TL;DR: CoWork-X is a framework for real-time, cooperative tasks using a Skill-Agent and Co-Optimizer to improve performance and reduce latency under token budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of sub-second coordination and sustained multi-episode adaptation in cooperative tasks with limited online token budgets.

Method: CoWork-X combines HTN-based skill retrieval (Skill-Agent) and patch-style skill consolidation (Co-Optimizer) with budget constraints and drift regularization.

Result: Achieves stable performance gains, reduces latency, and lowers token usage in real-time collaboration benchmarks like Overcooked-AI.

Conclusion: CoWork-X effectively balances real-time execution and skill adaptation, offering reliable low-cost performance in cooperative tasks.

Abstract: Large language models are enabling language-conditioned agents in interactive environments, but highly cooperative tasks often impose two simultaneous constraints: sub-second real-time coordination and sustained multi-episode adaptation under a strict online token budget. Existing approaches either rely on frequent in-episode reasoning that induces latency and timing jitter, or deliver post-episode improvements through unstructured text that is difficult to compile into reliable low-cost execution. We propose CoWork-X, an active co-evolution framework that casts peer collaboration as a closed-loop optimization problem across episodes, inspired by fast--slow memory separation. CoWork-X instantiates a Skill-Agent that executes via HTN (hierarchical task network)-based skill retrieval from a structured, interpretable, and compositional skill library, and a post-episode Co-Optimizer that performs patch-style skill consolidation with explicit budget constraints and drift regularization. Experiments in challenging Overcooked-AI-like realtime collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CoWork-X achieves stable, cumulative performance gains while steadily reducing online latency and token usage.

### [108] [Capacity Constraints and the Multilingual Penalty for Lexical Disambiguation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05035)
*Sean Trott,Pamela D. Rivière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multilingual LMs often perform worse than monolingual ones due to capacity constraints like reduced embedding isotropy, attentional limitations, and vocabulary issues, which collectively explain their poorer lexical disambiguation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why multilingual LMs underperform monolingual ones in tasks requiring precise semantic representations, focusing on lexical disambiguation.

Method: Used controlled datasets of human relatedness judgments for ambiguous words in English and Spanish, comparing monolingual and multilingual LMs from the same families. Explored three capacity constraints: representational, attentional, and vocabulary-related.

Result: Multilingual LMs exhibited all three constraints, which statistically accounted for their reduced performance in disambiguation tasks.

Conclusion: Multilingual LMs suffer from multiple capacity constraints, which correlate with their poorer lexical disambiguation performance.

Abstract: Multilingual language models (LMs) sometimes under-perform their monolingual counterparts, possibly due to capacity limitations. We quantify this ``multilingual penalty'' for lexical disambiguation--a task requiring precise semantic representations and contextualization mechanisms--using controlled datasets of human relatedness judgments for ambiguous words in both English and Spanish. Comparing monolingual and multilingual LMs from the same families, we find consistently reduced performance in multilingual LMs. We then explore three potential capacity constraints: representational (reduced embedding isotropy), attentional (reduced attention to disambiguating cues), and vocabulary-related (increased multi-token segmentation). Multilingual LMs show some evidence of all three limitations; moreover, these factors statistically account for the variance formerly attributed to a model's multilingual status. These findings suggest both that multilingual LMs do suffer from multiple capacity constraints, and that these constraints correlate with reduced disambiguation performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured framework to address the lack of systematic optimization in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) by introducing a collaboration gain metric and a factor attribution paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid progress in LLMs and MAS lacks a unified scientific framework, relying on trial-and-error, which hinders systematic optimization and improvement.

Method: The authors introduce a collaboration gain metric ($Γ$) to measure intrinsic gains and propose a factor attribution paradigm. They also construct a systematic MAS factor library.

Result: The framework aims to shift MAS research from empirical adjustments to rigorous science, distinguishing genuine collaboration from resource accumulation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances the field towards Collective AI by enabling structured optimization and systematic factor attribution.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly extended the capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), demonstrating significant effectiveness across a wide range of complex and open-ended domains. However, despite this rapid progress, the field still relies heavily on empirical trial-and-error. It lacks a unified and principled scientific framework necessary for systematic optimization and improvement. This bottleneck stems from the ambiguity of attribution: first, the absence of a structured taxonomy of factors leaves researchers restricted to unguided adjustments; second, the lack of a unified metric fails to distinguish genuine collaboration gain from mere resource accumulation. In this paper, we advocate for a transition to design science through an integrated framework. We advocate to establish the collaboration gain metric ($Γ$) as the scientific standard to isolate intrinsic gains from increased budgets. Leveraging $Γ$, we propose a factor attribution paradigm to systematically identify collaboration-driving factors. To support this, we construct a systematic MAS factor library, structuring the design space into control-level presets and information-level dynamics. Ultimately, this framework facilitates the transition from blind experimentation to rigorous science, paving the way towards a true science of Collective AI.

*Sidi Lu,Zhenwen Liang,Dongyang Ma,Yan Wang,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Locas introduces a parametric memory for flexible integration into transformer models, enabling efficient continual learning with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge test-time-training with parametric memory to enhance continual learning and reduce catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Locas uses FFN block designs (MLP or GLU-FFN) and principled initialization to integrate memory into models.

Result: Achieved efficient storage of past context with 0.02% additional parameters and minimal capability loss.

Conclusion: Locas effectively integrates memory into models, enabling continual learning with low computational and parameter costs.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to bridge test-time-training with a new type of parametric memory that can be flexibly offloaded from or merged into model parameters. We present Locas, a Locally-Supported parametric memory that shares the design of FFN blocks in modern transformers, allowing it to be flexibly permanentized into the model parameters while supporting efficient continual learning. We discuss two major variants of Locas: one with a conventional two-layer MLP design that has a clearer theoretical guarantee; the other one shares the same GLU-FFN structure with SOTA LLMs, and can be easily attached to existing models for both parameter-efficient and computation-efficient continual learning. Crucially, we show that proper initialization of such low-rank sideway-FFN-style memories -- performed in a principled way by reusing model parameters, activations and/or gradients -- is essential for fast convergence, improved generalization, and catastrophic forgetting prevention. We validate the proposed memory mechanism on the PG-19 whole-book language modeling and LoCoMo long-context dialogue question answering tasks. With only 0.02\% additional parameters in the lowest case, Locas-GLU is capable of storing the information from past context while maintaining a much smaller context window. In addition, we also test the model's general capability loss after memorizing the whole book with Locas, through comparative MMLU evaluation. Results show the promising ability of Locas to permanentize past context into parametric knowledge with minimized catastrophic forgetting of the model's existing internal knowledge.

Result: Demonstrates efficacy with metaphor identification, providing real-time token-level evaluation against human standards.

Conclusion: LinguistAgent bridges the gap between LLMs' potential and practical utility for researchers, with released code.

Abstract: Data annotation remains a significant bottleneck in the Humanities and Social Sciences, particularly for complex semantic tasks such as metaphor identification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of synthetic data generation using transformer models by proposing DKPS, a framework providing mathematical guarantees for output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeled data scarcity hampers AI model performance, and current synthetic data generation methods lack predictability. DKPS aims to offer statistical guarantees.

Method: Introduces DKPS, a mathematical framework for analyzing transformer outputs, demonstrating its derivation and application to downstream tasks like machine translation.

Result: DKPS provides concrete statistical guarantees for synthetic data quality, improving predictability and performance in tasks like neural machine translation.

Conclusion: DKPS offers a foundation for reliable synthetic data generation, though limitations exist, prompting future research directions.

Abstract: Scarcity of labeled training data remains the long pole in the tent for building performant language technology and generative AI models. Transformer models -- particularly LLMs -- are increasingly being used to mitigate the data scarcity problem via synthetic data generation. However, because the models are black boxes, the properties of the synthetic data are difficult to predict. In practice it is common for language technology engineers to 'fiddle' with the LLM temperature setting and hope that what comes out the other end improves the downstream model. Faced with this uncertainty, here we propose Data Kernel Perspective Space (DKPS) to provide the foundation for mathematical analysis yielding concrete statistical guarantees for the quality of the outputs of transformer models. We first show the mathematical derivation of DKPS and how it provides performance guarantees. Next we show how DKPS performance guarantees can elucidate performance of a downstream task, such as neural machine translation models or LLMs trained using Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO). Limitations of the current work and future research are also discussed.

TL;DR: A multimodal method improves implicit discourse relation classification by combining text and audio across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of inferring implicit discourse relations from context, especially when cues span modalities and languages.

Method: Construct a multilingual and multimodal dataset (English, French, Spanish) and use Qwen2-Audio to integrate textual and acoustic information for classification.

Result: Text-based models outperform audio-based ones, but combining modalities enhances performance, and cross-lingual transfer aids low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Multimodal integration and cross-lingual transfer can improve implicit discourse relation classification, especially for languages with limited resources.

Abstract: Implicit discourse relation classification is a challenging task, as it requires inferring meaning from context. While contextual cues can be distributed across modalities and vary across languages, they are not always captured by text alone. To address this, we introduce an automatic method for distantly related and unrelated language pairs to construct a multilingual and multimodal dataset for implicit discourse relations in English, French, and Spanish. For classification, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates textual and acoustic information through Qwen2-Audio, allowing joint modeling of text and audio for implicit discourse relation classification across languages. We find that while text-based models outperform audio-based models, integrating both modalities can enhance performance, and cross-lingual transfer can provide substantial improvements for low-resource languages.

TL;DR: GreekMMLU is a native-sourced benchmark for evaluating LLMs in Greek, addressing gaps in existing datasets. It includes 21,805 questions across 45 subjects, with evaluations revealing performance gaps among models and insights for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multilingual benchmarks for Greek often rely on machine-translated content, missing linguistic and cultural nuances. There's a need for authentic, native-sourced evaluation data.

Method: GreekMMLU comprises 21,805 multiple-choice questions sourced or authored in Greek from academic, professional, and governmental exams. The dataset spans 45 subjects and includes difficulty levels from primary to professional exams.

Result: Evaluations of 80+ LLMs show significant performance gaps between frontier and open-weight models, and between Greek-adapted and general multilingual models. A private leaderboard ensures contamination-resistant evaluation.

Conclusion: GreekMMLU fills a critical gap in Greek language evaluation benchmarks. The study highlights factors like model scale, adaptation, and prompting that influence performance, offering insights for enhancing Greek language capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly trained on multilingual corpora that include Greek, yet reliable evaluation benchmarks for Greek-particularly those based on authentic, native-sourced content-remain limited. Existing datasets are often machine-translated from English, failing to capture Greek linguistic and cultural characteristics. We introduce GreekMMLU, a native-sourced benchmark for massive multitask language understanding in Greek, comprising 21,805 multiple-choice questions across 45 subject areas, organized under a newly defined subject taxonomy and annotated with educational difficulty levels spanning primary to professional examinations. All questions are sourced or authored in Greek from academic, professional, and governmental exams. We publicly release 16,857 samples and reserve 4,948 samples for a private leaderboard to enable robust and contamination-resistant evaluation. Evaluations of over 80 open- and closed-source LLMs reveal substantial performance gaps between frontier and open-weight models, as well as between Greek-adapted models and general multilingual ones. Finally, we provide a systematic analysis of factors influencing performance-including model scale, adaptation, and prompting-and derive insights for improving LLM capabilities in Greek.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the risks of malicious language models in collaborative multi-LLM systems, quantifies their impact, and proposes mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critical safety risks posed by malicious or compromised models in decentralized multi-LLM collaboration systems.

Method: Engineered four categories of malicious LMs, integrated them into popular collaboration systems, and evaluated impact across 10 datasets. Proposed mitigation using external supervisors.

Result: Malicious models significantly degrade system performance, especially in reasoning and safety domains. Mitigation strategies recover 95.31% of initial performance.

Conclusion: While proposed strategies mitigate risks, fully securing multi-LLM systems against malicious models remains an open challenge.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly used in collaboration: multiple LMs trained by different parties collaborate through routing systems, multi-agent debate, model merging, and more. Critical safety risks remain in this decentralized paradigm: what if some of the models in multi-LLM systems are compromised or malicious? We first quantify the impact of malicious models by engineering four categories of malicious LMs, plug them into four types of popular model collaboration systems, and evaluate the compromised system across 10 datasets. We find that malicious models have a severe impact on the multi-LLM systems, especially for reasoning and safety domains where performance is lowered by 7.12% and 7.94% on average. We then propose mitigation strategies to alleviate the impact of malicious components, by employing external supervisors that oversee model collaboration to disable/mask them out to reduce their influence. On average, these strategies recover 95.31% of the initial performance, while making model collaboration systems fully resistant to malicious models remains an open research question.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to distill collaborative patterns from multiple LMs into a single model for efficiency, and proposes an evolution loop for continuous improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the strengths of collaborative LMs while reducing computational costs.

Method: Distill collaborative outputs into one model and create an evolution loop where models improve iteratively.

Result: Individual models improve by 8.0%, and collaborative systems by 14.9%. The loop outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: The distilled model and evolution loop effectively reduce costs and enhance performance.

Abstract: Model collaboration -- systems where multiple language models (LMs) collaborate -- combines the strengths of diverse models with cost in loading multiple LMs. We improve efficiency while preserving the strengths of collaboration by distilling collaborative patterns into a single model, where the model is trained on the outputs of the model collaboration system. At inference time, only the distilled model is employed: it imitates the collaboration while only incurring the cost of a single model. Furthermore, we propose the single-multi evolution loop: multiple LMs collaborate, each distills from the collaborative outputs, and these post-distillation improved LMs collaborate again, forming a collective evolution ecosystem where models evolve and self-improve by interacting with an environment of other models. Extensive experiments with 7 collaboration strategies and 15 tasks (QA, reasoning, factuality, etc.) demonstrate that: 1) individual models improve by 8.0% on average, absorbing the strengths of collaboration while reducing the cost to a single model; 2) the collaboration also benefits from the stronger and more synergistic LMs after distillation, improving over initial systems without evolution by 14.9% on average. Analysis reveals that the single-multi evolution loop outperforms various existing evolutionary AI methods, is compatible with diverse model/collaboration/distillation settings, and helps solve problems where the initial model/system struggles to.

TL;DR: Open-weight LLMs perform comparably to proprietary LLMs in harmful content moderation, with specificity often exceeding sensitivity except for intolerance and threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the effectiveness of open-weight LLMs versus proprietary LLMs for harmful content moderation, considering privacy and hardware constraints.

Method: Evaluated seven state-of-the-art LLMs (four proprietary, three open-weight) using real-world Bluesky post data, moderation decisions, and author annotations.

Result: Open-weight LLMs showed sensitivity (81%--97%) and specificity (91%--100%) comparable to proprietary models (72%--98%, 93%--99%). Specificity was higher for rudeness, while sensitivity surpassed for intolerance and threats.

Conclusion: Open-weight LLMs are viable for privacy-preserving moderation on consumer hardware, offering flexibility to balance community standards and user preferences.

Abstract: As internet access expands, so does exposure to harmful content, increasing the need for effective moderation. Research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively utilized for social media moderation tasks, including harmful content detection. While proprietary LLMs have been shown to zero-shot outperform traditional machine learning models, the out-of-the-box capability of open-weight LLMs remains an open question.
  Motivated by recent developments of reasoning LLMs, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art models: four proprietary and three open-weight. Testing with real-world posts on Bluesky, moderation decisions by Bluesky Moderation Service, and annotations by two authors, we find a considerable degree of overlap between the sensitivity (81%--97%) and specificity (91%--100%) of the open-weight LLMs and those (72%--98%, and 93%--99%) of the proprietary ones. Additionally, our analysis reveals that specificity exceeds sensitivity for rudeness detection, but the opposite holds for intolerance and threats. Lastly, we identify inter-rater agreement across human moderators and the LLMs, highlighting considerations for deploying LLMs in both platform-scale and personalized moderation contexts. These findings show open-weight LLMs can support privacy-preserving moderation on consumer-grade hardware and suggest new directions for designing moderation systems that balance community values with individual user preferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand LLM citation tendencies and their alignment with human preferences, addressing gaps in controlling and optimizing cite-worthiness recognition.

Method: A dataset categorizing web-derived texts into eight citation-motivation types was constructed, with pairwise preferences evaluated across all combinations. Experiments included Direct Preference Optimization for model calibration.

Result: LLMs overcite text marked as needing citations (e.g., Wikipedia) by up to 27% and underselect numeric sentences (-22.6%) and personal names (-20.1%). Stronger models mimic human preferences for medical text citations. Calibration improves alignment.

Conclusion: The study highlights misalignments between LLM and human citation behaviors, offering insights for optimizing cite-worthiness recognition and laying groundwork for future research.

Abstract: Most services built on powerful large-scale language models (LLMs) add citations to their output to enhance credibility. Recent research has paid increasing attention to the question of what reference documents to link to outputs. However, how LLMs recognize cite-worthiness and how this process should be controlled remains underexplored. In this study, we focus on what kinds of content LLMs currently tend to cite and how well that behavior aligns with human preferences. We construct a dataset to characterize the relationship between human citation preferences and LLM behavior. Web-derived texts are categorized into eight citation-motivation types, and pairwise citation preferences are exhaustively evaluated across all type combinations to capture fine-grained contrasts. Our results show that humans most frequently seek citations for medical text, and stronger models display a similar tendency. We also find that current models are as much as $27\%$ more likely than humans to add citations to text that is explicitly marked as needing citations on sources such as Wikipedia, and this overemphasis reduces alignment accuracy. Conversely, models systematically underselect numeric sentences (by $-22.6\%$ relative to humans) and sentences containing personal names (by $-20.1\%$), categories for which humans typically demand citations. Furthermore, experiments with Direct Preference Optimization demonstrate that model behavior can be calibrated to better match human citation preferences. We expect this study to provide a foundation for more fine-grained investigations into LLM citation preferences.

TL;DR: This study analyzes fine-grained knowledge proximity between academia and industry using entity and semantic space measurements, revealing rising proximity post-technological change and academia's weakening dominance during paradigm shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies lack detailed analysis of knowledge units, limiting understanding of academia-industry collaboration's fine-grained dynamics.

Method: Quantifies co-evolution using pre-trained models for entity extraction, cosine similarity for sequence overlaps, complex network analysis, and unsupervised contrastive learning for semantic space convergence.

Result: Finds increasing knowledge proximity post-technological change and academia's reduced dominance during paradigm shifts.

Conclusion: Provides textual evidence of bidirectional adaptation, aiding collaboration frameworks and resource allocation efficiency.

Abstract: The academia and industry are characterized by a reciprocal shaping and dynamic feedback mechanism. Despite distinct institutional logics, they have adapted closely in collaborative publishing and talent mobility, demonstrating tension between institutional divergence and intensive collaboration. Existing studies on their knowledge proximity mainly rely on macro indicators such as the number of collaborative papers or patents, lacking an analysis of knowledge units in the literature. This has led to an insufficient grasp of fine-grained knowledge proximity between industry and academia, potentially undermining collaboration frameworks and resource allocation efficiency. To remedy the limitation, this study quantifies the trajectory of academia-industry co-evolution through fine-grained entities and semantic space. In the entity measurement part, we extract fine-grained knowledge entities via pre-trained models, measure sequence overlaps using cosine similarity, and analyze topological features through complex network analysis. At the semantic level, we employ unsupervised contrastive learning to quantify convergence in semantic spaces by measuring cross-institutional textual similarities. Finally, we use citation distribution patterns to examine correlations between bidirectional knowledge flows and similarity. Analysis reveals that knowledge proximity between academia and industry rises, particularly following technological change. This provides textual evidence of bidirectional adaptation in co-evolution. Additionally, academia's knowledge dominance weakens during technological paradigm shifts.

TL;DR: Bagpiper is an 8B audio foundation model that processes audio holistically via rich captions, outperforming existing models in understanding and generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio models lack holistic processing, unlike human intelligence. Bagpiper aims to bridge raw audio with abstract cognitive concepts for unified audio understanding and generation.

Method: Pre-trained on 600B tokens, Bagpiper maps raw audio to high-level conceptual space. It uses a caption-then-process workflow for diverse tasks without task-specific priors.

Result: Bagpiper outperforms Qwen-2.5-Omni in audio understanding and CosyVoice3/TangoFlux in generation quality, handling speech, music, and sound effects.

Conclusion: Bagpiper achieves unified audio understanding and generation, pioneering holistic audio processing with available model, data, and code.

Abstract: Current audio foundation models typically rely on rigid, task-specific supervision, addressing isolated factors of audio rather than the whole. In contrast, human intelligence processes audio holistically, seamlessly bridging physical signals with abstract cognitive concepts to execute complex tasks. Grounded in this philosophy, we introduce Bagpiper, an 8B audio foundation model that interprets physical audio via rich captions, i.e., comprehensive natural language descriptions that encapsulate the critical cognitive concepts inherent in the signal (e.g., transcription, audio events). By pre-training on a massive corpus of 600B tokens, the model establishes a robust bidirectional mapping between raw audio and this high-level conceptual space. During fine-tuning, Bagpiper adopts a caption-then-process workflow, simulating an intermediate cognitive reasoning step to solve diverse tasks without task-specific priors. Experimentally, Bagpiper outperforms Qwen-2.5-Omni on MMAU and AIRBench for audio understanding and surpasses CosyVoice3 and TangoFlux in generation quality, capable of synthesizing arbitrary compositions of speech, music, and sound effects. To the best of our knowledge, Bagpiper is among the first works that achieve unified understanding generation for general audio. Model, data, and code are available at Bagpiper Home Page.

TL;DR: FedMosaic is a federated RAG framework that addresses challenges of storage, communication, and aggregation in privacy-aware domains by clustering documents and selectively combining adapters, achieving higher accuracy and lower costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve factuality and reduce hallucinations in LLMs while respecting privacy in domains where knowledge is siloed, avoiding raw document sharing.

Method: Uses parametric RAG with clustered multi-document adapters and selective aggregation to combine only relevant, nonconflicting adapters.

Result: Achieves 10.9% higher accuracy, reduces storage costs by 78.8%-86.3%, and lowers communication costs by 91.4% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FedMosaic effectively balances privacy, efficiency, and accuracy in federated RAG, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding generation in external knowledge to improve factuality and reduce hallucinations. Yet most deployments assume a centralized corpus, which is infeasible in privacy aware domains where knowledge remains siloed. This motivates federated RAG (FedRAG), where a central LLM server collaborates with distributed silos without sharing raw documents. In context RAG violates this requirement by transmitting verbatim documents, whereas parametric RAG encodes documents into lightweight adapters that merge with a frozen LLM at inference, avoiding raw-text exchange. We adopt the parametric approach but face two unique challenges induced by FedRAG: high storage and communication from per-document adapters, and destructive aggregation caused by indiscriminately merging multiple adapters. We present FedMosaic, the first federated RAG framework built on parametric adapters. FedMosaic clusters semantically related documents into multi-document adapters with document-specific masks to reduce overhead while preserving specificity, and performs selective adapter aggregation to combine only relevance-aligned, nonconflicting adapters. Experiments show that FedMosaic achieves an average 10.9% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in four categories, while lowering storage costs by 78.8% to 86.3% and communication costs by 91.4%, and never sharing raw documents.

*Haoran Li,Sucheng Ren,Alan Yuille,Feng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoPE adaptation methods focus on OOD mitigation or Semantic Modeling. CoPE unifies these by soft clipping low-frequency RoPE components, improving performance for long contexts up to 256k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify two distinct approaches (OOD mitigation and Semantic Modeling) for adapting RoPE to longer contexts by introducing a minimalist intervention.

Method: Introduces CoPE: soft clipping low-frequency components of RoPE to eliminate OOD outliers, refine semantic signals, and prevent spectral leakage.

Result: Significant performance gains for long contexts (up to 256k), validating theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: CoPE effectively unifies and improves RoPE adaptation for long-context LLMs, demonstrated by experimental results and theoretical support.

Abstract: Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) is a key component of context scaling in Large Language Models (LLMs). While various methods have been proposed to adapt RoPE to longer contexts, their guiding principles generally fall into two categories: (1) out-of-distribution (OOD) mitigation, which scales RoPE frequencies to accommodate unseen positions, and (2) Semantic Modeling, which posits that the attention scores computed with RoPE should always prioritize semantically similar tokens. In this work, we unify these seemingly distinct objectives through a minimalist intervention, namely CoPE: soft clipping lowfrequency components of RoPE. CoPE not only eliminates OOD outliers and refines semantic signals, but also prevents spectral leakage caused by hard clipping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that simply applying our soft clipping strategy to RoPE yields significant performance gains that scale up to 256k context length, validating our theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as a new state-of-the-art for length generalization.

*Fanfan Liu,Youyang Yin,Peng Shi,Siqi Yang,Zhixiong Zeng,Haibo Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how response length influences reasoning ability in RLVR-trained LLMs/VLMs, proposes a Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO) algorithm to address length bias, and demonstrates superior performance in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain variations in response length changes across RLVR algorithms and improve reasoning performance by addressing length bias.

Method: Theoretical analysis of RLVR components, introduction of LUSPO to eliminate length bias in GSPO, and extensive experimentation on reasoning benchmarks.

Result: LUSPO outperforms existing methods like GRPO and GSPO in mathematical and multimodal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: LUSPO is a state-of-the-art optimization strategy for RLVR-trained models, effectively resolving length bias and enhancing reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent applications of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant success in enhancing reasoning capabilities for complex tasks. During RLVR training, an increase in response length is often regarded as a key factor contributing to the growth of reasoning ability. However, the patterns of change in response length vary significantly across different RLVR algorithms during the training process. To provide a fundamental explanation for these variations, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the components of mainstream RLVR algorithms. We present a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing response length and validate our theory through extensive experimentation. Building upon these theoretical findings, we propose the Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO) algorithm. Specifically, we rectify the length bias inherent in Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), rendering its loss function unbiased with respect to response length and thereby resolving the issue of response length collapse. We conduct extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks and multimodal reasoning scenarios, where LUSPO consistently achieves superior performance. Empirical results demonstrate that LUSPO represents a novel, state-of-the-art optimization strategy compared to existing methods such as GRPO and GSPO.

*Haojin Wang,Yike Wang,Shangbin Feng,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MentorCollab improves SLM performance by selective, sparse guidance from LRMs at inference time, reducing redundancy and cost while enhancing reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high inference costs and redundancy of LRMs and the limitations of SLMs in multi-step reasoning tasks, MentorCollab leverages selective, sparse guidance from LRMs to enhance SLM performance without substantial overhead.

Method: MentorCollab involves probing for divergences between LRM and SLM at random token positions, using a lightweight verifier to decide whether the SLM should follow a short lookahead segment from the LRM or continue independently.

Result: The method improved performance in 12 out of 15 SLM-LRM pairs across three domains, achieving average gains of 3.0% and up to 8.0%, while only 18.4% of tokens were generated by the expensive LRM.

Conclusion: Selective inference-time guidance effectively restores large-model reasoning ability in small models without significant additional cost, demonstrating that short segments and selective probing suffice for successful collaboration.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by producing long chains of thought, but their inference costs are high and often generate redundant reasoning. Small language models (SLMs) are far more efficient, yet struggle on multi-step reasoning tasks. A natural idea is to let a large model guide a small one at inference time as a mentor, yet existing collaboration methods often promote imitation, resulting in verbose reasoning without consistent error correction. We propose MentorCollab, an inference-time collaboration method in which an LRM selectively and sparsely guides an SLM, rather than taking over generation. At randomly sampled token positions, we probe for divergences between the two models and use a lightweight verifier to decide whether the SLM should follow a short lookahead segment from its mentor or continue on its own. Across 15 SLM--LRM pairs and 3 domains (math reasoning, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning), our method improves performance in 12 settings, with average gains of 3.0% and up to 8.0%, while adopting only having 18.4% tokens generated by the expensive mentor model on average. We find that short segments and selective probing are sufficient for effective collaboration. Our results show that selective inference-time guidance restores large-model reasoning ability without substantial inference overhead.

### [126] [How Do Language Models Acquire Character-Level Information?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05347)
*Soma Sato,Ryohei Sasano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models implicitly learn character-level info despite not being explicitly trained on it. Mechanisms involve tokenization-related (merge rules, orthography) and tokenization-independent (semantic associations, syntax) factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LMs acquire character-level knowledge without explicit training.

Method: Comparing LMs trained under controlled settings (specified dataset/tokenizer) vs standard settings.

Result: Merge rules and orthographic constraints are tokenization-related factors; semantic associations and syntactic info are tokenization-independent.

Conclusion: Character-level knowledge in LMs stems from both tokenization-dependent and independent factors.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have been reported to implicitly encode character-level information, despite not being explicitly provided during training. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unexplored. To reveal the mechanisms, we analyze how models acquire character-level knowledge by comparing LMs trained under controlled settings, such as specifying the pre-training dataset or tokenizer, with those trained under standard settings. We categorize the contributing factors into those independent of tokenization. Our analysis reveals that merge rules and orthographic constraints constitute primary factors arising from tokenization, whereas semantic associations of substrings and syntactic information function as key factors independent of tokenization.

*Jun Rao,Zixiong Yu,Xuebo Liu,Guhan Chen,Jing Li,Jiansheng Wei,Xiaojun Meng,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the standard practice of aggressive Best-of-N sampling in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO-R1) for aligning Large Language Models, revealing diminishing returns and policy collapse. It introduces PACE, a corrective exploration strategy, which outperforms DPO-R1 with significantly less compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and risks (e.g., policy collapse, verifier noise amplification) associated with aggressive exploration (high N) in DPO-R1 for mathematical reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduces PACE (Proximal Alignment via Corrective Exploration), which synthesizes high-fidelity preference pairs from failed explorations instead of brute-force mining, operating with minimal compute (2<N<3).

Result: Empirical evaluations show PACE outperforms DPO-R1 (N=16) while using only about 1/5 of the compute, demonstrating superior robustness against reward hacking and label noise.

Conclusion: PACE offers a more efficient and robust alternative to DPO-R1, mitigating the pitfalls of aggressive exploration in alignment tasks.

Abstract: Iterative Direct Preference Optimization has emerged as the state-of-the-art paradigm for aligning Large Language Models on reasoning tasks. Standard implementations (DPO-R1) rely on Best-of-N sampling (e.g., $N \ge 8$) to mine golden trajectories from the distribution tail. In this paper, we challenge this scaling hypothesis and reveal a counter-intuitive phenomenon: in mathematical reasoning, aggressive exploration yields diminishing returns and even catastrophic policy collapse. We theoretically demonstrate that scaling $N$ amplifies verifier noise and induces detrimental distribution shifts. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{PACE} (Proximal Alignment via Corrective Exploration), which replaces brute-force mining with a generation-based corrective strategy. Operating with a minimal budget ($2<N<3$), PACE synthesizes high-fidelity preference pairs from failed explorations. Empirical evaluations show that PACE outperforms DPO-R1 $(N=16)$ while using only about $1/5$ of the compute, demonstrating superior robustness against reward hacking and label noise.

TL;DR: LLMs show performance gaps in non-English medical tasks, especially in Arabic, due to tokenization issues and unreliable confidence metrics, calling for language-aware design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are English-centric, limiting their effectiveness in linguistically diverse medical applications. The causes of performance gaps in low-resource languages are unclear.

Method: Cross-lingual empirical analysis of LLM performance on Arabic and English medical question answering, including tokenization and reliability analysis.

Result: Persistent language-driven performance gaps, structural fragmentation in Arabic text, and limited correlation between model confidence and correctness.

Conclusion: Language-aware design and evaluation strategies are needed to improve LLM performance in non-English medical tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used in medical applications, such as clinical decision support, medical education, and medical question answering. Yet, these models are often English-centric, limiting their robustness and reliability for linguistically diverse communities. Recent work has highlighted discrepancies in performance in low-resource languages for various medical tasks, but the underlying causes remain poorly understood. In this study, we conduct a cross-lingual empirical analysis of LLM performance on Arabic and English medical question and answering. Our findings reveal a persistent language-driven performance gap that intensifies with increasing task complexity. Tokenization analysis exposes structural fragmentation in Arabic medical text, while reliability analysis suggests that model-reported confidence and explanations exhibit limited correlation with correctness. Together, these findings underscore the need for language-aware design and evaluation strategies in LLMs for medical tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IESR, a lightweight framework for Text-to-SQL tasks, addressing challenges in complex reasoning and domain knowledge while improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL methods struggle with complex reasoning, domain knowledge, and deployment costs, motivating the need for a lightweight solution.

Method: IESR leverages LLMs for understanding and schema linking, uses MCTS-based reasoning with majority voting, and includes a consistency verification module.

Result: IESR achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks LogicCat and Archer without fine-tuning, using compact models.

Conclusion: The framework highlights biases in current models and suggests future research directions while providing an efficient solution.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a key natural language processing task that maps natural language questions to SQL queries, enabling intuitive interaction with web-based databases. Although current methods perform well on benchmarks like BIRD and Spider, they struggle with complex reasoning, domain knowledge, and hypothetical queries, and remain costly in enterprise deployment. To address these issues, we propose a framework named IESR(Information Enhanced Structured Reasoning) for lightweight large language models: (i) leverages LLMs for key information understanding and schema linking, and decoupling mathematical computation and SQL generation, (ii) integrates a multi-path reasoning mechanism based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with majority voting, and (iii) introduces a trajectory consistency verification module with a discriminator model to ensure accuracy and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that IESR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the complex reasoning benchmark LogicCat (24.28 EX) and the Archer dataset (37.28 EX) using only compact lightweight models without fine-tuning. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that current coder models exhibit notable biases and deficiencies in physical knowledge, mathematical computation, and common-sense reasoning, highlighting important directions for future research.

*Jiyun Chun,Eric Fosler-Lussier,Michael White,Andrew Perrault*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introducing a novel LLM-based framework to evaluate children's utterance quality in dialogues, focusing on Expansion and Independence, outperforming traditional metrics like MLU and readability indices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics for assessing children's utterance quality lack context sensitivity, missing key aspects like reasoning depth and discourse planning, necessitating a more nuanced approach.

Method: An LLM-as-a-judge framework classifies adult utterance types and scores child responses along Expansion (elaboration and inferential depth) and Independence (contribution to discourse) axes.

Result: The framework shows developmental validity, improves age estimation, detects discourse-related differences, and aligns with human judgments, enabling scalable evaluation.

Conclusion: The study shifts child utterance assessment from length-based metrics to context-sensitive evaluation, highlighting meaningful conversational contributions.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of children's utterances in adult-child dialogue remains challenging due to insufficient context-sensitive metrics. Common proxies such as Mean Length of Utterance (MLU), lexical diversity (vocd-D), and readability indices (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index) are dominated by length and ignore conversational context, missing aspects of response quality such as reasoning depth, topic maintenance, and discourse planning. We introduce an LLM-as-a-judge framework that first classifies the Previous Adult Utterance Type and then scores the child's response along two axes: Expansion (contextual elaboration and inferential depth) and Independence (the child's contribution to advancing the discourse). These axes reflect fundamental dimensions in child language development, where Expansion captures elaboration, clause combining, and causal and contrastive connectives. Independence captures initiative, topic control, decreasing reliance on adult scaffolding through growing self-regulation, and audience design. We establish developmental validity by showing age-related patterns and demonstrate predictive value by improving age estimation over common baselines. We further confirm semantic sensitivity by detecting differences tied to discourse relations. Our metrics align with human judgments, enabling large-scale evaluation. This shifts child utterance assessment from simply measuring length to evaluating how meaningfully the child's speech contributes to and advances the conversation within its context.

*Ji Zhao,Yufei Gu,Shitong Shao,Xun Zhou,Liang Xiang,Zeke Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Late-to-Early Training (LET) paradigm to accelerate the training of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging knowledge from smaller pretrained models, achieving faster convergence and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretraining LLMs is computationally expensive, and the paper addresses the underexplored question of using smaller pretrained models to speed up the training of larger ones.

Method: The LET paradigm guides early layers of an LLM during early training using representations from late layers of a pretrained model, employing late-to-early-step and late-to-early-layer learning mechanisms.

Result: Experiments on 1.4B and 7B parameter models show LET achieves up to 1.6× speedup and nearly 5% better downstream task accuracy compared to standard training, even with a significantly smaller pretrained model.

Conclusion: LET is an effective and efficient method for accelerating LLM training while enhancing performance, demonstrating practical benefits for scaling up language models.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable empirical success through scaling model and data size, pretraining has become increasingly critical yet computationally prohibitive, hindering rapid development. Despite the availability of numerous pretrained LLMs developed at significant computational expense, a fundamental real-world question remains underexplored: \textit{Can we leverage existing small pretrained models to accelerate the training of larger models?} In this paper, we propose a Late-to-Early Training (LET) paradigm that enables LLMs to explicitly learn later knowledge in earlier steps and earlier layers. The core idea is to guide the early layers of an LLM during early training using representations from the late layers of a pretrained (i.e. late training phase) model. We identify two key mechanisms that drive LET's effectiveness: late-to-early-step learning and late-to-early-layer learning. These mechanisms significantly accelerate training convergence while robustly enhancing both language modeling capabilities and downstream task performance, enabling faster training with superior performance. Extensive experiments on 1.4B and 7B parameter models demonstrate LET's efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, when training a 1.4B LLM on the Pile dataset, our method achieves up to 1.6$\times$ speedup with nearly 5\% improvement in downstream task accuracy compared to standard training, even when using a pretrained model with 10$\times$ fewer parameters than the target model.

TL;DR: OPUS is a dynamic data selection framework that improves pre-training efficiency by scoring tokens based on optimizer-induced updates, achieving superior results with fewer tokens across diverse datasets and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Data Wall phenomenon limits high-quality public text availability, shifting focus from quantity to quality of tokens for pre-training. Existing methods lack dynamic, optimizer-aware criteria.

Method: OPUS defines utility in the optimizer-induced update space, using Ghost technique with CountSketch for scalability and Boltzmann sampling for diversity, adding minimal compute overhead.

Result: OPUS outperforms baselines in GPT-2 pre-training and achieves superior performance with fewer tokens in Qwen3-8B-Base continued pre-training, demonstrating significant efficiency gains.

Conclusion: OPUS effectively addresses the Data Wall challenge by dynamically selecting high-utility tokens, enhancing pre-training efficiency and performance across various domains and scales.

Abstract: As high-quality public text approaches exhaustion, a phenomenon known as the Data Wall, pre-training is shifting from more tokens to better tokens. However, existing methods either rely on heuristic static filters that ignore training dynamics, or use dynamic yet optimizer-agnostic criteria based on raw gradients. We propose OPUS (Optimizer-induced Projected Utility Selection), a dynamic data selection framework that defines utility in the optimizer-induced update space. OPUS scores candidates by projecting their effective updates, shaped by modern optimizers, onto a target direction derived from a stable, in-distribution proxy. To ensure scalability, we employ Ghost technique with CountSketch for computational efficiency, and Boltzmann sampling for data diversity, incurring only 4.7\% additional compute overhead. OPUS achieves remarkable results across diverse corpora, quality tiers, optimizers, and model scales. In pre-training of GPT-2 Large/XL on FineWeb and FineWeb-Edu with 30B tokens, OPUS outperforms industrial-level baselines and even full 200B-token training. Moreover, when combined with industrial-level static filters, OPUS further improves pre-training efficiency, even with lower-quality data. Furthermore, in continued pre-training of Qwen3-8B-Base on SciencePedia, OPUS achieves superior performance using only 0.5B tokens compared to full training with 3B tokens, demonstrating significant data efficiency gains in specialized domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new metric, UOT-ERRANT, for evaluating grammatical error correction (GEC) systems by measuring similarity over edits using unbalanced optimal transport, improving performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reference-based metrics like BERTScore are ineffective for GEC because many words remain unchanged. The study aims to improve evaluation by focusing on edits specifically designed for GEC.

Method: Proposes 'edit vectors' to represent edits and introduces UOT-ERRANT, a metric using unbalanced optimal transport to measure similarity between edits in hypothesis and reference sentences.

Result: Experiments show UOT-ERRANT improves evaluation performance, especially in the +Fluency domain. The method is also interpretable due to its soft edit alignment.

Conclusion: UOT-ERRANT is a useful metric for ranking and analyzing GEC systems, offering better performance and interpretability compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation in grammatical error correction (GEC) is crucial for selecting the best-performing systems. Currently, reference-based metrics are a popular choice, which basically measure the similarity between hypothesis and reference sentences. However, similarity measures based on embeddings, such as BERTScore, are often ineffective, since many words in the source sentences remain unchanged in both the hypothesis and the reference. This study focuses on edits specifically designed for GEC, i.e., ERRANT, and computes similarity measured over the edits from the source sentence. To this end, we propose edit vector, a representation for an edit, and introduce a new metric, UOT-ERRANT, which transports these edit vectors from hypothesis to reference using unbalanced optimal transport. Experiments with SEEDA meta-evaluation show that UOT-ERRANT improves evaluation performance, particularly in the +Fluency domain where many edits occur. Moreover, our method is highly interpretable because the transport plan can be interpreted as a soft edit alignment, making UOT-ERRANT a useful metric for both system ranking and analyzing GEC systems. Our code is available from https://github.com/gotutiyan/uot-errant.

TL;DR: M2CQA introduces a culturally grounded benchmark for testing vision-language models' hallucination tendencies in non-Western contexts, revealing higher counterfactual acceptance in Arabic and dialects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination benchmarks lack diversity, especially outside Western contexts and English, prompting the need for a culturally inclusive evaluation tool.

Method: Created M2CQA, a multimodal benchmark with images from 17 MENA countries and contrastive statements in English, Arabic, and dialects. Proposed CounterFactual Hallucination Rate (CFHR) to measure hallucination beyond raw accuracy.

Result: VLMs showed higher CFHR in Arabic, especially dialects, despite high true-statement accuracy. Reasoning-first prompting increased hallucination, while answering before justifying improved robustness.

Conclusion: The study highlights cultural biases in VLMs and introduces M2CQA as a resource for future research.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) can achieve high accuracy while still accepting culturally plausible but visually incorrect interpretations. Existing hallucination benchmarks rarely test this failure mode, particularly outside Western contexts and English. We introduce M2CQA, a culturally grounded multimodal benchmark built from images spanning 17 MENA countries, paired with contrastive true and counterfactual statements in English, Arabic, and its dialects. To isolate hallucination beyond raw accuracy, we propose the CounterFactual Hallucination Rate (CFHR), which measures counterfactual acceptance conditioned on correctly answering the true statement. Evaluating state-of-the-art VLMs under multiple prompting strategies, we find that CFHR rises sharply in Arabic, especially in dialects, even when true-statement accuracy remains high. Moreover, reasoning-first prompting consistently increases counterfactual hallucination, while answering before justifying improves robustness. We will make the experimental resources and dataset publicly available for the community.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CFA², a causal front-door adjustment attack framework to jailbreak LLMs by severing confounding associations, achieving high success rates with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety mechanisms in LLMs obscure their capabilities, prompting a need to expose these mechanisms for better understanding and manipulation.

Method: The authors model safety mechanisms as unobserved confounders and use Pearl's Front-Door Criterion with Sparse Autoencoders to isolate core task intent.

Result: CFA² achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates with mechanistic insights into jailbreaking.

Conclusion: The framework effectively jailbreaks LLMs while providing interpretability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Safety alignment mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) often operate as latent internal states, obscuring the model's inherent capabilities. Building on this observation, we model the safety mechanism as an unobserved confounder from a causal perspective. Then, we propose the \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{F}ront-Door \textbf{A}djustment \textbf{A}ttack ({\textbf{CFA}}$^2$) to jailbreak LLM, which is a framework that leverages Pearl's Front-Door Criterion to sever the confounding associations for robust jailbreaking. Specifically, we employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to physically strip defense-related features, isolating the core task intent. We further reduce computationally expensive marginalization to a deterministic intervention with low inference complexity. Experiments demonstrate that {CFA}$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates while offering a mechanistic interpretation of the jailbreaking process.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an uncertainty-aware framework for multilingual multi-label emotion classification, addressing challenges like emotional ambiguity and incomplete supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume fully observed labels and deterministic objectives, leading to biased learning under partial supervision. The paper aims to improve robustness and reliability.

Method: Proposes 'Reasoning under Ambiguity' with a shared multilingual encoder, entropy-based ambiguity weighting, and mask-aware objective with positive-unlabeled regularization.

Result: Demonstrates consistent improvements on English, Spanish, and Arabic benchmarks, with better stability, robustness, and interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles ambiguity and incomplete supervision, outperforming baselines and enhancing emotion classification.

Abstract: Contemporary knowledge-based systems increasingly rely on multilingual emotion identification to support intelligent decision-making, yet they face major challenges due to emotional ambiguity and incomplete supervision. Emotion recognition from text is inherently uncertain because multiple emotional states often co-occur and emotion annotations are frequently missing or heterogeneous. Most existing multi-label emotion classification methods assume fully observed labels and rely on deterministic learning objectives, which can lead to biased learning and unreliable predictions under partial supervision. This paper introduces Reasoning under Ambiguity, an uncertainty-aware framework for multilingual multi-label emotion classification that explicitly aligns learning with annotation uncertainty. The proposed approach uses a shared multilingual encoder with language-specific optimization and an entropy-based ambiguity weighting mechanism that down-weights highly ambiguous training instances rather than treating missing labels as negative evidence. A mask-aware objective with positive-unlabeled regularization is further incorporated to enable robust learning under partial supervision. Experiments on English, Spanish, and Arabic emotion classification benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, along with improved training stability, robustness to annotation sparsity, and enhanced interpretability.

Method: A framework based on optimal transport aligns activations to infer cross-neuron correspondences, enabling weight-space fusion for heterogeneous models.

Result: Experiments in low-resource languages and specialized domains show consistent improvements over target models.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively transfers knowledge from large to small, heterogeneous models, enhancing performance in low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong capabilities by scaling model capacity and training data, yet many real-world deployments rely on smaller models trained or adapted from low-resource data. This gap motivates the need for mechanisms to transfer knowledge from large, high-resource models to smaller, low-resource targets. While model merging provides an effective transfer mechanism, most existing approaches assume architecture-compatible models and therefore cannot directly transfer knowledge from large high-resource LLMs to heterogeneous low-resource targets. In this work, we propose a cross-architecture merging framework based on optimal transport (OT) that aligns activations to infer cross-neuron correspondences between heterogeneous models. The resulting transport plans are then used to guide direct weight-space fusion, enabling effective high-resource to low-resource transfer using only a small set of inputs. Extensive experiments across low-resource languages and specialized domains demonstrate consistent improvements over target models.

*Larissa Pusch,Alexandre Courtiol,Tim Conrad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework integrates LLMs with KGs using natural language interactions to improve accessibility and accuracy, evaluated across synthetic and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of LLMs in knowledge-intensive tasks (hallucinations, outdated info) and text-based RAG's struggles with multi-hop reasoning by leveraging KGs' precision and explainability.

Method: Interactive framework where LLMs generate and explain Cypher queries, refined by users via natural language, tested on synthetic and real-world KGs.

Result: Improved accessibility to complex datasets, preserved factual accuracy, and insights into domain-specific LLM performance through quantitative benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges LLMs and KGs, enhancing accessibility and rigor while providing measurable performance insights.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but remain limited in knowledge-intensive domains due to hallucinations, outdated information, and limited explainability. Text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) helps ground model outputs in external sources but struggles with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), in contrast, support precise, explainable querying, yet require a knowledge of query languages. This work introduces an interactive framework in which LLMs generate and explain Cypher graph queries and users iteratively refine them through natural language. Applied to real-world KGs, the framework improves accessibility to complex datasets while preserving factual accuracy and semantic rigor and provides insight into how model performance varies across domains. Our core quantitative evaluation is a 90-query benchmark on a synthetic movie KG that measures query explanation quality and fault detection across multiple LLMs, complemented by two smaller real-life query-generation experiments on a Hyena KG and the MaRDI (Mathematical Research Data Initiative) KG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MT-GRPO improves multi-task RL-based post-training for LLMs by dynamically adapting task weights and introducing a ratio-preserving sampler, achieving better worst-task performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployment of LLMs requires reliable performance across diverse tasks, but standard GRPO often leads to imbalanced outcomes and distorted optimization signals.

Method: Proposed MT-GRPO dynamically adapts task weights to optimize worst-task performance and uses a ratio-preserving sampler to reflect adapted weights in gradients.

Result: MT-GRPO outperforms baselines, achieving 16-28% and 6% improvements over GRPO and DAPO in worst-task accuracy, with 50% fewer training steps.

Conclusion: MT-GRPO effectively balances task progress and improves efficiency, making it a robust solution for multi-task RL-based post-training.

Abstract: RL-based post-training with GRPO is widely used to improve large language models on individual reasoning tasks. However, real-world deployment requires reliable performance across diverse tasks. A straightforward multi-task adaptation of GRPO often leads to imbalanced outcomes, with some tasks dominating optimization while others stagnate. Moreover, tasks can vary widely in how frequently prompts yield zero advantages (and thus zero gradients), which further distorts their effective contribution to the optimization signal. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Task GRPO (MT-GRPO) algorithm that (i) dynamically adapts task weights to explicitly optimize worst-task performance and promote balanced progress across tasks, and (ii) introduces a ratio-preserving sampler to ensure task-wise policy gradients reflect the adapted weights. Experiments on both 3-task and 9-task settings show that MT-GRPO consistently outperforms baselines in worst-task accuracy. In particular, MT-GRPO achieves 16-28% and 6% absolute improvement on worst-task performance over standard GRPO and DAPO, respectively, while maintaining competitive average accuracy. Moreover, MT-GRPO requires 50% fewer training steps to reach 50% worst-task accuracy in the 3-task setting, demonstrating substantially improved efficiency in achieving reliable performance across tasks.

*Rui Jia,Ruiyi Lan,Fengrui Liu,Zhongxiang Dai,Bo Jiang,Jing Shao,Jingyuan Chen,Guandong Xu,Fei Wu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CASTLE, a benchmark for evaluating personalized safety in LLMs for education, addressing gaps in current safety metrics.



<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety evaluations lack consideration for student heterogeneity, risking harm to vulnerable groups.


Method: CASTLE is developed with 15 safety risks and 14 student attributes (92,908 scenarios). Metrics include Risk Sensitivity, Emotional Empathy, and Student Alignment.


Result: Tests on 18 LLMs show average safety ratings below 2.3/5, highlighting deficiencies in personalized safety.


Conclusion: CASTLE effectively identifies LLM shortcomings in personalized safety, urging improvements for educational applications.


Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the development of personalized learning in education. However, their inherent generation mechanisms often produce homogeneous responses to identical prompts. This one-size-fits-all mechanism overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in students cognitive and psychological, thereby posing potential safety risks to vulnerable groups. Existing safety evaluations primarily rely on context-independent metrics such as factual accuracy, bias, or toxicity, which fail to capture the divergent harms that the same response might cause across different student attributes. To address this gap, we propose the concept of Student-Tailored Personalized Safety and construct CASTLE based on educational theories. This benchmark covers 15 educational safety risks and 14 student attributes, comprising 92,908 bilingual scenarios. We further design three evaluation metrics: Risk Sensitivity, measuring the model ability to detect risks; Emotional Empathy, evaluating the model capacity to recognize student states; and Student Alignment, assessing the match between model responses and student attributes. Experiments on 18 SOTA LLMs demonstrate that CASTLE poses a significant challenge: all models scored below an average safety rating of 2.3 out of 5, indicating substantial deficiencies in personalized safety assurance.

*Giuseppe Samo,Paola Merlo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer models' ability to represent complex verb paradigms in Turkish and Hebrew depends on tokenization strategies, with Turkish benefiting from atomic or subword tokenization and Hebrew requiring morpheme-aware approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how transformer models handle morphological complexities in Turkish and Hebrew, focusing on the impact of tokenization strategies.

Method: The research uses the Blackbird Language Matrices task on natural data, testing monolingual and multilingual models with varying tokenization methods (atomic, subword, character-level, morpheme-aware).

Result: Turkish models perform well with atomic or subword tokenization, while Hebrew models require morpheme-aware segmentation for better performance. Synthetic datasets improve results across all models.

Conclusion: Tokenization strategies critically influence model performance on morphologically complex languages, with tailored approaches needed for languages like Hebrew.

Abstract: We investigate how transformer models represent complex verb paradigms in Turkish and Modern Hebrew, concentrating on how tokenization strategies shape this ability. Using the Blackbird Language Matrices task on natural data, we show that for Turkish -- with its transparent morphological markers -- both monolingual and multilingual models succeed, either when tokenization is atomic or when it breaks words into small subword units. For Hebrew, instead, monolingual and multilingual models diverge. A multilingual model using character-level tokenization fails to capture the language non-concatenative morphology, but a monolingual model with morpheme-aware segmentation performs well. Performance improves on more synthetic datasets, in all models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare necessitates comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate their accuracy in clinical text, addressing risks like misdiagnosis or incorrect treatments. Limited multilingual datasets prompted the creation of MedErrBench.

Method: MedErrBench was developed with clinician input, featuring ten common error types in clinical text. It includes annotated natural clinical cases in English, Arabic, and Chinese. Various language models were tested for error detection, localization, and correction.

Result: Evaluations showed significant performance gaps, particularly in non-English settings, underscoring the need for language-aware and clinically grounded systems.

Conclusion: MedErrBench aims to enhance multilingual clinical NLP globally by providing a publicly available benchmark and protocols, promoting safer AI-based healthcare.

Abstract: Inaccuracies in existing or generated clinical text may lead to serious adverse consequences, especially if it is a misdiagnosis or incorrect treatment suggestion. With Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly being used across diverse healthcare applications, comprehensive evaluation through dedicated benchmarks is crucial. However, such datasets remain scarce, especially across diverse languages and contexts. In this paper, we introduce MedErrBench, the first multilingual benchmark for error detection, localization, and correction, developed under the guidance of experienced clinicians. Based on an expanded taxonomy of ten common error types, MedErrBench covers English, Arabic and Chinese, with natural clinical cases annotated and reviewed by domain experts. We assessed the performance of a range of general-purpose, language-specific, and medical-domain language models across all three tasks. Our results reveal notable performance gaps, particularly in non-English settings, highlighting the need for clinically grounded, language-aware systems. By making MedErrBench and our evaluation protocols publicly-available, we aim to advance multilingual clinical NLP to promote safer and more equitable AI-based healthcare globally.

*Shuting Jiang,Ran Song,Yuxin Huang,Yan Xiang,Yantuan Xian,Shengxiang Gao,Zhengtao Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a neuron-efficient fine-tuning framework for multi-domain machine translation (MDMT) that identifies consensus-aligned neurons in LLMs, improving performance on seen and unseen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain adaptation remains a challenge for LLMs in MDMT, with existing methods suffering from issues like domain shift and parameter interference.

Method: Identifies and updates consensus-aligned neurons by maximizing mutual information between neuron behavior and domain features, then fine-tunes LLMs accordingly.

Result: Outperforms strong PEFT baselines across ten translation domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates parameter interference and domain-specific overfitting, enhancing MDMT capabilities.

Abstract: Multi-domain machine translation (MDMT) aims to build a unified model capable of translating content across diverse domains. Despite the impressive machine translation capabilities demonstrated by large language models (LLMs), domain adaptation still remains a challenge for LLMs. Existing MDMT methods such as in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning often suffer from domain shift, parameter interference and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a neuron-efficient fine-tuning framework for MDMT that identifies and updates consensus-aligned neurons within LLMs. These neurons are selected by maximizing the mutual information between neuron behavior and domain features, enabling LLMs to capture both generalizable translation patterns and domain-specific nuances. Our method then fine-tunes LLMs guided by these neurons, effectively mitigating parameter interference and domain-specific overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on three LLMs across ten German-English and Chinese-English translation domains evidence that our method consistently outperforms strong PEFT baselines on both seen and unseen domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OmniMoE is a co-designed framework that uses atomic-level experts for fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts, achieving better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between expert granularity and hardware efficiency in MoE architectures.

Method: Introduces vector-level Atomic Experts, a Cartesian Product Router, and Expert-Centric Scheduling for efficient routing and execution.

Result: Achieves 50.9% zero-shot accuracy and reduces inference latency from 73ms to 6.7ms compared to PEER.

Conclusion: OmniMoE demonstrates that fine-grained MoE can be both fast and accurate, outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are evolving towards finer granularity to improve parameter efficiency. However, existing MoE designs face an inherent trade-off between the granularity of expert specialization and hardware execution efficiency. We propose OmniMoE, a system-algorithm co-designed framework that pushes expert granularity to its logical extreme. OmniMoE introduces vector-level Atomic Experts, enabling scalable routing and execution within a single MoE layer, while retaining a shared dense MLP branch for general-purpose processing. Although this atomic design maximizes capacity, it poses severe challenges for routing complexity and memory access. To address these, OmniMoE adopts a system-algorithm co-design: (i) a Cartesian Product Router that decomposes the massive index space to reduce routing complexity from O(N) to O(sqrt(N)); and (ii) Expert-Centric Scheduling that inverts the execution order to turn scattered, memory-bound lookups into efficient dense matrix operations. Validated on seven benchmarks, OmniMoE (with 1.7B active parameters) achieves 50.9% zero-shot accuracy across seven benchmarks, outperforming coarse-grained (e.g., DeepSeekMoE) and fine-grained (e.g., PEER) baselines. Crucially, OmniMoE reduces inference latency from 73ms to 6.7ms (a 10.9-fold speedup) compared to PEER, demonstrating that massive-scale fine-grained MoE can be fast and accurate.

*Hao Yang,Zhiyu Yang,Xupeng Zhang,Wei Wei,Yunjie Zhang,Lin Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CompactRAG is a cost-efficient framework for multi-hop question answering that reduces LLM calls and token usage by decoupling offline corpus restructuring from online reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-hop RAG systems are inefficient due to repeated LLM calls and unstable entity grounding. CompactRAG aims to address these issues.

Method: Offline, an LLM converts the corpus into atomic QA pairs. Online, queries are decomposed and resolved with dense retrieval and RoBERTa-based extraction.

Result: CompactRAG achieves competitive accuracy on benchmarks while significantly reducing token consumption compared to iterative RAG baselines.

Conclusion: CompactRAG offers a practical and cost-efficient solution for multi-hop reasoning over large knowledge corpora.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a key paradigm for knowledge-intensive question answering. However, existing multi-hop RAG systems remain inefficient, as they alternate between retrieval and reasoning at each step, resulting in repeated LLM calls, high token consumption, and unstable entity grounding across hops. We propose CompactRAG, a simple yet effective framework that decouples offline corpus restructuring from online reasoning.
  In the offline stage, an LLM reads the corpus once and converts it into an atomic QA knowledge base, which represents knowledge as minimal, fine-grained question-answer pairs. In the online stage, complex queries are decomposed and carefully rewritten to preserve entity consistency, and are resolved through dense retrieval followed by RoBERTa-based answer extraction. Notably, during inference, the LLM is invoked only twice in total - once for sub-question decomposition and once for final answer synthesis - regardless of the number of reasoning hops.
  Experiments on HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MuSiQue demonstrate that CompactRAG achieves competitive accuracy while substantially reducing token consumption compared to iterative RAG baselines, highlighting a cost-efficient and practical approach to multi-hop reasoning over large knowledge corpora. The implementation is available at GitHub.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongR improves long-context reasoning in LLMs by integrating 'Think-and-Read' with contextual density rewards, achieving 9% gains on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for long-context reasoning rely on sparse rewards, which are insufficient for effective guidance. LongR addresses this gap.

Method: LongR combines a dynamic 'Think-and-Read' mechanism with contextual density rewards based on relative information gain.

Result: LongR achieves a 9% performance gain on LongBench v2 and consistent improvements on RULER and InfiniteBench.

Conclusion: LongR enhances long-context reasoning efficiency and robustness across diverse RL algorithms, validated by benchmark results.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a key driver for LLM reasoning. This capability is equally pivotal in long-context scenarios--such as long-dialogue understanding and structured data analysis, where the challenge extends beyond consuming tokens to performing rigorous deduction. While existing efforts focus on data synthesis or architectural changes, recent work points out that relying solely on sparse, outcome-only rewards yields limited gains, as such coarse signals are often insufficient to effectively guide the complex long-context reasoning. To address this, we propose LongR, a unified framework that enhances long-context performance by integrating a dynamic "Think-and-Read" mechanism, which interleaves reasoning with document consultation, with a contextual density reward based on relative information gain to quantify the utility of the relevant documents. Empirically, LongR achieves a 9% gain on LongBench v2 and consistent improvements on RULER and InfiniteBench, demonstrating robust efficiency in navigating extensive contexts. Furthermore, LongR consistently enhances performance across diverse RL algorithms (e.g., DAPO, GSPO). Finally, we conduct in-depth analyses to investigate the impact of reasoning chain length on efficiency and the model's robustness against distractors.

TL;DR: The abstract examines the effectiveness and bias of LLM-based text detectors, particularly for non-native Czech speakers, finding no systematic bias and that modern detectors work well without perplexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about misuse of LLM-generated text in academia and the potential bias of detectors against non-native speakers prompted this study.

Method: The study evaluates perplexity differences between native and non-native Czech speakers and tests detectors from three families.

Result: No lower perplexity in non-native Czech texts and no systematic bias in detectors were found. Contemporary detectors perform effectively without perplexity.

Conclusion: Modern text detectors are effective and unbiased against non-native speakers, even without relying on perplexity.

Abstract: LLM-based assistants have been widely popularised after the release of ChatGPT. Concerns have been raised about their misuse in academia, given the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and generated text. To combat this, automated techniques have been developed and shown to be effective, to some extent. However, prior work suggests that these methods often falsely flag essays from non-native speakers as generated, due to their low perplexity extracted from an LLM, which is supposedly a key feature of the detectors. We revisit these statements two years later, specifically in the Czech language setting. We show that the perplexity of texts from non-native speakers of Czech is not lower than that of native speakers. We further examine detectors from three separate families and find no systematic bias against non-native speakers. Finally, we demonstrate that contemporary detectors operate effectively without relying on perplexity.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in language-centric tasks. However, in agentic settings, LLMs often struggle to anticipate action consequences and adapt to environment dynamics, highlighting the need for world-modeling capabilities in LLM-based agents. We propose Reinforcement World Model Learning (RWML), a self-supervised method that learns action-conditioned world models for LLM-based agents on textual states using sim-to-real gap rewards. Our method aligns simulated next states produced by the model with realized next states observed from the environment, encouraging consistency between internal world simulations and actual environment dynamics in a pre-trained embedding space. Unlike next-state token prediction, which prioritizes token-level fidelity (i.e., reproducing exact wording) over semantic equivalence and can lead to model collapse, our method provides a more robust training signal and is empirically less susceptible to reward hacking than LLM-as-a-judge. We evaluate our method on ALFWorld and $τ^2$ Bench and observe significant gains over the base model, despite being entirely self-supervised. When combined with task-success rewards, our method outperforms direct task-success reward RL by 6.9 and 5.7 points on ALFWorld and $τ^2$ Bench respectively, while matching the performance of expert-data training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OdysseyArena introduces a new evaluation paradigm for LLM-based agents, focusing on inductive learning and long-horizon interactions, revealing deficiencies in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations lack inductive learning and long-horizon interactions, hindering agent autonomy.

Method: Developed OdysseyArena with primitives translating dynamics into environments, plus benchmarking (OdysseyArena-Lite) and stress-testing (OdysseyArena-Challenge) tools.

Result: Tests on 15+ LLMs show frontier models struggle with inductive scenarios.

Conclusion: Inductive learning remains a bottleneck for autonomous agents in complex environments.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of autonomous agents capable of navigating complex environments. However, existing evaluations primarily adopt a deductive paradigm, where agents execute tasks based on explicitly provided rules and static goals, often within limited planning horizons. Crucially, this neglects the inductive necessity for agents to discover latent transition laws from experience autonomously, which is the cornerstone for enabling agentic foresight and sustaining strategic coherence. To bridge this gap, we introduce OdysseyArena, which re-centers agent evaluation on long-horizon, active, and inductive interactions. We formalize and instantiate four primitives, translating abstract transition dynamics into concrete interactive environments. Building upon this, we establish OdysseyArena-Lite for standardized benchmarking, providing a set of 120 tasks to measure an agent's inductive efficiency and long-horizon discovery. Pushing further, we introduce OdysseyArena-Challenge to stress-test agent stability across extreme interaction horizons (e.g., > 200 steps). Extensive experiments on 15+ leading LLMs reveal that even frontier models exhibit a deficiency in inductive scenarios, identifying a critical bottleneck in the pursuit of autonomous discovery in complex environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RRAttention introduces a dynamic sparse attention method using round-robin sampling to reduce complexity and maintain performance, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms limits large language models processing long contexts. Existing dynamic sparse attention methods compromise on efficiency, preprocessing, or query independence.

Method: RRAttention employs a head round-robin sampling strategy, rotating query positions across attention heads per stride to ensure query independence and global pattern discovery. It reduces complexity via stride-level aggregation and adaptive Top-τ selection.

Result: Experiments show RRAttention recovers over 99% of full attention performance with half the computation, achieving a 2.4× speedup at 128K context length and surpassing other methods.

Conclusion: RRAttention effectively addresses trade-offs in dynamic sparse attention, offering significant efficiency gains without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms poses a critical bottleneck for large language models processing long contexts. While dynamic sparse attention methods offer input-adaptive efficiency, they face fundamental trade-offs: requiring preprocessing, lacking global evaluation, violating query independence, or incurring high computational overhead. We present RRAttention, a novel dynamic sparse attention method that simultaneously achieves all desirable properties through a head \underline{r}ound-\underline{r}obin (RR) sampling strategy. By rotating query sampling positions across attention heads within each stride, RRAttention maintains query independence while enabling efficient global pattern discovery with stride-level aggregation. Our method reduces complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L^2/S^2)$ and employs adaptive Top-$τ$ selection for optimal sparsity. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding (HELMET) and multimodal video comprehension (Video-MME) demonstrate that RRAttention recovers over 99\% of full attention performance while computing only half of the attention blocks, achieving 2.4$\times$ speedup at 128K context length and outperforming existing dynamic sparse attention methods.

TL;DR: xList-Hate decomposes hate speech detection into concept-level questions answered by LLMs, aggregated via a decision tree for robust, interpretable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech detection's binary classification approach overfits dataset-specific definitions and lacks robustness under domain shift.

Method: Introduces xList-Hate, a checklist-based framework where LLMs answer normative questions; signals are aggregated by an interpretable decision tree.

Result: Outperforms zero-shot LLM classification and supervised fine-tuning in cross-dataset robustness and handles annotation noise better.

Conclusion: Diagnostic reasoning offers a more robust, explainable, and extensible alternative to monolithic hate speech detection.

Abstract: Hate speech detection is commonly framed as a direct binary classification problem despite being a composite concept defined through multiple interacting factors that vary across legal frameworks, platform policies, and annotation guidelines. As a result, supervised models often overfit dataset-specific definitions and exhibit limited robustness under domain shift and annotation noise.
  We introduce xList-Hate, a diagnostic framework that decomposes hate speech detection into a checklist of explicit, concept-level questions grounded in widely shared normative criteria. Each question is independently answered by a large language model (LLM), producing a binary diagnostic representation that captures hateful content features without directly predicting the final label. These diagnostic signals are then aggregated by a lightweight, fully interpretable decision tree, yielding transparent and auditable predictions.
  We evaluate it across multiple hate speech benchmarks and model families, comparing it against zero-shot LLM classification and in-domain supervised fine-tuning. While supervised methods typically maximize in-domain performance, we consistently improves cross-dataset robustness and relative performance under domain shift. In addition, qualitative analysis of disagreement cases provides evidence that the framework can be less sensitive to certain forms of annotation inconsistency and contextual ambiguity. Crucially, the approach enables fine-grained interpretability through explicit decision paths and factor-level analysis.
  Our results suggest that reframing hate speech detection as a diagnostic reasoning task, rather than a monolithic classification problem, provides a robust, explainable, and extensible alternative for content moderation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small reasoning models often suffer from faithfulness hallucinations during intermediate reasoning steps, and existing mitigation methods relying on outcome-based rewards can reinforce unfaithful reasoning.

Method: FaithRL uses step-level supervision with explicit faithfulness rewards from a process reward model and an implicit truncated resampling strategy for contrastive signals.

Result: Experiments show FaithRL reduces hallucinations in both chain-of-thought and final answers across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: FaithRL enhances faithfulness and reliability in reasoning for resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: As large language models become smaller and more efficient, small reasoning models (SRMs) are crucial for enabling chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in resource-constrained settings. However, they are prone to faithfulness hallucinations, especially in intermediate reasoning steps. Existing mitigation methods based on online reinforcement learning rely on outcome-based rewards or coarse-grained CoT evaluation, which can inadvertently reinforce unfaithful reasoning when the final answer is correct. To address these limitations, we propose Faithfulness-Aware Step-Level Reinforcement Learning (FaithRL), introducing step-level supervision via explicit faithfulness rewards from a process reward model, together with an implicit truncated resampling strategy that generates contrastive signals from faithful prefixes. Experiments across multiple SRMs and Open-Book QA benchmarks demonstrate that FaithRL consistently reduces hallucinations in both the CoT and final answers, leading to more faithful and reliable reasoning.

TL;DR: KV-CoRE evaluates kv-cache compressibility in LLMs using SVD, revealing data-dependent patterns across layers and languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the inefficiency of kv-caches in LLMs as context length grows, focusing on data-dependent compression.

Method: Introduces KV-CoRE, a gradient-free SVD-based method for layer-wise evaluation of kv-cache compressibility.

Result: Identifies systematic compressibility patterns tied to model architecture, training data, and language.

Conclusion: Provides a benchmark and insights for dynamic compression and model development.

Abstract: Large language models rely on kv-caches to avoid redundant computation during autoregressive decoding, but as context length grows, reading and writing the cache can quickly saturate GPU memory bandwidth. Recent work has explored KV-cache compression, yet most approaches neglect the data-dependent nature of kv-caches and their variation across layers. We introduce KV-CoRE KV-cache Compressibility by Rank Evaluation), an SVD-based method for quantifying the data-dependent low-rank compressibility of kv-caches. KV-CoRE computes the optimal low-rank approximation under the Frobenius norm and, being gradient-free and incremental, enables efficient dataset-level, layer-wise evaluation. Using this method, we analyze multiple models and datasets spanning five English domains and sixteen languages, uncovering systematic patterns that link compressibility to model architecture, training data, and language coverage. As part of this analysis, we employ the Normalized Effective Rank as a metric of compressibility and show that it correlates strongly with performance degradation under compression. Our study establishes a principled evaluation framework and the first large-scale benchmark of kv-cache compressibility in LLMs, offering insights for dynamic, data-aware compression and data-centric model development.

### [155] [Polyglots or Multitudes? Multilingual LLM Answers to Value-laden Multiple-Choice Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05932)
*Léo Labat,Etienne Ollion,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether multilingual LLMs exhibit consistent responses across languages for value-laden MCQs, using a new multilingual corpus (MEVS). Results show varying consistency, with language-specific behaviors emerging selectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore language-induced variation in value-laden MCQ responses of multilingual LLMs and determine if they behave consistently across languages or exhibit language-dependent variations.

Method: Used the Multilingual European Value Survey (MEVS), a corpus of human-translated survey questions aligned in 8 European languages. Administered questions to over thirty multilingual LLMs under controlled prompt variations.

Result: Larger, instruction-tuned models showed higher consistency, but robustness varied across questions. Language-specific behaviors appeared selectively in consistent models.

Conclusion: The study highlights selective effects of preference fine-tuning on LLM responses, warranting further investigation into language-specific behaviors.

Abstract: Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) are often used to assess knowledge, reasoning abilities, and even values encoded in large language models (LLMs). While the effect of multilingualism has been studied on LLM factual recall, this paper seeks to investigate the less explored question of language-induced variation in value-laden MCQ responses. Are multilingual LLMs consistent in their responses across languages, i.e. behave like theoretical polyglots, or do they answer value-laden MCQs depending on the language of the question, like a multitude of monolingual models expressing different values through a single model? We release a new corpus, the Multilingual European Value Survey (MEVS), which, unlike prior work relying on machine translation or ad hoc prompts, solely comprises human-translated survey questions aligned in 8 European languages. We administer a subset of those questions to over thirty multilingual LLMs of various sizes, manufacturers and alignment-fine-tuning status under comprehensive, controlled prompt variations including answer order, symbol type, and tail character. Our results show that while larger, instruction-tuned models display higher overall consistency, the robustness of their responses varies greatly across questions, with certain MCQs eliciting total agreement within and across models while others leave LLM answers split. Language-specific behavior seems to arise in all consistent, instruction-fine-tuned models, but only on certain questions, warranting a further study of the selective effect of preference fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRIT (Translation-Reasoning Integrated Training) is a self-improving framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by integrating translation training, improving accuracy and language consistency without needing external feedback or extra data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long reasoning models often perform poorly in multilingual settings, either defaulting to English reasoning or suffering accuracy drops when constrained to the question language, due to limited multilingual question understanding and reasoning abilities.

Method: Proposes TRIT, which integrates translation training into multilingual reasoning, jointly improving question understanding and response generation without additional multilingual data.

Result: TRIT outperforms baselines by 7 percentage points on MMATH, boosts cross-lingual question alignment by over 10 points, and improves translation quality by up to 8.4 COMET points on FLORES-200.

Conclusion: TRIT effectively addresses multilingual reasoning challenges by self-improving translation and reasoning abilities, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and language consistency.

Abstract: Long reasoning models often struggle in multilingual settings: they tend to reason in English for non-English questions; when constrained to reasoning in the question language, accuracies drop substantially. The struggle is caused by the limited abilities for both multilingual question understanding and multilingual reasoning. To address both problems, we propose TRIT (Translation-Reasoning Integrated Training), a self-improving framework that integrates the training of translation into multilingual reasoning. Without external feedback or additional multilingual data, our method jointly enhances multilingual question understanding and response generation. On MMATH, our method outperforms multiple baselines by an average of 7 percentage points, improving both answer correctness and language consistency. Further analysis reveals that integrating translation training improves cross-lingual question alignment by over 10 percentage points and enhances translation quality for both mathematical questions and general-domain text, with gains up to 8.4 COMET points on FLORES-200.

*Felipe D. Toro-Hernández,Jesuino Vieira Filho,Rodrigo M. Cabral-Carvalho*

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework modeling concept production as navigation through embedding space, using transformer models to analyze semantic trajectories and their geometric/dynamical metrics, applicable across languages and clinical contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans traverse semantic knowledge spaces dynamically, leveraging embedding models to quantify semantic navigation without heavy preprocessing.

Method: Uses transformer text embedding models to construct semantic trajectories, extracting metrics like distance, entropy, velocity, and acceleration from cumulative embeddings. Evaluated on multilingual datasets and clinical groups.

Result: Distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types; cumulative embeddings outperform non-cumulative ones for longer trajectories. Different embedding models yield similar results.

Conclusion: The framework bridges cognitive modeling with learned representations, offering a scalable method for semantic dynamics analysis in clinical and cross-linguistic research.

Abstract: Semantic representations can be framed as a structured, dynamic knowledge space through which humans navigate to retrieve and manipulate meaning. To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extract geometric and dynamical metrics, including distance to next, distance to centroid, entropy, velocity, and acceleration. These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines. By framing semantic navigation as a structured trajectory through embedding space, bridging cognitive modeling with learned representation, thereby establishing a pipeline for quantifying semantic representation dynamics with applications in clinical research, cross-linguistic analysis, and the assessment of artificial cognition.

*Lizhuo Luo,Shenggui Li,Yonggang Wen,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB) and DSB Cache to improve text generation in diffusion large language models by dynamically adapting block sizes based on semantic difficulty, enhancing both quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fixed block scheduling in dLLMs is suboptimal for quality and efficiency, prompting the need for a dynamic approach that adapts to semantic difficulty.

Method: Proposes DSB, a training-free block scheduling method with dynamic block sizes, and DSB Cache, a KV-cache mechanism optimized for DSB.

Result: Experiments show DSB and DSB Cache consistently improve generation quality and inference efficiency in dLLMs.

Conclusion: Dynamic block scheduling tailored to semantic difficulty enhances dLLM performance without additional training.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative for text generation, distinguished by their native support for parallel decoding. In practice, block inference is crucial for avoiding order misalignment in global bidirectional decoding and improving output quality. However, the widely-used fixed, predefined block (naive) schedule is agnostic to semantic difficulty, making it a suboptimal strategy for both quality and efficiency: it can force premature commitments to uncertain positions while delaying easy positions near block boundaries. In this work, we analyze the limitations of naive block scheduling and disclose the importance of dynamically adapting the schedule to semantic difficulty for reliable and efficient inference. Motivated by this, we propose Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB), a training-free block scheduling method that uses a sliding block with a dynamic size to overcome the rigidity of the naive block. To further improve efficiency, we introduce DSB Cache, a training-free KV-cache mechanism tailored to DSB. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DSB, together with DSB Cache, consistently improves both generation quality and inference efficiency for dLLMs. Code is released at https://github.com/lizhuo-luo/DSB.

TL;DR: LLMs' accuracy in assessing mental health is influenced by contextual knowledge and modeling strategies, with detailed definitions, increased reasoning, and ensembling providing the best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand factors affecting LLMs' accuracy in zero-shot mental health assessments using PTSD narratives and self-reported scores.

Method: Evaluated 11 LLMs by varying contextual knowledge (definitions, summaries, questions) and modeling strategies (zero-shot vs few-shot, reasoning effort, model sizes).

Result: LLMs perform best with detailed context and reasoning; open-weight models plateau at 70B parameters, while closed-weight models improve; ensembling with supervised models yields top results.

Conclusion: Contextual knowledge and modeling choices are crucial for accurate mental health assessments using LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in a zero-shot fashion to assess mental health conditions, yet we have limited knowledge on what factors affect their accuracy. In this study, we utilize a clinical dataset of natural language narratives and self-reported PTSD severity scores from 1,437 individuals to comprehensively evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. To understand the factors affecting accuracy, we systematically varied (i) contextual knowledge like subscale definitions, distribution summary, and interview questions, and (ii) modeling strategies including zero-shot vs few shot, amount of reasoning effort, model sizes, structured subscales vs direct scalar prediction, output rescaling and nine ensemble methods. Our findings indicate that (a) LLMs are most accurate when provided with detailed construct definitions and context of the narrative; (b) increased reasoning effort leads to better estimation accuracy; (c) performance of open-weight models (Llama, Deepseek), plateau beyond 70B parameters while closed-weight (o3-mini, gpt-5) models improve with newer generations; and (d) best performance is achieved when ensembling a supervised model with the zero-shot LLMs. Taken together, the results suggest choice of contextual knowledge and modeling strategies is important for deploying LLMs to accurately assess mental health.

TL;DR: BudgetMem is a runtime memory framework for LLM agents that balances performance and cost via query-aware memory modules with tiered budgets, outperforming baselines and optimizing trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory systems for LLM agents are inefficient and lack explicit control over performance-cost trade-offs, motivating BudgetMem's runtime approach.

Method: BudgetMem organizes memory into modules with three budget tiers (Low/Mid/High), using a lightweight neural router trained with RL to optimize trade-offs.

Result: BudgetMem outperforms baselines in high-budget settings and achieves better accuracy-cost trade-offs under tight budgets across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: BudgetMem effectively balances performance and cost, with analysis revealing optimal tiering strategies for varying budget constraints.

Abstract: Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost trade-off. In this work, we present \textbf{BudgetMem}, a runtime agent memory framework for explicit, query-aware performance-cost control. BudgetMem structures memory processing as a set of memory modules, each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., \textsc{Low}/\textsc{Mid}/\textsc{High}). A lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning. Using BudgetMem as a unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA, BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets. Moreover, our analysis disentangles the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies, clarifying when each axis delivers the most favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DFlash introduces a speculative decoding framework using a lightweight block diffusion model for parallel drafting, achieving significant speedup over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs), which result in high latency and poor GPU utilization.

Method: DFlash employs a block diffusion model for parallel drafting, generating tokens in a single forward pass while conditioning on context features from the target model.

Result: DFlash achieves over 6x lossless acceleration and up to 2.5x higher speedup compared to state-of-the-art speculative decoding methods.

Conclusion: DFlash effectively mitigates the bottlenecks of autoregressive decoding, offering a practical and efficient solution for faster LLM inference.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but require inherently sequential decoding, leading to high inference latency and poor GPU utilization. Speculative decoding mitigates this bottleneck by using a fast draft model whose outputs are verified in parallel by the target LLM; however, existing methods still rely on autoregressive drafting, which remains sequential and limits practical speedups. Diffusion LLMs offer a promising alternative by enabling parallel generation, but current diffusion models typically underperform compared with autoregressive models. In this paper, we introduce DFlash, a speculative decoding framework that employs a lightweight block diffusion model for parallel drafting. By generating draft tokens in a single forward pass and conditioning the draft model on context features extracted from the target model, DFlash enables efficient drafting with high-quality outputs and higher acceptance rates. Experiments show that DFlash achieves over 6x lossless acceleration across a range of models and tasks, delivering up to 2.5x higher speedup than the state-of-the-art speculative decoding method EAGLE-3.

*Luke Whitbread,Lyle J. Palmer,Mark Jenkinson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DDPMs offer a unified approach for normative modeling of tabular IDPs, providing calibrated univariate centiles and realistic multivariate dependence, outperforming traditional methods at higher dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neuroimaging pipelines model IDPs individually, losing valuable multivariate patterns. DDPMs aim to capture these patterns while maintaining clinical interpretability.

Method: DDPMs with FiLM-MLP and SAINT transformer backbones are used for conditional density estimation, evaluated via synthetic benchmarks and UK Biobank data.

Result: DDPMs show well-calibrated outputs and realistic dependence, with transformers outperforming MLPs in higher dimensions.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based normative modeling is viable for multivariate deviation profiles in neuroimaging, balancing calibration and dependence.

Abstract: Normative modeling estimates reference distributions of biological measures conditional on covariates, enabling centiles and clinically interpretable deviation scores to be derived. Most neuroimaging pipelines fit one model per imaging-derived phenotype (IDP), which scales well but discards multivariate dependence that may encode coordinated patterns. We propose denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) as a unified conditional density estimator for tabular IDPs, from which univariate centiles and deviation scores are derived by sampling. We utilise two denoiser backbones: (i) a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) conditioned multilayer perceptron (MLP) and (ii) a tabular transformer with feature self-attention and intersample attention (SAINT), conditioning covariates through learned embeddings. We evaluate on a synthetic benchmark with heteroscedastic and multimodal age effects and on UK Biobank FreeSurfer phenotypes, scaling from dimension of 2 to 200. Our evaluation suite includes centile calibration (absolute centile error, empirical coverage, and the probability integral transform), distributional fidelity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests), multivariate dependence diagnostics, and nearest-neighbour memorisation analysis. For low dimensions, diffusion models deliver well-calibrated per-IDP outputs comparable to traditional baselines while jointly modeling realistic dependence structure. At higher dimensions, the transformer backbone remains substantially better calibrated than the MLP and better preserves higher-order dependence, enabling scalable joint normative models that remain compatible with standard per-IDP pipelines. These results support diffusion-based normative modeling as a practical route to calibrated multivariate deviation profiles in neuroimaging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causal Analyst, a framework for identifying causal mechanisms behind jailbreaks in LLMs using a dataset of 35k attempts, revealing key features like 'Positive Character' and 'Number of Task Steps' as direct drivers of attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the safety and reliability of LLMs by understanding the causal relationships between interpretable prompt features and jailbreak occurrences, which existing studies often overlook.

Method: The method involves integrating LLMs into data-driven causal discovery, using a dataset of 35k jailbreak attempts annotated with 37 human-readable prompt features, and jointly training LLM-based prompt encoding with GNN-based causal graph learning.

Result: The results identify specific prompt features as direct causal drivers of jailbreaks and demonstrate practical applications like a Jailbreaking Enhancer and Guardrail Advisor, outperforming non-causal approaches.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes that a causal perspective on jailbreak features is effective and interpretable for improving LLM reliability, with robust experimental validation supporting the framework's superiority.

Abstract: Uncovering the mechanisms behind "jailbreaks" in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their safety and reliability, yet these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Existing studies predominantly analyze jailbreak prompts by probing latent representations, often overlooking the causal relationships between interpretable prompt features and jailbreak occurrences. In this work, we propose Causal Analyst, a framework that integrates LLMs into data-driven causal discovery to identify the direct causes of jailbreaks and leverage them for both attack and defense. We introduce a comprehensive dataset comprising 35k jailbreak attempts across seven LLMs, systematically constructed from 100 attack templates and 50 harmful queries, annotated with 37 meticulously designed human-readable prompt features. By jointly training LLM-based prompt encoding and GNN-based causal graph learning, we reconstruct causal pathways linking prompt features to jailbreak responses. Our analysis reveals that specific features, such as "Positive Character" and "Number of Task Steps", act as direct causal drivers of jailbreaks. We demonstrate the practical utility of these insights through two applications: (1) a Jailbreaking Enhancer that targets identified causal features to significantly boost attack success rates on public benchmarks, and (2) a Guardrail Advisor that utilizes the learned causal graph to extract true malicious intent from obfuscated queries. Extensive experiments, including baseline comparisons and causal structure validation, confirm the robustness of our causal analysis and its superiority over non-causal approaches. Our results suggest that analyzing jailbreak features from a causal perspective is an effective and interpretable approach for improving LLM reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge Generative AI, Hamiltonian Physics, and Signal Processing by embedding physical priors into Transformer models, overcoming topological depth constraints.

Method: Introduces Momentum Attention via symplectic shear and kinematic momentum, leveraging Symplectic-Filter Duality to enable single-layer induction and spectral analysis.

Result: Validated with extensive experiments, a 125M Momentum model outperforms expectations and tracks a 350M baseline within ~2.9% validation loss.

Conclusion: The framework connects AI, physics, and signal processing, offering a new toolkit for mechanistic interpretability and performance enhancement.

Abstract: The Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) program has mapped the Transformer as a precise computational graph. We extend this graph with a conservation law and time-varying AC dynamics, viewing it as a physical circuit. We introduce Momentum Attention, a symplectic augmentation embedding physical priors via the kinematic difference operator $p_t = q_t - q_{t-1}$, implementing the symplectic shear $\hat{q}_t = q_t + γp_t$ on queries and keys. We identify a fundamental Symplectic-Filter Duality: the physical shear is mathematically equivalent to a High-Pass Filter. This duality is our cornerstone contribution -- by injecting kinematic momentum, we sidestep the topological depth constraint ($L \geq 2$) for induction head formation. While standard architectures require two layers for induction from static positions, our extension grants direct access to velocity, enabling Single-Layer Induction and Spectral Forensics via Bode Plots. We formalize an Orthogonality Theorem proving that DC (semantic) and AC (mechanistic) signals segregate into orthogonal frequency bands when Low-Pass RoPE interacts with High-Pass Momentum. Validated through 5,100+ controlled experiments (documented in Supplementary Appendices A--R and 27 Jupyter notebooks), our 125M Momentum model exceeds expectations on induction-heavy tasks while tracking a 350M baseline within $\sim$2.9% validation loss. Dedicated associative recall experiments reveal a scaling law $γ^* = 4.17 \times N^{-0.74}$ establishing momentum-depth fungibility. We offer this framework as a complementary analytical toolkit connecting Generative AI, Hamiltonian Physics, and Signal Processing.

TL;DR: Feature steering improves behavioral control in LLMs but significantly harms model performance, making prompt engineering a better balanced approach for practical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the practical effectiveness and trade-offs of feature steering methods compared to prompt engineering in real-world applications.

Method: Compared Goodfire's Auto Steer against prompt engineering baselines across 14 steering queries on 171 MMLU questions using Llama-8B and Llama-70B, measuring accuracy, coherence, and behavioral control.

Result: Auto Steer successfully modifies target behaviors but causes substantial performance degradation (accuracy drops from 66% to 46% on Llama-8B and 87% to 73% on Llama-70B) and coherence decline. Prompting achieves a better balance.

Conclusion: Current feature steering methods have significant limitations for practical deployment due to performance trade-offs, highlighting the need for empirical evaluation of mechanistic control methods.

Abstract: Feature steering has emerged as a promising approach for controlling LLM behavior through direct manipulation of internal representations, offering advantages over prompt engineering. However, its practical effectiveness in real-world applications remains poorly understood, particularly regarding potential trade-offs with output quality. We show that feature steering methods substantially degrade model performance even when successfully controlling target behaviors, a critical trade-off. Specifically, we evaluate Goodfire's Auto Steer against prompt engineering baselines across 14 steering queries (covering innocuous and safety-relevant behaviors) on 171 Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) questions using Llama-8B and Llama-70B, measuring accuracy, coherence, and behavioral control. Our findings show that Auto Steer successfully modifies target behaviors (achieving scores of 3.33 vs. 2.98 for prompting on Llama-8B and 3.57 vs. 3.10 on Llama-70B), but causes dramatic performance degradation: accuracy on the MMLU questions drops from 66% to 46% on Llama-8B and 87% to 73% on Llama-70B, with coherence falling from 4.62 to 2.24 and 4.94 to 3.89 respectively. Simple prompting achieves the best overall balance. These findings highlight limitations of current feature steering methods for practical deployment where task performance cannot be sacrificed. More broadly, our work demonstrates that mechanistic control methods face fundamental capability-behavior trade-offs that must be empirically characterized before deployment.

TL;DR: DCER is a unified multimodal fusion framework addressing noise and missing modalities via dual-stage compression and energy-based reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robustness challenges in multimodal fusion include noisy inputs degrading representation quality and missing modalities causing prediction failures.

Method: DCER uses dual-stage compression (within-modality frequency transforms and cross-modality bottleneck tokens) and energy-based reconstruction for missing modalities.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS benchmarks, with strong robustness in complete and high-missing conditions.

Conclusion: DCER effectively addresses noise and missing modalities, offering a robust solution for multimodal fusion.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion faces two robustness challenges: noisy inputs degrade representation quality, and missing modalities cause prediction failures. We propose DCER, a
  unified framework addressing both challenges through dual-stage compression and energy-based reconstruction. The compression stage operates at two levels:
  within-modality frequency transforms (wavelet for audio, DCT for video) remove noise while preserving task-relevant patterns, and cross-modality bottleneck tokens
  force genuine integration rather than modality-specific shortcuts. For missing modalities, energy-based reconstruction recovers representations via gradient descent
  on a learned energy function, with the final energy providing intrinsic uncertainty quantification (\r{ho} > 0.72 correlation with prediction error). Experiments on
  CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks, with a U-shaped robustness pattern favoring multimodal fusion at
  both complete and high-missing conditions. The code will be available on Github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of adapting time-series models during inference, especially under changing dynamics, without extensive retraining.

Method: LISA uses delay-coordinate embeddings and Laplacian spectral learning to create state representations, paired with a frozen decoder. It incorporates lightweight latent-space adapters (Gaussian-process regression or attention-like Markov operators).

Result: LISA outperforms frozen baselines in forecasting and autoregressive tasks, particularly beneficial under dynamic changes.

Conclusion: LISA successfully links in-context adaptation to nonparametric spectral methods, offering improved performance in dynamic time-series modeling.

Abstract: We propose Laplacian In-context Spectral Analysis (LISA), a method for inference-time adaptation of Laplacian-based time-series models using only an observed prefix. LISA combines delay-coordinate embeddings and Laplacian spectral learning to produce diffusion-coordinate state representations, together with a frozen nonlinear decoder for one-step prediction. We introduce lightweight latent-space residual adapters based on either Gaussian-process regression or an attention-like Markov operator over context windows. Across forecasting and autoregressive rollout experiments, LISA improves over the frozen baseline and is often most beneficial under changing dynamics. This work links in-context adaptation to nonparametric spectral methods for dynamical systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage partial physical knowledge as an inductive bias for causal discovery, overcoming limitations of purely data-driven methods in complex dynamical systems.

Method: The framework models system evolution using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), with known ODE dynamics in the drift term and unknown causal couplings in the diffusion term. A scalable sparsity-inducing MLE algorithm estimates parameters.

Result: The approach improves causal graph recovery and produces more stable, physically consistent estimates compared to state-of-the-art data-driven baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating partial physical knowledge enhances causal discovery in dynamical systems, offering better identifiability and robustness.

Abstract: Causal discovery is often a data-driven paradigm to analyze complex real-world systems. In parallel, physics-based models such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide mechanistic structure for many dynamical processes. Integrating these paradigms potentially allows physical knowledge to act as an inductive bias, improving identifiability, stability, and robustness of causal discovery in dynamical systems. However, such integration remains challenging: real dynamical systems often exhibit feedback, cyclic interactions, and non-stationary data trend, while many widely used causal discovery methods are formulated under acyclicity or equilibrium-based assumptions. In this work, we propose an integrative causal discovery framework for dynamical systems that leverages partial physical knowledge as an inductive bias. Specifically, we model system evolution as a stochastic differential equation (SDE), where the drift term encodes known ODE dynamics and the diffusion term corresponds to unknown causal couplings beyond the prescribed physics. We develop a scalable sparsity-inducing MLE algorithm that exploits causal graph structure for efficient parameter estimation. Under mild conditions, we establish guarantees to recover the causal graph. Experiments on dynamical systems with diverse causal structures show that our approach improves causal graph recovery and produces more stable, physically consistent estimates than purely data-driven state-of-the-art baselines.

### [169] [Temporal Pair Consistency for Variance-Reduced Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04908)
*Chika Maduabuchi,Jindong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TPC introduces a variance-reduction principle for continuous-time generative models, improving sample quality and efficiency without modifying architecture or solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing objectives treat timesteps independently, leading to high variance and inefficient sampling. TPC addresses this by coupling predictions along probability paths.

Method: TPC couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps via trajectory-coupled regularization, reducing gradient variance while preserving the flow-matching objective.

Result: TPC improves sample quality and efficiency on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, achieving better FID at similar or lower computational cost than prior methods.

Conclusion: TPC is a lightweight, effective solution for variance reduction in continuous-time generative models, compatible with modern pipelines.

Abstract: Continuous-time generative models, such as diffusion models, flow matching, and rectified flow, learn time-dependent vector fields but are typically trained with objectives that treat timesteps independently, leading to high estimator variance and inefficient sampling. Prior approaches mitigate this via explicit smoothness penalties, trajectory regularization, or modified probability paths and solvers. We introduce Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), a lightweight variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, operating entirely at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that TPC induces a quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization that provably reduces gradient variance while preserving the underlying flow-matching objective. Instantiated within flow matching, TPC improves sample quality and efficiency across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple resolutions, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost than prior methods, and extends seamlessly to modern SOTA-style pipelines with noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.

### [170] [Learning Where It Matters: Geometric Anchoring for Robust Preference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04909)
*Youngjae Cho,Jongsuk Kim,Ji-Hoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GAPO introduces a dynamic, geometry-aware anchor to replace fixed references in preference optimization, improving robustness and performance by adaptively reweighting preference pairs based on local sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like DPO suffer from distributional mismatch due to static references or unconstrained reward drift in reference-free variants, especially under noisy supervision.

Method: GAPO uses a dynamic anchor—an adversarial local perturbation of the current policy—to enable adaptive reweighting of preference pairs based on their local sensitivity, measuring robustness via the Anchor Gap.

Result: GAPO consistently enhances robustness across noisy settings and matches or outperforms existing methods on standard LLM alignment and reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed GAPO framework effectively addresses limitations of static references and reward drift, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness in preference optimization.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and related methods align large language models from pairwise preferences by regularizing updates against a fixed reference policy. As the policy drifts, a static reference, however, can become increasingly miscalibrated, leading to distributional mismatch and amplifying spurious preference signals under noisy supervision. Conversely, reference-free variants avoid mismatch but often suffer from unconstrained reward drift. We propose Geometric Anchor Preference Optimization (GAPO), which replaces the fixed reference with a dynamic, geometry-aware anchor: an adversarial local perturbation of the current policy within a small radius that serves as a pessimistic baseline. This anchor enables an adaptive reweighting mechanism, modulating the importance of each preference pair based on its local sensitivity. We further introduce the Anchor Gap, the reward discrepancy between the policy and its anchor, and show under smoothness conditions that it approximates worst-case local margin degradation. Optimizing a logistic objective weighted by this gap downweights geometrically brittle instances while emphasizing robust preference signals. Across diverse noise settings, GAPO consistently improves robustness while matching or improving performance on standard LLM alignment and reasoning benchmarks.

### [171] [A logical re-conception of neural networks: Hamiltonian bitwise part-whole architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04911)
*E Bowen,R Granger,A Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel system that represents relations (e.g., part-whole) directly using graph encodings and a graph-Hamiltonian operator, diverging from standard neural networks. It uses low-precision arithmetic for efficiency and exhibits symbolic computation traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a system where relational encoding is intrinsic, enabling symbolic-like computation and hierarchical representation without relying on standard artificial neural network methods.

Method: Encodes data as graphs with fixed primitive relations. A graph-Hamiltonian operator calculates energies to satisfy relation constraints, using low-precision arithmetic for efficiency.

Result: Produces hierarchical representations with symbolic traits, such as abductive inference, and identifies ANN-equivalent operations for higher-level semantic representation.

Conclusion: The system offers an unconventional yet efficient approach with potential for advancement in semantic representation, inviting further development.

Abstract: We introduce a simple initial working system in which relations (such as part-whole) are directly represented via an architecture with operating and learning rules fundamentally distinct from standard artificial neural network methods. Arbitrary data are straightforwardly encoded as graphs whose edges correspond to codes from a small fixed primitive set of elemental pairwise relations, such that simple relational encoding is not an add-on, but occurs intrinsically within the most basic components of the system. A novel graph-Hamiltonian operator calculates energies among these encodings, with ground states denoting simultaneous satisfaction of all relation constraints among graph vertices. The method solely uses radically low-precision arithmetic; computational cost is correspondingly low, and scales linearly with the number of edges in the data. The resulting unconventional architecture can process standard ANN examples, but also produces representations that exhibit characteristics of symbolic computation. Specifically, the method identifies simple logical relational structures in these data (part-of; next-to), building hierarchical representations that enable abductive inferential steps generating relational position-based encodings, rather than solely statistical representations. Notably, an equivalent set of ANN operations are derived, identifying a special case of embedded vector encodings that may constitute a useful approach to current work in higher-level semantic representation. The very simple current state of the implemented system invites additional tools and improvements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A^2-LLM is an end-to-end conversational audio avatar model that unifies language, audio prosody, and 3D facial motion, overcoming issues in cascaded systems. It outperforms in emotional expressiveness and real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational digital humans rely on cascaded architectures, leading to errors, latency, and poor emotional depth. A^2-LLM aims to address these by integrating multimodal reasoning.

Method: Proposes A^2-LLM, a unified framework for language, audio prosody, and facial motion, trained using FLAME-QA, a multimodal dataset aligning semantic intent with facial dynamics.

Result: A^2-LLM achieves superior emotional expressiveness, real-time efficiency (500 ms latency, 0.7 RTF), and outperforms rigid lip-sync systems.

Conclusion: A^2-LLM successfully integrates multimodal reasoning for expressive conversational avatars, offering significant improvements over traditional cascaded systems.

Abstract: Developing expressive and responsive conversational digital humans is a cornerstone of next-generation human-computer interaction. While large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced dialogue capabilities, most current systems still rely on cascaded architectures that connect independent modules. These pipelines are often plagued by accumulated errors, high latency, and poor real-time performance. Lacking access to the underlying conversational context, these pipelines inherently prioritize rigid lip-sync over emotional depth. To address these challenges, we propose A$^2$-LLM, an end-to-end conversational audio avatar large language model that jointly reasons about language, audio prosody, and 3D facial motion within a unified framework. To facilitate training, we introduce FLAME-QA, a high-quality multimodal dataset designed to align semantic intent with expressive facial dynamics within a QA format. By leveraging deep semantic understanding, A$^2$-LLM generates emotionally rich facial movements beyond simple lip-synchronization. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves superior emotional expressiveness while maintaining real-time efficiency (500 ms latency, 0.7 RTF).

*Jose Miguel Luna,Taha Bouhsine,Krzysztof Choromanski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLAY introduces a linear-time attention mechanism using spherical Yat-kernels, achieving near-softmax performance with O(L) complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to create a scalable Transformer without the performance trade-offs typical of linear-time attention mechanisms.

Method: SLAY constrains queries and keys to the unit sphere, uses Bernstein's theorem for approximation, and ensures nonnegative attention scores.

Result: SLAY performs nearly as well as softmax attention and better than prior methods like Performers and Cosformers.

Conclusion: SLAY offers the closest linear-time approximation to softmax attention, enabling efficient yet performant Transformers.

Abstract: We propose a new class of linear-time attention mechanisms based on a relaxed and computationally efficient formulation of the recently introduced E-Product, often referred to as the Yat-kernel (Bouhsine, 2025). The resulting interactions are geometry-aware and inspired by inverse-square interactions in physics. Our method, Spherical Linearized Attention with Yat Kernels (SLAY), constrains queries and keys to the unit sphere so that attention depends only on angular alignment. Using Bernstein's theorem, we express the spherical Yat-kernel as a nonnegative mixture of polynomial-exponential product kernels and derive a strictly positive random-feature approximation enabling linear-time O(L) attention. We establish positive definiteness and boundedness on the sphere and show that the estimator yields well-defined, nonnegative attention scores. Empirically, SLAY achieves performance that is nearly indistinguishable from standard softmax attention while retaining linear time and memory scaling, and consistently outperforms prior linear-time attention mechanisms such as Performers and Cosformers. To the best of our knowledge, SLAY represents the closest linear-time approximation to softmax attention reported to date, enabling scalable Transformers without the typical performance trade-offs of attention linearization.

*Soshi Kakio,Yasuko Matsubara,Ren Fujiwara,Yasushi Sakurai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HeteroComp addresses limitations in handling heterogeneous tensor streams by summarizing them into latent components and detecting group anomalies using Gaussian process priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle heterogeneous tensor streams (mix of categorical and continuous attributes) and overlook temporal dynamics, limiting anomaly detection effectiveness.

Method: HeteroComp uses Gaussian process priors to model continuous attributes and temporal dynamics, summarizing streams into latent components for group anomaly detection.

Result: HeteroComp outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in group anomaly detection accuracy and scales efficiently regardless of data stream length.

Conclusion: HeteroComp provides an effective solution for analyzing heterogeneous tensor streams and detecting group anomalies without distorting data properties.

Abstract: Analysis and anomaly detection in event tensor streams consisting of timestamps and multiple attributes - such as communication logs(time, IP address, packet length)- are essential tasks in data mining. While existing tensor decomposition and anomaly detection methods provide useful insights, they face the following two limitations. (i) They cannot handle heterogeneous tensor streams, which comprises both categorical attributes(e.g., IP address) and continuous attributes(e.g., packet length). They typically require either discretizing continuous attributes or treating categorical attributes as continuous, both of which distort the underlying statistical properties of the data.Furthermore, incorrect assumptions about the distribution family of continuous attributes often degrade the model's performance. (ii) They discretize timestamps, failing to track the temporal dynamics of streams(e.g., trends, abnormal events), which makes them ineffective for detecting anomalies at the group level, referred to as 'group anomalies' (e.g, DoS attacks). To address these challenges, we propose HeteroComp, a method for continuously summarizing heterogeneous tensor streams into 'components' representing latent groups in each attribute and their temporal dynamics, and detecting group anomalies. Our method employs Gaussian process priors to model unknown distributions of continuous attributes, and temporal dynamics, which directly estimate probability densities from data. Extracted components give concise but effective summarization, enabling accurate group anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that HeteroComp outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for group anomaly detection accuracy, and its computational time does not depend on the data stream length.

### [175] [Simulated Adoption: Decoupling Magnitude and Direction in LLM In-Context Conflict Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04918)
*Long Zhang,Fangwei Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs prioritize conflicting in-context information over parametric memory, termed sycophancy. The study reveals this involves geometric displacement ('Orthogonal Interference') rather than signal dilution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs resolve knowledge conflicts through compliance and whether suppression arises from signal dilution or geometric alteration.

Method: Conducted layer-wise geometric analysis on Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B, decomposing residual stream updates into radial and angular components.

Result: Rejected 'Manifold Dilution' hypothesis; found 'Orthogonal Interference' as the mechanism—conflicting contexts introduce quasi-orthogonal vectors, rotating hidden states.

Conclusion: Models bypass correct information via geometric displacement, not suppression. Highlights the need for vectorial monitoring to detect genuine knowledge vs. mimicry.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently prioritize conflicting in-context information over pre-existing parametric memory, a phenomenon often termed sycophancy or compliance. However, the mechanistic realization of this behavior remains obscure, specifically how the model resolves these knowledge conflicts through compliance, and whether this suppression arises from signal magnitude dilution or directional geometric alteration within the residual stream. To resolve this, we conducted a layer-wise geometric analysis across Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B, decomposing the residual stream updates induced by counter-factual contexts into radial (norm-based) and angular (cosine-based) components. Our empirical results reject the universality of the "Manifold Dilution" hypothesis, as two of the three architectures maintained stable residual norms despite exhibiting significant performance degradation on factual queries. Instead, we observed that compliance is consistently characterized by "Orthogonal Interference," where the conflicting context injects a steering vector that is quasi-orthogonal to the ground-truth direction, effectively rotating the hidden state representation. This suggests that models do not "unlearn" or suppress the magnitude of internal truths but rather employ a mechanism of geometric displacement to bypass the correct unembedding vector, effectively simulating adoption while preserving the original structural magnitude. These findings challenge scalar confidence metrics for detecting hallucinations and underscore the necessity of vectorial monitoring to distinguish between genuine knowledge integration and superficial in-context mimicry.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a gradual compacting method called Prune-Tune Loop (PTL) to compress Large Language Models (LLMs) without significant performance loss, achieving up to 50% size reduction with minimal post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational demands of LLMs by reducing redundant parameters while preserving reasoning capabilities, avoiding the dramatic performance drops seen in conventional pruning methods.

Method: PTL divides compression into fine-grained iterations, applying pruning and tuning alternately to incrementally reduce model size and restore performance. It resembles the 'boiling frog' effect for smooth compression.

Result: PTL compresses LLMs to nearly half their original size with lightweight post-training, maintaining comparable performance on reasoning tasks. It also works across various pruning strategies and tasks like code generation.

Conclusion: PTL offers a flexible and effective approach to LLM compression, balancing size reduction and performance retention across diverse tasks and pruning methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, but their substantial size often demands significant computational resources. To reduce resource consumption and accelerate inference, it is essential to eliminate redundant parameters without compromising performance. However, conventional pruning methods that directly remove such parameters often lead to a dramatic drop in model performance in reasoning tasks, and require extensive post-training to recover the lost capabilities. In this work, we propose a gradual compacting method that divides the compression process into multiple fine-grained iterations, applying a Prune-Tune Loop (PTL) at each stage to incrementally reduce model size while restoring performance with finetuning. This iterative approach-reminiscent of the "boiling frog" effect-enables the model to be progressively compressed without abrupt performance loss. Experimental results show that PTL can compress LLMs to nearly half their original size with only lightweight post-training, while maintaining performance comparable to the original model on reasoning tasks. Moreover, PTL is flexible and can be applied to various pruning strategies, such as neuron pruning and layer pruning, as well as different post-training methods, including continual pre-training and reinforcement learning. Additionally, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of PTL on a variety of tasks beyond mathematical reasoning, such as code generation, demonstrating its broad applicability.

*Ronghao Lin,Qiaolin He,Sijie Mai,Ying Zeng,Aolin Xiong,Li Huang,Yap-Peng Tan,Haifeng Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CyIN is a novel framework addressing the gap between complete and incomplete multimodal learning by using cyclic informative learning and cross-modal cyclic translation to handle dynamic missing modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multimodal deployments often face unpredictable modality availability, causing performance drops in pre-trained models. CyINTargets this issue by improving robustness.

Method: CyIN utilizes token- and label-level Information Bottleneck cyclically to build an informative latent space. It also employs cross-modal cyclic translation to reconstruct missing modalities.

Result: Experiments on 4 datasets show CyIN outperforms in both complete and incomplete multimodal scenarios.

Conclusion: CyIN effectively bridges the gap between complete and incomplete multimodal learning, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Multimodal machine learning, mimicking the human brain's ability to integrate various modalities has seen rapid growth. Most previous multimodal models are trained on perfectly paired multimodal input to reach optimal performance. In real-world deployments, however, the presence of modality is highly variable and unpredictable, causing the pre-trained models in suffering significant performance drops and fail to remain robust with dynamic missing modalities circumstances. In this paper, we present a novel Cyclic INformative Learning framework (CyIN) to bridge the gap between complete and incomplete multimodal learning. Specifically, we firstly build an informative latent space by adopting token- and label-level Information Bottleneck (IB) cyclically among various modalities. Capturing task-related features with variational approximation, the informative bottleneck latents are purified for more efficient cross-modal interaction and multimodal fusion. Moreover, to supplement the missing information caused by incomplete multimodal input, we propose cross-modal cyclic translation by reconstruct the missing modalities with the remained ones through forward and reverse propagation process. With the help of the extracted and reconstructed informative latents, CyIN succeeds in jointly optimizing complete and incomplete multimodal learning in one unified model. Extensive experiments on 4 multimodal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both complete and diverse incomplete scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to enhance neural operators' handling of complex boundary conditions (BCs) in PDEs by mapping boundary data to latent pseudo-extensions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operators struggle with highly variable boundary conditions in PDEs, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: The framework maps boundary data to latent pseudo-extensions over the spatial domain, allowing standard neural operator architectures to process boundary information.

Result: Outperforms baselines significantly on 18 challenging datasets, achieving high accuracy without hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed boundary-to-domain extension strategy is effective for integrating complex BCs into neural operators, broadening their applicability in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful surrogates for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), yet their ability to handle general, highly variable boundary conditions (BCs) remains limited. Existing approaches often fail when the solution operator exhibits strong sensitivity to boundary forcings. We propose a general framework for conditioning neural operators on complex non-homogeneous BCs through function extensions. Our key idea is to map boundary data to latent pseudo-extensions defined over the entire spatial domain, enabling any standard operator learning architecture to consume boundary information. The resulting operator, coupled with an arbitrary domain-to-domain neural operator, can learn rich dependencies on complex BCs and input domain functions at the same time. To benchmark this setting, we construct 18 challenging datasets spanning Poisson, linear elasticity, and hyperelasticity problems, with highly variable, mixed-type, component-wise, and multi-segment BCs on diverse geometries. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming baselines by large margins, while requiring no hyperparameter tuning across datasets. Overall, our results demonstrate that learning boundary-to-domain extensions is an effective and practical strategy for imposing complex BCs in existing neural operator frameworks, enabling accurate and robust scientific machine learning models for a broader range of PDE-governed problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reliable Audio-Visual Question Answering ($ackslash mathcal{R}$-AVQA), focusing on abstention over incorrect answers. It proposes Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR) to enhance reliability by correcting MSP confidence signals adaptively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVQA models lack robust mechanisms to abstain from incorrect answers. The paper aims to improve reliability by addressing MSP limitations in deep neural networks.

Method: Proposes ACR, which retains MSP as a primary confidence signal but adds Residual Risk Head and Confidence Gating Head for adaptive corrections when MSP is unreliable.

Result: ACR outperforms existing methods across AVQA architectures, showing consistency in in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and biased data settings.

Conclusion: ACR provides a reliable foundation for $ackslash mathcal{R}$-AVQA, demonstrating effectiveness through empirical results and theoretical analysis. Code will be available upon acceptance.

Abstract: We present a formal problem formulation for \textit{Reliable} Audio-Visual Question Answering ($\mathcal{R}$-AVQA), where we prefer abstention over answering incorrectly. While recent AVQA models have high accuracy, their ability to identify when they are likely wrong and their consequent abstention from answering remain underexplored areas of research. To fill this gap, we explore several approaches and then propose Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR), a lightweight method to further enhance the performance of $\mathcal{R}$-AVQA. Our key insight is that the Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) is Bayes-optimal only under strong calibration, a condition usually not met in deep neural networks, particularly in multimodal models. Instead of replacing MSP, our ACR maintains it as a primary confidence signal and applies input-adaptive residual corrections when MSP is deemed unreliable. ACR introduces two learned heads: i) a Residual Risk Head that predicts low-magnitude correctness residuals that MSP does not capture, and ii) a Confidence Gating Head to determine MSP trustworthiness. Our experiments and theoretical analysis show that ACR consistently outperforms existing methods on in- and out-of-disrtibution, and data bias settings across three different AVQA architectures, establishing a solid foundation for $\mathcal{R}$-AVQA task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STIR introduces dynamic latent trajectory control to enhance reasoning processes internally, outperforming static methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing activation steering methods use static control vectors, which don't adapt to the dynamic nature of complex reasoning tasks.

Method: STIR employs a three-stage pipeline: inducing latent actions, constructing a sparse control basis, and dynamically injecting context-specific impulses.

Result: STIR improves accuracy by 1.9% to 7.5% and reduces token consumption by up to 35% across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dynamic latent trajectory control internalizes reasoning processes efficiently, achieving superior performance without explicit generation.

Abstract: The internalization of chain-of-thought processes into hidden states has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm for scaling test-time compute. However, existing activation steering methods rely on static control vectors that fail to adapt to the non-stationary evolution of complex reasoning tasks. To address this limitation, we propose STIR (Self-Distilled Tools for Internal Reasoning), a framework that reformulates reasoning enhancement as a dynamic latent trajectory control problem. STIR introduces a synergistic three-stage pipeline: (1) differential intrinsic action induction harvests latent reasoning successes to crystallize steering primitives; (2) sparse control basis construction curates a compact, geometrically diverse tool library; and (3) value-modulated trajectory intervention dynamically injects context-specific impulses via anchor-based gating. Extensive experiments on six arithmetic and logical benchmarks across four representative models demonstrate that STIR improves average accuracy by 1.9% to 7.5% while reducing average token consumption by up to 35% compared to vanilla decoding. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of explicit chain-of-thought can be realized through dynamic latent trajectory control, internalizing the reasoning process to bypass the explicit generation while achieving superior fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current online Reinforcement Learning approaches for aligning flow matching models suffer from inefficient exploration and slow optimization due to undirected stochasticity and sparse rewards.

Method: Euphonium formulates sampling as a Stochastic Differential Equation incorporating process reward gradients, enabling step-by-step steering. It also includes a distillation objective to internalize guidance signals into the flow network.

Result: Experiments show Euphonium achieves better alignment and accelerates training convergence by 1.66x compared to existing methods like Flow-GRPO and DanceGRPO.

Conclusion: Euphonium advances beyond unguided exploration, offering a principled and efficient solution for aligning flow matching models with human preferences.

Abstract: While online Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning flow matching models with human preferences, current approaches are hindered by inefficient exploration during training rollouts. Relying on undirected stochasticity and sparse outcome rewards, these methods struggle to discover high-reward samples, resulting in data-inefficient and slow optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Euphonium, a novel framework that steers generation via process reward gradient guided dynamics. Our key insight is to formulate the sampling process as a theoretically principled Stochastic Differential Equation that explicitly incorporates the gradient of a Process Reward Model into the flow drift. This design enables dense, step-by-step steering toward high-reward regions, advancing beyond the unguided exploration in prior works, and theoretically encompasses existing sampling methods (e.g., Flow-GRPO, DanceGRPO) as special cases. We further derive a distillation objective that internalizes the guidance signal into the flow network, eliminating inference-time dependency on the reward model. We instantiate this framework with a Dual-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, combining latent process rewards for efficient credit assignment with pixel-level outcome rewards for final visual fidelity. Experiments on text-to-video generation show that Euphonium achieves better alignment compared to existing methods while accelerating training convergence by 1.66x.

TL;DR: TurboBoA is a backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm enhancing BoA's accuracy benefits with significant speed improvements via joint quantization, error correction, and adaptive grid computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inefficiencies and accuracy drops in PTQ methods like GPTQ and BoA for large language models.

Method: Proposes TurboBoA with joint quantization of out-channels, error correction, and adaptive grid refinement.

Result: Achieves substantial speedup over BoA and improved accuracy, setting state-of-the-art results in quantization.

Conclusion: TurboBoA efficiently balances speed and accuracy in PTQ, making it suitable for large-scale LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the importance of post-training quantization (PTQ) for reducing memory and computation costs. Among PTQ methods, GPTQ has gained significant attention for its efficiency, enabling billion-scale LLMs to be quantized within a few GPU hours. However, GPTQ's assumption of layer-wise independence leads to severe accuracy drops in low-bit regimes. Recently, BoA improved upon GPTQ by incorporating inter-layer dependencies within attention modules, but its reliance on sequential quantization across all out-channels makes it substantially less efficient. In this paper, we propose TurboBoA, a new backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm that preserves the accuracy benefits of BoA while significantly accelerating the process. The proposed TurboBoA introduces three key innovations: (i) joint quantization of multiple out-channels with a closed-form error compensation rule, which reduces sequential bottlenecks and yields more than a three-fold speedup; (ii) a correction mechanism for errors propagated from preceding quantized layers; and (iii) adaptive grid computation with coordinate descent refinement to maintain alignment during iterative updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TurboBoA delivers substantial acceleration over BoA while consistently improving accuracy. When combined with outlier suppression techniques, it achieves state-of-the-art results in both weight-only and weight-activation quantization.

Method: Combined geometric analysis with mechanistic intervention to study layer-wise transitions and representational geometry.

Result: Late layers use structured geometric codes: angles parametrize prediction similarity, while norms encode context-specific info.

Conclusion: The study offers a mechanistic-geometric explanation of how LLMs dynamically convert context into predictions.

Abstract: We show that decoder-only large language models exhibit a depth-wise transition from context-processing to prediction-forming phases of computation accompanied by a reorganization of representational geometry. Using a unified framework combining geometric analysis with mechanistic intervention, we demonstrate that late-layer representations implement a structured geometric code that enables selective causal control over token prediction. Specifically, angular organization of the representation geometry parametrizes prediction distributional similarity, while representation norms encode context-specific information that does not determine prediction. Together, these results provide a mechanistic-geometric account of the dynamics of transforming context into predictions in LLMs.

*Mohamad Dalal,Thomas B. Moeslund,Joakim Bruslund Haurum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hyperbolic Clustered GCD (HC-GCD) learns embeddings in hyperbolic space and clusters them directly there, outperforming Euclidean clustering in some aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior hyperbolic GCD methods revert to Euclidean geometry for clustering, which may not be optimal. The aim is to explore clustering directly in hyperbolic space for better performance.

Method: HC-GCD uses the Lorentz Hyperboloid model for embedding and employs hyperbolic K-Means for clustering. It is tested on Semantic Shift Benchmark datasets.

Result: HC-GCD matches the state-of-the-art hyperbolic GCD method and shows that hyperbolic K-Means outperforms Euclidean K-Means in accuracy. Clipping Euclidean norms affects clustering performance variably.

Conclusion: Clustering directly in hyperbolic space improves consistency and accuracy, demonstrating the potential of hyperbolic geometry for GCD tasks.

Abstract: Hyperbolic representation learning has been widely used to extract implicit hierarchies within data, and recently it has found its way to the open-world classification task of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). However, prior hyperbolic GCD methods only use hyperbolic geometry for representation learning and transform back to Euclidean geometry when clustering. We hypothesize this is suboptimal. Therefore, we present Hyperbolic Clustered GCD (HC-GCD), which learns embeddings in the Lorentz Hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry, and clusters these embeddings directly in hyperbolic space using a hyperbolic K-Means algorithm. We test our model on the Semantic Shift Benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that HC-GCD is on par with the previous state-of-the-art hyperbolic GCD method. Furthermore, we show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to better accuracy than Euclidean K-Means. We carry out ablation studies showing that clipping the norm of the Euclidean embeddings leads to decreased accuracy in clustering unseen classes, and increased accuracy for seen classes, while the overall accuracy is dataset dependent. We also show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to more consistent clusters when varying the label granularity.

*Davide Berasi,Matteo Farina,Massimiliano Mancini,Elisa Ricci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to optimize data mixtures for SFT of multimodal LLMs by using model merging as an efficient proxy, avoiding costly training runs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of optimizing data mixture weights due to combinatorial search space and high training costs motivates leveraging model merging for efficient estimation.

Method: Train domain-specific experts and evaluate their weighted parameter-space combinations to estimate data mixture performance.

Result: Merged proxy models show high rank correlation with models trained on actual data mixtures across 14 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Model merging provides a scalable, efficient strategy for optimizing data mixtures, decoupling optimization from intensive training.

Abstract: Selecting the best data mixture is critical for successful Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, determining the optimal mixture weights across multiple domain-specific datasets remains a significant bottleneck due to the combinatorial search space and the high cost associated with even a single training run. This is the so-called Data Mixture Optimization (DMO) problem. On the other hand, model merging unifies domain-specific experts through parameter interpolation. This strategy is efficient, as it only requires a single training run per domain, yet oftentimes leads to suboptimal models. In this work, we take the best of both worlds, studying model merging as an efficient strategy for estimating the performance of different data mixtures. We train domain-specific multimodal experts and evaluate their weighted parameter-space combinations to estimate the efficacy of corresponding data mixtures. We conduct extensive experiments on 14 multimodal benchmarks, and empirically demonstrate that the merged proxy models exhibit a high rank correlation with models trained on actual data mixtures. This decouples the search for optimal mixtures from the resource-intensive training process, thereby providing a scalable and efficient strategy for navigating the complex landscape of mixture weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the memory complexity limitations of existing neural PDE solvers when dealing with high-resolution meshes (~10^8 cells) in industrial-scale geometries.

Method: The method includes two key optimizations: faster slice and deslice using matrix multiplication associative property, and geometry slice tiling. It also employs an amortized training strategy and physical state caching during inference.

Result: Transolver-3 successfully handles meshes with over 160 million cells, demonstrating impressive performance in aircraft and automotive design benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study concludes that Transolver-3 bridges the gap between GPU capacity and resolution demands, making high-fidelity physics simulations feasible for industrial applications.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a transformative tool for the neural surrogate modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. However, scaling these solvers to industrial-scale geometries with over $10^8$ cells remains a fundamental challenge due to the prohibitive memory complexity of processing high-resolution meshes. We present Transolver-3, a new member of the Transolver family as a highly scalable framework designed for high-fidelity physics simulations. To bridge the gap between limited GPU capacity and the resolution requirements of complex engineering tasks, we introduce two key architectural optimizations: faster slice and deslice by exploiting matrix multiplication associative property and geometry slice tiling to partition the computation of physical states. Combined with an amortized training strategy by learning on random subsets of original high-resolution meshes and a physical state caching technique during inference, Transolver-3 enables high-fidelity field prediction on industrial-scale meshes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Transolver-3 is capable of handling meshes with over 160 million cells, achieving impressive performance across three challenging simulation benchmarks, including aircraft and automotive design tasks.

*Tomas Tokar,Scott Sanner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neuralized Kolmogorov Mean (NKM) and quasi-arithmetic neural networks (QUANNs) as trainable, expressive alternatives to fixed pooling operations for set-structured data, showing theoretical and empirical superiority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DeepSets and PointNet rely on non-learnable pooling operations, limiting expressivity and transferability of embeddings.

Method: Proposes NKM, a trainable framework for central tendency, and QUANNs, which use NKM for learnable aggregation.

Result: Theoretically, QUANNs are universal approximators and learn structured embeddings. Empirically, they outperform baselines and transfer well.

Conclusion: QUANNs offer a more expressive and transferable solution for set-structured data compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Sets represent a fundamental abstraction across many types of data. To handle the unordered nature of set-structured data, models such as DeepSets and PointNet rely on fixed, non-learnable pooling operations (e.g., sum or max) -- a design choice that can hinder the transferability of learned embeddings and limits model expressivity. More recently, learnable aggregation functions have been proposed as more expressive alternatives. In this work, we advance this line of research by introducing the Neuralized Kolmogorov Mean (NKM) -- a novel, trainable framework for learning a generalized measure of central tendency through an invertible neural function. We further propose quasi-arithmetic neural networks (QUANNs), which incorporate the NKM as a learnable aggregation function. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that, QUANNs are universal approximators for a broad class of common set-function decompositions and, thanks to their invertible neural components, learn more structured latent representations. Empirically, QUANNs outperform state-of-the-art baselines across diverse benchmarks, while learning embeddings that transfer effectively even to tasks that do not involve sets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces π-Distill and OPSD methods to distill frontier models using training-time privileged information, outperforming standard practices in multi-turn agentic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of transferring capabilities learned with privileged information (PI) to policies that operate without it at inference time, particularly in multi-turn agentic environments where reasoning is hidden.

Method: Introduces π-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective, and On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), a reinforcement learning approach with a reverse KL-penalty between student and PI-conditioned teacher.

Result: Both π-Distill and OPSD outperform standard practices (supervised fine-tuning followed by RL) across multiple benchmarks, models, and forms of PI.

Conclusion: π-Distill and OPSD are effective methods for learning with PI, with π-Distill generally outperforming OPSD in most cases.

Abstract: Training-time privileged information (PI) can enable language models to succeed on tasks they would otherwise fail, making it a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in hard, long-horizon settings. However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce π-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that π-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on π-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of complex systems like plasma-surface interactions is limited by parameter uncertainties and high computational costs, necessitating efficient calibration methods.

Method: The method uses a reduced Hessian approximation to identify stiff parameter subspaces with minimal simulations, integrated with a probabilistic formulation for rigorous inference.

Result: The framework outperforms baseline optimization techniques in sample efficiency, validated in plasma-surface interactions.

Conclusion: This approach provides a scalable tool for optimizing models of complex reaction systems, from plasma chemistry to biochemical networks.

Abstract: This work introduces a stochastic hierarchical optimization framework inspired by Sloppy Model theory for the efficient calibration of physical models. Central to this method is the use of a reduced Hessian approximation, which identifies and targets the stiff parameter subspace using minimal simulation queries. This strategy enables efficient navigation of highly anisotropic landscapes, avoiding the computational burden of exhaustive sampling. To ensure rigorous inference, we integrate this approach with a probabilistic formulation that derives a principled objective loss function directly from observed data. We validate the framework by applying it to the problem of plasma-surface interactions, where accurate modelling is strictly limited by uncertainties in surface reactivity parameters and the computational cost of kinetic simulations. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms baseline optimization techniques in sample efficiency. This approach offers a general and scalable tool for optimizing models of complex reaction systems, ranging from plasma chemistry to biochemical networks.

Motivation: Address the gap between practical online matching algorithms in domains like Internet advertising and organ allocation and their lack of strong theoretical guarantees.

Method: Develop online matching algorithms based on a coarsening approach, aggregating offline nodes into capacitated clusters while maintaining granularity.

Result: The proposed policy achieves near-optimal theoretical guarantees and closely matches the performance of the omniscient benchmark in realistic simulations.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap between data-driven heuristics and theoretical lower bounds, providing rigorous justification for clustering-based approaches in organ allocation.

Abstract: Online matching has been a mainstay in domains such as Internet advertising and organ allocation, but practical algorithms often lack strong theoretical guarantees. We take an important step toward addressing this by developing new online matching algorithms based on a coarsening approach. Although coarsening typically implies a loss of granularity, we show that, to the contrary, aggregating offline nodes into capacitated clusters can yield near-optimal theoretical guarantees. We apply our methodology to heart transplant allocation to develop theoretically grounded policies based on structural properties of historical data. In realistic simulations, our policy closely matches the performance of the omniscient benchmark. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven heuristics and pessimistic theoretical lower bounds, and provides rigorous justification for prior clustering-based approaches in organ allocation.

TL;DR: The paper argues that current donor organ allocation systems overlook the role of incentives, proposing incentive-aware policies integrating game theory and machine learning for fairness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current organ allocation systems fail to account for incentives among stakeholders, leading to adverse outcomes.

Method: The paper critiques existing approaches, identifies incentive misalignments in US heart transplant allocation, and proposes integrating mechanism design, strategic classification, causal inference, and social choice.

Result: Current incentive misalignments are causing adverse effects, highlighting the need for incentive-aware policies.

Conclusion: Future organ allocation policies should incorporate incentive-aware methodologies to ensure robustness, efficiency, and fairness.

Abstract: The allocation of scarce donor organs constitutes one of the most consequential algorithmic challenges in healthcare. While the field is rapidly transitioning from rigid, rule-based systems to machine learning and data-driven optimization, we argue that current approaches often overlook a fundamental barrier: incentives. In this position paper, we highlight that organ allocation is not merely a static optimization problem, but rather a complex game involving transplant centers, clinicians, and regulators. Focusing on US adult heart transplant allocation, we identify critical incentive misalignments across the decision-making pipeline, and present data showing that they are having adverse consequences today. Our main position is that the next generation of allocation policies should be incentive aware. We outline a research agenda for the machine learning community, calling for the integration of mechanism design, strategic classification, causal inference, and social choice to ensure robustness, efficiency, and fairness in the face of strategic behavior from the various constituent groups.

*Yu-Ang Lee,Ching-Yun Ko,Pin-Yu Chen,Mi-Yen Yeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRA variants' performance improvements vanish with proper hyperparameter tuning, making vanilla LoRA competitive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether reported improvements in LoRA variants hold under extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Method: Systematic evaluation of four LoRA variants and vanilla LoRA via hyperparameter searches on diverse tasks.

Result: Properly tuned learning rates equalize performance, showing minor rank-dependent effects.

Conclusion: Vanilla LoRA is still competitive; reported gains may not reflect consistent methodological benefits.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is the prevailing approach for efficient large language model (LLM) fine-tuning. Building on this paradigm, recent studies have proposed alternative initialization strategies and architectural modifications, reporting substantial improvements over vanilla LoRA. However, these gains are often demonstrated under fixed or narrowly tuned hyperparameter settings, despite the known sensitivity of neural networks to training configurations. In this work, we systematically re-evaluate four representative LoRA variants alongside vanilla LoRA through extensive hyperparameter searches. Across mathematical and code generation tasks on diverse model scales, we find that different LoRA methods favor distinct learning rate ranges. Crucially, once learning rates are properly tuned, all methods achieve similar peak performance (within 1-2%), with only subtle rank-dependent behaviors. These results suggest that vanilla LoRA remains a competitive baseline and that improvements reported under single training configuration may not reflect consistent methodological advantages. Finally, a second-order analysis attributes the differing optimal learning rate ranges to variations in the largest Hessian eigenvalue, aligning with classical learning theories.

*Atula Tejaswi,Litu Rout,Constantine Caramanis,Sanjay Shakkottai,Sujay Sanghavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EntRGi, a novel method for reward guidance in discrete diffusion language models, addressing limitations of existing approaches by dynamically regulating gradients using model confidence, and demonstrates its effectiveness empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reward guidance in discrete diffusion language models either degrade gradient feedback or involve incorrect optimization due to the discrete nature of tokens. The paper aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Proposes EntRGi (Entropy-aware Reward Guidance), which dynamically modulates gradients from the reward model by leveraging the model's confidence, ensuring reliable inputs and improved guidance.

Result: Empirical validation on a 7B-parameter model across diverse reward models and benchmarks shows consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: EntRGi effectively bridges the gap between discrete tokens and continuous relaxations, enhancing reward guidance performance.

Abstract: Reward guidance has been applied to great success in the test-time adaptation of continuous diffusion models; it updates each denoising step using the gradients from a downstream reward model. We study reward guidance for discrete diffusion language models, where one cannot differentiate through the natural outputs of the model because they are discrete tokens. Existing approaches either replace these discrete tokens with continuous relaxations, or employ techniques like the straight-through estimator. In this work, we show the downsides of both these methods. The former degrades gradient feedback because the reward model has never been trained with continuous inputs. The latter involves incorrect optimization because the gradient evaluated at discrete tokens is used to update continuous logits. Our key innovation is to go beyond this tradeoff by introducing a novel mechanism called EntRGi: Entropy aware Reward Guidance that dynamically regulates the gradients from the reward model. By modulating the continuous relaxation using the model's confidence, our approach substantially improves reward guidance while providing reliable inputs to the reward model. We empirically validate our approach on a 7B-parameter diffusion language model across 3 diverse reward models and 3 multi-skill benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: To ensure stable learning in Transformers by exploring non-Euclidean normalization approaches.

Method: Extends the QKNorm scheme with Lp norms, allowing flexible normalization beyond Euclidean norms.

Conclusion: The generalized QKNorm approach is viable for Transformer architectures.

Abstract: The normalization of query and key vectors is an essential part of the Transformer architecture. It ensures that learning is stable regardless of the scale of these vectors. Some normalization approaches are available. In this preliminary work, a generalization of the QKNorm normalization scheme is proposed. The approach is based on the Lp norm, allowing non-Euclidean norms to be employed. Experimental results demonstrate the suitability of the method for a simple problem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for private in-context learning (ICL) using a Product-of-Experts framework, improving accuracy by over 30% compared to prior methods while ensuring privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing differential privacy (DP) approaches to ICL are inefficient or ineffective, risking privacy-sensitive information exposure.

Method: The paper reformulates private ICL using a Product-of-Experts model, providing a theoretically grounded and parallelizable algorithm.

Result: The method improves accuracy by more than 30 percentage points on average across five datasets in text classification, math, and vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers strong privacy guarantees and significant accuracy improvements over existing DP-ICL methods.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks with only a small set of examples at inference time, thereby avoiding task-specific fine-tuning. However, in-context examples may contain privacy-sensitive information that should not be revealed through model outputs. Existing differential privacy (DP) approaches to ICL are either computationally expensive or rely on heuristics with limited effectiveness, including context oversampling, synthetic data generation, or unnecessary thresholding. We reformulate private ICL through the lens of a Product-of-Experts model. This gives a theoretically grounded framework, and the algorithm can be trivially parallelized. We evaluate our method across five datasets in text classification, math, and vision-language. We find that our method improves accuracy by more than 30 percentage points on average compared to prior DP-ICL methods, while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel algorithmic scheme for constrained contextual bandits with adversarial contexts, leveraging online regression oracles to improve regret and constraint violation guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of constrained contextual bandits with adversarially chosen contexts, focusing on controlling regret and cumulative constraint violation in a continuing setting.

Method: The proposed method builds on the SquareCB framework and uses online regression oracles to reduce the constrained problem to an unconstrained contextual bandit problem with adaptive surrogate rewards.

Result: The reduction provides improved guarantees for adversarial contexts compared to prior work focused on stochastic contexts, along with a simpler and clearer analysis.

Conclusion: The introduced scheme offers a modular and effective solution for constrained contextual bandits with adversarial contexts, advancing the field with improved guarantees and transparency.

Abstract: We study constrained contextual bandits (CCB) with adversarially chosen contexts, where each action yields a random reward and incurs a random cost. We adopt the standard realizability assumption: conditioned on the observed context, rewards and costs are drawn independently from fixed distributions whose expectations belong to known function classes. We consider the continuing setting, in which the algorithm operates over the entire horizon even after the budget is exhausted. In this setting, the objective is to simultaneously control regret and cumulative constraint violation. Building on the seminal SquareCB framework of Foster et al. (2018), we propose a simple and modular algorithmic scheme that leverages online regression oracles to reduce the constrained problem to a standard unconstrained contextual bandit problem with adaptively defined surrogate reward functions. In contrast to most prior work on CCB, which focuses on stochastic contexts, our reduction yields improved guarantees for the more general adversarial context setting, together with a compact and transparent analysis.

Conclusion: The entropy-based lifelong ensemble learning method effectively improves robustness and accuracy against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: We formulate the fundamental laws governing learning dynamics, namely the conservation law and the decrease of total entropy. Within this framework, we introduce an entropy-based lifelong ensemble learning method. We evaluate its effectiveness by constructing an immunization mechanism to defend against transfer-based adversarial attacks on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Compared with a naive ensemble formed by simply averaging models specialized on clean and adversarial samples, the resulting logifold achieves higher accuracy in most test cases, with particularly large gains under strong perturbations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in model-based RL, particularly in decision-time planning, by leveraging state representations that support local cost computation and long-horizon structure.

Method: Use the Laplacian representation to capture state-space distances at multiple time scales, preserving meaningful distances and decomposing long-horizon problems. Introduce ALPS, a hierarchical planning algorithm.

Result: ALPS outperforms common baselines on offline goal-conditioned RL tasks from OGBench, previously dominated by model-free methods.

Conclusion: The Laplacian representation is effective for planning, and ALPS demonstrates superior performance, advancing model-based RL.

Abstract: Planning with a learned model remains a key challenge in model-based reinforcement learning (RL). In decision-time planning, state representations are critical as they must support local cost computation while preserving long-horizon structure. In this paper, we show that the Laplacian representation provides an effective latent space for planning by capturing state-space distances at multiple time scales. This representation preserves meaningful distances and naturally decomposes long-horizon problems into subgoals, also mitigating the compounding errors that arise over long prediction horizons. Building on these properties, we introduce ALPS, a hierarchical planning algorithm, and demonstrate that it outperforms commonly used baselines on a selection of offline goal-conditioned RL tasks from OGBench, a benchmark previously dominated by model-free methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUTATE, a method for learning identifiable causal representations from continuous-time latent stochastic point processes, tested in genomics and neuroscience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning causal representations from observations is vital for machine learning and scientific discovery, especially in fields like climate science and biology. Current methods focus on i.i.d. or discrete-time processes, but real-world applications often involve continuous-time stochastic processes.

Method: The authors develop MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with a time-adaptive transition module, to infer stochastic dynamics. They analyze identifiability through the geometry of the parameter space.

Result: MUTATE effectively answers scientific questions, such as mutation accumulation in genomics and neuron spike triggers in neuroscience, across simulated and empirical studies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the gap in learning causal representations from continuous-time stochastic processes, demonstrating practical utility in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Learning meaningful causal representations from observations has emerged as a crucial task for facilitating machine learning applications and driving scientific discoveries in fields such as climate science, biology, and physics. This process involves disentangling high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level observations. Previous work in this area that achieves identifiability typically focuses on cases where the observations are either i.i.d. or follow a latent discrete-time process. Nevertheless, many real-world settings require identifying latent variables that are continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g., multivariate point processes). To this end, we develop identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes. We study its identifiability by analyzing the geometry of the parameter space. Furthermore, we develop MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with a time-adaptive transition module to infer stochastic dynamics. Across simulated and empirical studies, we find that MUTATE can effectively answer scientific questions, such as the accumulation of mutations in genomics and the mechanisms driving neuron spike triggers in response to time-varying dynamics.

TL;DR: ControlG introduces a control-theoretic framework to coordinate multi-task graph self-supervised learning by dynamically allocating optimization budget to objectives, avoiding instability and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combining multiple pretext objectives in graph self-supervised learning (SSL) often leads to interference and instability due to conflicting objectives, nonstationary utility, and hidden starvation of objectives.

Method: ControlG uses a control-theoretic approach, estimating objective difficulty and antagonism, planning budgets via Pareto-aware log-hypervolume, and scheduling with PID controllers.

Result: ControlG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across 9 datasets, providing auditable schedules of objective contributions.

Conclusion: Coordination in multi-task graph SSL is better addressed by temporal allocation of optimization budgets, demonstrated by ControlG's effectiveness.

Abstract: Can multi-task self-supervised learning on graphs be coordinated without the usual tug-of-war between objectives? Graph self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a growing toolbox of pretext objectives: mutual information, reconstruction, contrastive learning; yet combining them reliably remains a challenge due to objective interference and training instability. Most multi-pretext pipelines use per-update mixing, forcing every parameter update to be a compromise, leading to three failure modes: Disagreement (conflict-induced negative transfer), Drift (nonstationary objective utility), and Drought (hidden starvation of underserved objectives). We argue that coordination is fundamentally a temporal allocation problem: deciding when each objective receives optimization budget, not merely how to weigh them. We introduce ControlG, a control-theoretic framework that recasts multi-objective graph SSL as feedback-controlled temporal allocation by estimating per-objective difficulty and pairwise antagonism, planning target budgets via a Pareto-aware log-hypervolume planner, and scheduling with a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. Across 9 datasets, ControlG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, while producing an auditable schedule that reveals which objectives drove learning.

*Songyuan Zhang,Oswin So,H. M. Sabbir Ahmad,Eric Yang Yu,Matthew Cleaveland,Mitchell Black,Chuchu Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReFORM is an offline RL method using flow policies to address OOD errors while maintaining policy expressiveness, outperforming baselines on 40 OGBench tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in offline RL include OOD errors and representing multimodal optimal policies. Prior methods penalize statistical distance but limit policy improvement. ReFORM aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: ReFORM uses a behavior cloning flow policy with bounded source distribution to capture action support, then optimizes a reflected flow generating bounded noise while keeping support, to maximize performance.

Result: ReFORM outperforms all baselines on 40 OGBench tasks with varying dataset quality, using constant hyperparameters.

Conclusion: ReFORM effectively addresses OOD errors and policy expressiveness in offline RL, demonstrating superior performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn the optimal policy from a fixed dataset generated by behavior policies without additional environment interactions. One common challenge that arises in this setting is the out-of-distribution (OOD) error, which occurs when the policy leaves the training distribution. Prior methods penalize a statistical distance term to keep the policy close to the behavior policy, but this constrains policy improvement and may not completely prevent OOD actions. Another challenge is that the optimal policy distribution can be multimodal and difficult to represent. Recent works apply diffusion or flow policies to address this problem, but it is unclear how to avoid OOD errors while retaining policy expressiveness. We propose ReFORM, an offline RL method based on flow policies that enforces the less restrictive support constraint by construction. ReFORM learns a behavior cloning (BC) flow policy with a bounded source distribution to capture the support of the action distribution, then optimizes a reflected flow that generates bounded noise for the BC flow while keeping the support, to maximize the performance. Across 40 challenging tasks from the OGBench benchmark with datasets of varying quality and using a constant set of hyperparameters for all tasks, ReFORM dominates all baselines with hand-tuned hyperparameters on the performance profile curves.

*Shizheng Wen,Mingyuan Chi,Tianwei Yu,Ben Moseley,Mike Yan Michelis,Pu Ren,Hao Sun,Siddhartha Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified algorithmic framework for solving, optimizing, and learning PDEs using TensorGalerkin, demonstrating efficiency across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient and accurate numerical solutions, optimization, and learning methods for PDEs with variational structure.

Method: Utilizes Galerkin discretization and TensorGalerkin framework for optimized, GPU-compliant linear system assembly via tensorized operations and global reduction.

Result: Significant computational efficiency and accuracy improvements in solving PDEs, optimization, and operator learning compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The TensorGalerkin framework offers a versatile, high-performance solution for variational PDE problems across diverse applications.

Abstract: We present a unified algorithmic framework for the numerical solution, constrained optimization, and physics-informed learning of PDEs with a variational structure. Our framework is based on a Galerkin discretization of the underlying variational forms, and its high efficiency stems from a novel highly-optimized and GPU-compliant TensorGalerkin framework for linear system assembly (stiffness matrices and load vectors). TensorGalerkin operates by tensorizing element-wise operations within a Python-level Map stage and then performs global reduction with a sparse matrix multiplication that performs message passing on the mesh-induced sparsity graph. It can be seamlessly employed downstream as i) a highly-efficient numerical PDEs solver, ii) an end-to-end differentiable framework for PDE-constrained optimization, and iii) a physics-informed operator learning algorithm for PDEs. With multiple benchmarks, including 2D and 3D elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs on unstructured meshes, we demonstrate that the proposed framework provides significant computational efficiency and accuracy gains over a variety of baselines in all the targeted downstream applications.

### [203] [Quantile-Physics Hybrid Framework for Safe-Speed Recommendation under Diverse Weather Conditions Leveraging Connected Vehicle and Road Weather Information Systems Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05053)
*Wen Zhang,Adel W. Sadek,Chunming Qiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes a hybrid predictive framework using CV and RWIS data to recommend safe speed intervals for freeways under varying weather conditions, achieving accurate and safe speed predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inclement weather affects driver visibility and road friction, increasing crash risk; this framework aims to mitigate such risks by recommending adjusted safe speeds.

Method: The framework uses high-resolution CV and RWIS data, quantile regression forests (QRF) for speed distribution predictions, and physics-based upper speed limits for safety.

Result: QRF model achieves strong performance (MAE 1.55 mph, 96.43% within 5 mph error, PICP 48.55%) and generalizes well across weather and road segments.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for real-world deployment, enhancing traffic safety and reducing weather-related crashes.

Abstract: Inclement weather conditions can significantly impact driver visibility and tire-road surface friction, requiring adjusted safe driving speeds to reduce crash risk. This study proposes a hybrid predictive framework that recommends real-time safe speed intervals for freeway travel under diverse weather conditions. Leveraging high-resolution Connected Vehicle (CV) data and Road Weather Information System (RWIS) data collected in Buffalo, NY, from 2022 to 2023, we construct a spatiotemporally aligned dataset containing over 6.6 million records across 73 days. The core model employs Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) to estimate vehicle speed distributions in 10-minute windows, using 26 input features that capture meteorological, pavement, and temporal conditions. To enforce safety constraints, a physics-based upper speed limit is computed for each interval based on real-time road grip and visibility, ensuring that vehicles can safely stop within their sight distance. The final recommended interval fuses QRF-predicted quantiles with both posted speed limits and the physics-derived upper bound. Experimental results demonstrate strong predictive performance: the QRF model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.55 mph, with 96.43% of median speed predictions within 5 mph, a PICP (50%) of 48.55%, and robust generalization across weather types. The model's ability to respond to changing weather conditions and generalize across road segments shows promise for real-world deployment, thereby improving traffic safety and reducing weather-related crashes.

Conclusion: StagePilot effectively simulates grooming behaviors, offering a practical tool for prevention training.

Abstract: Cybergrooming is an evolving threat to youth, necessitating proactive educational interventions. We propose StagePilot, an offline RL-based dialogue agent that simulates the stage-wise progression of grooming behaviors for prevention training. StagePilot selects conversational stages using a composite reward that balances user sentiment and goal proximity, with transitions constrained to adjacent stages for realism and interpretability. We evaluate StagePilot through LLM-based simulations, measuring stage completion, dialogue efficiency, and emotional engagement. Results show that StagePilot generates realistic and coherent conversations aligned with grooming dynamics. Among tested methods, the IQL+AWAC agent achieves the best balance between strategic planning and emotional coherence, reaching the final stage up to 43% more frequently than baselines while maintaining over 70% sentiment alignment.

### [205] [Does SGD Seek Flatness or Sharpness? An Exactly Solvable Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05065)
*Yizhou Xu,Pierfrancesco Beneventano,Isaac Chuang,Liu Ziyin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates SGD's preference for flat or sharp loss landscapes during training, finding that it depends on data distribution's noise isotropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify conflicting evidence on SGD's flatness-seeking behavior by analyzing an analytically solvable model.

Method: Identify and solve an analytically solvable model showing SGD's preference for minimal gradient fluctuations, not flatness. Test insights with MLP, RNN, and transformers.

Result: SGD prefers flat minima only if label noise is isotropic; anisotropic noise leads to sharp solutions. Confirmed experimentally across architectures.

Conclusion: Data distribution's noise isotropy uniquely determines SGD's convergence sharpness, resolving prior contradictions.

Abstract: A large body of theory and empirical work hypothesizes a connection between the flatness of a neural network's loss landscape during training and its performance. However, there have been conceptually opposite pieces of evidence regarding when SGD prefers flatter or sharper solutions during training. In this work, we partially but causally clarify the flatness-seeking behavior of SGD by identifying and exactly solving an analytically solvable model that exhibits both flattening and sharpening behavior during training. In this model, the SGD training has no \textit{a priori} preference for flatness, but only a preference for minimal gradient fluctuations. This leads to the insight that, at least within this model, it is data distribution that uniquely determines the sharpness at convergence, and that a flat minimum is preferred if and only if the noise in the labels is isotropic across all output dimensions. When the noise in the labels is anisotropic, the model instead prefers sharpness and can converge to an arbitrarily sharp solution, depending on the imbalance in the noise in the labels spectrum. We reproduce this key insight in controlled settings with different model architectures such as MLP, RNN, and transformers.

*Wenting Li,Saif R. Kazi,Russell Bent,Duo Zhou,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid verifier in a branch-and-bound framework improves robustness verification of neural networks by efficiently tightening bounds using exact NLP-CC and accelerating methods like warm-started solves and strong branching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robustness concerns hinder neural network deployment in safety-critical applications, and current verification methods struggle with scalability-completeness trade-offs.

Method: Proposes a hybrid verifier using branch-and-bound with exact nonlinear programming (NLP-CC) for upper bounding, warm-started NLP solves, and pattern-aligned strong branching.

Result: Achieves tighter upper bounds than PGD, fast per-node solves, and end-to-end speedups over MIP-based verification on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances scalability and completeness, providing robust verification guarantees with practical speedups.

Abstract: Neural networks achieve strong empirical performance, but robustness concerns still hinder deployment in safety-critical applications. Formal verification provides robustness guarantees, but current methods face a scalability-completeness trade-off. We propose a hybrid verifier in a branch-and-bound (BaB) framework that efficiently tightens both upper and lower bounds until an $ε-$global optimum is reached or early stop is triggered. The key is an exact nonlinear program with complementarity constraints (NLP-CC) for upper bounding that preserves the ReLU input-output graph, so any feasible solution yields a valid counterexample and enables rapid pruning of unsafe subproblems. We further accelerate verification with (i) warm-started NLP solves requiring minimal constraint-matrix updates and (ii) pattern-aligned strong branching that prioritizes splits most effective at tightening relaxations. We also provide conditions under which NLP-CC upper bounds are tight. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show markedly tighter upper bounds than PGD across perturbation radii spanning up to three orders of magnitude, fast per-node solves in practice, and substantial end-to-end speedups over MIP-based verification, amplified by warm-starting, GPU batching, and pattern-aligned branching.

### [207] [Reliable Explanations or Random Noise? A Reliability Metric for XAI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05082)
*Poushali Sengupta,Sabita Maharjan,Frank Eliassen,Shashi Raj Pandey,Yan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Explanation Reliability Index (ERI) to measure the stability of AI model explanations under realistic conditions, highlighting reliability issues in widely used methods like SHAP and Integrated Gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring reliable and stable explanations for decisions made by complex machine learning models is crucial in high-stakes domains, but current methods often fail under non-adversarial changes.

Method: The authors propose ERI, a family of metrics based on four reliability axioms (robustness, consistency, smoothness, resilience), with formal guarantees and benchmarks (ERI-T and ERI-Bench).

Result: Experiments show that popular explanation methods, like SHAP and IG, exhibit significant instability under realistic conditions, undermining their reliability.

Conclusion: ERI provides a principled framework to assess explanation reliability, promoting more trustworthy explainable AI systems.

Abstract: In recent years, explaining decisions made by complex machine learning models has become essential in high-stakes domains such as energy systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, the reliability of these explanations, namely, whether they remain stable and consistent under realistic, non-adversarial changes, remains largely unmeasured. Widely used methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients (IG) are well-motivated by axiomatic notions of attribution, yet their explanations can vary substantially even under system-level conditions, including small input perturbations, correlated representations, and minor model updates. Such variability undermines explanation reliability, as reliable explanations should remain consistent across equivalent input representations and small, performance-preserving model changes. We introduce the Explanation Reliability Index (ERI), a family of metrics that quantifies explanation stability under four reliability axioms: robustness to small input perturbations, consistency under feature redundancy, smoothness across model evolution, and resilience to mild distributional shifts. For each axiom, we derive formal guarantees, including Lipschitz-type bounds and temporal stability results. We further propose ERI-T, a dedicated measure of temporal reliability for sequential models, and introduce ERI-Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test explanation reliability across synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results reveal widespread reliability failures in popular explanation methods, showing that explanations can be unstable under realistic deployment conditions. By exposing and quantifying these instabilities, ERI enables principled assessment of explanation reliability and supports more trustworthy explainable AI (XAI) systems.

*Zhiqun Zuo,Mohammad Mahdi Khalili*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Strategic classification faces fairness issues; deterministic thresholds violate individual fairness, but randomized classifiers can achieve it under certain conditions, improving fairness-accuracy trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fairness challenges in strategic classification, particularly individual fairness, which remains underexplored compared to group fairness.

Method: Analyzing threshold-based classifiers, proving deterministic thresholds violate fairness, and proposing randomized classifiers with conditions for fairness. Solved via linear programming.

Result: Found optimal, individually fair randomized classifiers; also extendable to group fairness. Real-world experiments show effective unfairness mitigation.

Conclusion: Randomized classifiers under specific conditions can ensure individual fairness in strategic classification, improving fairness-accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Strategic classification, where individuals modify their features to influence machine learning (ML) decisions, presents critical fairness challenges. While group fairness in this setting has been widely studied, individual fairness remains underexplored. We analyze threshold-based classifiers and prove that deterministic thresholds violate individual fairness. Then, we investigate the possibility of using a randomized classifier to achieve individual fairness. We introduce conditions under which a randomized classifier ensures individual fairness and leverage these conditions to find an optimal and individually fair randomized classifier through a linear programming problem. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be extended to group fairness notions. Experiments on real-world datasets confirm that our method effectively mitigates unfairness and improves the fairness-accuracy trade-off.

*Parsa Vares*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoDiscover enhances systematic literature review screening with adaptive active learning, using a heterogeneous graph and dynamic query strategies to improve efficiency and mitigate cold start issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual screening in systematic literature reviews is costly and inefficient due to low prevalence of relevant studies and scarce expert input. Traditional active learning methods lack adaptability and ignore relational structures in literature.

Method: AutoDiscover models literature as a heterogeneous graph and employs a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) for node representations. A Discounted Thompson Sampling (DTS) agent dynamically manages query strategies, balancing exploration and exploitation with real-time human feedback.

Result: AutoDiscover outperforms static active learning baselines on the SYNERGY benchmark, achieving higher screening efficiency and effectively bootstrapping from minimal initial labels.

Conclusion: AutoDiscover, combined with TS-Insight for interpretability, significantly accelerates systematic literature review screening under challenging conditions of low prevalence and scarce expert labels.

Abstract: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are fundamental to evidence-based research, but manual screening is an increasing bottleneck as scientific output grows. Screening features low prevalence of relevant studies and scarce, costly expert decisions. Traditional active learning (AL) systems help, yet typically rely on fixed query strategies for selecting the next unlabeled documents. These static strategies do not adapt over time and ignore the relational structure of scientific literature networks. This thesis introduces AutoDiscover, a framework that reframes AL as an online decision-making problem driven by an adaptive agent. Literature is modeled as a heterogeneous graph capturing relationships among documents, authors, and metadata. A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) learns node representations, which a Discounted Thompson Sampling (DTS) agent uses to dynamically manage a portfolio of query strategies. With real-time human-in-the-loop labels, the agent balances exploration and exploitation under non-stationary review dynamics, where strategy utility changes over time. On the 26-dataset SYNERGY benchmark, AutoDiscover achieves higher screening efficiency than static AL baselines. Crucially, the agent mitigates cold start by bootstrapping discovery from minimal initial labels where static approaches fail. We also introduce TS-Insight, an open-source visual analytics dashboard to interpret, verify, and diagnose the agent's decisions. Together, these contributions accelerate SLR screening under scarce expert labels and low prevalence of relevant studies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stochastic gradient method for probabilistic combinatorial optimization, offering unbiased gradients with single-query efficiency, generalizing REINFORCE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of exact gradient computation in combinatorial problems, which typically requires multiple queries.

Method: Proposes a stochastic gradient method that computes unbiased gradients using only a single query of the combinatorial function, extending REINFORCE.

Result: The method efficiently computes gradients, reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach generalizes existing methods like REINFORCE and introduces new stochastic gradients, improving optimization efficiency.

Abstract: In a probabilistic reformulation of a combinatorial problem, we often face an optimization over a hypercube, which corresponds to the Bernoulli probability parameter for each binary variable in the primal problem. The combinatorial nature suggests that an exact gradient computation requires multiple queries. We propose a stochastic gradient that is unbiased and requires only a single query of the combinatorial function. This method encompasses a well-established REINFORCE (through an importance sampling), as well as including a class of new stochastic gradients.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RRD is a framework for refining rubrics to improve LLM judges' accuracy and reward signals in reinforcement fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rubrics often lack coverage, conflate dimensions, and contain redundant criteria, degrading performance.

Method: RRD uses recursive decomposition-filter cycles to refine rubrics, ensuring coverage, alignment, and non-redundancy.

Result: RRD improves judge accuracy by up to +17.7 points and boosts reward signals by up to 160% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: RRD provides scalable and interpretable rubric refinement for LLM judging and reward modeling.

Abstract: Recently, rubrics have been used to guide LLM judges in capturing subjective, nuanced, multi-dimensional human preferences, and have been extended from evaluation to reward signals for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, rubric generation remains hard to control: rubrics often lack coverage, conflate dimensions, misalign preference direction, and contain redundant or highly correlated criteria, degrading judge accuracy and producing suboptimal rewards during RFT. We propose RRD, a principled framework for rubric refinement built on a recursive decompose-filter cycle. RRD decomposes coarse rubrics into fine-grained, discriminative criteria, expanding coverage while sharpening separation between responses. A complementary filtering mechanism removes misaligned and redundant rubrics, and a correlation-aware weighting scheme prevents over-representing highly correlated criteria, yielding rubric sets that are informative, comprehensive, and non-redundant. Empirically, RRD delivers large, consistent gains across both evaluation and training: it improves preference-judgment accuracy on JudgeBench and PPE for both GPT-4o and Llama3.1-405B judges, achieving top performance in all settings with up to +17.7 points on JudgeBench. When used as the reward source for RFT on WildChat, it yields substantially stronger and more stable learning signals, boosting reward by up to 160% (Qwen3-4B) and 60% (Llama3.1-8B) versus 10-20% for prior rubric baselines, with gains that transfer to HealthBench-Hard and BiGGen Bench. Overall, RRD establishes recursive rubric refinement as a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM judging and reward modeling in open-ended domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simplifying tabular ML pipeline design to reduce the need for domain expertise and engineering effort by leveraging LLMs.

Method: SemPipes integrates LLM-powered semantic operators for natural language-based data transformations, synthesized and optimized via evolutionary search.

Result: SemPipes improves predictive performance and reduces pipeline complexity across diverse tabular ML tasks.

Conclusion: SemPipes demonstrates the potential of LLMs in automating and enhancing tabular ML pipelines through semantic operators.

Abstract: Real-world machine learning on tabular data relies on complex data preparation pipelines for prediction, data integration, augmentation, and debugging. Designing these pipelines requires substantial domain expertise and engineering effort, motivating the question of how large language models (LLMs) can support tabular ML through code synthesis. We introduce SemPipes, a novel declarative programming model that integrates LLM-powered semantic data operators into tabular ML pipelines. Semantic operators specify data transformations in natural language while delegating execution to a runtime system. During training, SemPipes synthesizes custom operator implementations based on data characteristics, operator instructions, and pipeline context. This design enables the automatic optimization of data operations in a pipeline via LLM-based code synthesis guided by evolutionary search. We evaluate SemPipes across diverse tabular ML tasks and show that semantic operators substantially improve end-to-end predictive performance for both expert-designed and agent-generated pipelines, while reducing pipeline complexity. We implement SemPipes in Python and release it at https://github.com/deem-data/sempipes/tree/v1.

*Hao Chen,Jinghui Yuan,Hanmin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper questions the optimality of AdamW's weight decay due to radial oscillations and proposes AdamO, a decoupled optimizer for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdamW's weight decay causes conflicts ('Radial Tug-of-War'), degrading feature learning. The paper aims to decouple magnitude and direction updates.

Method: Introduces AdamO: separates norm control (handled by SGD-style update) and tangential learning (Adam's preconditioning), with curvature-adaptive steps and architecture-aware rules.

Result: AdamO outperforms AdamW in generalization and stability across vision and language tasks without extra constraints.

Conclusion: Decoupling radial and tangential dynamics improves optimizer performance effectively.

Abstract: Is the standard weight decay in AdamW truly optimal? Although AdamW decouples weight decay from adaptive gradient scaling, a fundamental conflict remains: the Radial Tug-of-War. In deep learning, gradients tend to increase parameter norms to expand effective capacity while steering directions to learn features, whereas weight decay indiscriminately suppresses norm growth. This push--pull interaction induces radial oscillations, injecting noise into Adam's second-moment estimates and potentially degrading delicate tangential feature learning. We argue that magnitude and direction play distinct roles and should be decoupled in optimizer dynamics. We propose Orthogonal Dynamics Decoupling and instantiate it as AdamO: an SGD-style update handles the one-dimensional norm control, while Adam's adaptive preconditioning is confined to the tangential subspace. AdamO further incorporates curvature-adaptive radial step sizing and architecture-aware rules and projections for scale-invariant layers and low-dimensional parameters. Experiments on vision and language tasks show that AdamO improves generalization and stability over AdamW without introducing additional complex constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical bandit algorithms struggle with hidden, time-varying states, leading to biased reward estimates and suboptimal action selection.

Method: Proposes state-model-free bandit algorithms using lagged contextual features and coordinated probing to implicitly track latent states and disambiguate rewards.

Result: Empirical results show superior performance over classical methods, with robust adaptation to non-stationary rewards.

Conclusion: The methods offer efficient, state-model-free solutions for sequential decision-making, with practical guidelines for real-world use.

Abstract: The multi-armed bandit problem is a core framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical algorithms often fail in environments with hidden, time-varying states that confound reward estimation and optimal action selection. We address key challenges arising from unobserved confounders, such as biased reward estimates and limited state information, by introducing a family of state-model-free bandit algorithms that leverage lagged contextual features and coordinated probing strategies. These implicitly track latent states and disambiguate state-dependent reward patterns. Our methods and their adaptive variants can learn optimal policies without explicit state modeling, combining computational efficiency with robust adaptation to non-stationary rewards. Empirical results across diverse settings demonstrate superior performance over classical approaches, and we provide practical recommendations for algorithm selection in real-world applications.

### [215] [Fairness Under Group-Conditional Prior Probability Shift: Invariance, Drift, and Target-Aware Post-Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05144)
*Amir Asiaee,Kaveh Aryan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies group-conditional prior probability shift (GPPS) in machine learning, showing that fairness criteria based on error rates remain stable under GPPS, while acceptance-rate criteria drift. It introduces methods to estimate target-domain fairness without labels and proposes TAP-GPPS for enforcing demographic parity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness drift in deployed machine learning systems when label prevalence changes across demographic groups.

Method: Analyzes GPPS, proves structural properties of fairness criteria, and introduces TAP-GPPS for label-free post-processing.

Result: Fairness criteria based on error rates are invariant under GPPS, while acceptance-rate criteria drift. TAP-GPPS effectively enforces demographic parity.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical and practical tools for maintaining fairness under GPPS, with validated experimental results.

Abstract: Machine learning systems are often trained and evaluated for fairness on historical data, yet deployed in environments where conditions have shifted. A particularly common form of shift occurs when the prevalence of positive outcomes changes differently across demographic groups--for example, when disease rates rise faster in one population than another, or when economic conditions affect loan default rates unequally. We study group-conditional prior probability shift (GPPS), where the label prevalence $P(Y=1\mid A=a)$ may change between training and deployment while the feature-generation process $P(X\mid Y,A)$ remains stable. Our analysis yields three main contributions. First, we prove a fundamental dichotomy: fairness criteria based on error rates (equalized odds) are structurally invariant under GPPS, while acceptance-rate criteria (demographic parity) can drift--and we prove this drift is unavoidable for non-trivial classifiers (shift-robust impossibility). Second, we show that target-domain risk and fairness metrics are identifiable without target labels: the invariance of ROC quantities under GPPS enables consistent estimation from source labels and unlabeled target data alone, with finite-sample guarantees. Third, we propose TAP-GPPS, a label-free post-processing algorithm that estimates prevalences from unlabeled data, corrects posteriors, and selects thresholds to satisfy demographic parity in the target domain. Experiments validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that TAP-GPPS achieves target fairness with minimal utility loss.

TL;DR: TIDE is a framework enhancing LLM inference via adaptive speculative decoding, reducing overhead and improving throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in speculative decoding due to dynamic workloads and system constraints.

Method: Temporal Incremental Draft Engine (TIDE) integrates draft adaptation into LLM inference, reusing hidden states for zero-overhead training and employing adaptive runtime control.

Result: Achieves 1.15x throughput improvement over static speculative decoding and reduces draft training time by 1.67x.

Conclusion: TIDE effectively optimizes LLM inference performance while minimizing overhead.

Abstract: Speculative decoding can substantially accelerate LLM inference, but realizing its benefits in practice is challenging due to evolving workloads and system-level constraints. We present TIDE (Temporal Incremental Draft Engine), a serving-engine-native framework that integrates online draft adaptation directly into high-performance LLM inference systems. TIDE reuses target model hidden states generated during inference as training signals, enabling zero-overhead draft adaptation without reloading the target model, and employs adaptive runtime control to activate speculation and training only when beneficial. TIDE exploits heterogeneous clusters by mapping decoupled inference and training to appropriate GPU classes. Across diverse real-world workloads, TIDE achieves up to 1.15x throughput improvement over static speculative decoding while reducing draft training time by 1.67x compared to approaches that recompute training signals.

*Wonjun Yi,Rismaya Kumar Mishra,Yong-Hwa Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-task learning (MTL) framework using crosstalk structures to jointly learn fault conditions and related physical variables, improving fault classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fault classification studies often ignore additional physical coupling information in signals. Leveraging this coupling can enhance fault detection.

Method: A crosstalk-based MTL framework is employed, building on a residual neural dimension reductor model. It tests on drone fault and motor compound fault datasets.

Result: The proposed model outperforms single-task models, multi-class models, and shared trunk MTL models in fault classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The crosstalk MTL approach effectively utilizes physical coupling information to improve fault classification across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Machine systems inherently generate signals in which fault conditions and various physical variables are physically coupled. Although many existing fault classification studies rely solely on direct fault labels, the aforementioned signals naturally embed additional information shaped by other physically coupled information. Herein, we leverage this coupling through a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that jointly learns fault conditions and the related physical variables. Among MTL architectures, crosstalk structures have distinct advantages because they allow for controlled information exchange between tasks through the cross-talk layer while preventing negative transfer, in contrast to shared trunk architectures that often mix incompatible features. We build on our previously introduced residual neural dimension reductor model, and extend its application to two benchmarks where physical coupling is prominent. The first benchmark is a drone fault dataset, in which machine type and maneuvering direction significantly alter the frequency components of measured signals even under the same nominal condition. By learning fault classification together with these physical attributes, the cross-talk architecture can better classify faults. The second benchmark dataset is the motor compound fault dataset. In this system, each fault component, inner race fault, outer race fault, misalignment, and unbalance is coupled to the other. For motor compound fault, we also test classification performance when we use single-channel data or multi-channel data as input to the classifier. Across both benchmarks, our residual neural dimension reductor, consistently outperformed single-task models, multi-class models that merge all label combinations, and shared trunk multi-task models.

### [218] [CoSA: Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05148)
*Songtao Wei,Yi Li,Bohan Zhang,Zhichun Guo,Ying Huang,Yuede Ji,Miao Yin,Guanpeng Li,Bingzhe Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoSA introduces a compressed sensing-based PEFT method, surpassing low-rank approaches for efficient and expressive LLM adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods rely on low-rank assumptions, potentially limiting expressivity. CoSA addresses this by leveraging compressed sensing theory.

Method: CoSA uses fixed random projection matrices and a learnable core to encode weight updates compactly, avoiding low-rank constraints. Theoretical analysis validates this approach.

Result: Evaluated on 10 diverse tasks with 5 models, CoSA consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods.

Conclusion: CoSA offers a principled, efficient, and expressive alternative to traditional low-rank PEFT methods.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a practical paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) without updating all parameters. Most existing approaches, such as LoRA and PiSSA, rely on low-rank decompositions of weight updates. However, the low-rank assumption may restrict expressivity, particularly in task-specific adaptation scenarios where singular values are distributed relatively uniformly. To address this limitation, we propose CoSA (Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation), a new PEFT method extended from compressed sensing theory. Instead of constraining weight updates to a low-rank subspace, CoSA expresses them through fixed random projection matrices and a compact learnable core. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of CoSA as a synthesis process, proving that weight updates can be compactly encoded into a low-dimensional space and mapped back through random projections. Extensive experimental results show that CoSA provides a principled perspective for efficient and expressive multi-scale model adaptation. Specifically, we evaluate CoSA on 10 diverse tasks, including natural language understanding and generation, employing 5 models of different scales from RoBERTa, Llama, and Qwen families. Across these settings, CoSA consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods.

*Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui,Eleni Triantafillou,David Krueger,Adrian Weller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues for treating capability control in foundation models as separate from alignment, proposing multi-layered control mechanisms across the model lifecycle to mitigate misuse and failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the potential misuse and failures of foundation models by distinguishing capability control from alignment.

Method: Organizes capability control mechanisms into three layers: data-based, learning-based, and system-based controls, advocating for defense-in-depth.

Result: Proposes layered control strategies to impose operational limits on model behaviors.

Conclusion: Advocates for complementary controls across the full stack, highlighting open challenges in achieving effective capability control.

Abstract: Foundation models are trained on broad data distributions, yielding generalist capabilities that enable many downstream applications but also expand the space of potential misuse and failures. This position paper argues that capability control -- imposing restrictions on permissible model behavior -- should be treated as a distinct goal from alignment. While alignment is often context and preference-driven, capability control aims to impose hard operational limits on permissible behaviors, including under adversarial elicitation. We organize capability control mechanisms across the model lifecycle into three layers: (i) data-based control of the training distribution, (ii) learning-based control via weight- or representation-level interventions, and (iii) system-based control via post-deployment guardrails over inputs, outputs, and actions. Because each layer has characteristic failure modes when used in isolation, we advocate for a defense-in-depth approach that composes complementary controls across the full stack. We further outline key open challenges in achieving such control, including the dual-use nature of knowledge and compositional generalization.

*Kevin Han,Yuhang Zhou,Mingze Gao,Gedi Zhou,Serena Li,Abhishek Kumar,Xiangjun Fan,Weiwei Li,Lizhu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EBPO improves reinforcement learning stability for LLMs by balancing local and global statistics, outperforming GRPO in benchmarks with better training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing stability issues like high variance and vanishing gradients in GRPO methods for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Method: Introduces Empirical Bayes Policy Optimization (EBPO), using a shrinkage estimator to balance local group stats with a global prior updated online.

Result: EBPO ensures lower MSE, bounded entropy decay, and non-vanishing signals, outperforming GRPO in benchmarks like AIME and OlympiadBench.

Conclusion: EBPO offers superior stability and performance gains, especially with small group sizes, benefiting from curriculum learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, dominant approaches like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical stability challenges: they suffer from high estimator variance under computational constraints (small group sizes) and vanishing gradient signals in saturated failure regimes where all responses yield identical zero rewards. To address this, we propose Empirical Bayes Policy Optimization (EBPO), a novel framework that regularizes local group-based baselines by borrowing strength from the policy's accumulated global statistics. Instead of estimating baselines in isolation, EBPO employs a shrinkage estimator that dynamically balances local group statistics with a global prior updated via Welford's online algorithm. Theoretically, we demonstrate that EBPO guarantees strictly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), bounded entropy decay, and non-vanishing penalty signals in failure scenarios compared to GRPO. Empirically, EBPO consistently outperforms GRPO and other established baselines across diverse benchmarks, including AIME and OlympiadBench. Notably, EBPO exhibits superior training stability, achieving high-performance gains even with small group sizes, and benefits significantly from difficulty-stratified curriculum learning.

TL;DR: The paper compares four deep learning models for daily hypoxia classification in the Gulf of Mexico, with the ST-Transformer achieving the highest accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing seasonal models lack fine-scale variability needed for responsive ecosystem management, prompting the need for improved daily hypoxia prediction.

Method: Four architectures (BiLSTM, Medformer, ST-Transformer, TCN) were trained on 2009-2020 hindcast data and tested on 2020-2024 data. Metrics included water column stratification and sediment oxygen consumption.

Result: All models performed well, with ST-Transformer leading (AUC-ROC: 0.982-0.992). McNemar's test confirmed significant differences in predictions.

Conclusion: The study provides a reproducible framework for real-time hypoxia prediction, aiding environmental and ocean modeling efforts.

Abstract: Coastal hypoxia, especially in the northern part of Gulf of Mexico, presents a persistent ecological and economic concern. Seasonal models offer coarse forecasts that miss the fine-scale variability needed for daily, responsive ecosystem management. We present study that compares four deep learning architectures for daily hypoxia classification: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Medformer (Medical Transformer), Spatio-Temporal Transformer (ST-Transformer), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). We trained our models with twelve years of daily hindcast data from 2009-2020 Our training data consists of 2009-2020 hindcast data from a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Similarly, we use hindcast data from 2020 through 2024 as a test data. We constructed classification models incorporating water column stratification, sediment oxygen consumption, and temperature-dependent decomposition rates. We evaluated each architectures using the same data preprocessing, input/output formulation, and validation protocols. Each model achieved high classification accuracy and strong discriminative ability with ST-Transformer achieving the highest performance across all metrics and tests periods (AUC-ROC: 0.982-0.992). We also employed McNemar's method to identify statistically significant differences in model predictions. Our contribution is a reproducible framework for operational real-time hypoxia prediction that can support broader efforts in the environmental and ocean modeling systems community and in ecosystem resilience.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Meta-Autointerp, a method combining Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and LLM-summarizers to interpret training dynamics in large-scale RL environments like Full-Press Diplomacy. It identifies various behaviors, validates 90% of SAE features, and finds some predictively useful hypotheses, despite limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding LLM behavior changes during training in complex RL environments.

Method: Apply pretrained SAEs and LLM-summarizers to analyze training runs, introducing Meta-Autointerp for grouping SAE features into interpretable hypotheses.

Result: Identified fine-grained and strategic behaviors, validated 90% of SAE features, and improved an untrained agent's score by +14.2%. However, some SAE/LLM features were not useful to humans.

Conclusion: SAEs and LLM-summarizers offer complementary insights into agent behavior, forming a foundation for future data-centric interpretability work.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained in complex Reinforcement Learning, multi-agent environments, making it difficult to understand how behavior changes over training. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently shown to be useful for data-centric interpretability. In this work, we analyze large-scale reinforcement learning training runs from the sophisticated environment of Full-Press Diplomacy by applying pretrained SAEs, alongside LLM-summarizer methods. We introduce Meta-Autointerp, a method for grouping SAE features into interpretable hypotheses about training dynamics. We discover fine-grained behaviors including role-playing patterns, degenerate outputs, language switching, alongside high-level strategic behaviors and environment-specific bugs. Through automated evaluation, we validate that 90% of discovered SAE Meta-Features are significant, and find a surprising reward hacking behavior. However, through two user studies, we find that even subjectively interesting and seemingly helpful SAE features may be worse than useless to humans, along with most LLM generated hypotheses. However, a subset of SAE-derived hypotheses are predictively useful for downstream tasks. We further provide validation by augmenting an untrained agent's system prompt, improving the score by +14.2%. Overall, we show that SAEs and LLM-summarizer provide complementary views into agent behavior, and together our framework forms a practical starting point for future data-centric interpretability work on ensuring trustworthy LLM behavior throughout training.

*Chun-Wun Cheng,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb,Angelica I. Aviles-Rivero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpectraKAN is a neural operator that adapts spectral convolution based on input, improving performance in solving PDEs by up to 49% over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spectral neural operators use static Fourier kernels, limiting their ability to capture multi-scale and anisotropic dynamics in PDEs.

Method: SpectraKAN conditions the spectral operator on the input by modulating a multi-scale Fourier trunk with a global representation extracted from spatio-temporal history.

Result: SpectraKAN outperforms baselines, reducing RMSE by up to 49%, especially in spatio-temporal prediction tasks.

Conclusion: SpectraKAN introduces an input-conditioned approach to spectral operators, achieving state-of-the-art performance while retaining the efficiency of spectral mixing.

Abstract: Spectral neural operators, particularly Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), are a powerful framework for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their efficient global mixing in the frequency domain. However, existing spectral operators rely on static Fourier kernels applied uniformly across inputs, limiting their ability to capture multi-scale, regime-dependent, and anisotropic dynamics governed by the global state of the system. We introduce SpectraKAN, a neural operator that conditions the spectral operator on the input itself, turning static spectral convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator. This is achieved by extracting a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history and using it to modulate a multi-scale Fourier trunk via single-query cross-attention, enabling the operator to adapt its behaviour while retaining the efficiency of spectral mixing. We provide theoretical justification showing that this modulation converges to a resolution-independent continuous operator under mesh refinement and KAN gives smooth, Lipschitz-controlled global modulation. Across diverse PDE benchmarks, SpectraKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing RMSE by up to 49% over strong baselines, with particularly large gains on challenging spatio-temporal prediction tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Double-P is a hierarchical sparse attention framework optimizing top-p accuracy, selection overhead, and sparse attention cost, achieving near-zero accuracy drop and significant speedups in LLM inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention over growing key-value caches is a bottleneck in LLMs, motivating sparse attention for scalable inference. Existing top-p methods inadequately optimize accuracy, overhead, and cost.

Method: Double-P uses hierarchical top-p selection: coarse-grained estimation at the cluster level, followed by adaptive token-level refinement.

Result: Double-P reduces attention computation overhead by 1.8x and achieves up to 1.3x decoding speedup with near-zero accuracy drop.

Conclusion: Double-P effectively balances accuracy and efficiency, outperforming fixed-budget sparse attention methods.

Abstract: As long-context inference becomes central to large language models (LLMs), attention over growing key-value caches emerges as a dominant decoding bottleneck, motivating sparse attention for scalable inference. Fixed-budget top-k sparse attention cannot adapt to heterogeneous attention distributions across heads and layers, whereas top-p sparse attention directly preserves attention mass and provides stronger accuracy guarantees. Existing top-p methods, however, fail to jointly optimize top-p accuracy, selection overhead, and sparse attention cost, which limits their overall efficiency. We present Double-P, a hierarchical sparse attention framework that optimizes all three stages. Double-P first performs coarse-grained top-p estimation at the cluster level using size-weighted centroids, then adaptively refines computation through a second top-p stage that allocates token-level attention only when needed. Across long-context benchmarks, Double-P consistently achieves near-zero accuracy drop, reducing attention computation overhead by up to 1.8x and delivers up to 1.3x end-to-end decoding speedup over state-of-the-art fixed-budget sparse attention methods.

*Changhoon Song,Teng Yuan Chang,Youngjoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Summarizes the development of exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework for accurate precipitation nowcasting, addressing challenges in forecasting extreme weather events with a balanced dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate extreme weather forecasting is critical for disaster mitigation, but existing models are either computationally expensive or biased. Current datasets are also skewed, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes exPreCast, integrating local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor. Introduces a balanced KMA dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks (SEVIR, MeteoNet) and the KMA dataset, providing reliable forecasts for both normal and extreme rainfall.

Conclusion: exPreCast offers an efficient solution for accurate nowcasting across diverse rainfall conditions, leveraging a balanced dataset.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall or storms is critical for risk management and disaster mitigation. Although high-resolution radar observations have spurred extensive research on nowcasting models, precipitation nowcasting remains particularly challenging due to pronounced spatial locality, intricate fine-scale rainfall structures, and variability in forecasting horizons. While recent diffusion-based generative ensembles show promising results, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, deterministic models are computationally efficient but remain biased toward normal rainfall. Furthermore, the benchmark datasets commonly used in prior studies are themselves skewed--either dominated by ordinary rainfall events or restricted to extreme rainfall episodes--thereby hindering general applicability in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework for generating finely detailed radar forecasts, and introduce a newly constructed balanced radar dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which encompasses both ordinary precipitation and extreme events. Our model integrates local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor to flexibly adjust forecasting horizons. Experiments on established benchmarks (SEVIR and MeteoNet) as well as on the balanced KMA dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering accurate and reliable nowcasts across both normal and extreme rainfall regimes.

*Jinjin Chi,Taoping Liu,Mengtao Yin,Ximing Li,Yongcheng Jing,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a flow matching-based framework for disentangled representation learning, using factor-conditioned flows and orthogonality regularization for semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods lack strong semantic alignment despite encouraging factor independence.

Method: Uses flow matching to learn factor-conditioned flows in a compact latent space, introducing a non-overlap regularizer for semantic alignment.

Result: Shows consistent improvements in disentanglement scores, controllability, and sample fidelity across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework outperforms baselines by better enforcing semantic alignment and reducing cross-factor interference.

Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to capture the underlying explanatory factors of observed data, enabling a principled understanding of the data-generating process. Recent advances in generative modeling have introduced new paradigms for learning such representations. However, existing diffusion-based methods encourage factor independence via inductive biases, yet frequently lack strong semantic alignment. In this work, we propose a flow matching-based framework for disentangled representation learning, which casts disentanglement as learning factor-conditioned flows in a compact latent space. To enforce explicit semantic alignment, we introduce a non-overlap (orthogonality) regularizer that suppresses cross-factor interference and reduces information leakage between factors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over representative baselines, yielding higher disentanglement scores as well as improved controllability and sample fidelity.

*Chao Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves the privacy guarantees for differentially private prediction in streaming settings, reducing the dependency on query count from polynomial to polylogarithmic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance privacy-preserving prediction algorithms by minimizing the labeled sample size required for differentially private responses to queries.

Method: Introduces private predictors for oblivious and adaptive online adversaries, leveraging concept class properties and streaming techniques.

Result: For oblivious adversaries, labeled examples scale as $	ilde{O}(VC(	ext{C})^{3.5}	ext{log}^{3.5}T)$; for adaptive adversaries evaluating halfspaces, labeled examples scale as $	ilde{O}(d^{5.5}	ext{log}T)$.

Conclusion: The method significantly improves the efficiency of differentially private prediction by reducing sample size dependencies.

Abstract: We study differentially private prediction introduced by Dwork and Feldman (COLT 2018): an algorithm receives one labeled sample set $S$ and then answers a stream of unlabeled queries while the output transcript remains $(\varepsilon,δ)$-differentially private with respect to $S$. Standard composition yields a $\sqrt{T}$ dependence for $T$ queries.
  We show that this dependence can be reduced to polylogarithmic in $T$ in streaming settings. For an oblivious online adversary and any concept class $\mathcal{C}$, we give a private predictor that answers $T$ queries with $|S|= \tilde{O}(VC(\mathcal{C})^{3.5}\log^{3.5}T)$ labeled examples. For an adaptive online adversary and halfspaces over $\mathbb{R}^d$, we obtain $|S|=\tilde{O}\left(d^{5.5}\log T\right)$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zero-Sum Linear Attention (ZeroS) improves linear attention's performance by addressing limitations like additive blending and uniform weight bias, matching softmax attention benchmarks while maintaining O(N) complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the underperformance of linear attention methods compared to softmax attention due to restrictions like convex combinations and uniform weight bias.

Method: Proposes ZeroS by removing the constant zero-order term and reweighting zero-sum softmax residuals, enabling contrastive operations and stable weights.

Result: ZeroS matches or exceeds softmax attention in sequence modeling benchmarks while retaining O(N) complexity.

Conclusion: ZeroS expands the representable functions of linear attention and achieves competitive performance without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: Linear attention methods offer Transformers $O(N)$ complexity but typically underperform standard softmax attention. We identify two fundamental limitations affecting these approaches: the restriction to convex combinations that only permits additive information blending, and uniform accumulated weight bias that dilutes attention in long contexts. We propose Zero-Sum Linear Attention (ZeroS), which addresses these limitations by removing the constant zero-order term $1/t$ and reweighting the remaining zero-sum softmax residuals. This modification creates mathematically stable weights, enabling both positive and negative values and allowing a single attention layer to perform contrastive operations. While maintaining $O(N)$ complexity, ZeroS theoretically expands the set of representable functions compared to convex combinations. Empirically, it matches or exceeds standard softmax attention across various sequence modeling benchmarks.

*Chunyu Wei,Siyuan He,Yu Wang,Yueguo Chen,Yunhai Wang,Bing Bai,Yidong Zhang,Yong Xie,Shunming Zhang,Fei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework combining dynamic graph modeling and balanced anomaly synthesis to tackle challenges like static models and class imbalance in graph anomaly detection (GAD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GAD methods struggle with static models unsuitable for dynamic networks and extreme class imbalance leading to biased models. The paper addresses these interdependent issues.

Method: The framework includes a discrete ego-graph diffusion model for synthetic anomaly generation and a curriculum anomaly augmentation mechanism to dynamically adjust synthetic data during training.

Result: Experiments on five datasets confirm the framework's effectiveness in improving anomaly detection and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed data-centric framework successfully integrates dynamic graph modeling and anomaly synthesis, overcoming limitations of existing GAD methods.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is crucial in applications like fraud detection and cybersecurity. Despite recent advancements using graph neural networks (GNNs), two major challenges persist. At the model level, most methods adopt a transductive learning paradigm, which assumes static graph structures, making them unsuitable for dynamic, evolving networks. At the data level, the extreme class imbalance, where anomalous nodes are rare, leads to biased models that fail to generalize to unseen anomalies. These challenges are interdependent: static transductive frameworks limit effective data augmentation, while imbalance exacerbates model distortion in inductive learning settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel data-centric framework that integrates dynamic graph modeling with balanced anomaly synthesis. Our framework features: (1) a discrete ego-graph diffusion model, which captures the local topology of anomalies to generate ego-graphs aligned with anomalous structural distribution, and (2) a curriculum anomaly augmentation mechanism, which dynamically adjusts synthetic data generation during training, focusing on underrepresented anomaly patterns to improve detection and generalization. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that the effectiveness of our framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CDAS introduces a novel model-steering method using distributed interchange interventions and weak-supervised distribution matching, offering faithful and stable control without relying on preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current steering methods, influenced by fine-tuning objectives, often overfit or produce unnatural outputs. The hypothesis is that effective steering requires identifying internal model mechanisms, not enforcing external preferences.

Method: Building on distributed alignment search (DAS), CDAS uses distributed interchange interventions (DII) with a new distribution matching objective. It avoids probability maximization and derives steering factors from data.

Result: CDAS does not always outperform preference-optimization methods but scales better. It successfully overrides refusal behaviors and neutralizes backdoors while maintaining general model utility.

Conclusion: CDAS is a robust and complementary approach to model steering, particularly effective for safety-related tasks and scalable improvements.

Abstract: Intervention-based model steering offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative to prompting and fine-tuning. However, by adapting strong optimization objectives from fine-tuning, current methods are susceptible to overfitting and often underperform, sometimes generating unnatural outputs. We hypothesize that this is because effective steering requires the faithful identification of internal model mechanisms, not the enforcement of external preferences. To this end, we build on the principles of distributed alignment search (DAS), the standard for causal variable localization, to propose a new steering method: Concept DAS (CDAS). While we adopt the core mechanism of DAS, distributed interchange intervention (DII), we introduce a novel distribution matching objective tailored for the steering task by aligning intervened output distributions with counterfactual distributions. CDAS differs from prior work in two main ways: first, it learns interventions via weak-supervised distribution matching rather than probability maximization; second, it uses DIIs that naturally enable bi-directional steering and allow steering factors to be derived from data, reducing the effort required for hyperparameter tuning and resulting in more faithful and stable control. On AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark, we show that CDAS does not always outperform preference-optimization methods but may benefit more from increased model scale. In two safety-related case studies, overriding refusal behaviors of safety-aligned models and neutralizing a chain-of-thought backdoor, CDAS achieves systematic steering while maintaining general model utility. These results indicate that CDAS is complementary to preference-optimization approaches and conditionally constitutes a robust approach to intervention-based model steering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers suffer from high compute and memory costs. Existing pruning methods require retraining or multi-stage optimization, limiting post-training deployment. CORP aims to address these limitations.

Method: CORP formulates pruning as a representation recovery problem. It models removed activations and attention logits as affine functions of retained components, deriving closed-form ridge regression solutions to minimize representation error.

Result: CORP retains 82.8% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with DeiT-Huge after pruning 50% of MLP and attention structures. It completes pruning in under 20 minutes on a single GPU.

Conclusion: CORP is an efficient and accurate one-shot structured pruning framework for Vision Transformers, enabling post-training deployment without retraining or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Vision Transformers achieve strong accuracy but incur high compute and memory cost. Structured pruning can reduce inference cost, but most methods rely on retraining or multi-stage optimization. These requirements limit post-training deployment. We propose \textbf{CORP}, a closed-form one-shot structured pruning framework for Vision Transformers. CORP removes entire MLP hidden dimensions and attention substructures without labels, gradients, or fine-tuning. It operates under strict post-training constraints using only a small unlabeled calibration set. CORP formulates structured pruning as a representation recovery problem. It models removed activations and attention logits as affine functions of retained components and derives closed-form ridge regression solutions that fold compensation into model weights. This minimizes expected representation error under the calibration distribution. Experiments on ImageNet with DeiT models show strong redundancy in MLP and attention representations. Without compensation, one-shot structured pruning causes severe accuracy degradation. With CORP, models preserve accuracy under aggressive sparsity. On DeiT-Huge, CORP retains 82.8\% Top-1 accuracy after pruning 50\% of both MLP and attention structures. CORP completes pruning in under 20 minutes on a single GPU and delivers substantial real-world efficiency gains.

*David Alejandro Trejo Pizzo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hybrid Gated Flow (HGF), a dual-stream architecture combining 1.58-bit quantization with FP16 correction, reducing perplexity degradation by 55% while adding minimal memory overhead. It also explores quantization as structural regularization and scales successfully to larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the 'Memory Wall' bottleneck in deploying LLMs on edge devices by balancing memory efficiency and model performance using hybrid quantization.

Method: Proposes HGF, coupling a 1.58-bit ternary backbone with a learnable FP16 correction path controlled by adaptive gates, tested on TinyStories and scaled to larger datasets.

Result: HGF achieves a 55% recovery of the quality gap between ternary quantization and FP16 baselines with only ~12-15% memory overhead. It also shows improved training stability.

Conclusion: HGF effectively mitigates the trade-off between memory efficiency and model performance, demonstrating scalability and robustness in larger models.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" -- a hardware limitation where memory bandwidth, not compute, becomes the bottleneck. Recent 1.58-bit quantization techniques (e.g., BitNet b1.58) dramatically reduce memory footprint but typically incur a perplexity degradation of 20-25% compared to FP16 baselines. In this work, we introduce Hybrid Gated Flow (HGF), a dual-stream architecture that couples a 1.58-bit ternary backbone with a learnable, low-rank FP16 correction path controlled by adaptive gates.
  Through extensive experiments on the TinyStories dataset across two training regimes (2500 and 3500 steps), we demonstrate that HGF 5.4 achieves a validation loss of 0.9306 compared to BitNet's 1.0294, recovering approximately 55% of the quality gap between pure ternary quantization and the FP16 baseline (0.8490). This recovery is achieved with only ~12-15% memory overhead beyond the ternary backbone.
  Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence for an emergent phenomenon: quantization as structural regularization. While a full-precision differential attention baseline (Diff_Only) exhibited training instability with validation loss exceeding 1.68, the ternary-anchored HGF maintained robust convergence throughout training. Finally, we report preliminary results extending this architecture to 1.2B and 3B parameter models trained on SlimPajama and FineWeb-Edu. These larger-scale experiments confirm that the architectural stability and quality recovery observed in small-scale proxies scale linearly to production-grade language modeling regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TADS is a task-aware data selection framework for multimodal pre-training that improves data efficiency and performance by integrating quality, relevance, and diversity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raw web-crawled datasets are noisy and inefficient for training large-scale multimodal models, and existing selection methods lack task-awareness.

Method: TADS uses a learnable value function combining intrinsic quality, task relevance, and distributional diversity, refined via meta-learning.

Result: TADS achieves better zero-shot performance across benchmarks using only 36% of the data, outperforming baselines by 1.0%.

Conclusion: TADS effectively enhances data efficiency and performance in multimodal pre-training.

Abstract: Large-scale multimodal pre-trained models like CLIP rely heavily on high-quality training data, yet raw web-crawled datasets are often noisy, misaligned, and redundant, leading to inefficient training and suboptimal generalization. Existing data selection methods are either heuristic-based, suffering from bias and limited diversity, or data-driven but task-agnostic, failing to optimize for multi-task scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce TADS (Task-Aware Data Selection), a novel framework for multi-task multimodal pre-training that integrates Intrinsic Quality, Task Relevance, and Distributional Diversity into a learnable value function. TADS employs a comprehensive quality assessment system with unimodal and cross-modal operators, quantifies task relevance via interpretable similarity vectors, and optimizes diversity through cluster-based weighting. A feedback-driven meta-learning mechanism adaptively refines the selection strategy based on proxy model performance across multiple downstream tasks. Experiments on CC12M demonstrate that TADS achieves superior zero-shot performance on benchmarks like ImageNet, CIFAR-100, MS-COCO, and Flickr30K, using only 36% of the data while outperforming baselines by an average of 1.0%. This highlights that TADS significantly enhances data efficiency by curating a high-utility subset that yields a much higher performance ceiling within the same computational constraints.

*Pengyi Li,Elizaveta Goncharova,Andrey Kuznetsov,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR enhances LLM reasoning but suffers from low-entropy policies. The proposed ARM method balances reward signals, improving diversity and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard methods like GRPO cause mode collapse in LLMs by favoring high-likelihood paths, reducing output diversity. A solution is needed to equilibrate confidence across correct responses.

Method: Introduces Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM), using Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence to adjust reward signals and balance gradient updates.

Result: Empirical tests show ARM increases diversity and entropy without sacrificing accuracy, outperforming GRPO by 5.7% in Pass@1 and 13.9% in Pass@32.

Conclusion: ARM successfully mitigates entropy collapse, achieving a better trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an indispensable paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard policy optimization methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often converge to low-entropy policies, leading to severe mode collapse and limited output diversity. We analyze this issue from the perspective of sampling probability dynamics, identifying that the standard objective disproportionately reinforces the highest-likelihood paths, thereby suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains. To address this, we propose a novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) designed to equilibrate the confidence levels across all correct responses. By incorporating Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into the advantage estimation, our method dynamically reshapes the reward signal to attenuate the gradient updates of over-confident reasoning paths, while redistributing probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy, effectively achieving a superior trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks. Empirical results on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models across mathematical and coding benchmarks show that ProGRPO significantly mitigates entropy collapse. Specifically, on Qwen2.5-7B, our method outperforms GRPO by 5.7% in Pass@1 and, notably, by 13.9% in Pass@32, highlighting its superior capability in generating diverse correct reasoning paths.

*Minhuan Li,Jiequn Han,Pilar Cossio,Luhuan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EmbedOpt improves biomolecular conformation generation by optimizing experimental likelihoods in the conditional embedding space, outperforming coordinate-based posterior sampling in robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Posterior sampling struggles when targets lie in low-density prior regions, requiring brittle likelihood weighting. EmbedOpt addresses this by leveraging the conditional embedding space.

Method: EmbedOpt steers diffusion models by optimizing experimental likelihoods in the conditional embedding space, which encodes sequence and coevolutionary signals.

Result: EmbedOpt outperforms posterior sampling in cryo-EM map fitting, matches it in distance constraints, and is more robust across hyperparameters.

Conclusion: EmbedOpt offers a smoother, more efficient approach for biomolecular conformation generation, reducing diffusion steps and improving performance.

Abstract: In many biophysical inverse problems, the goal is to generate biomolecular conformations that are both physically plausible and consistent with experimental measurements. As recent sequence-to-structure diffusion models provide powerful data-driven priors, posterior sampling has emerged as a popular framework by guiding atomic coordinates to target conformations using experimental likelihoods. However, when the target lies in a low-density region of the prior, posterior sampling requires aggressive and brittle weighting of the likelihood guidance. Motivated by this limitation, we propose EmbedOpt, an alternative inference-time approach for steering diffusion models to optimize experimental likelihoods in the conditional embedding space. As this space encodes rich sequence and coevolutionary signals, optimizing over it effectively shifts the diffusion prior to align with experimental constraints. We validate EmbedOpt on two benchmarks simulating cryo-electron microscopy map fitting and experimental distance constraints. We show that EmbedOpt outperforms the coordinate-based posterior sampling method in map fitting tasks, matches performance on distance constraint tasks, and exhibits superior engineering robustness across hyperparameters spanning two orders of magnitude. Moreover, its smooth optimization behavior enables a significant reduction in the number of diffusion steps required for inference, leading to better efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HealthMamba is a framework improving healthcare facility visit prediction accuracy and reliability by integrating spatiotemporal dependencies and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models overlook spatial dependencies and reliability during emergencies, prompting the need for an advanced solution.

Method: HealthMamba includes a spatiotemporal encoder, GraphMamba for hierarchical modeling, and uncertainty quantification mechanisms.

Result: It achieves 6.0% better accuracy and 3.5% improved uncertainty quantification versus baselines.

Conclusion: HealthMamba outperforms existing methods by addressing spatiotemporal dependencies and uncertainty, aiding resource allocation.

Abstract: Healthcare facility visit prediction is essential for optimizing healthcare resource allocation and informing public health policy. Despite advanced machine learning methods being employed for better prediction performance, existing works usually formulate this task as a time-series forecasting problem without considering the intrinsic spatial dependencies of different types of healthcare facilities, and they also fail to provide reliable predictions under abnormal situations such as public emergencies. To advance existing research, we propose HealthMamba, an uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal framework for accurate and reliable healthcare facility visit prediction. HealthMamba comprises three key components: (i) a Unified Spatiotemporal Context Encoder that fuses heterogeneous static and dynamic information, (ii) a novel Graph State Space Model called GraphMamba for hierarchical spatiotemporal modeling, and (iii) a comprehensive uncertainty quantification module integrating three uncertainty quantification mechanisms for reliable prediction. We evaluate HealthMamba on four large-scale real-world datasets from California, New York, Texas, and Florida. Results show HealthMamba achieves around 6.0% improvement in prediction accuracy and 3.5% improvement in uncertainty quantification over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Feng Zhu,Robert W. Heath,Aritra Mitra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified convergence analysis for stochastic variance-reduced algorithms (SAG, SAGA, IAG) in large-scale machine learning, offering simpler proofs and improved rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analyses for SAG, SAGA, and IAG are disparate and complex, often tailored to specific methods. The paper aims to unify and simplify these analyses.

Method: The authors use concentration tools to bound stochastic delays and design a novel Lyapunov function, enabling a modular and concise proof.

Result: The unified analysis provides high-probability bounds for SAG and SAGA, extends to non-convex objectives, and improves prior rates for IAG.

Conclusion: The paper successfully unifies the analysis of SAG, SAGA, and IAG, offering simpler proofs and better performance guarantees.

Abstract: Stochastic variance-reduced algorithms such as Stochastic Average Gradient (SAG) and SAGA, and their deterministic counterparts like the Incremental Aggregated Gradient (IAG) method, have been extensively studied in large-scale machine learning. Despite their popularity, existing analyses for these algorithms are disparate, relying on different proof techniques tailored to each method. Furthermore, the original proof of SAG is known to be notoriously involved, requiring computer-aided analysis. Focusing on finite-sum optimization with smooth and strongly convex objective functions, our main contribution is to develop a single unified convergence analysis that applies to all three algorithms: SAG, SAGA, and IAG. Our analysis features two key steps: (i) establishing a bound on delays due to stochastic sub-sampling using simple concentration tools, and (ii) carefully designing a novel Lyapunov function that accounts for such delays. The resulting proof is short and modular, providing the first high-probability bounds for SAG and SAGA that can be seamlessly extended to non-convex objectives and Markov sampling. As an immediate byproduct of our new analysis technique, we obtain the best known rates for the IAG algorithm, significantly improving upon prior bounds.

*Chengxiao Wang,Haoze Wu,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces robust neural Lyapunov barrier certificates for verifying safety and stability in deep RL controllers under perturbations, outperforming baselines in certified robustness and empirical success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for verifying RL controllers lack robustness under real-world dynamics uncertainties, motivating the development of robust neural Lyapunov barrier certificates.

Method: The paper defines robust Lyapunov barrier functions with Lipschitz-based sufficient conditions and enforces these via adversarial training, Lipschitz neighborhood bound, and global Lipschitz regularization.

Result: The approach improves certified robustness bounds (up to 4.6 times) and empirical success rates (up to 2.4 times) in tested environments like Inverted Pendulum and 2D Docking.

Conclusion: Robust neural certificates effectively enhance safe RL performance under dynamic perturbations, validated through significant improvements over baselines.

Abstract: Neural Lyapunov and barrier certificates have recently been used as powerful tools for verifying the safety and stability properties of deep reinforcement learning (RL) controllers. However, existing methods offer guarantees only under fixed ideal unperturbed dynamics, limiting their reliability in real-world applications where dynamics may deviate due to uncertainties. In this work, we study the problem of synthesizing \emph{robust neural Lyapunov barrier certificates} that maintain their guarantees under perturbations in system dynamics. We formally define a robust Lyapunov barrier function and specify sufficient conditions based on Lipschitz continuity that ensure robustness against bounded perturbations. We propose practical training objectives that enforce these conditions via adversarial training, Lipschitz neighborhood bound, and global Lipschitz regularization. We validate our approach in two practically relevant environments, Inverted Pendulum and 2D Docking. The former is a widely studied benchmark, while the latter is a safety-critical task in autonomous systems. We show that our methods significantly improve both certified robustness bounds (up to $4.6$ times) and empirical success rates under strong perturbations (up to $2.4$ times) compared to the baseline. Our results demonstrate effectiveness of training robust neural certificates for safe RL under perturbations in dynamics.

*Yayuan Li,Ze Peng,Jian Zhang,Jintao Guo,Yue Duan,Yinghuan Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Model merging combines fine-tuned models but suffers from over-counting shared knowledge. SVC, a training-free method, addresses this by calibrating singular values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods focus on resolving task conflicts but neglect over-counting shared spectral directions, leading to biased models.

Method: SVC quantifies subspace overlap and rescales inflated singular values without training or data.

Result: SVC improves merging baselines, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and boosts Task Arithmetic by 13.0%.

Conclusion: SVC effectively balances the spectrum in merged models, enhancing performance across vision and language tasks.

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned models into a single model by adding their weight updates, providing a lightweight alternative to retraining. Existing methods primarily target resolving conflicts between task updates, leaving the failure mode of over-counting shared knowledge unaddressed. We show that when tasks share aligned spectral directions (i.e., overlapping singular vectors), a simple linear combination repeatedly accumulates these directions, inflating the singular values and biasing the merged model toward shared subspaces. To mitigate this issue, we propose Singular Value Calibration (SVC), a training-free and data-free post-processing method that quantifies subspace overlap and rescales inflated singular values to restore a balanced spectrum. Across vision and language benchmarks, SVC consistently improves strong merging baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by modifying only the singular values, SVC improves the performance of Task Arithmetic by 13.0%. Code is available at: https://github.com/lyymuwu/SVC.

*Yinan Huang,Hans Hao-Hsun Hsu,Junran Wang,Bo Dai,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sequential Flow Matching, a framework for real-time streaming prediction using Bayesian filtering to accelerate sampling and reduce latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and latency issues in deploying diffusion and flow-matching models for real-time sequential prediction.

Method: Proposes Sequential Flow Matching, leveraging Bayesian filtering to recursively update predictive distributions and initialize sampling from previous posteriors.

Result: Competitive performance with full-step diffusion models while requiring fewer sampling steps, enabling faster inference.

Conclusion: Bayesian filtering offers a principled approach to enhance efficiency in real-time deployment of flow-based models.

Abstract: Sequential prediction from streaming observations is a fundamental problem in stochastic dynamical systems, where inherent uncertainty often leads to multiple plausible futures. While diffusion and flow-matching models are capable of modeling complex, multi-modal trajectories, their deployment in real-time streaming environments typically relies on repeated sampling from a non-informative initial distribution, incurring substantial inference latency and potential system backlogs. In this work, we introduce Sequential Flow Matching, a principled framework grounded in Bayesian filtering. By treating streaming inference as learning a probability flow that transports the predictive distribution from one time step to the next, our approach naturally aligns with the recursive structure of Bayesian belief updates. We provide theoretical justification that initializing generation from the previous posterior offers a principled warm start that can accelerate sampling compared to naïve re-sampling. Across a wide range of forecasting, decision-making and state estimation tasks, our method achieves performance competitive with full-step diffusion while requiring only one or very few sampling steps, therefore with faster sampling. It suggests that framing sequential inference via Bayesian filtering provides a new and principled perspective towards efficient real-time deployment of flow-based models.

TL;DR: FlowSteer introduces a nonlinear steering method using Flow Matching to improve efficiency and precision in Large Reasoning Models, outperforming linear methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of verbose outputs in Large Reasoning Models by moving beyond restrictive linear representation hypotheses.

Method: FlowSteer learns a nonlinear transformation via Flow Matching as a velocity field for precise, input-dependent control over reasoning.

Result: FlowSteer achieves more compact reasoning and better token efficiency across benchmarks compared to linear baselines.

Conclusion: Generative techniques modeling full distributional transport offer a superior foundation for controlling LRMs.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is often hampered by overly verbose outputs. Prior steering methods attempt to address this issue by applying a single, global vector to hidden representations -- an approach grounded in the restrictive linear representation hypothesis. In this work, we introduce FlowSteer, a nonlinear steering method that goes beyond uniform linear shifts by learning a complete transformation between the distributions associated with verbose and concise reasoning. This transformation is learned via Flow Matching as a velocity field, enabling precise, input-dependent control over the model's reasoning process. By aligning steered representations with the distribution of concise-reasoning activations, FlowSteer yields more compact reasoning than the linear shifts. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, FlowSteer demonstrates strong task performance and token efficiency compared to leading inference-time baselines. Our work demonstrates that modeling the full distributional transport with generative techniques offers a more effective and principled foundation for controlling LRMs.

### [242] [GAS: Enhancing Reward-Cost Balance of Generative Model-assisted Offline Safe RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05323)
*Zifan Liu,Xinran Li,Shibo Chen,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GAS enhances offline safe reinforcement learning by improving trajectory stitching and balancing reward-cost tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GM-assisted methods struggle with stitching suboptimal trajectories and balancing conflicting reward and cost targets.

Method: GAS augments and relabels datasets, introduces goal functions for reward-cost estimation, and reshapes data distribution.

Result: GAS outperforms existing methods in balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction.

Conclusion: GAS effectively addresses key challenges in OSRL, demonstrating robust performance.

Abstract: Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL) aims to learn a policy to achieve high performance in sequential decision-making while satisfying constraints, using only pre-collected datasets. Recent works, inspired by the strong capabilities of Generative Models (GMs), reformulate decision-making in OSRL as a conditional generative process, where GMs generate desirable actions conditioned on predefined reward and cost values. However, GM-assisted methods face two major challenges in OSRL: (1) lacking the ability to "stitch" optimal transitions from suboptimal trajectories within the dataset, and (2) struggling to balance reward targets with cost targets, particularly when they are conflict. To address these issues, we propose Goal-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel algorithm designed to enhance stitching capabilities while effectively balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction. To enhance the stitching ability, GAS first augments and relabels the dataset at the transition level, enabling the construction of high-quality trajectories from suboptimal ones. GAS also introduces novel goal functions, which estimate the optimal achievable reward and cost goals from the dataset. These goal functions, trained using expectile regression on the relabeled and augmented dataset, allow GAS to accommodate a broader range of reward-cost return pairs and achieve a better tradeoff between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to human-specified values. The estimated goals then guide policy training, ensuring robust performance under constrained settings. Furthermore, to improve training stability and efficiency, we reshape the dataset to achieve a more uniform reward-cost return distribution. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of GAS, demonstrating superior performance in balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an information-theoretic framework to analyze pool-based active learning (AL) as a noisy lossy compression problem, deriving theoretical limits for label complexity and generalization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish theoretical limits for pool-based AL by reformulating it as a noisy lossy compression problem, bridging gaps in existing analyses.

Method: Proposes mapping pool observations to noisy symbols, data selection to compression, and learning to decoding, then applies finite blocklength analysis.

Result: Derived information-theoretic lower bounds on label complexity and generalization error, incorporating overfitting and inductive bias discrepancies.

Conclusion: Provides a new theoretical perspective on pool-based AL, linking it to information-theoretic bounds and stability theory.

Abstract: This paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the theoretical limits of pool-based active learning (AL), in which a subset of instances is selectively labeled. The proposed framework reformulates pool-based AL as a noisy lossy compression problem by mapping pool observations to noisy symbol observations, data selection to compression, and learning to decoding. This correspondence enables a unified information-theoretic analysis of data selection and learning in pool-based AL. Applying finite blocklength analysis of noisy lossy compression, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on label complexity and generalization error that serve as theoretical limits for a given learning algorithm under its associated optimal data selection strategy. Specifically, our bounds include terms that reflect overfitting induced by the learning algorithm and the discrepancy between its inductive bias and the target task, and are closely related to established information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, which have not been previously applied to the analysis of pool-based AL. These properties yield a new theoretical perspective on pool-based AL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REAL addresses Gradient Misassignment and Domination in RLVR methods by treating rewards as labels, improving policy updates and outperforming GRPO variants like DAPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods suffer from inefficient policy updates due to Gradient Misassignment in Positives and Gradient Domination in Negatives.

Method: Introduces REAL, a framework that treats verifiable rewards as categorical labels, reformulating policy optimization as classification and using anchor logits.

Result: REAL improves training stability and outperforms GRPO variants, achieving 6.7% higher Pass@1 on a 1.5B model and scaling gains to larger models.

Conclusion: REAL effectively mitigates gradient mismatches, offering stable and superior performance in complex reasoning tasks compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has recently advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models in complex reasoning tasks by providing explicit rule-based supervision. Among RLVR methods, GRPO and its variants have achieved strong empirical performance. Despite their success, we identify that they suffer from Gradient Misassignment in Positives and Gradient Domination in Negatives, which lead to inefficient and suboptimal policy updates. To address these issues, we propose Rewards as Labels (REAL), a novel framework that revisits verifiable rewards as categorical labels rather than scalar weights, thereby reformulating policy optimization as a classification problem. Building on this, we further introduce anchor logits to enhance policy learning. Our analysis reveals that REAL induces a monotonic and bounded gradient weighting, enabling balanced gradient allocation across rollouts and effectively mitigating the identified mismatches. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that REAL improves training stability and consistently outperforms GRPO and strong variants such as DAPO. On the 1.5B model, REAL improves average Pass@1 over DAPO by 6.7%. These gains further scale to 7B model, REAL continues to outperform DAPO and GSPO by 6.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Notably, even with a vanilla binary cross-entropy, REAL remains stable and exceeds DAPO by 4.5% on average.

*Edward Berman,Luisa Li,Jung Yeon Park,Robin Walters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the smoothing effects of GNNs in PDE modeling, showing that unitary convolutions can hinder performance in physical systems. It introduces relaxed unitary convolutions for better balance and extends them to meshes, outperforming other methods like mesh-aware transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) face oversmoothing issues when solving PDEs on surfaces, and unitary convolutions, while preserving smoothness, may overconstrain systems where smoothness naturally increases (e.g., diffusion). The study aims to address this imbalance.

Method: The authors systematically analyze GNN smoothing effects, prove the limitations of unitary convolutions for dynamics modeling, and propose relaxed unitary convolutions. They generalize these concepts from graphs to meshes.

Result: Experiments on PDEs (heat and wave equations) and weather forecasting demonstrate that relaxed unitary convolutions outperform mesh-aware transformers and equivariant neural networks.

Conclusion: Relaxed unitary convolutions effectively balance smoothness preservation with natural smoothing requirements, offering superior performance for PDE modeling on surfaces compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Modern neural networks have shown promise for solving partial differential equations over surfaces, often by discretizing the surface as a mesh and learning with a mesh-aware graph neural network. However, graph neural networks suffer from oversmoothing, where a node's features become increasingly similar to those of its neighbors. Unitary graph convolutions, which are mathematically constrained to preserve smoothness, have been proposed to address this issue. Despite this, in many physical systems, such as diffusion processes, smoothness naturally increases and unitarity may be overconstraining. In this paper, we systematically study the smoothing effects of different GNNs for dynamics modeling and prove that unitary convolutions hurt performance for such tasks. We propose relaxed unitary convolutions that balance smoothness preservation with the natural smoothing required for physical systems. We also generalize unitary and relaxed unitary convolutions from graphs to meshes. In experiments on PDEs such as the heat and wave equations over complex meshes and on weather forecasting, we find that our method outperforms several strong baselines, including mesh-aware transformers and equivariant neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian framework to adaptively determine neighborhood scopes in GNNs, improving performance by modeling message-passing as a stochastic beta process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for determining neighborhood scopes in GNNs are inefficient and biased due to fixed search spaces, prompting the need for an adaptive solution for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

Method: The authors model GNN message-passing as a stochastic beta process, inferring optimal neighborhood scopes alongside GNN parameter optimization within a Bayesian framework.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the method's compatibility with top GNN variants, achieving competitive or superior node classification performance and well-calibrated predictions.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian framework enhances GNN expressivity and performance by adaptively inferring neighborhood scopes, validated across benchmark datasets.

Abstract: The neighborhood scope (i.e., number of hops) where graph neural networks (GNNs) aggregate information to characterize a node's statistical property is critical to GNNs' performance. Two-stage approaches, training and validating GNNs for every pre-specified neighborhood scope to search for the best setting, is a time-consuming task and tends to be biased due to the search space design. How to adaptively determine proper neighborhood scopes for the aggregation process for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs remains largely unexplored. We thus propose to model the GNNs' message-passing behavior on a graph as a stochastic process by treating the number of hops as a beta process. This Bayesian framework allows us to infer the most plausible neighborhood scope for message aggregation simultaneously with the optimization of GNN parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that the scope inference improves the expressivity of a GNN. Experiments on benchmark homophilic and heterophilic datasets show that the proposed method is compatible with state-of-the-art GNN variants, achieving competitive or superior performance on the node classification task, and providing well-calibrated predictions.

TL;DR: HRT reframes oblique tree splits as non-linear least-squares problems, offering fast convergence, universal approximation, and compact structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for learning oblique decision trees rely on slow search or heuristics; HRT aims to provide a more efficient and theoretically grounded solution.

Method: HRT treats each split as a non-linear least-squares problem, using damped Newton methods for optimization and optional ridge regularization.

Result: HRT achieves fast, stable convergence, matches or outperforms baselines, and provides compact tree structures.

Conclusion: HRT is a theoretically sound and practical approach for learning oblique decision trees, offering improved efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Oblique decision trees combine the transparency of trees with the power of multivariate decision boundaries, but learning high-quality oblique splits is NP-hard, and practical methods still rely on slow search or theory-free heuristics. We present the Hinge Regression Tree (HRT), which reframes each split as a non-linear least-squares problem over two linear predictors whose max/min envelope induces ReLU-like expressive power. The resulting alternating fitting procedure is exactly equivalent to a damped Newton (Gauss-Newton) method within fixed partitions. We analyze this node-level optimization and, for a backtracking line-search variant, prove that the local objective decreases monotonically and converges; in practice, both fixed and adaptive damping yield fast, stable convergence and can be combined with optional ridge regularization. We further prove that HRT's model class is a universal approximator with an explicit $O(δ^2)$ approximation rate, and show on synthetic and real-world benchmarks that it matches or outperforms single-tree baselines with more compact structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DLM-Scope, a sparse autoencoder (SAE) framework for interpreting diffusion language models (DLMs), highlighting differences in SAE behavior between DLMs and autoregressive LLMs, and demonstrating SAEs' effectiveness in DLM interpretability and interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for tailored interpretability tools for emerging diffusion language models (DLMs) as they become a viable alternative to autoregressive LLMs.

Method: Proposes DLM-Scope, a SAE-based interpretability framework for DLMs, and evaluates its performance in feature extraction, interventions, decoding order, and stability.

Result: SAEs in DLMs reduce cross-entropy loss in early layers, enable effective diffusion-time interventions, and provide stable features, outperforming LLMs in certain tasks.

Conclusion: DLM-Scope lays the groundwork for mechanistic interpretability in DLMs, showcasing SAEs' potential for DLM-related tasks and algorithms.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a standard tool for mechanistic interpretability in autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling researchers to extract sparse, human-interpretable features and intervene on model behavior. Recently, as diffusion language models (DLMs) have become an increasingly promising alternative to the autoregressive LLMs, it is essential to develop tailored mechanistic interpretability tools for this emerging class of models. In this work, we present DLM-Scope, the first SAE-based interpretability framework for DLMs, and demonstrate that trained Top-K SAEs can faithfully extract interpretable features. Notably, we find that inserting SAEs affects DLMs differently than autoregressive LLMs: while SAE insertion in LLMs typically incurs a loss penalty, in DLMs it can reduce cross-entropy loss when applied to early layers, a phenomenon absent or markedly weaker in LLMs. Additionally, SAE features in DLMs enable more effective diffusion-time interventions, often outperforming LLM steering. Moreover, we pioneer certain new SAE-based research directions for DLMs: we show that SAEs can provide useful signals for DLM decoding order; and the SAE features are stable during the post-training phase of DLMs. Our work establishes a foundation for mechanistic interpretability in DLMs and shows a great potential of applying SAEs to DLM-related tasks and algorithms.

### [249] [Erase at the Core: Representation Unlearning for Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05375)
*Jaewon Lee,Yongwoo Kim,Donghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Erase at the Core (EC), a framework addressing superficial forgetting in machine unlearning by enforcing forgetting across all network layers using multi-layer contrastive unlearning and deeply supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods often only alter the final classifier, leaving intermediate representations largely unchanged, leading to superficial forgetting. The goal is to ensure comprehensive forgetting throughout the network.

Method: EC integrates multi-layer contrastive unlearning on the forget set with retain set preservation via deeply supervised learning. Auxiliary modules are added to intermediate layers, applying contrastive unlearning and cross-entropy losses with layer-wise weighted losses.

Result: EC achieves effective logit-level forgetting and significantly reduces representational similarity to the original model across layers. It is model-agnostic and improves representation-level forgetting without compromising retain set performance.

Conclusion: EC effectively addresses superficial forgetting by enforcing forgetting throughout the network hierarchy, offering a versatile and improved approach to machine unlearning.

Abstract: Many approximate machine unlearning methods demonstrate strong logit-level forgetting -- such as near-zero accuracy on the forget set -- yet continue to preserve substantial information within their internal feature representations. We refer to this discrepancy as superficial forgetting. Recent studies indicate that most existing unlearning approaches primarily alter the final classifier, leaving intermediate representations largely unchanged and highly similar to those of the original model. To address this limitation, we introduce the Erase at the Core (EC), a framework designed to enforce forgetting throughout the entire network hierarchy. EC integrates multi-layer contrastive unlearning on the forget set with retain set preservation through deeply supervised learning. Concretely, EC attaches auxiliary modules to intermediate layers and applies both contrastive unlearning and cross-entropy losses at each supervision point, with layer-wise weighted losses. Experimental results show that EC not only achieves effective logit-level forgetting, but also substantially reduces representational similarity to the original model across intermediate layers. Furthermore, EC is model-agnostic and can be incorporated as a plug-in module into existing unlearning methods, improving representation-level forgetting while maintaining performance on the retain set.

TL;DR: Constrained GRPO extends GRPO for constrained policy optimization using Lagrangian-based methods, addressing issues in advantage estimation to ensure stable constraint enforcement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored area of extending scalable critic-free policy learning (GRPO) to settings with explicit behavioral constraints.

Method: Introduces Constrained GRPO, leveraging Lagrangian relaxation with indicator cost functions and a scalarized advantage construction to handle constraints effectively.

Result: Experiments in a toy gridworld and robotics tasks show improved constraint satisfaction and task success, validating the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Constrained GRPO provides a simple and effective solution for constrained policy optimization, especially in embodied AI domains.

Abstract: While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable framework for critic-free policy learning, extending it to settings with explicit behavioral constraints remains underexplored. We introduce Constrained GRPO, a Lagrangian-based extension of GRPO for constrained policy optimization. Constraints are specified via indicator cost functions, enabling direct optimization of violation rates through a Lagrangian relaxation. We show that a naive multi-component treatment in advantage estimation can break constrained learning: mismatched component-wise standard deviations distort the relative importance of the different objective terms, which in turn corrupts the Lagrangian signal and prevents meaningful constraint enforcement. We formally derive this effect to motivate our scalarized advantage construction that preserves the intended trade-off between reward and constraint terms. Experiments in a toy gridworld confirm the predicted optimization pathology and demonstrate that scalarizing advantages restores stable constraint control. In addition, we evaluate Constrained GRPO on robotics tasks, where it improves constraint satisfaction while increasing task success, establishing a simple and effective recipe for constrained policy optimization in embodied AI domains that increasingly rely on large multimodal foundation models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a systematic RL approach for high-quality kernel generation in AI systems, introducing KernelGYM for training stability and unbiased advantage estimation, achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality kernel generation is crucial for scalable AI systems, but existing methods suffer from reward hacking, lazy optimization, and lack of robust training environments.

Method: Developed KernelGYM for distributed GPU training, introduced TRLOO for unbiased advantage estimation, and incorporated profiling-based rewards and rejection sampling.

Result: Dr.Kernel-14B outperforms Claude-4.5-Sonnet and GPT-5, achieving up to 47.8% speedup with best candidates.

Conclusion: The proposed RL framework and tools significantly improve kernel generation performance, with open-sourced resources for further research.

Abstract: High-quality kernel is critical for scalable AI systems, and enabling LLMs to generate such code would advance AI development. However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM, we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out (TRLOO) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards (PR) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling (PRS) to overcome the issue. The trained model, Dr.Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for Dr.Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). When selecting the best candidate across all turns, this 1.2x speedup rate further increases to 47.8%.

*Wei Soon Cheong,Lian Lian Jiang,Jamie Ng Suat Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates foundation models for electricity demand forecasting, finding their performance varies by geography and architecture, and challenges assumptions about universal superiority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether time-series foundation models can effectively leverage exogenous features for electricity demand forecasting, comparing them against a baseline LSTM.

Method: Empirically evaluates models like MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, and Chronos-2 under three feature configurations in Singaporean and Australian markets at hourly and daily granularities.

Result: Performance varies; Chronos-2 excels in zero-shot settings, but the baseline LSTM often outperforms foundation models in stable climates like Singapore. Model architecture and geographic context significantly impact effectiveness.

Conclusion: Foundation models are not universally superior; domain-specific models are still needed, especially in stable climates like Singapore.

Abstract: Time-series foundation models have emerged as a new paradigm for forecasting, yet their ability to effectively leverage exogenous features -- critical for electricity demand forecasting -- remains unclear. This paper empirically evaluates foundation models capable of modeling cross-channel correlations against a baseline LSTM with reversible instance normalization across Singaporean and Australian electricity markets at hourly and daily granularities. We systematically assess MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, and Chronos-2 under three feature configurations: all features, selected features, and target-only. Our findings reveal highly variable effectiveness: while Chronos-2 achieves the best performance among foundation models (in zero-shot settings), the simple baseline frequently outperforms all foundation models in Singapore's stable climate, particularly for short-term horizons. Model architecture proves critical, with synergistic architectural implementations (TTM's channel-mixing, Chronos-2's grouped attention) consistently leveraging exogenous features, while other approaches show inconsistent benefits. Geographic context emerges as equally important, with foundation models demonstrating advantages primarily in variable climates. These results challenge assumptions about universal foundation model superiority and highlight the need for domain-specific models, specifically in the energy domain.

TL;DR: DFPO is a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows for better advantage estimation and generalization under noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like noisy supervision and poor OOD generalization in RL, especially in LLM post-training, by improving value representation.

Method: DFPO models values as continuous flows across time steps, integrating conditional risk control and consistency constraints.

Result: DFPO outperforms PPO, FlowRL, and other baselines in noisy supervision tasks, showing improved stability and generalization.

Conclusion: DFPO enhances robustness in RL training by leveraging value flow fields and stabilizing mechanisms.

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) systems in real-world environments remains challenging due to noisy supervision and poor out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, especially in LLM post-training. Recent distributional RL methods improve robustness by modeling values with multiple quantile points, but they still learn each quantile independently as a scalar. This results in rough-grained value representations that lack fine-grained conditioning on state information, struggling under complex and OOD conditions. We propose DFPO (Distributional Value Flow Policy Optimization with Conditional Risk and Consistency Control), a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows across time steps. By scaling value modeling through learning of a value flow field instead of isolated quantile predictions, DFPO captures richer state information for more accurate advantage estimation. To stabilize training under noisy feedback, DFPO further integrates conditional risk control and consistency constraints along value flow trajectories. Experiments on dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific tasks show that DFPO outperforms PPO, FlowRL, and other robust baselines under noisy supervision, achieving improved training stability and generalization.

*Adda Akram Bendoukha,Aymen Boudguiga,Nesrine Kaaniche,Renaud Sirdey,Didem Demirag,Sébastien Gambs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel federated learning approach combining homomorphic encryption for secure aggregation with meta-classifiers for Byzantine resilience, achieving high accuracy in filtering attacks with minimal utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the dual challenges of privacy-preserving aggregation and Byzantine resilience in federated learning, which current solutions tackle independently.

Method: Uses homomorphic encryption for privacy and meta-classifiers trained on diverse Byzantine behaviors (e.g., backdoor attacks) to filter malicious updates. Automates hyperparameter selection for efficiency.

Result: Achieves 90%-94% accuracy in detecting Byzantine updates with minor model utility loss and efficient encrypted inference runtimes (6-26 seconds).

Conclusion: The approach successfully integrates secure aggregation and Byzantine resilience, demonstrating practical effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a collaborative model while preserving data privacy. However, the distributed nature of this approach still raises privacy and security issues, such as the exposure of sensitive data due to inference attacks and the influence of Byzantine behaviors on the trained model. In particular, achieving both secure aggregation and Byzantine resilience remains challenging, as existing solutions often address these aspects independently. In this work, we propose to address these challenges through a novel approach that combines homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving aggregation with property-inference-inspired meta-classifiers for Byzantine filtering. First, following the property-inference attacks blueprint, we train a set of filtering meta-classifiers on labeled shadow updates, reproducing a diverse ensemble of Byzantine misbehaviors in FL, including backdoor, gradient-inversion, label-flipping and shuffling attacks. The outputs of these meta-classifiers are then used to cancel the Byzantine encrypted updates by reweighting. Second, we propose an automated method for selecting the optimal kernel and the dimensionality hyperparameters with respect to homomorphic inference, aggregation constraints and efficiency over the CKKS cryptosystem. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive experiments the effectiveness of our approach against Byzantine participants on the FEMNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and acsincome benchmarks. More precisely, our SVM filtering achieves accuracies between $90$% and $94$% for identifying Byzantine updates at the cost of marginal losses in model utility and encrypted inference runtimes ranging from $6$ to $24$ seconds and from $9$ to $26$ seconds for an overall aggregation.

*Sheshansh Agrawal,Thien Hang Nguyen,Douwe Kiela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A tournament graph framework is introduced for efficient and principled k-wise reranking in large language models, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM reranking methods either use heuristics that don't fully utilize ranking information or are inefficient. The paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: Proposes a tournament graph framework that aggregates pairwise preferences from k-document comparisons into a global preference graph, optimizing information gain and handling non-transitive preferences.

Result: Empirical results across 14 benchmarks and 5 LLMs show the method achieves superior accuracy with 25-40% fewer tokens, and 7x fewer tokens than pairwise methods.

Conclusion: The framework provides a more efficient and accurate approach to reranking, leveraging tournament graphs to maximize information gain and handle LLM judgment complexities.

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as powerful zero-shot rerankers for retrieval-augmented generation, offering strong generalization without task-specific training. However, existing LLM reranking methods either rely on heuristics that fail to fully exploit the information revealed by each ranking decision or are inefficient when they do. We introduce a tournament graph framework that provides a principled foundation for $k$-wise reranking. Our key observation is that each $k$-document comparison reveals a complete tournament of $\binom{k}{2}$ pairwise preferences. These tournaments are aggregated into a global preference graph, whose transitive closure yields many additional orderings without further model invocations. We formalize when a candidate's rank is certifiably determined and design a query schedule that greedily maximizes information gain towards identifying the top-$m$ items. Our framework also gracefully handles non-transitive preferences - cycles induced by LLM judgments - by collapsing them into equivalence classes that yield principled tiered rankings. Empirically, across 14 benchmarks and 5 LLMs, our method achieves Pareto dominance over existing methods: matching or exceeding accuracy while requiring 25-40% fewer tokens than comparable approaches, and 7$\times$ fewer than pairwise methods at near-identical quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores hyperparameter sensitivity in offline goal-conditioned RL, finding it less severe than in online RL. It compares HIQL and QRL algorithms, showing QRL's stability with expert data and attributing sensitivity differences to gradient interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if hyperparameter sensitivity in RL is intrinsic or caused by training mechanisms, focusing on offline goal-conditioned RL where data quality shifts are controllable.

Method: Study hyperparameter sensitivity under stationary/non-stationary data regimes using HIQL (TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric learning). Introduce an inter-goal gradient alignment diagnostic.

Result: QRL shows stable performance with modest expert data, while HIQL has sharp optima drifting across phases. Gradient interference explains sensitivity differences.

Conclusion: Hyperparameter sensitivity in RL is amplified by bootstrapping dynamics, not inevitable. This insight can guide more robust algorithm design.

Abstract: Hyperparameter sensitivity in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often accepted as unavoidable. However, it remains unclear whether it is intrinsic to the RL problem or exacerbated by specific training mechanisms. We investigate this question in offline goal-conditioned RL, where data distributions are fixed, and non-stationarity can be explicitly controlled via scheduled shifts in data quality. Additionally, we study varying data qualities under both stationary and non-stationary regimes, and cover two representative algorithms: HIQL (bootstrapped TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric representation learning). Overall, we observe substantially greater robustness to changes in hyperparameter configurations than commonly reported for online RL, even under controlled non-stationarity. Once modest expert data is present ($\approx$ 20\%), QRL maintains broad, stable near-optimal regions, while HIQL exhibits sharp optima that drift significantly across training phases. To explain this divergence, we introduce an inter-goal gradient alignment diagnostic. We find that bootstrapped objectives exhibit stronger destructive gradient interference, which coincides directly with hyperparameter sensitivity. These results suggest that high sensitivity to changes in hyperparameter configurations during training is not inevitable in RL, but is amplified by the dynamics of bootstrapping, offering a pathway toward more robust algorithmic objective design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two energy-efficiency metrics for AI systems—Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule and Empowerment per Joule—linking intelligence to physical efficiency. It provides theoretical grounding and practical guidelines for consistent measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high energy costs of modern AI by developing metrics that quantify intelligence in terms of energy efficiency.

Method: Proposes two metrics: (1) Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule measures information encoding efficiency, and (2) Empowerment per Joule evaluates control information efficiency. Uses stochastic thermodynamics for theoretical foundations.

Result: Demonstrates how these metrics can benchmark AI efficiency under specific assumptions and highlights their limitations without those assumptions. Provides practical recommendations for empirical settings.

Conclusion: A unified framework for reporting these metrics, alongside accounting conventions, can reduce ambiguity and enable consistent comparisons of AI efficiency.

Abstract: Modern AI systems achieve remarkable capabilities at the cost of substantial energy consumption. To connect intelligence to physical efficiency, we propose two complementary bits-per-joule metrics under explicit accounting conventions: (1) Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule -- bits of structural information about a theoretical environment-instance variable newly encoded in an agent's internal state per unit measured energy within a stated boundary -- and (2) Empowerment per Joule -- the embodied sensorimotor channel capacity (control information) per expected energetic cost over a fixed horizon. These provide two axes of physical intelligence: recognition (model-building) vs.control (action influence). Drawing on stochastic thermodynamics, we show how a Landauer-scale closed-cycle benchmark for epiplexity acquisition follows as a corollary of a standard thermodynamic-learning inequality under explicit subsystem assumptions, and we clarify how Landauer-scaled costs act as closed-cycle benchmarks under explicit reset/reuse and boundary-closure assumptions; conversely, we give a simple decoupling construction showing that without such assumptions -- and without charging for externally prepared low-entropy resources (e.g.fresh memory) crossing the boundary -- information gain and in-boundary dissipation need not be tightly linked. For empirical settings where the latent structure variable is unavailable, we align the operational notion of epiplexity with compute-bounded MDL epiplexity and recommend reporting MDL-epiplexity / compression-gain surrogates as companions. Finally, we propose a unified efficiency framework that reports both metrics together with a minimal checklist of boundary/energy accounting, coarse-graining/noise, horizon/reset, and cost conventions to reduce ambiguity and support consistent bits-per-joule comparisons, and we sketch connections to energy-adjusted scaling analyses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance reasoning capabilities of LLMs by systematically analyzing policy divergence measures and their impact on exploration and performance.

Method: Introduces a unified clipping framework using KL3 estimator, a variance-reduced Monte Carlo estimator of KL divergence.

Result: KL3-based constraint improves training stability and final performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Principled policy divergence constraints, like KL3 estimator, enhance RLVR methods by promoting stronger exploration and retaining simplicity.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a critical paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Most existing RLVR methods, such as GRPO and its variants, ensure stable updates by constraining policy divergence through clipping likelihood ratios. This paper introduces a unified clipping framework that characterizes existing methods via a general notion of policy divergence, encompassing both likelihood ratios and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences and extending to alternative measures. The framework provides a principled foundation for systematically analyzing how different policy divergence measures affect exploration and performance. We further identify the KL3 estimator, a variance-reduced Monte Carlo estimator of the KL divergence, as a key policy divergence constraint. We theoretically demonstrate that the KL3-based constraint is mathematically equivalent to an asymmetric ratio-based clipping that reallocates probability mass toward high-confidence actions, promoting stronger exploration while retaining the simplicity of GRPO-style methods. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating the KL3 estimator into GRPO improves both training stability and final performance, highlighting the importance of principled policy divergence constraints in policy optimization.

TL;DR: EUQ is a fine-grained method to detect misbehaviors in LVLMs by quantifying epistemic uncertainty, outperforming baselines and revealing insights into internal conflict and ignorance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often produce unreliable or harmful content due to epistemic uncertainty, necessitating better methods to detect and address these misbehaviors.

Method: EUQ interprets model features as supporting or opposing evidence, using Evidence Theory to quantify conflict and ignorance in a single forward pass.

Result: EUQ excels in detecting hallucinations (high conflict) and OOD failures (high ignorance), outperforming existing methods across four misbehavior categories.

Conclusion: EUQ provides a robust framework for understanding and mitigating LVLM misbehaviors, with potential applications in critical deployments.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown substantial advances in multimodal understanding and generation. However, when presented with incompetent or adversarial inputs, they frequently produce unreliable or even harmful content, such as fact hallucinations or dangerous instructions. This misalignment with human expectations, referred to as \emph{misbehaviors} of LVLMs, raises serious concerns for deployment in critical applications. These misbehaviors are found to stem from epistemic uncertainty, specifically either conflicting internal knowledge or the absence of supporting information. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods, which typically capture only overall epistemic uncertainty, have shown limited effectiveness in identifying such issues. To address this gap, we propose Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ), a fine-grained method that captures both information conflict and ignorance for effective detection of LVLM misbehaviors. In particular, we interpret features from the model output head as either supporting (positive) or opposing (negative) evidence. Leveraging Evidence Theory, we model and aggregate this evidence to quantify internal conflict and knowledge gaps within a single forward pass. We extensively evaluate our method across four categories of misbehavior, including hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial vulnerabilities, and out-of-distribution (OOD) failures, using state-of-the-art LVLMs, and find that EUQ consistently outperforms strong baselines, showing that hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict and OOD failures to high ignorance. Furthermore, layer-wise evidential uncertainty dynamics analysis helps interpret the evolution of internal representations from a new perspective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The efficiency and adaptability challenges in GRPO's exploration mechanism motivate the study.

Method: Introduces Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE) to address symmetry issues in GRAE, enhancing exploration and difficulty adaptation.

Result: A-GRAE outperforms GRPO variants across seven benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dynamic modulation of exploration and difficulty focus in A-GRAE leads to consistently better performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly GRPO, has become the standard for eliciting LLM reasoning. However, its efficiency in exploration and difficulty adaptation remains an open challenge. In this work, we argue that these bottlenecks stem from an implicit advantage symmetry inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE). This symmetry induces two critical limitations: (i) at the group level, strict symmetry in weights between correct and incorrect trajectories leaves unsampled action logits unchanged, thereby hindering exploration of novel correct solution. (ii) at the sample level, the algorithm implicitly prioritizes medium-difficulty samples, remaining agnostic to the non-stationary demands of difficulty focus. Through controlled experiments, we reveal that this symmetric property is sub-optimal, yielding two pivotal insights: (i) asymmetrically suppressing the advantages of correct trajectories encourages essential exploration. (ii) learning efficiency is maximized by a curriculum-like transition-prioritizing simpler samples initially before gradually shifting to complex ones. Motivated by these findings, we propose Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE), which dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that A-GRAE consistently improves GRPO and its variants across both LLMs and MLLMs.

Motivation: To enable principled constrained generation with complex logical expressions in diffusion models.

Method: Derives an exact Boolean calculus for logical guidance, uses recursive algorithms for signal computation, and introduces hybrid guidance blending atomic scores and posterior probabilities.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on image and protein structure generation tasks.

Conclusion: LOGDIFF provides a robust framework for exact logical guidance in diffusion models.

Abstract: We propose LOGDIFF (Logical Guidance for the Exact Composition of Diffusion Models), a guidance framework for diffusion models that enables principled constrained generation with complex logical expressions at inference time.
  We study when exact score-based guidance for complex logical formulas can be obtained from guidance signals associated with atomic properties.
  First, we derive an exact Boolean calculus that provides a sufficient condition for exact logical guidance.
  Specifically, if a formula admits a circuit representation in which conjunctions combine conditionally independent subformulas and disjunctions combine subformulas that are either conditionally independent or mutually exclusive, exact logical guidance is achievable.
  In this case, the guidance signal can be computed exactly from atomic scores and posterior probabilities using an efficient recursive algorithm.
  Moreover, we show that, for commonly encountered classes of distributions, any desired Boolean formula is compilable into such a circuit representation.
  Second, by combining atomic guidance scores with posterior probability estimates, we introduce a hybrid guidance approach that bridges classifierguidance and classifier-free guidance, applicable to both compositional logical guidance and standard conditional generation.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on multiple image and protein structure generation tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes message-adaptive graph prompt tuning for GNNs, improving adaptability by modifying message passing steps without fine-tuning the backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained GNNs struggle with downstream task adaptation due to mismatches in objectives, and current prompt methods fail to adapt neighborhood interactions effectively.

Method: Inject learnable prompts into message passing to reweight neighbor messages and add task-specific vectors during aggregation, keeping the GNN backbone frozen.

Result: Experiments on diverse datasets show gains over prior prompting methods in few-shot settings and competitive performance with fine-tuning in full-shot regimes.

Conclusion: Message-adaptive prompt tuning offers a parameter-efficient way to adapt pre-trained GNNs, outperforming existing methods while maintaining backbone integrity.

Abstract: Pre-trained graph neural networks (GNNs) transfer well, but adapting them to downstream tasks remains challenging due to mismatches between pre-training objectives and task requirements. Graph prompt tuning offers a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, yet most methods only modify inputs or representations and leave message passing unchanged, limiting their ability to adapt neighborhood interactions. We propose message-adaptive graph prompt tuning, which injects learnable prompts into the message passing step to reweight incoming neighbor messages and add task-specific prompt vectors during message aggregation, while keeping the backbone GNN frozen. The approach is compatible with common GNN backbones and pre-training strategies, and applicable across downstream settings. Experiments on diverse node- and graph-level datasets show consistent gains over prior graph prompting methods in few-shot settings, while achieving performance competitive with fine-tuning in full-shot regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle structural shifts in graph neural networks by identifying domain-invariant information across graph topologies and feature similarities.

Method: Proposes EdgeMask-DG for adversarial edge masking and EdgeMask-DG* for applying this to feature-enriched graphs, combining topology and feature-derived edges.

Result: Achieves 78.0% worst-case domain accuracy on Cora OOD benchmark, a 3.8 pp improvement over prior methods.

Conclusion: EdgeMask-DG* effectively combines adaptive adversarial topology search with feature enrichment, demonstrating superior performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Structural shifts pose a significant challenge for graph neural networks, as graph topology acts as a covariate that can vary across domains. Existing domain generalization methods rely on fixed structural augmentations or training on globally perturbed graphs, mechanisms that do not pinpoint which specific edges encode domain-invariant information. We argue that domain-invariant structural information is not rigidly tied to a single topology but resides in the consensus across multiple graph structures derived from topology and feature similarity. To capture this, we first propose EdgeMask-DG, a novel min-max algorithm where an edge masker learns to find worst-case continuous masks subject to a sparsity constraint, compelling a task GNN to perform effectively under these adversarial structural perturbations. Building upon this, we introduce EdgeMask-DG*, an extension that applies this adversarial masking principle to an enriched graph. This enriched graph combines the original topology with feature-derived edges, allowing the model to discover invariances even when the original topology is noisy or domain-specific. EdgeMask-DG* is the first to systematically combine adaptive adversarial topology search with feature-enriched graphs. We provide a formal justification for our approach from a robust optimization perspective. We demonstrate that EdgeMask-DG* achieves new state-of-the-art performance on diverse graph domain generalization benchmarks, including citation networks, social networks, and temporal graphs. Notably, on the Cora OOD benchmark, EdgeMask-DG* lifts the worst-case domain accuracy to 78.0\%, a +3.8 pp improvement over the prior state of the art (74.2\%).

Abstract: Multimodal-Attributed Graph (MAG) learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling complex real-world systems by integrating graph topology with rich attributes from multiple modalities. With the rapid proliferation of novel MAG models capable of handling intricate cross-modal semantics and structural dependencies, establishing a rigorous and unified evaluation standard has become imperative.

### [265] [On the Superlinear Relationship between SGD Noise Covariance and Loss Landscape Curvature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05600)
*Yikuan Zhang,Ning Yang,Yuhai Tu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper clarifies misconceptions about SGD's noise covariance $ℜ$ being proportional to the Hessian $ℎ$, showing this only holds under restrictive conditions. It introduces a more general relationship $ℜ ∝ ℰ_p[ℎ_p^2]$ and bounds the exponent $γ$ in $C_{ii} ∝ H_{ii}^γ$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to correct prior assumptions linking SGD's noise covariance to the Hessian, which are often invalid in deep learning contexts, and to provide a more accurate characterization.

Method: Leveraging Activity–Weight Duality, the authors derive a general relationship between SGD's noise covariance and per-sample Hessian spectra, validated empirically across diverse setups.

Result: The paper establishes $ℜ ∝ ℰ_p[ℎ_p^2]$ and bounds $1 ≤ γ ≤ 2$ for the power-law relation $C_{ii} ∝ H_{ii}^γ$, supported by experimental evidence.

Conclusion: The findings refute strict proportionality between $ℜ$ and $ℎ$, offering a unified and empirically validated framework for understanding SGD's noise-curvature relationship.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) introduces anisotropic noise that is correlated with the local curvature of the loss landscape, thereby biasing optimization toward flat minima. Prior work often assumes an equivalence between the Fisher Information Matrix and the Hessian for negative log-likelihood losses, leading to the claim that the SGD noise covariance $\mathbf{C}$ is proportional to the Hessian $\mathbf{H}$. We show that this assumption holds only under restrictive conditions that are typically violated in deep neural networks. Using the recently discovered Activity--Weight Duality, we find a more general relationship agnostic to the specific loss formulation, showing that $\mathbf{C} \propto \mathbb{E}_p[\mathbf{h}_p^2]$, where $\mathbf{h}_p$ denotes the per-sample Hessian with $\mathbf{H} = \mathbb{E}_p[\mathbf{h}_p]$. As a consequence, $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ commute approximately rather than coincide exactly, and their diagonal elements follow an approximate power-law relation $C_{ii} \propto H_{ii}^γ$ with a theoretically bounded exponent $1 \leq γ\leq 2$, determined by per-sample Hessian spectra. Experiments across datasets, architectures, and loss functions validate these bounds, providing a unified characterization of the noise-curvature relationship in deep learning.

TL;DR: Shiva-DiT proposes Residual-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Selection to reduce computational costs in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) while maintaining learnability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs face high computational costs due to quadratic scaling of self-attention, and existing pruning methods fail to meet requirements like differentiability, efficiency, and static hardware budgets.

Method: Shiva-DiT uses Residual-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Selection, a residual-aware straight-through estimator, Context-Aware Router, and Adaptive Ratio Policy to learn adaptive pruning schedules.

Result: Experiments show Shiva-DiT achieves a 1.54× wall-clock speedup with better fidelity than baselines, eliminating ragged tensor overheads.

Conclusion: Shiva-DiT effectively balances computational efficiency and fidelity, setting a new Pareto frontier for DiTs.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) incur prohibitive computational costs due to the quadratic scaling of self-attention. Existing pruning methods fail to simultaneously satisfy differentiability, efficiency, and the strict static budgets required for hardware overhead. To address this, we propose Shiva-DiT, which effectively reconciles these conflicting requirements via Residual-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Selection. By leveraging a residual-aware straight-through estimator, our method enforces deterministic token counts for static compilation while preserving end-to-end learnability through residual gradient estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a Context-Aware Router and Adaptive Ratio Policy to autonomously learn an adaptive pruning schedule. Experiments on mainstream models, including SD3.5, demonstrate that Shiva-DiT establishes a new Pareto frontier, achieving a 1.54$\times$ wall-clock speedup with superior fidelity compared to existing baselines, effectively eliminating ragged tensor overheads.

### [267] [Path-Guided Flow Matching for Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05616)
*Xuhui Li,Zhengquan Luo,Xiwei Liu,Yongqiang Yu,Zhiqiang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Path-Guided Flow Matching (PGFM) is proposed as a flow matching-based framework for dataset distillation, offering faster and more stable synthesis compared to diffusion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based dataset distillation methods suffer from heuristic guidance, time-consuming sampling, and trajectory instability, harming downstream generalization.

Method: PGFM uses flow matching in latent space with a frozen VAE to class-conditionally transport Gaussian noise to data. It introduces a path-to-prototype guidance algorithm for reliable trajectory control.

Result: PGFM outperforms diffusion-based methods with fewer sampling steps and high efficiency (7.6× faster, 78% mode coverage).

Conclusion: PGFM is a promising alternative to diffusion-based distillation, balancing efficiency, diversity, and performance.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic sets with comparable performance in training models. Despite recent progress on diffusion-based distillation, this type of method typically depends on heuristic guidance or prototype assignment, which comes with time-consuming sampling and trajectory instability and thus hurts downstream generalization especially under strong control or low IPC. We propose \emph{Path-Guided Flow Matching (PGFM)}, the first flow matching-based framework for generative distillation, which enables fast deterministic synthesis by solving an ODE in a few steps. PGFM conducts flow matching in the latent space of a frozen VAE to learn class-conditional transport from Gaussian noise to data distribution. Particularly, we develop a continuous path-to-prototype guidance algorithm for ODE-consistent path control, which allows trajectories to reliably land on assigned prototypes while preserving diversity and efficiency. Extensive experiments across high-resolution benchmarks demonstrate that PGFM matches or surpasses prior diffusion-based distillation approaches with fewer steps of sampling while delivering competitive performance with remarkably improved efficiency, e.g., 7.6$\times$ more efficient than the diffusion-based counterparts with 78\% mode coverage.

*Mohamad Mohamad,Francesco Ponzio,Xavier Descombes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mode-dependent layers like Batch Normalization destabilize PPO; Mode-Dependent Rectification (MDR) stabilizes training without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the destabilizing effects of mode-dependent layers (e.g., Batch Normalization) in PPO, which cause policy mismatch and reward collapse.

Method: Introduces Mode-Dependent Rectification (MDR), a lightweight dual-phase training procedure.

Result: MDR improves stability and performance across procedurally generated games and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: MDR effectively stabilizes PPO training with mode-dependent layers and extends to other similar layers.

Abstract: Mode-dependent architectural components (layers that behave differently during training and evaluation, such as Batch Normalization or dropout) are commonly used in visual reinforcement learning but can destabilize on-policy optimization. We show that in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), discrepancies between training and evaluation behavior induced by Batch Normalization lead to policy mismatch, distributional drift, and reward collapse. We propose Mode-Dependent Rectification (MDR), a lightweight dual-phase training procedure that stabilizes PPO under mode-dependent layers without architectural changes. Experiments across procedurally generated games and real-world patch-localization tasks demonstrate that MDR consistently improves stability and performance, and extends naturally to other mode-dependent layers.

*Ojasva Nema,Kaustubh Sharma,Aditya Chauhan,Parikshit Pareek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that neural networks' failures in selective unlearning and long-horizon extrapolation stem from internal representation structure, not just optimization. It proposes bilinear MLPs for structural disentanglement, showing their non-mixing property under gradient flow and validating this with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fragility in neural networks for tasks with algebraic structure, focusing on representation structure's role.

Method: Introduces Bilinear MLPs to study multiplicative interactions' impact, analyzing their non-mixing property under gradient flow.

Result: Bilinear architectures recover true algebraic operators, outperforming pointwise nonlinear networks.

Conclusion: Architectural inductive bias is key for model editability and generalization, emphasizing representational structure's importance.

Abstract: Selective unlearning and long-horizon extrapolation remain fragile in modern neural networks, even when tasks have underlying algebraic structure. In this work, we argue that these failures arise not solely from optimization or unlearning algorithms, but from how models structure their internal representations during training. We explore if having explicit multiplicative interactions as an architectural inductive bias helps in structural disentanglement, through Bilinear MLPs. We show analytically that bilinear parameterizations possess a `non-mixing' property under gradient flow conditions, where functional components separate into orthogonal subspace representations. This provides a mathematical foundation for surgical model modification. We validate this hypothesis through a series of controlled experiments spanning modular arithmetic, cyclic reasoning, Lie group dynamics, and targeted unlearning benchmarks. Unlike pointwise nonlinear networks, multiplicative architectures are able to recover true operators aligned with the underlying algebraic structure. Our results suggest that model editability and generalization are constrained by representational structure, and that architectural inductive bias plays a central role in enabling reliable unlearning.

### [270] [Joint Embedding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05639)
*Amin Oji,Paul Fieguth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VJE combines joint embedding and variational inference for self-supervised learning, achieving competitive performance with non-contrastive baselines and excelling in anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable probabilistic representation learning in a reconstruction-free, non-contrastive setting by synthesizing joint embedding and variational inference.

Method: Maximizes a symmetric conditional ELBO using a latent-variable model with a Student-$t$ likelihood and polar decomposition. Uses an amortized inference network for variational posterior.

Result: Performs comparably to non-contrastive baselines on standard benchmarks and outperforms them in anomaly detection.

Conclusion: VJE effectively learns probabilistic representations without reconstruction or contrastive methods, demonstrating utility in diverse tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Variational Joint Embedding (VJE), a framework that synthesizes joint embedding and variational inference to enable self-supervised learning of probabilistic representations in a reconstruction-free, non-contrastive setting. Compared to energy-based predictive objectives that optimize pointwise discrepancies, VJE maximizes a symmetric conditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) for a latent-variable model defined directly on encoder embeddings. We instantiate the conditional likelihood with a heavy-tailed Student-$t$ model using a polar decomposition that explicitly decouples directional and radial factors to prevent norm-induced instabilities during training. VJE employs an amortized inference network to parameterize a diagonal Gaussian variational posterior whose feature-wise variances are shared with the likelihood scale to capture anisotropic uncertainty without auxiliary projection heads. Across ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10/100, and STL-10, VJE achieves performance comparable to standard non-contrastive baselines under linear and k-NN evaluation. We further validate these probabilistic semantics through one-class CIFAR-10 anomaly detection, where likelihood-based scoring under the proposed model outperforms comparable self-supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HORAI, a frequency-enhanced multimodal foundation model for time series analysis, addressing challenges like lack of unified pretraining paradigms and large-scale datasets. It achieves SOTA zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series foundation models lack multimodal integration, limiting understanding. The paper aims to address the absence of a unified pretraining paradigm and large-scale multimodal datasets.

Method: Proposes HORAI with Frequency-enhanced Cross-Modality Encoder and Time-Frequency Decoder. Uses MM-TS, a large-scale dataset with six domains, curated via an automated pipeline.

Result: HORAI achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on forecasting and anomaly detection.

Conclusion: Multimodal integration enhances time series models, as demonstrated by HORAI's strong generalization.

Abstract: While existing time series foundation models primarily rely on large-scale unimodal pretraining, they lack complementary modalities to enhance time series understanding. Building multimodal foundation models is a natural next step, but it faces key challenges: 1) lack of a unified multimodal pretraining paradigm and large-scale multimodal corpora for time series analysis; 2) how to effectively integrate heterogeneous modalities and enhance model generalization. To address these challenges, we take an early step toward multimodal foundation models for time series analysis. We first propose a multimodal pretraining paradigm that leverages time series with endogenous modalities (derived images and text) and exogenous knowledge (real-world news), providing a comprehensive multi-view perspective for time series analysis. To support this, we develop an automated data construction pipeline to curate MM-TS, the first large-scale multimodal time series dataset spanning six domains, with up to one billion points. Then we propose HORAI, a frequency-enhanced multimodal foundation model. It integrates two core components: the Frequency-enhanced Cross-Modality Encoder and the Time-Frequency Decoder, designed to effectively fuse multimodal features and enhance model generalization across modalities and domains. After pretraining on MM-TS, HORAI achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating strong generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TACO, a tabular compression model, outperforms traditional transformer-based methods by being faster, more memory-efficient, and scalable while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of transformer-based tabular foundation models, which suffer from quadratic complexity, high memory usage, and slow training/inference times.

Method: Proposes TACO, an end-to-end tabular compression model that compresses training data into a latent space to reduce overhead.

Result: TACO achieves up to 94x faster inference, 97% less memory usage, and retains performance without significant degradation.

Conclusion: TACO is scalable, efficient, and performs better than other baselines, making it a strong alternative to transformer-based methods.

Abstract: The long-standing dominance of gradient-boosted decision trees for tabular data has recently been challenged by in-context learning tabular foundation models. In-context learning methods fit and predict in one forward pass without parameter updates by leveraging the training data as context for predicting on query test points. While recent tabular foundation models achieve state-of-the-art performance, their transformer architecture based on the attention mechanism has quadratic complexity regarding dataset size, which in turn increases the overhead on training and inference time, and limits the capacity of the models to handle large-scale datasets. In this work, we propose TACO, an end-to-end tabular compression model that compresses the training dataset in a latent space. We test our method on the TabArena benchmark, where our proposed method is up to 94x faster in inference time, while consuming up to 97\% less memory compared to the state-of-the-art tabular transformer architecture, all while retaining performance without significant degradation. Lastly, our method not only scales better with increased dataset sizes, but it also achieves better performance compared to other baselines.

### [273] [Alignment Verifiability in Large Language Models: Normative Indistinguishability under Behavioral Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05656)
*Igor Santos-Grueiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Behavioral evaluation of LLMs infers alignment from observed compliance, but this inference lacks unique identification of latent alignment due to partial observability and evaluation-aware agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the implicit inference problem in LLM alignment assessment, questioning whether behavioral compliance certifies underlying alignment.

Method: The study formalizes alignment evaluation as an identifiability problem under partial observability, introducing the Alignment Verifiability Problem and Normative Indistinguishability to analyze when distinct alignment hypotheses yield identical behavioral signals.

Result: The main finding is negative: finite behavioral evaluation cannot uniquely identify latent alignment, meaning compliance does not certify alignment. Behavioral tests estimate indistinguishability classes, not alignment itself.

Conclusion: Alignment benchmarks provide upper bounds on observable compliance, not guarantees of latent alignment, reframing their role in evaluation.

Abstract: Behavioral evaluation is the dominant paradigm for assessing alignment in large language models (LLMs). In practice, alignment is inferred from performance under finite evaluation protocols - benchmarks, red-teaming suites, or automated pipelines - and observed compliance is often treated as evidence of underlying alignment. This inference step, from behavioral evidence to claims about latent alignment properties, is typically implicit and rarely analyzed as an inference problem in its own right.
  We study this problem formally. We frame alignment evaluation as an identifiability question under partial observability and allow agent behavior to depend on information correlated with the evaluation regime. Within this setting, we introduce the Alignment Verifiability Problem and the notion of Normative Indistinguishability, capturing when distinct latent alignment hypotheses induce identical distributions over all evaluator-accessible signals.
  Our main result is a negative but sharply delimited identifiability theorem. Under finite behavioral evaluation and evaluation-aware agents, observed behavioral compliance does not uniquely identify latent alignment. That is, even idealized behavioral evaluation cannot, in general, certify alignment as a latent property.
  We further show that behavioral alignment tests should be interpreted as estimators of indistinguishability classes rather than verifiers of alignment. Passing increasingly stringent tests may reduce the space of compatible hypotheses, but cannot collapse it to a singleton under the stated conditions. This reframes alignment benchmarks as providing upper bounds on observable compliance within a regime, rather than guarantees of underlying alignment.

### [274] [Tight Long-Term Tail Decay of (Clipped) SGD in Non-Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05657)
*Aleksandar Armacki,Dragana Bajović,Dušan Jakovetić,Soummya Kar,Ali H. Sayed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods using large deviations theory, providing upper and lower bounds on tail decay rates for SGD and clipped SGD under various noise assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work lacks direct study of failure probability and focuses on finite-time bounds, missing the true long-term tail decay relevant for modern models trained for millions of iterations.

Method: The authors use large deviations theory to analyze SGD and clipped SGD (c-SGD) under non-convex costs and bounded or heavy-tailed noise.

Result: Upper bounds show decay rates like $e^{-t/\log(t)}$ for SGD and $e^{-t^{\beta_p}/\log(t)}$ for c-SGD, with tight lower bounds at $e^{-t}$. These rates outperform existing finite-time bounds.

Conclusion: The paper provides stronger long-term tail decay guarantees for SGD-based methods, revealing regimes where tails decay faster than previously known.

Abstract: The study of tail behaviour of SGD-induced processes has been attracting a lot of interest, due to offering strong guarantees with respect to individual runs of an algorithm. While many works provide high-probability guarantees, quantifying the error rate for a fixed probability threshold, there is a lack of work directly studying the probability of failure, i.e., quantifying the tail decay rate for a fixed error threshold. Moreover, existing results are of finite-time nature, limiting their ability to capture the true long-term tail decay which is more informative for modern learning models, typically trained for millions of iterations. Our work closes these gaps, by studying the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods through the lens of large deviations theory, establishing several strong results in the process. First, we provide an upper bound on the tails of the gradient norm-squared of the best iterate produced by (vanilla) SGD, for non-convex costs and bounded noise, with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t/\log(t)}$. Next, we relax the noise assumption by considering clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moment of order $p \in (1,2]$, showing an upper bound with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t^{β_p}/\log(t)}$, where $β_p = \frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ for $p \in (1,2)$ and $e^{-t/\log^2(t)}$ for $p = 2$. Finally, we provide lower bounds on the tail decay, at rate $e^{-t}$, showing that our rates for both SGD and c-SGD are tight, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Notably, our results demonstrate an order of magnitude faster long-term tail decay compared to existing work based on finite-time bounds, which show rates $e^{-\sqrt{t}}$ and $e^{-t^{β_p/2}}$, $p \in (1,2]$, for SGD and c-SGD, respectively. As such, we uncover regimes where the tails decay much faster than previously known, providing stronger long-term guarantees for individual runs.

TL;DR: A probabilistic forecasting framework using AQ-RNN for multi-regional PV power generation improves accuracy and calibration by leveraging spatial dependencies and arbitrary quantile estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty in PV power generation forecasts, moving beyond deterministic predictions to probabilistic methods for better energy management.

Method: AQ-RNN integrates an any-quantile paradigm with dual-track recurrent architecture, dilated recurrent cells, patch-based temporal modeling, and dynamic ensemble.

Result: Improved forecast accuracy, calibration, and prediction interval quality compared to baselines, validated on 30 years of hourly PV data from 259 European regions.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for uncertainty-aware energy management in renewable-dominated power systems.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) generation introduces significant uncertainty into power system operation, necessitating forecasting approaches that extend beyond deterministic point predictions. This paper proposes an any-quantile probabilistic forecasting framework for multi-regional PV power generation based on the Any-Quantile Recurrent Neural Network (AQ-RNN). The model integrates an any-quantile forecasting paradigm with a dual-track recurrent architecture that jointly processes series-specific and cross-regional contextual information, supported by dilated recurrent cells, patch-based temporal modeling, and a dynamic ensemble mechanism.
  The proposed framework enables the estimation of calibrated conditional quantiles at arbitrary probability levels within a single trained model and effectively exploits spatial dependencies to enhance robustness at the system level. The approach is evaluated using 30 years of hourly PV generation data from 259 European regions and compared against established statistical and neural probabilistic baselines. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in forecast accuracy, calibration, and prediction interval quality, underscoring the suitability of the proposed method for uncertainty-aware energy management and operational decision-making in renewable-dominated power systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Surjective Pseudo-invertible Neural Networks (SPNN) to generalize the Moore-Penrose Pseudo-inverse (PInv) to non-linear systems, enabling zero-shot inversion of complex degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the utility of PInv from linear systems to non-linear mappings, particularly neural networks, enabling solutions for non-linear inverse problems.

Method: Proposes SPNN, a class of architectures with tractable non-linear PInv, and formalizes Non-Linear Back-Projection (NLBP) to ensure consistency constraints.

Result: SPNNs enable zero-shot inversion of non-linear degradations, expanding the scope of inverse problems without retraining diffusion models.

Conclusion: The work successfully generalizes PInv to non-linear regimes, enhancing applicability in zero-shot inverse problem-solving with precise semantic control.

Abstract: The Moore-Penrose Pseudo-inverse (PInv) serves as the fundamental solution for linear systems. In this paper, we propose a natural generalization of PInv to the nonlinear regime in general and to neural networks in particular. We introduce Surjective Pseudo-invertible Neural Networks (SPNN), a class of architectures explicitly designed to admit a tractable non-linear PInv. The proposed non-linear PInv and its implementation in SPNN satisfy fundamental geometric properties. One such property is null-space projection or "Back-Projection", $x' = x + A^\dagger(y-Ax)$, which moves a sample $x$ to its closest consistent state $x'$ satisfying $Ax=y$. We formalize Non-Linear Back-Projection (NLBP), a method that guarantees the same consistency constraint for non-linear mappings $f(x)=y$ via our defined PInv. We leverage SPNNs to expand the scope of zero-shot inverse problems. Diffusion-based null-space projection has revolutionized zero-shot solving for linear inverse problems by exploiting closed-form back-projection. We extend this method to non-linear degradations. Here, "degradation" is broadly generalized to include any non-linear loss of information, spanning from optical distortions to semantic abstractions like classification. This approach enables zero-shot inversion of complex degradations and allows precise semantic control over generative outputs without retraining the diffusion prior.

TL;DR: SCLCS is a self-supervised framework for selecting small, representative core-sets to preserve the ranking of functional connectivity (FC) operators efficiently, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exhaustive evaluation of FC modeling methods is computationally prohibitive; SCLCS aims to make large-scale FC benchmarking feasible by selecting representative core-sets.

Method: Uses adaptive Transformer to learn FC structures, introduces Structural Perturbation Score (SPS) for stability, and employs density-balanced sampling for diversity.

Result: On REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS preserves ground-truth rankings with 10% data, outperforming SOTA by 23.2% in ranking consistency.

Conclusion: SCLCS formalizes core-set selection for FC benchmarking, enabling feasible large-scale comparisons in computational neuroscience.

Abstract: Benchmarking the hundreds of functional connectivity (FC) modeling methods on large-scale fMRI datasets is critical for reproducible neuroscience. However, the combinatorial explosion of model-data pairings makes exhaustive evaluation computationally prohibitive, preventing such assessments from becoming a routine pre-analysis step. To break this bottleneck, we reframe the challenge of FC benchmarking by selecting a small, representative core-set whose sole purpose is to preserve the relative performance ranking of FC operators. We formalize this as a ranking-preserving subset selection problem and propose Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Core-set Selection (SCLCS), a self-supervised framework to select these core-sets. SCLCS first uses an adaptive Transformer to learn each sample's unique FC structure. It then introduces a novel Structural Perturbation Score (SPS) to quantify the stability of these learned structures during training, identifying samples that represent foundational connectivity archetypes. Finally, while SCLCS identifies stable samples via a top-k ranking, we further introduce a density-balanced sampling strategy as a necessary correction to promote diversity, ensuring the final core-set is both structurally robust and distributionally representative. On the large-scale REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS preserves the ground-truth model ranking with just 10% of the data, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) core-set selection methods by up to 23.2% in ranking consistency (nDCG@k). To our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize core-set selection for FC operator benchmarking, thereby making large-scale operators comparisons a feasible and integral part of computational neuroscience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in efficiently adapting large pretrained models to new tasks without catastrophic forgetting or high retraining costs, which existing methods like LoRA fail to address adequately.

Method: Share dynamically updates a shared low-rank subspace, integrating core knowledge from past tasks and incrementally adding new information, enabling seamless adaptation across tasks and modalities.

Result: Share achieves up to 100x parameter reduction and 281x memory savings compared to LoRA, performing comparably to jointly trained models and replacing hundreds of task-specific adapters.

Conclusion: Share is a scalable and practical solution for continual learning in large-scale AI systems, validated across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Adapting large pretrained models to new tasks efficiently and continually is crucial for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to catastrophic forgetting and the high cost of retraining. While parameter-efficient tuning methods like low rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce computational demands, they lack mechanisms for strict continual learning and knowledge integration, without relying on data replay, or multiple adapters. We propose Share, a novel approach to parameter efficient continual finetuning that learns and dynamically updates a single, shared low-rank subspace, enabling seamless adaptation across multiple tasks and modalities. Share constructs a foundational subspace that extracts core knowledge from past tasks and incrementally integrates new information by identifying essential subspace directions. Knowledge from each new task is incorporated into this evolving subspace, facilitating forward knowledge transfer, while minimizing catastrophic interference. This approach achieves up to 100x parameter reduction and 281x memory savings over traditional LoRA methods, maintaining performance comparable to jointly trained models. A single Share model can replace hundreds of task-specific LoRA adapters, supporting scalable, asynchronous continual learning. Experiments across image classification, natural language understanding, 3D pose estimation, and text-to-image generation validate its effectiveness, making Share a practical and scalable solution for lifelong learning in large-scale AI systems.

### [279] [Stable but Wrong: When More Data Degrades Scientific Conclusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05668)
*Zhipeng Zhang,Kai Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals that accumulating more data can sometimes lead to incorrect conclusions due to unobservable degradation in observation reliability, challenging the assumption that more data always improves scientific validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to highlight a fundamental flaw in the implicit belief that larger datasets inherently lead to more reliable scientific conclusions, especially when observational reliability degrades in unobservable ways.

Method: The authors use minimal synthetic experiments to demonstrate scenarios where standard inference procedures fail despite appearing well-calibrated and passing diagnostic checks.

Result: The findings show that in certain structural regimes, additional data amplify errors rather than correct them, while diagnostics misleadingly appear normal.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that stability, convergence, and confidence are insufficient for epistemic validity and emphasizes the need for explicit constraints on observational integrity in inference processes.

Abstract: Modern science increasingly relies on ever-growing observational datasets and automated inference pipelines, under the implicit belief that accumulating more data makes scientific conclusions more reliable. Here we show that this belief can fail in a fundamental and irreversible way. We identify a structural regime in which standard inference procedures converge smoothly, remain well calibrated, and pass conventional diagnostic checks, yet systematically converge to incorrect conclusions. This failure arises when the reliability of observations degrades in a manner that is intrinsically unobservable to the inference process itself. Using minimal synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that in this regime additional data do not correct error but instead amplify it, while residual-based and goodness-of-fit diagnostics remain misleadingly normal. These results reveal an intrinsic limit of data-driven science: stability, convergence, and confidence are not sufficient indicators of epistemic validity. We argue that inference cannot be treated as an unconditional consequence of data availability, but must instead be governed by explicit constraints on the integrity of the observational process.

*Miriam Schäfers,Merlijn Krale,Thiago D. Simão,Nils Jansen,Maximilian Weininger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PBP framework integrates perception models into POMDP solvers to handle high-dimensional observations like images, improving performance and robustness against visual corruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional POMDP solvers struggle with high-dimensional observations (e.g., camera images), limiting their applicability in real-world problems.

Method: PBP uses an image classifier to map visual observations to state distributions, integrating these into belief updates without explicit reasoning over high-dimensional spaces. Uncertainty quantification is added to handle classifier imprecision.

Result: PBP outperforms deep RL methods and uncertainty quantification enhances robustness against visual corruption.

Conclusion: PBP effectively bridges perception and planning in POMDPs, offering scalable solutions for real-world problems with high-dimensional observations.

Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a principled planning model for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Yet, real-world problems with high-dimensional observations, such as camera images, remain intractable for traditional belief- and filtering-based solvers. To tackle this problem, we introduce the Perception-based Beliefs for POMDPs framework (PBP), which complements such solvers with a perception model. This model takes the form of an image classifier which maps visual observations to probability distributions over states. PBP incorporates these distributions directly into belief updates, so the underlying solver does not need to reason explicitly over high-dimensional observation spaces. We show that the belief update of PBP coincides with the standard belief update if the image classifier is exact. Moreover, to handle classifier imprecision, we incorporate uncertainty quantification and introduce two methods to adjust the belief update accordingly. We implement PBP using two traditional POMDP solvers and empirically show that (1) it outperforms existing end-to-end deep RL methods and (2) uncertainty quantification improves robustness of PBP against visual corruption.

*Alex Vitvitskyi,Michael Boratko,Matej Grcic,Razvan Pascanu,Deep Shah,Petar Veličković*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using evolutionary search, particularly AlphaEvolve with LLMs, to discover activation functions efficiently, targeting both performance and inductive biases via synthetic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve optimization and expressivity in neural networks by automating the discovery of activation functions using evolutionary search, while encoding specific inductive biases.

Method: Utilizes AlphaEvolve, leveraging LLMs as mutator operators, to search over all possible Python functions within a FLOP budget, avoiding manual search spaces. Uses out-of-distribution performance as a fitness function.

Result: Demonstrates that small-scale synthetic datasets suffice for AlphaEvolve to find meaningful activation functions, highlighting efficiency and flexibility.

Conclusion: Evolutionary search with modern pipelines like AlphaEvolve effectively discovers activation functions, targeting performance and inductive biases without extensive manual intervention.

Abstract: The choice of activation function is an active area of research, with different proposals aimed at improving optimization, while maintaining expressivity. Additionally, the activation function can significantly alter the implicit inductive bias of the architecture, controlling its non-linear behavior. In this paper, in line with previous work, we argue that evolutionary search provides a useful framework for finding new activation functions, while we also make two novel observations. The first is that modern pipelines, such as AlphaEvolve, which relies on frontier LLMs as a mutator operator, allows for a much wider and flexible search space; e.g., over all possible python functions within a certain FLOP budget, eliminating the need for manually constructed search spaces. In addition, these pipelines will be biased towards meaningful activation functions, given their ability to represent common knowledge, leading to a potentially more efficient search of the space. The second observation is that, through this framework, one can target not only performance improvements but also activation functions that encode particular inductive biases. This can be done by using performance on out-of-distribution data as a fitness function, reflecting the degree to which the architecture respects the inherent structure in the data in a manner independent of distribution shifts. We carry an empirical exploration of this proposal and show that relatively small scale synthetic datasets can be sufficient for AlphaEvolve to discover meaningful activations.

Motivation: 

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: We propose a new analysis framework for clustering $M$ items into an unknown number of $K$ distinct groups using noisy and actively collected responses. At each time step, an agent is allowed to query pairs of items and observe bandit binary feedback. If the pair of items belongs to the same (resp.\ different) cluster, the observed feedback is $1$ with probability $p>1/2$ (resp.\ $q<1/2$). Leveraging the ubiquitous change-of-measure technique, we establish a fundamental lower bound on the expected number of queries needed to achieve a desired confidence in the clustering accuracy, formulated as a sup-inf optimization problem. Building on this theoretical foundation, we design an asymptotically optimal algorithm in which the stopping criterion involves an empirical version of the inner infimum -- the Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) statistic -- being compared to a threshold. We develop a computationally feasible variant of the GLR statistic and show that its performance gap to the lower bound can be accurately empirically estimated and remains within a constant multiple of the lower bound.

*Arno Geimer,Beltran Fiz Pontiveros,Radu State*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedRandom is introduced as a novel method to mitigate instability in assessing participant contributions in Federated Learning, improving consistency and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for fair and stable assessment of participant contributions in Federated Learning, addressing costs, compensation, and identifying malicious actors or free-riders.

Method: FedRandom tackles instability statistically by generating more samples than regular FL strategies, providing consistent contribution evaluations.

Result: FedRandom reduces distance to ground truth by over a third in 50% of scenarios and improves stability in 90% of cases across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: FedRandom effectively addresses contribution instability, enhancing participant trust and engagement in Federated Learning.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach for Machine Learning tasks. In industry deployments characterized by a limited number of entities possessing abundant data, the significance of a participant's role in shaping the global model becomes pivotal given that participation in a federation incurs costs, and participants may expect compensation for their involvement. Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem. Tackling the instability as a statistical estimation problem, FedRandom allows us to generate more samples than when using regular FL strategies. We show that these additional samples provide a more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions. We demonstrate our approach using different data distributions across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100 and FMNIST and show that FedRandom reduces the overall distance to the ground truth by more than a third in half of all evaluated scenarios, and improves stability in more than 90% of cases.

### [284] [Limitations of SGD for Multi-Index Models Beyond Statistical Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05704)
*Daniel Barzilai,Ohad Shamir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations of SGD by introducing a new framework to study its behavior without relying on the SQ framework, focusing on single-index and multi-index models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools like the SQ framework inadequately capture SGD's noise characteristics, leading to incorrect predictions. Many analyses also require non-trivial algorithmic modifications, prompting the need for a more accurate framework.

Method: The authors develop a novel non-SQ framework to analyze standard vanilla SGD's limitations, focusing on single-index and multi-index models. The approach applies broadly, including to neural networks.

Result: The proposed framework provides a more accurate analysis of SGD's limitations without relying on adversarial noise or algorithmic modifications.

Conclusion: The new framework offers a better understanding of SGD's fundamental limitations, applicable across diverse settings and architectures.

Abstract: Understanding the limitations of gradient methods, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in particular, is a central challenge in learning theory. To that end, a commonly used tool is the Statistical Queries (SQ) framework, which studies performance limits of algorithms based on noisy interaction with the data. However, it is known that the formal connection between the SQ framework and SGD is tenuous: Existing results typically rely on adversarial or specially-structured gradient noise that does not reflect the noise in standard SGD, and (as we point out here) can sometimes lead to incorrect predictions. Moreover, many analyses of SGD for challenging problems rely on non-trivial algorithmic modifications, such as restricting the SGD trajectory to the sphere or using very small learning rates. To address these shortcomings, we develop a new, non-SQ framework to study the limitations of standard vanilla SGD, for single-index and multi-index models (namely, when the target function depends on a low-dimensional projection of the inputs). Our results apply to a broad class of settings and architectures, including (potentially deep) neural networks.

### [285] [Fix Representation (Optimally) Before Fairness: Finite-Sample Shrinkage Population Correction and the True Price of Fairness Under Subpopulation Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05707)
*Amir Asiaee,Kaveh Aryan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how fairness interventions in machine learning can appear to either harm or help predictive accuracy due to misrepresented subgroup proportions in training data. It introduces an evaluation protocol to isolate the true tradeoff between fairness and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to resolve the observed tension between predictive accuracy and group fairness constraints, identifying that misrepresented subgroup proportions in training data can lead to misleading conclusions about fairness interventions.

Method: The authors analyze subpopulation shift conditions, propose an optimal finite-sample correction (shrinkage reweighting), and suggest evaluating fairness interventions against a properly-weighted baseline using synthetic and real-world datasets (Adult, COMPAS).

Result: Theoretical predictions show that fairness interventions can improve accuracy under certain conditions. Experiments confirm the protocol's effectiveness in eliminating spurious tradeoffs and revealing the true fairness-utility frontier.

Conclusion: Properly accounting for subgroup proportions in training data is crucial for evaluating fairness interventions. The proposed protocol ensures accurate assessment of the fairness-utility tradeoff.

Abstract: Machine learning practitioners frequently observe tension between predictive accuracy and group fairness constraints -- yet sometimes fairness interventions appear to improve accuracy. We show that both phenomena can be artifacts of training data that misrepresents subgroup proportions. Under subpopulation shift (stable within-group distributions, shifted group proportions), we establish: (i) full importance-weighted correction is asymptotically unbiased but finite-sample suboptimal; (ii) the optimal finite-sample correction is a shrinkage reweighting that interpolates between target and training mixtures; (iii) apparent "fairness helps accuracy" can arise from comparing fairness methods to an improperly-weighted baseline. We provide an actionable evaluation protocol: fix representation (optimally) before fairness -- compare fairness interventions against a shrinkage-corrected baseline to isolate the true, irreducible price of fairness. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks (Adult, COMPAS) validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that this protocol eliminates spurious tradeoffs, revealing the genuine fairness-utility frontier.

*Amir Asiaee,Kaveh Aryan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairBoost incorporates fairness constraints into boosting while maintaining theoretical guarantees, balancing accuracy-fairness tradeoffs through projecting distributions and quantifying the cost of fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to integrate group fairness constraints into boosting algorithms without losing the analyzable training dynamics that AdaBoost offers.

Method: FairBoost projects the exponential-weights distribution onto a convex set meeting fairness constraints, then trains weak learners on this fair distribution.

Result: Theoretical insights show reduced weak learner edge controlled by KL-divergence, with experiments confirming competitive fairness-accuracy tradeoffs.

Conclusion: FairBoost successfully balances fairness and accuracy in boosting, supported by theoretical bounds and empirical validation.

Abstract: Boosting algorithms enjoy strong theoretical guarantees: when weak learners maintain positive edge, AdaBoost achieves geometric decrease of exponential loss. We study how to incorporate group fairness constraints into boosting while preserving analyzable training dynamics. Our approach, FairBoost, projects the ensemble-induced exponential-weights distribution onto a convex set of distributions satisfying fairness constraints (as a reweighting surrogate), then trains weak learners on this fair distribution. The key theoretical insight is that projecting the training distribution reduces the effective edge of weak learners by a quantity controlled by the KL-divergence of the projection. We prove an exponential-loss bound where the convergence rate depends on weak learner edge minus a "fairness cost" term $δ_t = \sqrt{\mathrm{KL}(w^t \| q^t)/2}$. This directly quantifies the accuracy-fairness tradeoff in boosting dynamics. Experiments on standard benchmarks validate the theoretical predictions and demonstrate competitive fairness-accuracy tradeoffs with stable training curves.

*Binghui Li,Kaifei Wang,Han Zhong,Pinyan Lu,Liwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Muon optimizer improves convergence by balancing learning rates of frequency components, offering exponential speedups over GD in noiseless cases and superior scaling in noisy setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand Muon's dynamics and scaling behavior, which show empirical gains but lack theoretical clarity, especially in hierarchical frequency settings with and without label noise.

Method: Analyzes Muon in a linear associative memory model with softmax retrieval and hierarchical frequency spectra, comparing it to Gradient Descent (GD). Explores noiseless and noisy cases.

Result: Muon mitigates imbalanced learning rates of frequency components, achieving exponential speedups over GD in noiseless cases and better scaling in noisy scenarios. It acts as an implicit matrix preconditioner.

Conclusion: Muon's adaptive task alignment and block-symmetric gradient structure make it more efficient than GD, particularly in hierarchical frequency settings, supported by synthetic and real-world experiments.

Abstract: Muon updates matrix parameters via the matrix sign of the gradient and has shown strong empirical gains, yet its dynamics and scaling behavior remain unclear in theory. We study Muon in a linear associative memory model with softmax retrieval and a hierarchical frequency spectrum over query-answer pairs, with and without label noise. In this setting, we show that Gradient Descent (GD) learns frequency components at highly imbalanced rates, leading to slow convergence bottlenecked by low-frequency components. In contrast, the Muon optimizer mitigates this imbalance, leading to faster and more uniform progress. Specifically, in the noiseless case, Muon achieves an exponential speedup over GD; in the noisy case with a power-decay frequency spectrum, we derive Muon's optimization scaling law and demonstrate its superior scaling efficiency over GD. Furthermore, we show that Muon can be interpreted as an implicit matrix preconditioner arising from adaptive task alignment and block-symmetric gradient structure. In contrast, the preconditioner with coordinate-wise sign operator could match Muon under oracle access to unknown task representations, which is infeasible for SignGD in practice. Experiments on synthetic long-tail classification and LLaMA-style pre-training corroborate the theory.

TL;DR: CSRv2 improves ultra-sparse embeddings via progressive k-annealing and supervised contrastive objectives, reducing inactive neurons and enhancing efficiency without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of dense embeddings and severe degradation of CSR in ultra-sparse regimes.

Method: CSRv2 stabilizes sparsity learning with progressive k-annealing, uses supervised contrastive objectives, and ensures adaptability with full backbone finetuning.

Result: Reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20%, achieves a 14% accuracy gain at k=2, and offers 7x speedup over MRL with 300x efficiency improvements over dense embeddings.

Conclusion: CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical, benefiting real-time and edge-deployable AI systems.

Abstract: In the era of large foundation models, the quality of embeddings has become a central determinant of downstream task performance and overall system capability. Yet widely used dense embeddings are often extremely high-dimensional, incurring substantial costs in storage, memory, and inference latency. To address these, Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) is recently proposed as a promising direction, mapping dense embeddings into high-dimensional but k-sparse vectors, in contrast to compact dense embeddings such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). Despite its promise, CSR suffers severe degradation in the ultra-sparse regime, where over 80% of neurons remain inactive, leaving much of its efficiency potential unrealized. In this paper, we introduce CSRv2, a principled training approach designed to make ultra-sparse embeddings viable. CSRv2 stabilizes sparsity learning through progressive k-annealing, enhances representational quality via supervised contrastive objectives, and ensures end-to-end adaptability with full backbone finetuning. CSRv2 reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20% and delivers a 14% accuracy gain at k=2, bringing ultra-sparse embeddings on par with CSR at k=8 and MRL at 32 dimensions, all with only two active features. While maintaining comparable performance, CSRv2 delivers a 7x speedup over MRL, and yields up to 300x improvements in compute and memory efficiency relative to dense embeddings in text representation. Extensive experiments across text and vision demonstrate that CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical without compromising performance, where CSRv2 achieves 7%/4% improvement over CSR when k=4 and further increases this gap to 14%/6% when k=2 in text/vision representation. By making extreme sparsity viable, CSRv2 broadens the design space for real-time and edge-deployable AI systems where both embedding quality and efficiency are critical.

Motivation: Prompt injection is a critical vulnerability in LLM agents, but current methods rely on human efforts and lack scalability.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning to generate universal adversarial suffixes, supporting query-based optimization and transfer attacks.

Result: Achieves successful attacks on frontier systems like GPT-5 Nano, Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Gemini 2.5 Flash.

Conclusion: AutoInject establishes a robust baseline for automated prompt injection research, demonstrating scalability and adaptability.

Abstract: Prompt injection is one of the most critical vulnerabilities in LLM agents; yet, effective automated attacks remain largely unexplored from an optimization perspective. Existing methods heavily depend on human red-teamers and hand-crafted prompts, limiting their scalability and adaptability. We propose AutoInject, a reinforcement learning framework that generates universal, transferable adversarial suffixes while jointly optimizing for attack success and utility preservation on benign tasks. Our black-box method supports both query-based optimization and transfer attacks to unseen models and tasks. Using only a 1.5B parameter adversarial suffix generator, we successfully compromise frontier systems including GPT 5 Nano, Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Gemini 2.5 Flash on the AgentDojo benchmark, establishing a stronger baseline for automated prompt injection research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep clustering's advantage over k-means is questioned, especially beyond image datasets. DEC's ability to overcome k-means limitations is scrutinized, revealing a non-deep method may perform better using distributional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if deep clustering (DEC) truly overcomes k-means' limitations—like handling arbitrary cluster shapes, sizes, and densities—and to explore if non-deep methods can achieve the same goals more effectively.

Method: Analyzes DEC's deep-learned representation and compares it with a non-deep approach that leverages cluster distributional information.

Result: Finds that DEC does not fully address k-means' limitations, and a non-deep method using distributional data outperforms DEC in overcoming these challenges.

Conclusion: Deep clustering may not inherently surpass k-means' limitations; leveraging distributional information in simpler methods can be more effective.

Abstract: Deep clustering (DC) is often quoted to have a key advantage over $k$-means clustering. Yet, this advantage is often demonstrated using image datasets only, and it is unclear whether it addresses the fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering. Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) learns a latent representation via an autoencoder and performs clustering based on a $k$-means-like procedure, while the optimization is conducted in an end-to-end manner. This paper investigates whether the deep-learned representation has enabled DEC to overcome the known fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering, i.e., its inability to discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, varied sizes and densities. Our investigations on DEC have a wider implication on deep clustering methods in general. Notably, none of these methods exploit the underlying data distribution. We uncover that a non-deep learning approach achieves the intended aim of deep clustering by making use of distributional information of clusters in a dataset to effectively address these fundamental limitations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Variational Speculative Decoding (VSD) improves LLM/MLLM inference by optimizing draft training as variational inference, maximizing acceptance probability and enhancing decoding efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speculative decoding methods focus on single greedy trajectories, creating a discrepancy with decoding which involves multiple draft paths. VSD addresses this by optimizing draft training to align with actual decoding dynamics.

Method: VSD formulates draft training as variational inference over latent proposals (draft paths), maximizing marginal acceptance probability via an ELBO. It uses an Expectation-Maximization procedure with MCMC sampling and Adaptive Rejection Weighting (ARW) plus Confidence-Aware Regularization (CAR) for optimization.

Result: VSD achieves up to 9.6% speedup over EAGLE-3 and 7.9% over ViSpec in experiments across LLMs and MLLMs, enhancing decoding efficiency.

Conclusion: VSD effectively bridges the training-decoding gap, improving speedup and efficiency in speculative decoding for large language models.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates inference for (M)LLMs, yet a training-decoding discrepancy persists: while existing methods optimize single greedy trajectories, decoding involves verifying and ranking multiple sampled draft paths. We propose Variational Speculative Decoding (VSD), formulating draft training as variational inference over latent proposals (draft paths). VSD maximizes the marginal probability of target-model acceptance, yielding an ELBO that promotes high-quality latent proposals while minimizing divergence from the target distribution. To enhance quality and reduce variance, we incorporate a path-level utility and optimize via an Expectation-Maximization procedure. The E-step draws MCMC samples from an oracle-filtered posterior, while the M-step maximizes weighted likelihood using Adaptive Rejection Weighting (ARW) and Confidence-Aware Regularization (CAR). Theoretical analysis confirms that VSD increases expected acceptance length and speedup. Extensive experiments across LLMs and MLLMs show that VSD achieves up to a 9.6% speedup over EAGLE-3 and 7.9% over ViSpec, significantly improving decoding efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing suboptimal performance from merging mismatched dynamics datasets in cross-domain offline RL.

Method: Uses inverse policy and reward models to correct source actions/rewards, retained via a forward dynamics model.

Result: STC outperforms existing methods in environments with dynamics shifts.

Conclusion: STC effectively exploits source domain data for reliable policy adaptation.

Abstract: It remains a critical challenge to adapt policies across domains with mismatched dynamics in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we study cross-domain offline RL, where an offline dataset from another similar source domain can be accessed to enhance policy learning upon a target domain dataset. Directly merging the two datasets may lead to suboptimal performance due to potential dynamics mismatches. Existing approaches typically mitigate this issue through source domain transition filtering or reward modification, which, however, may lead to insufficient exploitation of the valuable source domain data. Instead, we propose to modify the source domain data into the target domain data. To that end, we leverage an inverse policy model and a reward model to correct the actions and rewards of source transitions, explicitly achieving alignment with the target dynamics. Since limited data may result in inaccurate model training, we further employ a forward dynamics model to retain corrected samples that better match the target dynamics than the original transitions. Consequently, we propose the Selective Transition Correction (STC) algorithm, which enables reliable usage of source domain data for policy adaptation. Experiments on various environments with dynamics shifts demonstrate that STC achieves superior performance against existing baselines.

TL;DR: Larger Gaussian process variances improve expressivity and training stability in deep networks with sparse activations, achieving high accuracy even at 90% sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance the training and expressivity of deep networks with sparsity-inducing activations, potentially reducing energy consumption in models with fully connected layers.

Method: The Edge-of-Chaos (EoC) initialisation strategy is used to analyse Gaussian process variances in intermediate layers, specifically focusing on shifted and clipped ReLU activations.

Result: Initialisations with larger Gaussian process variances enable high activation sparsity (up to 90%) while maintaining accuracy in DNNs and CNNs, improving training stability.

Conclusion: The findings suggest a viable approach to reduce energy usage in machine learning models by leveraging high sparsity levels without compromising performance.

Abstract: The intermediate layers of deep networks can be characterised as a Gaussian process, in particular the Edge-of-Chaos (EoC) initialisation strategy prescribes the limiting covariance matrix of the Gaussian process. Here we show that the under-utilised chosen variance of the Gaussian process is important in the training of deep networks with sparsity inducing activation, such as a shifted and clipped ReLU, $\text{CReLU}_{τ,m}(x)=\min(\max(x-τ,0),m)$. Specifically, initialisations leading to larger fixed Gaussian process variances, allow for improved expressivity with activation sparsity as large as 90% in DNNs and CNNs, and generally improve the stability of the training process. Enabling full, or near full, accuracy at such high levels of sparsity in the hidden layers suggests a promising mechanism to reduce the energy consumption of machine learning models involving fully connected layers.

*Shutong Ding,Yimiao Zhou,Ke Hu,Mokai Pan,Shan Zhong,Yanwei Fu,Jingya Wang,Ye Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel distributional RL method called Diffusion Bridge Critics (DBC), which models the inverse CDF of Q values using a diffusion bridge for accurate value distribution estimation. DBC outperforms existing distributional critic models in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based RL methods primarily focus on policies, neglecting the importance of accurate value estimation via critics. The stochastic nature of RL tasks also suggests critics should be distributional. DBC addresses these gaps.

Method: DBC models the inverse CDF of Q values using a diffusion bridge, avoiding collapse into trivial Gaussian distributions. It also includes an analytic integral formula to mitigate discretization errors.

Result: Experiments on MuJoCo benchmarks show DBC surpasses previous distributional critic models, proving its effectiveness in capturing accurate value distributions.

Conclusion: DBC is the first to use a diffusion bridge as a critic, offering superior performance and compatibility with existing RL frameworks as a plug-and-play component.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated promising results in a wide range of continuous control tasks. However, existing works in this field focus on the application of diffusion policies while leaving the diffusion critics unexplored. In fact, since policy optimization fundamentally relies on the critic, accurate value estimation is far more important than policy expressiveness. Furthermore, given the stochasticity of most reinforcement learning tasks, it has been confirmed that the critic is more appropriately depicted with a distributional model. Motivated by these points, we propose a novel distributional RL method with Diffusion Bridge Critics (DBC). DBC directly models the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Q value. This allows us to accurately capture the value distribution and prevents it from collapsing into a trivial Gaussian distribution owing to the strong distribution-matching capability of the diffusion bridge. Moreover, we further derive an analytic integral formula to address discretization errors in DBC, which is essential in value estimation. To our knowledge, DBC is the first work to employ the diffusion bridge model as the critic. Notably, DBC is also a plug-and-play component and can be integrated into most existing RL frameworks. Experimental results on MuJoCo robot control benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DBC compared with previous distributional critic models.

### [295] [Classification Under Local Differential Privacy with Model Reversal and Model Averaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05797)
*Caihong Qin,Yang Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the utility loss in local differential privacy (LDP) by framing it as a transfer learning problem, introducing three novel techniques to improve classification accuracy without sacrificing privacy, and validating them with theoretical and empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDP provides strong privacy guarantees but often degrades data utility due to noise. The paper aims to mitigate this tradeoff by leveraging transfer learning principles.

Method: The authors propose three techniques: a noised binary feedback mechanism, model reversal to adjust classifier boundaries, and model averaging to weigh reversed classifiers. Theoretical risk bounds under LDP are derived.

Result: Empirical evaluations on simulated and real-world datasets show significant improvements in classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively enhance data utility in LDP settings while maintaining privacy, validated by theoretical and experimental outcomes.

Abstract: Local differential privacy (LDP) has become a central topic in data privacy research, offering strong privacy guarantees by perturbing user data at the source and removing the need for a trusted curator. However, the noise introduced by LDP often significantly reduces data utility. To address this issue, we reinterpret private learning under LDP as a transfer learning problem, where the noisy data serve as the source domain and the unobserved clean data as the target. We propose novel techniques specifically designed for LDP to improve classification performance without compromising privacy: (1) a noised binary feedback-based evaluation mechanism for estimating dataset utility; (2) model reversal, which salvages underperforming classifiers by inverting their decision boundaries; and (3) model averaging, which assigns weights to multiple reversed classifiers based on their estimated utility. We provide theoretical excess risk bounds under LDP and demonstrate how our methods reduce this risk. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets show substantial improvements in classification accuracy.

*Quan M. Tran,Zhuo Huang,Wenbin Zhang,Bo Han,Koji Yatani,Masashi Sugiyama,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bifrost is a training-free method that adapts past trajectories to new tasks by leveraging context differences, outperforming existing approaches without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the context mismatch issue when reusing successful task trajectories across different tasks, which existing methods handle inefficiently or unreliably.

Method: Bifrost uses context-trajectory correlation to guide adaptation of trajectories at the representation level, aligning them with the target task.

Result: Bifrost consistently outperforms other trajectory reuse and finetuned methods across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: Agents can effectively leverage past experiences despite significant context shifts, thanks to Bifrost's precise adaptation approach.

Abstract: Autonomous agents excel in self-improvement through reflection and iterative refinement, which reuse successful task trajectories as in-context examples to assist subsequent reasoning. However, shifting across tasks often introduces a context mismatch. Hence, existing approaches either discard the trajectories or manipulate them using heuristics, leading to a non-negligible fine-tuning cost or unguaranteed performance. To bridge this gap, we reveal a context-trajectory correlation, where shifts of context are highly parallel with shifts of trajectory. Based on this finding, we propose BrIdge contextual gap FoR imprOvised trajectory STeering (Bifrost), a training-free method that leverages context differences to precisely guide the adaptation of previously solved trajectories towards the target task, mitigating the misalignment caused by context shifts. Our trajectory adaptation is conducted at the representation level using agent hidden states, ensuring trajectory transformation accurately aligns with the target context in a shared space. Across diverse benchmarks, Bifrost consistently outperforms existing trajectory reuse and finetuned self-improvement methods, demonstrating that agents can effectively leverage past experiences despite substantial context shifts.

*Matteo Gätzner,Johannes Kirschner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for confidence estimation in CT reconstruction with theoretical guarantees, applicable to both classical and deep learning methods. Deep methods yield tighter confidence regions without losing coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide reliable confidence estimation for CT reconstructions, addressing uncertainties in deep-learning-based methods and ensuring theoretical coverage guarantees.

Method: Uses sequential likelihood mixing framework under a realistic forward model (log-linear with Poisson noise). Evaluated on classical algorithms and deep learning methods like U-Nets and Diffusion models.

Result: Deep reconstructions produce tighter confidence regions than classical methods while maintaining theoretical coverage. Detects hallucinations and provides interpretable visualizations.

Conclusion: Deep models are validated as robust, uncertainty-aware tools for medical imaging, combining power and reliability in reconstruction and confidence estimation.

Abstract: We present a principled framework for confidence estimation in computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. Based on the sequential likelihood mixing framework (Kirschner et al., 2025), we establish confidence regions with theoretical coverage guarantees for deep-learning-based CT reconstructions. We consider a realistic forward model following the Beer-Lambert law, i.e., a log-linear forward model with Poisson noise, closely reflecting clinical and scientific imaging conditions. The framework is general and applies to both classical algorithms and deep learning reconstruction methods, including U-Nets, U-Net ensembles, and generative Diffusion models. Empirically, we demonstrate that deep reconstruction methods yield substantially tighter confidence regions than classical reconstructions, without sacrificing theoretical coverage guarantees. Our approach allows the detection of hallucinations in reconstructed images and provides interpretable visualizations of confidence regions. This establishes deep models not only as powerful estimators, but also as reliable tools for uncertainty-aware medical imaging.

*Artem Riabinin,Andrey Veprikov,Arman Bolatov,Martin Takáč,Aleksandr Beznosikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive learning rate scheduler for norm-constrained optimizers, validated by theory and empirical results, showing improved performance in LLM pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve learning rate scheduling by leveraging theoretical insights into local curvature and suboptimality gaps, eliminating manual tuning.

Method: Develops a learning rate scheduler based on curvature assumptions, tested on LLaMA architectures.

Result: Outperforms manual warm-up schedules in LLM pretraining without additional hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: The adaptive scheduler is theoretically grounded and practically effective.

Abstract: We study adaptive learning rate scheduling for norm-constrained optimizers (e.g., Muon and Lion). We introduce a generalized smoothness assumption under which local curvature decreases with the suboptimality gap and empirically verify that this behavior holds along optimization trajectories. Under this assumption, we establish convergence guarantees under an appropriate choice of learning rate, for which warm-up followed by decay arises naturally from the proof rather than being imposed heuristically.
  Building on this theory, we develop a practical learning rate scheduler that relies only on standard hyperparameters and adapts the warm-up duration automatically at the beginning of training. We evaluate this method on large language model pretraining with LLaMA architectures and show that our adaptive warm-up selection consistently outperforms or at least matches the best manually tuned warm-up schedules across all considered setups, without additional hyperparameter search.

### [299] [Synthesizing Realistic Test Data without Breaking Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05833)
*Laura Plein,Alexi Turcotte,Arina Hallemans,Andreas Zeller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to generate synthetic datasets with statistical properties matching original data without direct use of original data, enhancing privacy while maintaining utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GAN-based synthetic data methods are either inaccurate or vulnerable to privacy attacks due to direct use of original data.

Method: Uses a test generator (fuzzer) and discriminator to evolve samples indirectly, preserving original data constraints and statistical properties.

Result: Evaluated on four datasets, the approach shows high utility and privacy preservation compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The method effectively generates privacy-preserving synthetic data with statistical fidelity to original datasets.

Abstract: There is a need for synthetic training and test datasets that replicate statistical distributions of original datasets without compromising their confidentiality. A lot of research has been done in leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic data generation. However, the resulting models are either not accurate enough or are still vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIA) or dataset reconstruction attacks since the original data has been leveraged in the training process. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of producing a synthetic test dataset with the same statistical properties as the original one, with only indirectly leveraging the original data in the generation process. The approach is inspired by GANs, with a generation step and a discrimination step. However, in our approach, we use a test generator (a fuzzer) to produce test data from an input specification, preserving constraints set by the original data; a discriminator model determines how close we are to the original data. By evolving samples and determining "good samples" with the discriminator, we can generate privacy-preserving data that follows the same statistical distributions are the original dataset, leading to a similar utility as the original data. We evaluated our approach on four datasets that have been used to evaluate the state-of-the-art techniques. Our experiments highlight the potential of our approach towards generating synthetic datasets that have high utility while preserving privacy.

### [300] [Visualizing the loss landscapes of physics-informed neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05849)
*Conor Rowan,Finn Murphy-Blanchard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the loss landscapes of physics-informed neural networks, comparing them to traditional data-driven models and finding surprising similarities in their smoothness and convexity near solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the success of training physics-informed neural networks by analyzing their loss landscapes, a topic previously limited to image classification tasks.

Method: The authors review existing loss landscape literature, apply visualization techniques to physics-informed networks, and empirically analyze landscapes defined by Deep Ritz and squared residual loss forms.

Result: Physics-informed loss landscapes resemble those of data-driven models: smooth, well-conditioned, and convex near solutions. Unexpectedly, both loss formulations produce similar landscapes.

Conclusion: The work bridges loss landscape analysis to scientific machine learning, challenges assumptions about complexity, and highlights similarities between physics-informed and traditional networks.

Abstract: Training a neural network requires navigating a high-dimensional, non-convex loss surface to find parameters that minimize this loss. In many ways, it is surprising that optimizers such as stochastic gradient descent and ADAM can reliably locate minima which perform well on both the training and test data. To understand the success of training, a "loss landscape" community has emerged to study the geometry of the loss function and the dynamics of optimization, often using visualization techniques. However, these loss landscape studies have mostly been limited to machine learning for image classification. In the newer field of physics-informed machine learning, little work has been conducted to visualize the landscapes of losses defined not by regression to large data sets, but by differential operators acting on state fields discretized by neural networks. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review of the loss landscape literature, as well as a discussion of the few existing physics-informed works which investigate the loss landscape. We then use a number of the techniques we survey to empirically investigate the landscapes defined by the Deep Ritz and squared residual forms of the physics loss function. We find that the loss landscapes of physics-informed neural networks have many of the same properties as the data-driven classification problems studied in the literature. Unexpectedly, we find that the two formulations of the physics loss often give rise to similar landscapes, which appear smooth, well-conditioned, and convex in the vicinity of the solution. The purpose of this work is to introduce the loss landscape perspective to the scientific machine learning community, compare the Deep Ritz and the strong form losses, and to challenge prevailing intuitions about the complexity of the loss landscapes of physics-informed networks.

*Amir R. Asadi,Akbar Davoodi,Ramin Javadi,Farzad Parvaresh*

TL;DR: The paper studies exact community recovery in networks using the Data Block Model (DBM), characterizing thresholds and providing an efficient algorithm validated by simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world networks often include node attributes beyond connectivity, motivating extension of the stochastic block model (SBM) to incorporate such data.

Method: Introduces the Chernoff--TV divergence to analyze exact recovery thresholds in DBM and proposes an efficient algorithm.

Result: Achieves a sharp exact recovery threshold for DBM and demonstrates feasibility via simulations.

Conclusion: Incorporating node data improves community detection, with theoretical guarantees and practical validation.

Abstract: Community detection in networks is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistical inference, with applications in social networks, biological systems, and communication networks. The stochastic block model (SBM) serves as a canonical framework for studying community structure, and exact recovery, identifying the true communities with high probability, is a central theoretical question. While classical results characterize the phase transition for exact recovery based solely on graph connectivity, many real-world networks contain additional data, such as node attributes or labels. In this work, we study exact recovery in the Data Block Model (DBM), an SBM augmented with node-associated data, as formalized by Asadi, Abbe, and Verdú (2017). We introduce the Chernoff--TV divergence and use it to characterize a sharp exact recovery threshold for the DBM. We further provide an efficient algorithm that achieves this threshold, along with a matching converse result showing impossibility below the threshold. Finally, simulations validate our findings and demonstrate the benefits of incorporating vertex data as side information in community detection.

TL;DR: CFRecs is a framework transforming counterfactual graph explanations into actionable insights for recommender systems, tested on Zillow's housing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving model interpretability and providing actionable recommendations for users in competitive markets like housing.

Method: Employs a two-stage architecture with GNN and Graph-VAE to suggest minimal, impactful changes in graph structure and attributes.

Result: Effectively delivers actionable recommendations on Zillow's data, showcasing utility in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: CFRecs offers a novel perspective on recommendations using counterfactual reasoning, proven effective in practical applications.

Abstract: Graph-structured data is ubiquitous and powerful in representing complex relationships in many online platforms. While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used to learn from such data, counterfactual graph learning has emerged as a promising approach to improve model interpretability. Counterfactual explanation research focuses on identifying a counterfactual graph that is similar to the original but leads to different predictions. These explanations optimize two objectives simultaneously: the sparsity of changes in the counterfactual graph and the validity of its predictions. Building on these qualitative optimization goals, this paper introduces CFRecs, a novel framework that transforms counterfactual explanations into actionable insights. CFRecs employs a two-stage architecture consisting of a graph neural network (GNN) and a graph variational auto-encoder (Graph-VAE) to strategically propose minimal yet high-impact changes in graph structure and node attributes to drive desirable outcomes in recommender systems. We apply CFRecs to Zillow's graph-structured data to deliver actionable recommendations for both home buyers and sellers with the goal of helping them navigate the competitive housing market and achieve their homeownership goals. Experimental results on Zillow's user-listing interaction data demonstrate the effectiveness of CFRecs, which also provides a fresh perspective on recommendations using counterfactual reasoning in graphs.

*Minyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable score-based variational inference method for Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), avoiding reparametrized sampling and enabling use with large-scale models like Vision Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VI methods like ELBO-based approaches dominate BNN inference, but score-based alternatives are often inadequate for large-scale BNNs. The paper aims to address this gap with a scalable solution.

Method: Proposes a novel VI method combining score matching loss and proximal penalty, leveraging stochastic gradients for noisy unbiased mini-batch scores. This avoids reparametrized sampling.

Result: Empirical tests on visual recognition and time-series forecasting show the method's effectiveness with large-scale deep networks, including Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: The introduced score-based VI method is scalable and outperforms traditional approaches for large-scale BNNs, offering broader applicability and richer variational density families.

Abstract: Bayesian (deep) neural networks (BNN) are often more attractive than the mainstream point-estimate vanilla deep learning in various aspects including uncertainty quantification, robustness to noise, resistance to overfitting, and more. The variational inference (VI) is one of the most widely adopted approximate inference methods. Whereas the ELBO-based variational free energy method is a dominant choice in the literature, in this paper we introduce a score-based alternative for BNN variational inference. Although there have been quite a few score-based variational inference methods proposed in the community, most are not adequate for large-scale BNNs for various computational and technical reasons. We propose a novel scalable VI method where the learning objective combines the score matching loss and the proximal penalty term in iterations, which helps our method avoid the reparametrized sampling, and allows for noisy unbiased mini-batch scores through stochastic gradients. This in turn makes our method scalable to large-scale neural networks including Vision Transformers, and allows for richer variational density families. On several benchmarks including visual recognition and time-series forecasting with large-scale deep networks, we empirically show the effectiveness of our approach.

### [304] [Escaping Local Minima Provably in Non-convex Matrix Sensing: A Deterministic Framework via Simulated Lifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05887)
*Tianqi Shen,Jinji Yang,Junze He,Kunhan Gao,Ziye Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escape mechanism to avoid spurious local minima in low-rank matrix sensing by simulating over-parameterization without actual computational lifting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of spurious local minima in nonconvex optimization, particularly in low-rank matrix sensing, motivates the need for a deterministic method to escape these minima without costly over-parameterization.

Method: The SOD mechanism simulates the escape directions from over-parameterized space, projecting them back to the original parameter space to ensure a strict decrease in objective value.

Result: Numerical experiments show the framework effectively escapes local minima and converges to global optima with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates how simulated over-parameterization can simplify optimization landscapes, offering broader implications for nonconvex problems beyond matrix sensing.

Abstract: Low-rank matrix sensing is a fundamental yet challenging nonconvex problem whose optimization landscape typically contains numerous spurious local minima, making it difficult for gradient-based optimizers to converge to the global optimum. Recent work has shown that over-parameterization via tensor lifting can convert such local minima into strict saddle points, an insight that also partially explains why massive scaling can improve generalization and performance in modern machine learning. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escape mechanism that simulates the landscape and escape direction of the over-parametrized space, without resorting to actually lifting the problem, since that would be computationally intractable. In essence, we designed a mathematical framework to project over-parametrized escape directions onto the original parameter space to guarantee a strict decrease of objective value from existing local minima. To the best of the our knowledge, this represents the first deterministic framework that could escape spurious local minima with guarantee, especially without using random perturbations or heuristic estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework reliably escapes local minima and facilitates convergence to global optima, while incurring minimal computational cost when compared to explicit tensor over-parameterization. We believe this framework has non-trivial implications for nonconvex optimization beyond matrix sensing, by showcasing how simulated over-parameterization can be leveraged to tame challenging optimization landscapes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations focus on final task success, lacking insights into how agents retrieve and use code context during problem solving.

Method: ContextBench includes 1,136 tasks from 66 repositories across eight languages, with human-annotated gold contexts and an automated framework to track agent metrics.

Result: Sophisticated agent scaffolding offers only marginal gains; LLMs favor recall over precision, and there are gaps between explored and utilized context.

Conclusion: ContextBench provides intermediate metrics to enhance understanding of issue-resolution processes, offering valuable signals for guiding LLM reasoning.

Abstract: LLM-based coding agents have shown strong performance on automated issue resolution benchmarks, yet existing evaluations largely focus on final task success, providing limited insight into how agents retrieve and use code context during problem solving. We introduce ContextBench, a process-oriented evaluation of context retrieval in coding agents. ContextBench consists of 1,136 issue-resolution tasks from 66 repositories across eight programming languages, each augmented with human-annotated gold contexts. We further implement an automated evaluation framework that tracks agent trajectories and measures context recall, precision, and efficiency throughout issue resolution. Using ContextBench, we evaluate four frontier LLMs and five coding agents. Our results show that sophisticated agent scaffolding yields only marginal gains in context retrieval ("The Bitter Lesson" of coding agents), LLMs consistently favor recall over precision, and substantial gaps exist between explored and utilized context. ContextBench augments existing end-to-end benchmarks with intermediate gold-context metrics that unbox the issue-resolution process. These contexts offer valuable intermediate signals for guiding LLM reasoning in software tasks. Data and code are available at: https://cioutn.github.io/context-bench/.

TL;DR: The paper explores the computational limits of transformers, focusing on solving PARITY, and presents a new construction that addresses practical limitations while proving lower bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite transformers being widely used, their computational capabilities remain unclear. The study aims to determine if transformers can solve PARITY under practical constraints.

Method: The authors introduce a new transformer construction for PARITY using softmax, length-independent positional encoding, and no layernorm, testing both causal and non-causal masking.

Result: They demonstrate a transformer that solves PARITY under practical conditions and prove a lower bound: PARITY cannot be solved with a single layer and head.

Conclusion: The findings enhance understanding of transformer capabilities and limitations, providing insights for practical implementations.

Abstract: The transformer architecture is almost a decade old. Despite that, we still have a limited understanding of what this architecture can or cannot compute. For instance, can a 1-layer transformer solve PARITY -- or more generally -- which kinds of transformers can do it? Known constructions for PARITY have at least 2 layers and employ impractical features: either a length-dependent positional encoding, or hardmax, or layernorm without the regularization parameter, or they are not implementable with causal masking.
  We give a new construction of a transformer for PARITY with softmax, length-independent and polynomially bounded positional encoding, no layernorm, working both with and without causal masking. We also give the first lower bound for transformers solving PARITY -- by showing that it cannot be done with only one layer and one head.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bounded-search-based PTQ method with regularized asymmetric calibration to improve LLM efficiency, balancing quantization quality and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of memory and latency costs in deploying LLMs by improving post-training quantization (PTQ) through better robustness and efficiency.

Method: Introduces interpolated asymmetric calibration as regularization, a successive rounding procedure, and bounded-search extension for trade-offs between quantization quality and compute cost.

Result: Demonstrates consistent improvements in perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines across various LLMs, bit-widths, and benchmarks, with modest additional computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances PTQ effectiveness for LLMs by combining asymmetric calibration and bounded search, offering practical deployment benefits.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver robust performance across diverse applications, yet their deployment often faces challenges due to the memory and latency costs of storing and accessing billions of parameters. Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference by mapping pretrained weights to low-bit formats without retraining, but its effectiveness depends critically on both the quantization objective and the rounding procedure used to obtain low-bit weight representations. In this work, we show that interpolating between symmetric and asymmetric calibration acts as a form of regularization that preserves the standard quadratic structure used in PTQ while providing robustness to activation mismatch. Building on this perspective, we derive a simple successive rounding procedure that naturally incorporates asymmetric calibration, as well as a bounded-search extension that allows for an explicit trade-off between quantization quality and the compute cost. Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed bounded search based on a regularized asymmetric calibration objective consistently improves perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, while incurring only modest and controllable additional computational cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates whether generative sequence models trained on chess sequences capture the game's true structure by proposing adversarial sequence generation to test soundness. Results show no model is fully sound, but some training methods improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To verify if sample-based training captures the true structure of languages (e.g., chess rules) and to develop practical tools for assessing model soundness.

Method: Adversarial sequence generation is used to force models to predict invalid moves. Models are trained on random and high-quality chess games, with various techniques evaluated.

Result: No model achieved full soundness, but certain training methods and datasets improved performance. Board state probes had little causal impact on predictions.

Conclusion: Adversarial generation effectively tests model soundness, revealing training and dataset choices can enhance performance, though no model fully captures chess rules.

Abstract: Generative sequence models are typically trained on sample sequences from natural or formal languages. It is a crucial question whether -- or to what extent -- sample-based training is able to capture the true structure of these languages, often referred to as the ``world model''. Theoretical results indicate that we can hope for soundness at best, that is, generating valid sequences, but not necessarily all of them. However, it is still important to have practical tools that are able to verify whether a given sequence model is sound. In this study, we focus on chess, as it is a domain that provides enough complexity while having a simple rule-based world model. We propose adversarial sequence generation for verifying the soundness of the sequence model. Our adversaries generate valid sequences so as to force the sequence model to generate an invalid next move prediction. Apart from the falsification of soundness, this method is also suitable for a more fine-grained analysis of the failure modes and the effects of different choices during training. To demonstrate this, we propose a number of methods for adversarial sequence generation and evaluate the approach on a large set of chess models. We train models on random as well as high-quality chess games, using several training recipes. We find that none of the models are sound, but some training techniques and dataset choices are able to improve soundness remarkably. We also investigate the potential application of board state probes in both our training and attack methods. Our findings indicate that the extracted board states have no causal role in next token prediction in most of the models.

TL;DR: The paper identifies unintended behaviors in LLMs due to spurious correlations from post-training data chunks, introduces tools SURF and TURF to detect and trace these issues, and demonstrates their impact on models like Claude 4.5 and GPT-5.1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of LLMs learning unintended patterns from post-training data, which leads to surprising and miscalibrated behaviors.

Method: Introduces SURF (black-box pipeline to surface unintended behaviors) and TURF (tool to trace failures to specific post-training data). Tests on models like Claude 4.5 and GPT-5.1.

Result: Shows that chunky post-training leads to miscalibrated behaviors, often due to imbalanced or underspecified data chunks.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for better post-training data curation and introduces practical tools to diagnose and address unintended model behaviors.

Abstract: LLM post-training involves many diverse datasets, each targeting a specific behavior. But these datasets encode incidental patterns alongside intended ones: correlations between formatting and content, narrow phrasings across diverse problems, and implicit associations arising from the discrete data curation process. These patterns are often invisible to developers yet salient to models, producing behaviors that surprise their creators, such as rejecting true facts presented in a particular question format. We call this chunky post-training: the model learns spurious correlations as a result of distinct chunks of post-training data. We introduce SURF, a black-box pipeline which surfaces these unintended behaviors at run time, and TURF, a tool that traces these failures back to specific post-training data. Applying these tools to frontier models (Claude 4.5, GPT-5.1, Grok 4.1, Gemini 3) and open models (Tülu 3), we show that chunky post-training produces miscalibrated behaviors, which often result from imbalanced or underspecified chunks of post-training data.

TL;DR: PMD-mean approximates log-partition in PMD with mean reward, introducing adaptive mixed KL-$\chi^2$ regularization for robust updates, showing superior performance in math reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of partition function estimation in PMD for RL in large action spaces of LLMs.

Method: Approximates log-partition with mean reward, performs regression in log-policy space, and introduces adaptive KL-$\chi^2$ regularization.

Result: Demonstrates improved stability, time efficiency, and performance in math reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: PMD-mean offers a practical, robust approach for RL in LLMs, deepening understanding and enabling principled improvements.

Abstract: Policy mirror descent (PMD) provides a principled framework for reinforcement learning (RL) by iteratively solving KL-regularized policy improvement subproblems. While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--$χ^2$ regularizer. This additional $χ^2$ regularization constrains large probability changes, producing more conservative updates when expected rewards are low and enhancing robustness against finite-sample estimation errors. Experiments on math reasoning tasks show that PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency. These findings deepen our understanding of PMD-mean and illuminate pathways toward principled improvements in RL algorithms for LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKimi.

*Sudeepta Mondal,Xinyi Mary Xie,Ruxiao Duan,Alex Wong,Ganesh Sundaramoorthi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper addresses the issue of OOD detector tuning without relying on an adhoc OOD dataset, proposing a new approach that uses only training data and outperforms baselines for high-parameter detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detectors rely on adhoc datasets, which may not represent real OOD data and can lead to performance variability. The work aims to solve tuning without such datasets.

Method: Introduces a generic approach for tuning OOD detectors using only the training data of the neural network, eliminating the need for extra OOD datasets.

Result: The proposed method consistently improves over baselines for high-parameter OOD detectors and performs comparably for low-parameter ones.

Conclusion: The approach offers a practical solution to OOD detector tuning, reducing reliance on potentially unrepresentative OOD datasets and improving robustness.

Abstract: Existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors are often tuned by a separate dataset deemed OOD with respect to the training distribution of a neural network (NN). OOD detectors process the activations of NN layers and score the output, where parameters of the detectors are determined by fitting to an in-distribution (training) set and the aforementioned dataset chosen adhocly. At detector training time, this adhoc dataset may not be available or difficult to obtain, and even when it's available, it may not be representative of actual OOD data, which is often ''unknown unknowns." Current benchmarks may specify some left-out set from test OOD sets. We show that there can be significant variance in performance of detectors based on the adhoc dataset chosen in current literature, and thus even if such a dataset can be collected, the performance of the detector may be highly dependent on the choice. In this paper, we introduce and formalize the often neglected problem of tuning OOD detectors without a given ``OOD'' dataset. To this end, we present strong baselines as an attempt to approach this problem. Furthermore, we propose a new generic approach to OOD detector tuning that does not require any extra data other than those used to train the NN. We show that our approach improves over baseline methods consistently across higher-parameter OOD detector families, while being comparable across lower-parameter families.

*Alaa El Ichi,Khalide Jbilou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Riemannian geometry-based dimensionality reduction methods like PGA and adapted discriminant analysis outperform Euclidean methods for manifold-valued data, highlighting their importance in machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To respect the underlying manifold structure of data and improve low-dimensional embeddings and classification performance.

Method: Extends Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA) and adapts discriminant analysis using Riemannian geometry, leveraging geodesic distances and intrinsic statistical measures.

Result: Riemannian methods show improved representation quality and classification performance, especially for curved spaces like hyperspheres.

Conclusion: Geometry-aware dimensionality reduction is crucial for modern machine learning, particularly for manifold-constrained data.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate Riemannian geometry based dimensionality reduction methods that respect the underlying manifold structure of the data. In particular, we focus on Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA) as a nonlinear generalization of PCA for manifold valued data, and extend discriminant analysis through Riemannian adaptations of other known dimensionality reduction methods. These approaches exploit geodesic distances, tangent space representations, and intrinsic statistical measures to achieve more faithful low dimensional embeddings. We also discuss related manifold learning techniques and highlight their theoretical foundations and practical advantages. Experimental results on representative datasets demonstrate that Riemannian methods provide improved representation quality and classification performance compared to their Euclidean counterparts, especially for data constrained to curved spaces such as hyperspheres and symmetric positive definite manifolds. This study underscores the importance of geometry aware dimensionality reduction in modern machine learning and data science applications.

*Sihan Yang,Kexuan Shi,Weiyang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OrthoMerge is a method for merging finetuned LLMs by preserving geometric properties of weights via Riemannian manifold operations, outperforming Euclidean space merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing merging methods degrade pretrained weights' geometric properties; OrthoMerge aims to preserve these while integrating diverse capabilities.

Method: OrthoMerge uses Riemannian manifold operations for merging orthogonal matrices from Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) and extends to non-OFT models via Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling.

Result: OrthoMerge effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and maintains performance across tasks compared to linear merging methods.

Conclusion: OrthoMerge offers a principled, geometry-aware approach to merging finetuned LLMs, enhancing model integration and performance preservation.

Abstract: Merging finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly important for integrating diverse capabilities into a single unified model. However, prevailing model merging methods rely on linear arithmetic in Euclidean space, which often destroys the intrinsic geometric properties of pretrained weights, such as hyperspherical energy. To address this, we propose Orthogonal Model Merging (OrthoMerge), a method that performs merging operations on the Riemannian manifold formed by the orthogonal group to preserve the geometric structure of the model's weights. By mapping task-specific orthogonal matrices learned by Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) to the Lie algebra, OrthoMerge enables a principled yet efficient integration that takes into account both the direction and intensity of adaptations. In addition to directly leveraging orthogonal matrices obtained by OFT, we further extend this approach to general models finetuned with non-OFT methods (i.e., low-rank finetuning, full finetuning) via an Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling strategy. This technique extracts the orthogonal components of expert models by solving the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which are then merged on the manifold of the orthogonal group, while the remaining linear residuals are processed through standard additive merging. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of OrthoMerge in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining model performance across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: The paper extends divergence-based Preference Alignment (PA) objectives to general alignment settings, introducing f-GRPO and f-HAL for improved LLM alignment with theoretical and empirical support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify alignment settings under a divergence-based framework and propose new methods for better performance and flexibility.

Method: Introduces f-GRPO (on-policy RL) and f-HAL (hybrid objectives) using variational f-divergence representations.

Result: Theoretical guarantees of improved average reward; superior performance in RLVR and PA tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances alignment in LLMs, validated by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Recent research shows that Preference Alignment (PA) objectives act as divergence estimators between aligned (chosen) and unaligned (rejected) response distributions. In this work, we extend this divergence-based perspective to general alignment settings, such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where only environmental rewards are available. Within this unified framework, we propose $f$-Group Relative Policy Optimization ($f$-GRPO), a class of on-policy reinforcement learning, and $f$-Hybrid Alignment Loss ($f$-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of $f$-divergences. We provide theoretical guarantees that these classes of objectives improve the average reward after alignment. Empirically, we validate our framework on both RLVR (Math Reasoning) and PA tasks (Safety Alignment), demonstrating superior performance and flexibility compared to current methods.

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for learning on structured data, yet their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs is fundamentally limited. These limitations are usually attributed to message passing; in this work we show that an independent bottleneck arises at the readout stage. Using finite-dimensional representation theory, we prove that all linear permutation-invariant readouts, including sum and mean pooling, factor through the Reynolds (group-averaging) operator and therefore project node embeddings onto the fixed subspace of the permutation action, erasing all non-trivial symmetry-aware components regardless of encoder expressivity. This yields both a new expressivity barrier and an interpretable characterization of what global pooling preserves or destroys. To overcome this collapse, we introduce projector-based invariant readouts that decompose node representations into symmetry-aware channels and summarize them with nonlinear invariant statistics, preserving permutation invariance while retaining information provably invisible to averaging. Empirically, swapping only the readout enables fixed encoders to separate WL-hard graph pairs and improves performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that readout design is a decisive and under-appreciated factor in GNN expressivity.

*Arran Carter,Sanghyeok Choi,Kirill Tamogashev,Víctor Elvira,Nikolay Malkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of sampling from discrete distributions using diffusion samplers, introducing off-policy training techniques and extending their use to bridging arbitrary distributions and posterior sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling from discrete distributions remains underexplored despite advancements in continuous-space diffusion samplers. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposes off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers and generalizes them to bridge arbitrary distributions using Schrödinger bridge training.

Result: Demonstrates improved performance of discrete samplers on benchmarks and introduces applications like data-free posterior sampling.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends diffusion samplers to discrete spaces, enhancing their utility for complex tasks.

Abstract: Sampling from a distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-\mathcal{E}(x)}$ known up to a normalising constant is an important and challenging problem in statistics. Recent years have seen the rise of a new family of amortised sampling algorithms, commonly referred to as diffusion samplers, that enable fast and efficient sampling from an unnormalised density. Such algorithms have been widely studied for continuous-space sampling tasks; however, their application to problems in discrete space remains largely unexplored. Although some progress has been made in this area, discrete diffusion samplers do not take full advantage of ideas commonly used for continuous-space sampling. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by introducing off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers. We show that these techniques improve the performance of discrete samplers on both established and new synthetic benchmarks. Next, we generalise discrete diffusion samplers to the task of bridging between two arbitrary distributions, introducing data-to-energy Schrödinger bridge training for the discrete domain for the first time. Lastly, we showcase the application of the proposed diffusion samplers to data-free posterior sampling in the discrete latent spaces of image generative models.

*Mohamad Amin Jamshidi,Mehrbod Zarifi,Zolfa Anvari,Hamed Ghafarirad,Mohammad Zareinejad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid LSTM-Random Forest algorithm for estimating nonlinear friction force in hydraulic cylinders, achieving high precision and computational efficiency suitable for real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precision in hydraulic cylinders requires accurate friction models, but existing analytical models lack adaptability and computational efficiency.

Method: A data-driven hybrid algorithm combining LSTM networks and Random Forests is introduced for friction force estimation using experimental training data.

Result: The algorithm achieves stable model errors under 10% across diverse conditions, with computational costs of 1.51 milliseconds per estimation.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach outperforms traditional models like LuGre in adaptability and real-time performance, validated through experimental comparisons.

Abstract: Hydraulic systems are widely utilized in industrial applications due to their high force generation, precise control, and ability to function in harsh environments. Hydraulic cylinders, as actuators in these systems, apply force and position through the displacement of hydraulic fluid, but their operation is significantly influenced by friction force. Achieving precision in hydraulic cylinders requires an accurate friction model under various operating conditions. Existing analytical models, often derived from experimental tests, necessitate the identification or estimation of influencing factors but are limited in adaptability and computational efficiency. This research introduces a data-driven, hybrid algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forests for nonlinear friction force estimation. The algorithm effectively combines feature detection and estimation processes using training data acquired from an experimental hydraulic test setup. It achieves a consistent and stable model error of less than 10% across diverse operating conditions and external load variations, ensuring robust performance in complex situations. The computational cost of the algorithm is 1.51 milliseconds per estimation, making it suitable for real-time applications. The proposed method addresses the limitations of analytical models by delivering high precision and computational efficiency. The algorithm's performance is validated through detailed analysis and experimental results, including direct comparisons with the LuGre model. The comparison highlights that while the LuGre model offers a theoretical foundation for friction modeling, its performance is limited by its inability to dynamically adjust to varying operational conditions of the hydraulic cylinder, further emphasizing the advantages of the proposed hybrid approach in real-time applications.

*Yizhou Liu,Sara Kangaslahti,Ziming Liu,Jeff Gore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Loss scales inversely with depth in LLMs due to ensemble averaging by similar layers, suggesting inefficiency and a need for architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how depth and width in LLMs contribute differently to performance and loss scaling.

Method: Analysis of LLMs and toy residual networks to quantify depth's impact on loss.

Result: Loss inversely proportional to depth, driven by ensemble averaging rather than compositional learning.

Conclusion: Improving LLM efficiency may require architectural innovations for better depth utilization.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws relate loss to model size in large language models (LLMs), yet depth and width may contribute to performance differently, requiring more detailed studies. Here, we quantify how depth affects loss via analysis of LLMs and toy residual networks. We find loss scales inversely proportional to depth in LLMs, probably due to functionally similar layers reducing error through ensemble averaging rather than compositional learning or discretizing smooth dynamics. This regime is inefficient yet robust and may arise from the architectural bias of residual networks and target functions incompatible with smooth dynamics. The findings suggest that improving LLM efficiency may require architectural innovations to encourage compositional use of depth.

*Keith Ando Ogawa,Bruno Lopes Yamamoto,Lucas Lauton de Alcantara,Lucas Pellicer,Rosimeire Pereira Costa,Edson Bollis,Anna Helena Reali Costa,Artur Jordao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to reduce trainable parameters in LoRA-based fine-tuning by selectively adapting only the most relevant layers, maintaining predictive performance across tasks and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs grow in scale, current parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA may still be computationally expensive. The work aims to further reduce costs by focusing on the most impactful layers.

Method: The authors systematically select a few layers for LoRA-based fine-tuning by measuring their contribution to internal representation changes. This method is orthogonal to existing LoRA techniques.

Result: The approach reduces trainable parameters by up to 50% with minimal performance drop on GLUE benchmarks and even improvements in decoder-only and multimodal models.

Conclusion: Selective layer-wise LoRA fine-tuning is effective, scalable, and compatible with existing techniques, offering significant parameter reduction without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Pre-training Large Language Models (LLMs) on web-scale datasets becomes fundamental for advancing general-purpose AI. In contrast, enhancing their predictive performance on downstream tasks typically involves adapting their knowledge through fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aim to reduce the computational cost of this process by freezing the pre-trained model and updating a smaller number of parameters. In comparison to full fine-tuning, these methods achieve over 99\% reduction in trainable parameter count, depending on the configuration. Unfortunately, such a reduction may prove insufficient as LLMs continue to grow in scale. In this work, we address the previous problem by systematically selecting only a few layers to fine-tune using LoRA or its variants. We argue that not all layers contribute equally to the model adaptation. Leveraging this, we identify the most relevant layers to fine-tune by measuring their contribution to changes in internal representations. Our method is orthogonal to and readily compatible with existing low-rank adaptation techniques. We reduce the trainable parameters in LoRA-based techniques by up to 50\%, while maintaining the predictive performance across different models and tasks. Specifically, on encoder-only architectures, this reduction in trainable parameters leads to a negligible predictive performance drop on the GLUE benchmark. On decoder-only architectures, we achieve a small drop or even improvements in the predictive performance on mathematical problem-solving capabilities and coding tasks. Finally, this effectiveness extends to multimodal models, for which we also observe competitive results relative to fine-tuning with LoRA modules in all layers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diamond Maps are proposed as a solution to efficiently align generative models with rewards post-training, enabling adaptability at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flow and diffusion models struggle with adapting to user preferences or constraints post-training, making reward alignment costly and brittle.

Method: Diamond Maps are stochastic flow map models designed for adaptability, amortizing simulation steps into a single-step sampler while retaining stochasticity for reward alignment.

Result: Experiments show Diamond Maps can be efficiently learned via distillation, achieve better reward alignment, and scale more effectively than existing methods.

Conclusion: Diamond Maps offer a practical solution for creating generative models that can quickly adapt to arbitrary preferences and constraints during inference.

Abstract: Flow and diffusion models produce high-quality samples, but adapting them to user preferences or constraints post-training remains costly and brittle, a challenge commonly called reward alignment. We argue that efficient reward alignment should be a property of the generative model itself, not an afterthought, and redesign the model for adaptability. We propose "Diamond Maps", stochastic flow map models that enable efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time. Diamond Maps amortize many simulation steps into a single-step sampler, like flow maps, while preserving the stochasticity required for optimal reward alignment. This design makes search, sequential Monte Carlo, and guidance scalable by enabling efficient and consistent estimation of the value function. Our experiments show that Diamond Maps can be learned efficiently via distillation from GLASS Flows, achieve stronger reward alignment performance, and scale better than existing methods. Our results point toward a practical route to generative models that can be rapidly adapted to arbitrary preferences and constraints at inference time.

*Leo Zhang,James Martens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OSA is a novel attention mechanism designed to address instability issues like rank collapse and poor Jacobian conditioning in SSA, enabling better training of skipless Transformers with linear computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The instability of Softmax Self-Attention (SSA) in skipless architectures due to rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians motivates the development of Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA).

Method: OSA parametrizes the attention matrix as orthogonal using the matrix exponential of a skew-symmetric matrix derived from query-key values, leveraging low-rank structure for efficiency.

Result: OSA achieves linear computational complexity and memory cost with sequence length and ensures well-conditioned Jacobians through a specific initialization scheme.

Conclusion: OSA provides a stable and efficient alternative to SSA, facilitating the training of skipless Transformers without normalization layers.

Abstract: Softmax Self-Attention (SSA) is a key component of Transformer architectures. However, when utilised within skipless architectures, which aim to improve representation learning, recent work has highlighted the inherent instability of SSA due to inducing rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians. In this work, we design a novel attention mechanism: Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA), which aims to bypass these issues with SSA, in order to allow for (non-causal) Transformers without skip connections and normalisation layers to be more easily trained. In particular, OSA parametrises the attention matrix to be orthogonal via mapping a skew-symmetric matrix, formed from query-key values, through the matrix exponential. We show that this can be practically implemented, by exploiting the low-rank structure of our query-key values, resulting in the computational complexity and memory cost of OSA scaling linearly with sequence length. Furthermore, we derive an initialisation scheme for which we prove ensures that the Jacobian of OSA is well-conditioned.

TL;DR: The paper explores how varying compute resources affect RL policy performance and generalization, proposing a flexible architecture that outperforms static models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of compute on RL policies and address the conflation of compute and parameters in traditional frameworks.

Method: Formalizes compute-bounded policies and introduces a minimal architecture allowing variable compute usage.

Result: Shows improved performance and generalization across 31 tasks compared to staticfeedforward and deep residual networks.

Conclusion: Policies leveraging more compute outperform those with fixed compute or parameters, highlighting compute's critical role in RL.

Abstract: How does the amount of compute available to a reinforcement learning (RL) policy affect its learning? Can policies using a fixed amount of parameters, still benefit from additional compute? The standard RL framework does not provide a language to answer these questions formally. Empirically, deep RL policies are often parameterized as neural networks with static architectures, conflating the amount of compute and the number of parameters. In this paper, we formalize compute bounded policies and prove that policies which use more compute can solve problems and generalize to longer-horizon tasks that are outside the scope of policies with less compute. Building on prior work in algorithmic learning and model-free planning, we propose a minimal architecture that can use a variable amount of compute. Our experiments complement our theory. On a set 31 different tasks spanning online and offline RL, we show that $(1)$ this architecture achieves stronger performance simply by using more compute, and $(2)$ stronger generalization on longer-horizon test tasks compared to standard feedforward networks or deep residual network using up to 5 times more parameters.

### [324] [Optimism Stabilizes Thompson Sampling for Adaptive Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06014)
*Shunxing Yan,Han Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Thompson sampling's inferential properties under adaptive data collection are complex due to random arm-specific sample sizes. Optimism stabilizes it, enabling valid asymptotic inference with minimal regret cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the inferential challenges of Thompson sampling (TS) in stochastic multi-armed bandits due to adaptive data collection, where classical asymptotic theory fails. The goal is to understand how optimism can restore stability for valid inference.

Method: The study examines TS in the $K$-armed Gaussian bandit. Two optimistic modifications are analyzed: variance-inflated TS and an alternative that adds a mean bonus to the posterior mean. Both mechanisms aim to stabilize pull counts.

Result: Variance-inflated TS is proven stable for any $K ≥ 2$, extending previous results from a two-armed setting. The alternative optimistic modification achieves the same stability. Both enable asymptotically valid inference with mild regret.

Conclusion: Optimism stabilizes TS, ensuring valid asymptotic inference in multi-armed bandits. Both analyzed modifications maintain stability while only slightly increasing regret.

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is widely used for stochastic multi-armed bandits, yet its inferential properties under adaptive data collection are subtle. Classical asymptotic theory for sample means can fail because arm-specific sample sizes are random and coupled with the rewards through the action-selection rule. We study this phenomenon in the $K$-armed Gaussian bandit and identify \emph{optimism} as a key mechanism for restoring \emph{stability}, a sufficient condition for valid asymptotic inference requiring each arm's pull count to concentrate around a deterministic scale. First, we prove that variance-inflated TS \citep{halder2025stable} is stable for any $K \ge 2$, including the challenging regime where multiple arms are optimal. This resolves the open question raised by \citet{halder2025stable} through extending their results from the two-armed setting to the general $K$-armed setting. Second, we analyze an alternative optimistic modification that keeps the posterior variance unchanged but adds an explicit mean bonus to posterior mean, and establish the same stability conclusion. In summary, suitably implemented optimism stabilizes Thompson sampling and enables asymptotically valid inference in multi-armed bandits, while incurring only a mild additional regret cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CORAL is an inference-time steering method that improves accuracy and calibration in LLMs without retraining, using regularized probes on internal activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the persistent miscalibration of LLMs post-training, offering a lightweight alternative to expensive retraining.

Method: CORAL uses weight-decay MLP probes to extract distributed correctness signals from model activations.

Result: CORAL improves accuracy by 10% and ECE by 50% on average across models and benchmarks.

Conclusion: CORAL efficiently enhances MCQA performance during inference, leveraging distributed model internals.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit persistent miscalibration, especially after instruction tuning and preference alignment. Modified training objectives can improve calibration, but retraining is expensive. Inference-time steering offers a lightweight alternative, yet most existing methods optimize proxies for correctness rather than correctness itself. We introduce CORAL (Correctness-Optimized Residual Activation Lens), a regularized inference-time steering method that captures distributed correctness signals from model internal activations using weight-decay MLP probes. We evaluate CORAL across three 7B-parameter models and find that it consistently improves accuracy by 10\% and expected calibration error (ECE) by 50\% on average. We additionally demonstrate that these gains transfer without retraining to the complete published test sets of four held-out benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, Math-MC, OpenBookQA), averaging 14\% accuracy improvements and 49\% ECE improvements. Our results support the hypothesis that distributed information in model internals can be extracted using regularized probes when individual neurons are insufficient. CORAL thus provides a compute-efficient, transferable, and calibration-aware approach to improve MCQA performance during inference.

TL;DR: The paper addresses how sufficient curiosity in Active Inference (AIF) ensures both coherent learning and efficient decision-making, bridging theory and practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify when the balance between epistemic and pragmatic values in AIF yields optimal learning and decision-making, avoiding pitfalls like myopic exploitation or excessive exploration.

Method: Theoretical analysis establishes guarantees for Expected Free Energy (EFE)-minimizing agents, linking AIF to Bayesian experimental design and optimization.

Result: Sufficient curiosity ensures self-consistent learning (Bayesian posterior consistency) and no-regret optimization (bounded cumulative regret).

Conclusion: The findings provide practical guidelines for tuning the epistemic-pragmatic trade-off, validated by real-world experiments.

Abstract: Active inference (AIF) unifies exploration and exploitation by minimizing the Expected Free Energy (EFE), balancing epistemic value (information gain) and pragmatic value (task performance) through a curiosity coefficient. Yet it has been unclear when this balance yields both coherent learning and efficient decision-making: insufficient curiosity can drive myopic exploitation and prevent uncertainty resolution, while excessive curiosity can induce unnecessary exploration and regret. We establish the first theoretical guarantee for EFE-minimizing agents, showing that a single requirement--sufficient curiosity--simultaneously ensures self-consistent learning (Bayesian posterior consistency) and no-regret optimization (bounded cumulative regret). Our analysis characterizes how this mechanism depends on initial uncertainty, identifiability, and objective alignment, thereby connecting AIF to classical Bayesian experimental design and Bayesian optimization within one theoretical framework. We further translate these theories into practical design guidelines for tuning the epistemic-pragmatic trade-off in hybrid learning-optimization problems, validated through real-world experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve OOD detection by effectively aggregating token embeddings from language models, addressing limitations of simple average-based methods.

Method: AP-OOD uses a semi-supervised approach, interpolating between unsupervised and supervised settings, and exploits token-level information.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: reduces FPR95 from 27.84% to 4.67% on XSUM and from 77.08% to 70.37% on WMT15 En-Fr.

Conclusion: AP-OOD outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in OOD detection for text.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which maps high-dimensional data into a scalar OOD score, is critical for the reliable deployment of machine learning models. A key challenge in recent research is how to effectively leverage and aggregate token embeddings from language models to obtain the OOD score. In this work, we propose AP-OOD, a novel OOD detection method for natural language that goes beyond simple average-based aggregation by exploiting token-level information. AP-OOD is a semi-supervised approach that flexibly interpolates between unsupervised and supervised settings, enabling the use of limited auxiliary outlier data. Empirically, AP-OOD sets a new state of the art in OOD detection for text: in the unsupervised setting, it reduces the FPR95 (false positive rate at 95% true positives) from 27.84% to 4.67% on XSUM summarization, and from 77.08% to 70.37% on WMT15 En-Fr translation.

Result: Models improve within-task performance but fail to generalize physical rules to related tasks.

Conclusion: Interaction-based learning alone is insufficient for developing generalizable physical intuitions in models.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision language models do not have good intuitions about the physical world. Recent work has shown that supervised fine-tuning can improve model performance on simple physical tasks. However, fine-tuned models do not appear to learn robust physical rules that can generalize to new contexts. Based on research in cognitive science, we hypothesize that models need to interact with an environment to properly learn its physical dynamics. We train models that learn through interaction with the environment using reinforcement learning. While learning from interaction allows models to improve their within-task performance, it fails to produce models with generalizable physical intuitions. We find that models trained on one task do not reliably generalize to related tasks, even if the tasks share visual statistics and physical principles, and regardless of whether the models are trained through interaction.

*Konosuke Yoshizato,Kazuma Shimizu,Ryota Higa,Takanobu Otsuka*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLM-based multi-agent systems for inventory management, showing they can optimize orders in restricted scenarios. A novel agent, AIM-RM, improves adaptability by leveraging past experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainties about LLM-based MASs' effectiveness in inventory management, particularly their ability to derive optimal policies and adapt to diverse scenarios.

Method: Examined an LLM-based MAS with fixed-ordering and safe-stock strategies. Introduced AIM-RM, an agent that uses similarity matching for enhanced adaptability.

Result: LLM-based MAS achieved optimal decisions in restricted scenarios without detailed prompt adjustments. AIM-RM outperformed benchmarks in diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: LLM-based MASs show promise for inventory management, with AIM-RM demonstrating superior adaptability and performance.

Abstract: This study investigates large language model (LLM) -based multi-agent systems (MASs) as a promising approach to inventory management, which is a key component of supply chain management. Although these systems have gained considerable attention for their potential to address the challenges associated with typical inventory management methods, key uncertainties regarding their effectiveness persist. Specifically, it is unclear whether LLM-based MASs can consistently derive optimal ordering policies and adapt to diverse supply chain scenarios. To address these questions, we examine an LLM-based MAS with a fixed-ordering strategy prompt that encodes the stepwise processes of the problem setting and a safe-stock strategy commonly used in inventory management. Our empirical results demonstrate that, even without detailed prompt adjustments, an LLM-based MAS can determine optimal ordering decisions in a restricted scenario. To enhance adaptability, we propose a novel agent called AIM-RM, which leverages similar historical experiences through similarity matching. Our results show that AIM-RM outperforms benchmark methods across various supply chain scenarios, highlighting its robustness and adaptability.

*Joseph Fioresi,Parth Parag Kulkarni,Ashmal Vayani,Song Wang,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: LTS introduces a learned shared-memory mechanism for parallel agentic systems to reduce redundant computations by enabling selective cross-team information reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency caused by overlapping reasoning in parallel agent teams.

Method: LTS uses a global memory bank and a lightweight controller trained via reinforcement learning to decide which information to share.

Result: LTS reduces runtime without sacrificing task performance on benchmarks like AssistantBench and GAIA.

Conclusion: Learned memory admission improves the efficiency of parallel agentic systems.

Abstract: Agentic systems solve complex tasks by coordinating multiple agents that iteratively reason, invoke tools, and exchange intermediate results. To improve robustness and solution quality, recent approaches deploy multiple agent teams running in parallel to explore diverse reasoning trajectories. However, parallel execution comes at a significant computational cost: when different teams independently reason about similar sub-problems or execute analogous steps, they repeatedly perform substantial overlapping computation. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose Learning to Share (LTS), a learned shared-memory mechanism for parallel agentic frameworks that enables selective cross-team information reuse while controlling context growth. LTS introduces a global memory bank accessible to all teams and a lightweight controller that decides whether intermediate agent steps should be added to memory or not. The controller is trained using stepwise reinforcement learning with usage-aware credit assignment, allowing it to identify information that is globally useful across parallel executions. Experiments on the AssistantBench and GAIA benchmarks show that LTS significantly reduces overall runtime while matching or improving task performance compared to memory-free parallel baselines, demonstrating that learned memory admission is an effective strategy for improving the efficiency of parallel agentic systems.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: PhysicsAgentABM combines symbolic and neural methods for scalable, calibrated agent-based modeling, reducing LLM usage while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based multi-agent systems are expensive and poorly calibrated, while classical ABMs lack integration of rich individual-level behaviors. PhysicsAgentABM addresses these gaps.

Method: PhysicsAgentABM uses behaviorally coherent agent clusters, symbolic agents for transitions, a neural transition model, and epistemic fusion. ANCHOR reduces LLM calls via clustering.

Result: Experiments show gains in accuracy and calibration over baselines in public health, finance, and social sciences.

Conclusion: PhysicsAgentABM offers a scalable, calibrated simulation paradigm by focusing on population-level inference with neuro-symbolic fusion.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems enable expressive agent reasoning but are expensive to scale and poorly calibrated for timestep-aligned state-transition simulation, while classical agent-based models (ABMs) offer interpretability but struggle to integrate rich individual-level signals and non-stationary behaviors. We propose PhysicsAgentABM, which shifts inference to behaviorally coherent agent clusters: state-specialized symbolic agents encode mechanistic transition priors, a multimodal neural transition model captures temporal and interaction dynamics, and uncertainty-aware epistemic fusion yields calibrated cluster-level transition distributions. Individual agents then stochastically realize transitions under local constraints, decoupling population inference from entity-level variability. We further introduce ANCHOR, an LLM agent-driven clustering strategy based on cross-contextual behavioral responses and a novel contrastive loss, reducing LLM calls by up to 6-8 times. Experiments across public health, finance, and social sciences show consistent gains in event-time accuracy and calibration over mechanistic, neural, and LLM baselines. By re-architecting generative ABM around population-level inference with uncertainty-aware neuro-symbolic fusion, PhysicsAgentABM establishes a new paradigm for scalable and calibrated simulation with LLMs.

### [332] [Artificial Intelligence as Strange Intelligence: Against Linear Models of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04986)
*Kendra Chilson,Eric Schwitzgebel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques the linear model of AI progress, introduces concepts of 'familiar' and 'strange' intelligence, and advocates for a nonlinear model, emphasizing AI's unpredictable strengths and weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the linear view of AI intelligence and explore how AI may exhibit 'strange intelligence' with mixed superhuman and subhuman capabilities.

Method: Introduce and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence, distinguishing between 'familiar' and 'strange' intelligence, and discuss implications for AI evaluation.

Result: AI intelligence is nonlinear, combining varied strengths and weaknesses, making it unpredictable and resistant to linear quantification.

Conclusion: Adversarial testing should recognize AI's nonlinear nature; errors or successes in specific tasks don't fully indicate general intelligence.

Abstract: We endorse and expand upon Susan Schneider's critique of the linear model of AI progress and introduce two novel concepts: "familiar intelligence" and "strange intelligence". AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which "general intelligence" is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks. On a nonlinear model of AI intelligence, such errors on their own do not demonstrate a system's lack of outstanding general intelligence. Conversely, excellent performance on one type of task, such as an IQ test, cannot warrant assumptions of broad capacities beyond that task domain.

*Zhanli Li,Huiwen Tian,Lvzhou Luo,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepRead improves long-document QA by leveraging document structure and introducing multi-turn, decision-driven retrieval tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic search frameworks underutilize document-native priors like hierarchical organization, limiting their effectiveness in long-document question answering.

Method: DeepRead converts PDFs into structured Markdown, indexes paragraphs with metadata, and provides retrieval and reading tools ('Retrieve' and 'ReadSection') for LLMs.

Result: DeepRead outperforms Search-o1-style approaches and exhibits human-like 'locate then read' behavior.

Conclusion: DeepRead's structured approach enhances long-document QA by synergizing retrieval and reading tools.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of tool-using and agentic large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is evolving from one-shot, passive retrieval into multi-turn, decision-driven evidence acquisition. Despite strong results in open-domain settings, existing agentic search frameworks commonly treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure. We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering. The synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools is also validated. Our fine-grained behavioral analysis reveals a reading and reasoning paradigm resembling human-like ``locate then read'' behavior.

### [334] [MINT: Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree for Objective-Driven Knowledge-Gap Reasoning and Active Elicitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05048)
*Zeyu Fang,Tian Lan,Mahdi Imani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MINT optimizes AI-human joint planning by actively eliciting human inputs through a neuro-symbolic tree and self-play, achieving near-expert performance with minimal queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-world planning often involves incomplete information and unknowns, leading to knowledge gaps. The paper aims to devise AI strategies to actively gather human inputs for optimal joint planning.

Method: Proposes MINT, a neuro-symbolic tree that models interaction possibilities and uses a neural policy to estimate uncertainty. It employs self-play and LLMs to summarize reasoning and generate optimal queries.

Result: MINT achieves near-expert returns with limited queries across three benchmarks, improving rewards and success rates in tasks involving unseen/unknown objects.

Conclusion: MINT effectively bridges knowledge gaps in joint planning through optimized human-AI interaction, demonstrating scalability and performance in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Joint planning through language-based interactions is a key area of human-AI teaming. Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation. Our evaluation on three benchmarks involving unseen/unknown objects of increasing realism shows that MINT-based planning attains near-expert returns by issuing a limited number of questions per task while achieving significantly improved rewards and success rates.

*Adithya Kulkarni,Mohna Chakraborty,Jay Bagga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs perform well on solved graph theory problems but struggle with open ones, showing potential for educational use with caution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how reliably LLMs support mathematically rigorous thinking in computer science education, especially in graph theory.

Method: Evaluate LLM performance using an eight-stage protocol covering interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction for solved and open graph theory problems.

Result: LLM excelled on the solved problem (correct definitions, valid proof) but struggled with the open problem (coherent interpretations, no solution advancement).

Conclusion: LLMs are useful for exploring established material but lack novel insights; educational use should emphasize verification and rigorous reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used by students to explore advanced material in computer science, including graph theory. As these tools become integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework, it is important to understand how reliably they support mathematically rigorous thinking. This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.
  The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.
  These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning. For computing education, this distinction highlights the importance of guiding students to use LLMs for conceptual exploration while relying on independent verification and rigorous argumentation for formal problem solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for a shift in uncertainty quantification (UQ) research toward interactive LLM agents and proposes a new framework treating UQ as a conditional uncertainty reduction process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UQ research focuses on single-turn tasks, but LLM agents are increasingly used in complex, interactive settings, necessitating a new UQ framework.

Method: The paper introduces a general formulation of agent UQ, critiques prior works' implicit uncertainty accumulation view, and proposes a conditional uncertainty reduction perspective.

Result: A conceptual framework is outlined to guide UQ design for LLM agents, emphasizing interactivity and reducible uncertainty.

Conclusion: The work highlights practical implications for LLM development and applications, while identifying open problems in agent UQ.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs) is a key building block for safety guardrails of daily LLM applications. Yet, even as LLM agents are increasingly deployed in highly complex tasks, most UQ research still centers on single-turn question-answering. We argue that UQ research must shift to realistic settings with interactive agents, and that a new principled framework for agent UQ is needed. This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting "interactivity" of actions. From this perspective, we outline a conceptual framework to provide actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups. Finally, we conclude with practical implications of the agent UQ in frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, as well as open remaining problems.

*Stephen Pilli,Vivek Nallur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-5 can replicate human cognitive biases in decision-making scenarios, demonstrating their ability to predict and emulate individual-level biases under interactive conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to determine if LLMs can predict and emulate individual-level cognitive biases, especially under contextual interactions like cognitive load, beyond just reproducing well-known biases.

Method: The researchers adapted three decision scenarios into conversational settings, conducted a human experiment (N=1100), and simulated similar conditions using LLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-5) with participant demographics and dialogue transcripts.

Result: LLMs accurately reproduced human biases, with notable differences in how GPT-4 and GPT-5 aligned with human behavior.

Conclusion: The findings highlight implications for designing adaptive, bias-aware LLM systems in interactive contexts.

Abstract: Cognitive biases often shape human decisions. While large language models (LLMs) have been shown to reproduce well-known biases, a more critical question is whether LLMs can predict biases at the individual level and emulate the dynamics of biased human behavior when contextual factors, such as cognitive load, interact with these biases. We adapted three well-established decision scenarios into a conversational setting and conducted a human experiment (N=1100). Participants engaged with a chatbot that facilitates decision-making through simple or complex dialogues. Results revealed robust biases. To evaluate how LLMs emulate human decision-making under similar interactive conditions, we used participant demographics and dialogue transcripts to simulate these conditions with LLMs based on GPT-4 and GPT-5. The LLMs reproduced human biases with precision. We found notable differences between models in how they aligned human behavior. This has important implications for designing and evaluating adaptive, bias-aware LLM-based AI systems in interactive contexts.

*Agni Bandyopadhyay,Gunther Waxenegger-Wilfing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework improves adaptive collision avoidance and efficiency in multi-debris active debris removal missions using small satellites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in safe operations and collision risk minimization amid increasing orbital debris.

Method: Uses a masked Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm for dynamic maneuver adjustment, integrating refueling and mission planning.

Result: Reduced collision risk and improved mission efficiency compared to heuristic methods, validated via Iridium 33 debris simulations.

Conclusion: The RL framework offers scalable, adaptable solutions for complex multi-debris removal and multi-target rendezvous missions.

Abstract: As the orbital environment around Earth becomes increasingly crowded with debris, active debris removal (ADR) missions face significant challenges in ensuring safe operations while minimizing the risk of in-orbit collisions. This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in ADR missions, specifically for multi-debris removal using small satellites. Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR.
  Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions. Key considerations include fuel efficiency, avoidance of active collision zones, and optimization of dynamic orbital parameters.
  The RL agent learns to determine efficient sequences for rendezvousing with multiple debris targets, optimizing fuel usage and mission time while incorporating necessary refueling stops. Simulated ADR scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 debris dataset are used for evaluation, covering diverse orbital configurations and debris distributions to demonstrate robustness and adaptability. Results show that the proposed RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches.
  This work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.

TL;DR: The study evaluates the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH benchmark for AI safety in suicide risk detection, showing strong alignment between clinician ratings and an LLM judge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the urgent need for an evidence-based safety benchmark for AI chatbots used in mental health support, ensuring they are safe for users.

Method: Simulated conversations between LLM-based users and AI chatbots were rated by clinicians and an LLM judge using a scoring rubric to evaluate safety and realism.

Result: Clinicians showed consistent safety ratings (IRR: 0.77), and the LLM judge closely aligned with clinician consensus (IRR: 0.81). User-agents were deemed realistic.

Conclusion: VERA-MH is a valid and reliable automated safety evaluation tool for AI in mental health, though further research is needed to confirm its generalizability.

Abstract: Millions now use leading generative AI chatbots for psychological support. Despite the promise related to availability and scale, the single most pressing question in AI for mental health is whether these tools are safe. The Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health (VERA-MH) evaluation was recently proposed to meet the urgent need for an evidence-based automated safety benchmark. This study aimed to examine the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in suicide risk detection and response. We first simulated a large set of conversations between large language model (LLM)-based users (user-agents) and general-purpose AI chatbots. Licensed mental health clinicians used a rubric (scoring guide) to independently rate the simulated conversations for safe and unsafe chatbot behaviors, as well as user-agent realism. An LLM-based judge used the same scoring rubric to evaluate the same set of simulated conversations. We then compared rating alignment across (a) individual clinicians and (b) clinician consensus and the LLM judge, and (c) examined clinicians' ratings of user-agent realism. Individual clinicians were generally consistent with one another in their safety ratings (chance-corrected inter-rater reliability [IRR]: 0.77), thus establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with this clinical consensus (IRR: 0.81) overall and within key conditions. Clinician raters generally perceived the user-agents to be realistic. For the potential mental health benefits of AI chatbots to be realized, attention to safety is paramount. Findings from this human evaluation study support the clinical validity and reliability of VERA-MH: an open-source, fully automated AI safety evaluation for mental health. Further research will address VERA-MH generalizability and robustness.

TL;DR: The paper compares three planners (nominal PPO, domain-randomized PPO, and MCTS) for Active Debris Removal missions, highlighting trade-offs between speed and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing efficiency, adaptability, and feasibility in autonomous mission planning for Active Debris Removal in Low Earth Orbit.

Method: Compares a nominal Masked PPO policy, a domain-randomized Masked PPO, and a plain MCTS baseline in high-fidelity orbital simulations with 300 test cases under various constraints.

Result: Nominal PPO performs best under matching conditions but degrades with distributional shift; domain-randomized PPO offers better adaptability with moderate performance loss; MCTS handles constraints best but is computationally expensive.

Conclusion: The study highlights a trade-off between speed and adaptability, suggesting that combining training diversity with online planning could improve future ADR mission planners.

Abstract: Autonomous mission planning for Active Debris Removal (ADR) must balance efficiency, adaptability, and strict feasibility constraints on fuel and mission duration. This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit: a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy trained under fixed mission parameters, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy trained across varying mission constraints for improved robustness, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline. Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time. The findings underline a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, and suggest that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners.

TL;DR: GAMMS is a lightweight, scalable simulation framework for multi-agent systems, designed for rapid prototyping and large-scale deployments with real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for accessible, scalable simulation tools amid the limitations of existing high-fidelity simulators.

Method: Developed GAMMS, a graph-based simulator emphasizing scalability, ease of use, integration, visualization, and real-world grounding.

Result: Enables efficient simulation of complex domains, supports diverse agent policies, and integrates with external tools.

Conclusion: GAMMS lowers barriers for multi-agent research, fostering innovation with its open-source, high-performance framework.

Abstract: As intelligent systems and multi-agent coordination become increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a growing need for simulation tools that are both scalable and accessible. Existing high-fidelity simulators, while powerful, are often computationally expensive and ill-suited for rapid prototyping or large-scale agent deployments. We present GAMMS (Graph based Adversarial Multiagent Modeling Simulator), a lightweight yet extensible simulation framework designed to support fast development and evaluation of agent behavior in environments that can be represented as graphs. GAMMS emphasizes five core objectives: scalability, ease of use, integration-first architecture, fast visualization feedback, and real-world grounding. It enables efficient simulation of complex domains such as urban road networks and communication systems, supports integration with external tools (e.g., machine learning libraries, planning solvers), and provides built-in visualization with minimal configuration. GAMMS is agnostic to policy type, supporting heuristic, optimization-based, and learning-based agents, including those using large language models. By lowering the barrier to entry for researchers and enabling high-performance simulations on standard hardware, GAMMS facilitates experimentation and innovation in multi-agent systems, autonomous planning, and adversarial modeling. The framework is open-source and available at https://github.com/GAMMSim/GAMMS/

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the reliability and bias of LLMs in merchant risk assessment using a structured multi-evaluator framework, revealing model-specific biases and alignment with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding about LLM reliability and bias in payments-risk settings, particularly for merchant risk assessment.

Method: A structured framework combining a five-criterion rubric with Monte-Carlo scoring, involving five LLMs generating and cross-evaluating risk rationales under attributed and anonymized conditions. A consensus-deviation metric was introduced for unbiased evaluation.

Result: Models showed significant heterogeneity in bias, with some aligning closely with human judgment. Ground-truth validation confirmed the framework's effectiveness in capturing genuine quality.

Conclusion: The framework offers a replicable method for evaluating LLMs in payment-risk workflows and underscores the need for bias-aware protocols in financial settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators of reasoning quality, yet their reliability and bias in payments-risk settings remain poorly understood. We introduce a structured multi-evaluator framework for assessing LLM reasoning in Merchant Category Code (MCC)-based merchant risk assessment, combining a five-criterion rubric with Monte-Carlo scoring to evaluate rationale quality and evaluator stability. Five frontier LLMs generate and cross-evaluate MCC risk rationales under attributed and anonymized conditions. To establish a judge-independent reference, we introduce a consensus-deviation metric that eliminates circularity by comparing each judge's score to the mean of all other judges, yielding a theoretically grounded measure of self-evaluation and cross-model deviation. Results reveal substantial heterogeneity: GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show negative self-evaluation bias (-0.33, -0.31), while Gemini-2.5 Pro and Grok 4 display positive bias (+0.77, +0.71), with bias attenuating by 25.8 percent under anonymization. Evaluation by 26 payment-industry experts shows LLM judges assign scores averaging +0.46 points above human consensus, and that the negative bias of GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet reflects closer alignment with human judgment. Ground-truth validation using payment-network data shows four models exhibit statistically significant alignment (Spearman rho = 0.56 to 0.77), confirming that the framework captures genuine quality. Overall, the framework provides a replicable basis for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge systems in payment-risk workflows and highlights the need for bias-aware protocols in operational financial settings.

*Suvadip Sana,Jinzhou Wu,Martin T. Wells*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DemPO introduces a democratic approach to AI preference alignment by using algorithmic sortition to ensure demographic representativeness, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bias in AI preference alignment methods caused by unrepresentative human rater samples, DemPO aims to incorporate values from demographically representative publics.

Method: DemPO uses algorithmic sortition for preference-based fine-tuning with two schemes: Hard Panel (exclusive quota-satisfying samples) and Soft Panel (reweighting by inclusion probability).

Result: Hard Panel ranks highest across six aggregation methods, and Soft Panel outperforms the unweighted baseline, especially with larger models.

Conclusion: Ensuring demographic representativeness during preference collection yields AI behavior that better reflects values from representative publics.

Abstract: Whose values should AI systems learn? Preference based alignment methods like RLHF derive their training signal from human raters, yet these rater pools are typically convenience samples that systematically over represent some demographics and under represent others. We introduce Democratic Preference Optimization, or DemPO, a framework that applies algorithmic sortition, the same mechanism used to construct citizen assemblies, to preference based fine tuning. DemPO offers two training schemes. Hard Panel trains exclusively on preferences from a quota satisfying mini public sampled via sortition. Soft Panel retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery. We prove that Soft Panel weighting recovers the expected Hard Panel objective in closed form. Using a public preference dataset that pairs human judgments with rater demographics and a seventy five clause constitution independently elicited from a representative United States panel, we evaluate Llama models from one billion to eight billion parameters fine tuned under each scheme. Across six aggregation methods, the Hard Panel consistently ranks first and the Soft Panel consistently outperforms the unweighted baseline, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increases. These results demonstrate that enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage, rather than post hoc correction, yields models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics.

### [344] [SocialVeil: Probing Social Intelligence of Language Agents under Communication Barriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05115)
*Keyang Xuan,Pengda Wang,Chongrui Ye,Haofei Yu,Tal August,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 	extsc{SocialVeil}, a social learning environment simulating communication barriers for testing LLMs, revealing significant performance drops and limited effectiveness of adaptation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack realistic communication challenges, limiting the evaluation of LLMs' social intelligence in imperfect settings.

Method: Developed 	extsc{SocialVeil} to simulate three types of communication barriers (semantic vagueness, sociocultural mismatch, emotional interference) and introduced metrics (unresolved confusion, mutual understanding) to evaluate interaction quality.

Result: Experiments showed barriers impair LLM performance (mutual understanding reduced by 45%, confusion elevated by 50%), with human evaluations validating barrier fidelity. Adaptation strategies had modest impact.

Conclusion: 	extsc{SocialVeil} advances social interaction testing for LLMs, highlighting gaps in handling real-world communication challenges and potential research directions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in interactive environments to test their social intelligence. However, existing benchmarks often assume idealized communication between agents, limiting our ability to diagnose whether LLMs can maintain and repair interactions in more realistic, imperfect settings. To close this gap, we present \textsc{SocialVeil}, a social learning environment that can simulate social interaction under cognitive-difference-induced communication barriers. Grounded in a systematic literature review of communication challenges in human interaction, \textsc{SocialVeil} introduces three representative types of such disruption, \emph{semantic vagueness}, \emph{sociocultural mismatch}, and \emph{emotional interference}. We also introduce two barrier-aware evaluation metrics, \emph{unresolved confusion} and \emph{mutual understanding}, to evaluate interaction quality under impaired communication. Experiments across 720 scenarios and four frontier LLMs show that barriers consistently impair performance, with mutual understanding reduced by over 45\% on average, and confusion elevated by nearly 50\%. Human evaluations validate the fidelity of these simulated barriers (ICC$\approx$0.78, Pearson r$\approx$0.80). We further demonstrate that adaptation strategies (Repair Instruction and Interactive learning) only have a modest effect far from barrier-free performance. This work takes a step toward bringing social interaction environments closer to real-world communication, opening opportunities for exploring the social intelligence of LLM agents.

TL;DR: CAST-CKT is a chaos-aware framework for traffic prediction in cross-city, data-scarce settings, outperforming existing methods by addressing chaotic dynamics and enabling efficient few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic prediction methods struggle with nonlinear dynamics and domain shifts in cross-city, data-scarce scenarios. CAST-CKT aims to address these challenges by leveraging chaos theory.

Method: CAST-CKT uses a chaotic analyser to quantify predictability, chaos-aware attention, adaptive topology learning, and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment for knowledge transfer.

Result: The framework achieves superior performance in MAE and RMSE on four benchmarks, with horizon-specific predictions and uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: CAST-CKT effectively captures chaotic traffic dynamics, enhances few-shot learning, and provides interpretable regime analysis, advancing cross-city traffic prediction.

Abstract: Traffic prediction in data-scarce, cross-city settings is challenging due to complex nonlinear dynamics and domain shifts. Existing methods often fail to capture traffic's inherent chaotic nature for effective few-shot learning. We propose CAST-CKT, a novel Chaos-Aware Spatio-Temporal and Cross-City Knowledge Transfer framework. It employs an efficient chaotic analyser to quantify traffic predictability regimes, driving several key innovations: chaos-aware attention for regime-adaptive temporal modelling; adaptive topology learning for dynamic spatial dependencies; and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment for knowledge transfer. The framework also provides horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification. Theoretical analysis shows improved generalisation bounds. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks in cross-city few-shot settings show CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE, while offering interpretable regime analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HugRAG improves graph-based RAG by modeling causal relationships hierarchically, outperforming existing methods in structured retrieval and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from surface-level node matching and lack causal modeling, leading to unreliable answers.

Method: HugRAG introduces causal gating across hierarchical modules to suppress spurious correlations and enable scalable reasoning.

Result: HugRAG consistently outperforms baseline graph-based RAG methods across datasets and metrics.

Conclusion: HugRAG provides a scalable and causally grounded foundation for RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has enhanced large language models by enabling access to external knowledge, with graph-based RAG emerging as a powerful paradigm for structured retrieval and reasoning. However, existing graph-based methods often over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are typically limited to local or single-document contexts and also suffer from information isolation that arises from modular graph structures, which hinders scalability and cross-module causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules. HugRAG explicitly models causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics. Our work establishes a principled foundation for structured, scalable, and causally grounded RAG systems.

*Fengxian Chen,Zhilong Tao,Jiaxuan Li,Yunlong Li,Qingguo Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for Chinese Tibetan medicine using multiple knowledge bases (KBs). It proposes two methods—DAKS for KB routing and budgeted retrieval, and an alignment graph for evidence fusion—to improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enhance cross-KB verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of grounding question answering in domain settings with multiple heterogeneous KBs, where dense encyclopedia entries can overshadow authoritative sources like classics or clinical papers.

Method: The methods include DAKS for KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate bias, and an alignment graph for evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing. A lightweight generator, \textsc{openPangu-Embedded-7B}, is used for answer generation.

Result: Experiments show improved routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage. The full system achieves top CrossEv@5 performance while maintaining faithfulness and citation correctness.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address density-driven bias and improve cross-KB evidence coverage, enhancing retrieval-augmented generation in complex domain settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) promises grounded question answering, yet domain settings with multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases (KBs) remain challenging. In Chinese Tibetan medicine, encyclopedia entries are often dense and easy to match, which can dominate retrieval even when classics or clinical papers provide more authoritative evidence. We study a practical setting with three KBs (encyclopedia, classics, and clinical papers) and a 500-query benchmark (cutoff $K{=}5$) covering both single-KB and cross-KB questions. We propose two complementary methods to improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification. First, DAKS performs KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density-driven bias and to prioritize authoritative sources when appropriate. Second, we use an alignment graph to guide evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing, improving cross-KB evidence coverage without relying on naive concatenation. All answers are generated by a lightweight generator, \textsc{openPangu-Embedded-7B}. Experiments show consistent gains in routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage, with the full system achieving the best CrossEv@5 while maintaining strong faithfulness and citation correctness.

*Guozhi Liu,Weiwei Lin,Tiansheng Huang,Ruichao Mo,Qi Mu,Xiumin Wang,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses harmful fine-tuning in large language models by proposing 'Surgery,' a defense method using attention sink divergence to mitigate safety risks, improving performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Harmful fine-tuning undermines the safety alignment of large language models, posing significant risks. The study aims to mitigate this by leveraging the attention sink mechanism.

Method: The authors measure 'sink divergence' for attention heads, observe its correlation with harmfulness, and propose 'Surgery,' a defense using sink divergence suppression via regularization.

Result: Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90%, 11.25%, and 9.55% on BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces harmful patterns during fine-tuning, enhancing model safety.

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning can invalidate safety alignment of large language models, exposing significant safety risks. In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\%, 11.25\%, and 9.55\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

Result: Achieved 91.24% accuracy and identified both full and partial tumours, offering layered explanations from broad regions to pixel-level details.

Conclusion: The integrated XAI approach enhances reliability and interpretability in healthcare AI, particularly for critical tasks like brain tumour detection.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models for brain tumour detection. A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed and trained on the BraTS 2021 dataset, achieving 91.24% accuracy in distinguishing between tumour and non-tumour regions. This research combines Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GRAD-CAM), Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide comprehensive insights into the model's decision-making process. This multi-technique approach successfully identified both full and partial tumours, offering layered explanations ranging from broad regions of interest to pixel-level details. GRAD-CAM highlighted important spatial regions, LRP provided detailed pixel-level relevance and SHAP quantified feature contributions. The integrated approach effectively explained model predictions, including cases with partial tumour visibility thus showing superior explanatory power compared to individual XAI methods. This research enhances transparency and trust in AI-driven medical imaging analysis by offering a more comprehensive perspective on the model's reasoning. The study demonstrates the potential of integrated XAI techniques in improving the reliability and interpretability of AI systems in healthcare, particularly for critical tasks like brain tumour detection.

*Xinyi He,Ying Yang,Chuanjian Fu,Sihan Guo,Songchun Zhu,Lifeng Fan,Zhenliang Zhang,Yujia Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes TEA, a dynamic in-situ task generation method for assessing embodied agents in unseen 3D environments, addressing data contamination and scene specificity issues in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to evaluate agent capabilities in diverse, unseen environments due to data contamination and lack of scene specificity.

Method: TEA uses a structured graph representation and a two-stage (interaction-evolution) system for task generation, enabling continuous task creation and recombination without external data.

Result: TEA generated 87,876 tasks in 10 unseen scenes, validated as reasonable and diverse by humans. Benchmarking showed SOTA models struggle with basic perception and 3D interaction awareness.

Conclusion: In-situ evaluation is crucial before deploying agents in real-world environments, as highlighted by the shortcomings of SOTA models on TEA-generated tasks.

Abstract: As general intelligent agents are poised for widespread deployment in diverse households, evaluation tailored to each unique unseen 3D environment has become a critical prerequisite. However, existing benchmarks suffer from severe data contamination and a lack of scene specificity, inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings. To address this, we propose a dynamic in-situ task generation method for unseen environments inspired by human cognition. We define tasks through a structured graph representation and construct a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA). In the interaction stage, the agent actively interacts with the environment, creating a loop between task execution and generation that allows for continuous task generation. In the evolution stage, task graph modeling allows us to recombine and reuse existing tasks to generate new ones without external data. Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks in two cycles, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans on our in-situ tasks reveals that models, despite excelling on public benchmarks, perform surprisingly poorly on basic perception tasks, severely lack 3D interaction awareness and show high sensitivity to task types in reasoning. These sobering findings highlight the necessity of in-situ evaluation before deploying agents into real-world human environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces recos, a new similarity metric that outperforms cosine similarity by capturing nonlinear relationships in semantic spaces, validated through experiments on diverse embedding models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cosine similarity's limitation to linear relationships fails to model complex semantic structures. The authors aim to develop a more accurate metric.

Method: They derive a tighter upper bound for the dot product, leading to recos, which normalizes by sorted vector components and relaxes linear dependence conditions.

Result: recos consistently outperforms cosine similarity across 11 embedding models, showing higher correlation with human judgments on STS benchmarks.

Conclusion: recos is a superior, mathematically principled alternative to cosine similarity for semantic analysis in complex embedding spaces.

Abstract: Cosine similarity, the standard metric for measuring semantic similarity in vector spaces, is mathematically grounded in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which inherently limits it to capturing linear relationships--a constraint that fails to model the complex, nonlinear structures of real-world semantic spaces. We advance this theoretical underpinning by deriving a tighter upper bound for the dot product than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz bound. This new bound leads directly to recos, a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by the sorted vector components. recos relaxes the condition for perfect similarity from strict linear dependence to ordinal concordance, thereby capturing a broader class of relationships. Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models--spanning static, contextualized, and universal types--demonstrate that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks. Our work establishes recos as a mathematically principled and empirically superior alternative, offering enhanced accuracy for semantic analysis in complex embedding spaces.

*Kim Hammar,Tansu Alpcan,Emil Lupu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework integrates LLMs into security management via iterative action generation, consistency checks, and feedback loops to reduce hallucinations and improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability and hallucination tendencies of LLMs in security management tasks like incident response planning.

Method: Proposes an iterative framework where LLM-generated actions undergo consistency checks and external feedback (e.g., digital twin evaluation), refined via in-context learning.

Result: Framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to leading LLMs in incident response scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates LLM hallucinations and enhances decision support in security management.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are promising tools for supporting security management tasks, such as incident response planning. However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions. To evaluate our framework, we apply it to an incident response use case where the goal is to generate a response and recovery plan based on system logs. Experiments on four public datasets show that our framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Paper critiques 'Universal Foundation Models for Time Series,' arguing they misinterpret structure for semantics due to incompatible generative processes. Introduces 'Autoregressive Blindness Bound' and advocates a 'Causal Control Agent' paradigm instead of universality. Recommends focusing benchmarks on drift adaptation speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the flawed assumption that time series data can be universally modeled, ignoring the diversity in generative processes across domains like finance and fluid dynamics.

Method: The paper introduces the 'Autoregressive Blindness Bound' to highlight the limitations of history-only models and proposes a 'Causal Control Agent' paradigm, which uses external context to manage specialized solvers.

Result: Monolithic models fail under distributional drift, and the proposed agent-based approach aims to improve robustness by leveraging domain-specific expertise.

Conclusion: The conclusion calls for a shift in evaluation benchmarks from zero-shot accuracy to drift adaptation speed, emphasizing robust, control-theoretic systems.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the pursuit of "Universal Foundation Models for Time Series" rests on a fundamental category error, mistaking a structural Container for a semantic Modality. We contend that because time series hold incompatible generative processes (e.g., finance vs. fluid dynamics), monolithic models degenerate into expensive "Generic Filters" that fail to generalize under distributional drift. To address this, we introduce the "Autoregressive Blindness Bound," a theoretical limit proving that history-only models cannot predict intervention-driven regime shifts. We advocate replacing universality with a Causal Control Agent paradigm, where an agent leverages external context to orchestrate a hierarchy of specialized solvers, from frozen domain experts to lightweight Just-in-Time adaptors. We conclude by calling for a shift in benchmarks from "Zero-Shot Accuracy" to "Drift Adaptation Speed" to prioritize robust, control-theoretic systems.

TL;DR: AMR is a novel MOOC recommendation framework that addresses data sparsity and over-specialization by embedding semantic content in automatically discovered metapaths, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional MOOC recommendation methods like collaborative filtering and graph-based approaches reliant on predefined metapaths.

Method: AMR uses bi-directional walks to discover metapaths, bi-LSTM-based encoders for aspect-aware path representations, and incorporates them into subgraphs.

Result: AMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on MOOCCube and PEEK datasets in metrics like HR@K and nDCG@K.

Conclusion: AMR effectively captures rich aspect information, enabling more accurate recommendations than predefined metapath methods.

Abstract: MOOC recommendation systems have received increasing attention to help learners navigate and select preferred learning content. Traditional methods such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering suffer from data sparsity and over-specialization. To alleviate these limitations, graph-based approaches have been proposed; however, they still rely heavily on manually predefined metapaths, which often capture only superficial structural relationships and impose substantial burdens on domain experts as well as significant engineering costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose AMR (Aspect-aware MOOC Recommendation), a novel framework that models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding the semantic content of nodes within each metapath. AMR automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, derives aspect-aware path representations using a bi-LSTM-based encoder, and incorporates these representations as edge features in the learner-learner and KC-KC subgraphs to achieve fine-grained semantically informed KC recommendations. Extensive experiments on the large-scale MOOCCube and PEEK datasets show that AMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines across key metrics such as HR@K and nDCG@K. Further analysis confirms that AMR effectively captures rich path-specific aspect information, allowing more accurate recommendations than those methods that rely solely on predefined metapaths. The code will be available upon accepted.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' negotiation skills using PieArena, a benchmark based on MBA-level scenarios, finding AGI-level performance in GPT-5 compared to trained students. It also identifies behavioral differences across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' strategic reasoning and economic value creation in negotiations, a critical business task, using realistic scenarios.

Method: Introduces PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark derived from MBA course scenarios, and evaluates LLMs, including GPT-5, against trained students.

Result: GPT-5 matches or outperforms trained students, showing AGI-level performance. Joint-intentionality scaffolding benefits mid- and lower-tier LMs more than frontier models. Behavioral profiles reveal diverse negotiation strategies.

Conclusion: Frontier LLMs like GPT-5 are intellectually ready for high-stakes negotiations, but robustness and trustworthiness issues persist.

Abstract: We present an in-depth evaluation of LLMs' ability to negotiate, a central business task that requires strategic reasoning, theory of mind, and economic value creation. To do so, we introduce PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark grounded in multi-agent interactions over realistic scenarios drawn from an MBA negotiation course at an elite business school. We find systematic evidence of AGI-level performance in which a representative frontier agent (GPT-5) matches or outperforms trained business-school students, despite a semester of general negotiation instruction and targeted coaching immediately prior to the task. We further study the effects of joint-intentionality agentic scaffolding and find asymmetric gains, with large improvements for mid- and lower-tier LMs and diminishing returns for frontier LMs. Beyond deal outcomes, PieArena provides a multi-dimensional negotiation behavioral profile, revealing novel cross-model heterogeneity, masked by deal-outcome-only benchmarks, in deception, computation accuracy, instruction compliance, and perceived reputation. Overall, our results suggest that frontier language agents are already intellectually and psychologically capable of deployment in high-stakes economic settings, but deficiencies in robustness and trustworthiness remain open challenges.

TL;DR: ProAct is a framework enhancing LLM agents' long-horizon planning via Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD) and Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic), outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing LLM agents' struggle with long-horizon planning due to compounding errors in future state simulations.

Method: ProAct uses GLAD for supervised fine-tuning on search-derived trajectories and MC-Critic for refining decision accuracy via lightweight rollouts.

Result: ProAct improves planning accuracy, with a 4B parameter model outperforming open-source baselines and rivaling closed-source models.

Conclusion: ProAct effectively enhances LLM agents' planning abilities and generalizes robustly to unseen environments.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agents struggle in interactive environments requiring long-horizon planning, primarily due to compounding errors when simulating future states. To address this, we propose ProAct, a framework that enables agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning through a two-stage training paradigm. First, we introduce Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD), where the agent undergoes supervised fine-tuning on trajectories derived from environment-based search. By compressing complex search trees into concise, causal reasoning chains, the agent learns the logic of foresight without the computational overhead of inference-time search. Second, to further refine decision accuracy, we propose the Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic), a plug-and-play auxiliary value estimator designed to enhance policy-gradient algorithms like PPO and GRPO. By leveraging lightweight environment rollouts to calibrate value estimates, MC-Critic provides a low-variance signal that facilitates stable policy optimization without relying on expensive model-based value approximation. Experiments on both stochastic (e.g., 2048) and deterministic (e.g., Sokoban) environments demonstrate that ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy. Notably, a 4B parameter model trained with ProAct outperforms all open-source baselines and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source models, while demonstrating robust generalization to unseen environments.

TL;DR: AgentXRay is a framework that reconstructs interpretable workflows from black-box agentic systems using search-based optimization and pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve interpretability and control of opaque agentic systems by synthesizing explicit workflows.

Method: Uses combinatorial optimization over workflow space with Monte Carlo Tree Search and Red-Black Pruning.

Result: Achieves higher similarity to target outputs and reduces token usage compared to baselines.

Conclusion: AgentXRay effectively reconstructs workflows without accessing internal model parameters.

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown strong capabilities in complex problem solving, yet many agentic systems remain difficult to interpret and control due to opaque internal workflows. While some frameworks offer explicit architectures for collaboration, many deployed agentic systems operate as black boxes to users. We address this by introducing Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR), a new task aiming to synthesize an explicit, interpretable stand-in workflow that approximates a black-box system using only input--output access. We propose AgentXRay, a search-based framework that formulates AWR as a combinatorial optimization problem over discrete agent roles and tool invocations in a chain-structured workflow space. Unlike model distillation, AgentXRay produces editable white-box workflows that match target outputs under an observable, output-based proxy metric, without accessing model parameters. To navigate the vast search space, AgentXRay employs Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by a scoring-based Red-Black Pruning mechanism, which dynamically integrates proxy quality with search depth. Experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that AgentXRay achieves higher proxy similarity and reduces token consumption compared to unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration under fixed iteration budgets.

TL;DR: PATHWAYS benchmarks web agents' ability to uncover and use hidden contextual info, revealing gaps in adaptive investigation and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if web agents can effectively discover and utilize hidden contextual information in complex multi-step decision tasks.

Method: Introduces PATHWAYS, a benchmark of 250 tasks testing closed and open models on context discovery, evidence integration, and judgement override.

Result: Agents often navigate to relevant pages but struggle with hidden evidence, hallucinate reasoning, and fail to integrate correct context. Explicit instructions improve context discovery but reduce accuracy.

Conclusion: Current web agent architectures lack reliable mechanisms for adaptive investigation, evidence integration, and judgement override.

Abstract: We introduce PATHWAYS, a benchmark of 250 multi-step decision tasks that test whether web-based agents can discover and correctly use hidden contextual information. Across both closed and open models, agents typically navigate to relevant pages but retrieve decisive hidden evidence in only a small fraction of cases. When tasks require overturning misleading surface-level signals, performance drops sharply to near chance accuracy. Agents frequently hallucinate investigative reasoning by claiming to rely on evidence they never accessed. Even when correct context is discovered, agents often fail to integrate it into their final decision. Providing more explicit instructions improves context discovery but often reduces overall accuracy, revealing a tradeoff between procedural compliance and effective judgement. Together, these results show that current web agent architectures lack reliable mechanisms for adaptive investigation, evidence integration, and judgement override.

*Youngcheon You,Banseok Lee,Minseop Choi,Seonyoung Kim,Hyochan Chong,Changdong Kim,Youngmin Kim,Dongkyu Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RaBiT, a novel quantization framework, resolves feature co-adaptation in residual binarization, achieving state-of-the-art 2-bit performance and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme quantization of large language models (LLMs) creates a trade-off between efficiency and performance. Residual binarization suffers from feature co-adaptation, limiting expressive capacity.

Method: RaBiT enforces a residual hierarchy by deriving each binary path from a shared full-precision weight, ensuring sequential error correction. It includes robust initialization prioritizing functional preservation.

Result: RaBiT achieves state-of-the-art 2-bit performance, rivals Vector Quantization methods, and speeds up inference by 4.49× on an RTX 4090.

Conclusion: RaBiT effectively addresses co-adaptation issues in residual binarization, enhancing efficiency and performance for LLM deployment.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) requires extreme quantization, forcing a critical trade-off between low-bit efficiency and performance. Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation. RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier: it achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals even hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.

Abstract: Domain specific large language models are increasingly used to support patient education, triage, and clinical decision making in ophthalmology, making rigorous evaluation essential to ensure safety and accuracy. This study evaluated four small medical LLMs Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, and MedLLaMA3-v20 in answering ophthalmology related patient queries and assessed the feasibility of LLM based evaluation against clinician grading. In this cross sectional study, 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by each model, generating 2160 responses. Models were selected for parameter sizes under 10 billion to enable resource efficient deployment. Responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists of differing seniority and by GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework assessing safety, consensus and context, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability, with ratings assigned on a five point Likert scale. Agreement between LLM and clinician grading was assessed using Spearman rank correlation, Kendall tau statistics, and kernel density estimate analyses. Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents. MedLLaMA3-v20 performed poorest, with 25.5 percent of responses containing hallucinations or clinically misleading content, including fabricated terminology. GPT-4-Turbo grading showed strong alignment with clinician assessments overall, with Spearman rho of 0.80 and Kendall tau of 0.67, though Senior Consultants graded more conservatively. Overall, medical LLMs demonstrated potential for safe ophthalmic question answering, but gaps remained in clinical depth and consensus, supporting the feasibility of LLM based evaluation for large scale benchmarking and the need for hybrid automated and clinician review frameworks to guide safe clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current opinion dynamics models, such as incomplete priors and poor physical transparency, by leveraging physical systems like DCR.

Method: Proposes OPINN, a framework combining Neural ODEs with DCR-inspired physical priors for opinion modeling.

Result: OPINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in forecasting opinion evolution on real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: OPINN offers a promising approach for integrating cyber, physical, and social systems in opinion dynamics modeling.

Abstract: Advanced opinion dynamics modeling is vital for deciphering social behavior, emphasizing its role in mitigating polarization and securing cyberspace. To synergize mechanistic interpretability with data-driven flexibility, recent studies have explored the integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for opinion modeling. Despite this promise, existing methods are tailored to incomplete priors, lacking a comprehensive physical system to integrate dynamics from local, global, and endogenous levels. Moreover, penalty-based constraints adopted in existing methods struggle to deeply encode physical priors, leading to optimization pathologies and discrepancy between latent representations and physical transparency. To this end, we offer a physical view to interpret opinion dynamics via Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory. Building upon the Neural ODEs, we define the neural opinion dynamics to coordinate neural networks with physical priors, and further present the OPINN, a physics-informed neural framework for opinion dynamics modeling. Evaluated on real-world and synthetic datasets, OPINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting, offering a promising paradigm for the nexus of cyber, physical, and social systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based automation solutions focus narrowly on patient-physician interactions or isolated subtasks, missing the complexity of real administrative workflows.

Method: H-AdminSim combines realistic data generation with multi-agent simulation, using FHIR integration for interoperability and standardized evaluation.

Result: The framework provides a unified environment for testing LLM-driven automation across diverse hospital settings.

Conclusion: H-AdminSim offers a standardized testbed to assess LLM feasibility and performance in administrative automation, bridging a critical gap in healthcare automation research.

Abstract: Hospital administration departments handle a wide range of operational tasks and, in large hospitals, process over 10,000 requests per day, driving growing interest in LLM-based automation. However, prior work has focused primarily on patient--physician interactions or isolated administrative subtasks, failing to capture the complexity of real administrative workflows. To address this gap, we propose H-AdminSim, a comprehensive end-to-end simulation framework that combines realistic data generation with multi-agent-based simulation of hospital administrative workflows. These tasks are quantitatively evaluated using detailed rubrics, enabling systematic comparison of LLMs. Through FHIR integration, H-AdminSim provides a unified and interoperable environment for testing administrative workflows across heterogeneous hospital settings, serving as a standardized testbed for assessing the feasibility and performance of LLM-driven administrative automation.

### [364] [THOR: Inductive Link Prediction over Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05424)
*Weijian Yu,Yuhuan Lu,Dingqi Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: THOR is an inductive link prediction method for hyper-relational knowledge graphs (HKGs) that outperforms existing techniques by capturing structural invariance across HKGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hyper-relational KG link prediction methods are transductive, limiting generalizability to unseen vocabularies. THOR addresses this by enabling fully-inductive inference.

Method: THOR uses relation and entity foundation graphs, modeled agnostically, with parallel graph encoders and a transformer decoder for masked training and inductive inference.

Result: THOR achieves significant improvements (66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4%) over rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive baselines across 12 datasets.

Conclusion: THOR's design effectively captures transferable structural invariance, making it a powerful tool for inductive hyper-relational link prediction.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a key ingredient supporting a variety of applications. Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings. Results show that THOR outperforms a sizable collection of baselines, yielding 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over the best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques, respectively. A series of ablation studies also reveals our key design factors capturing the structural invariance transferable across HKGs for inductive tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like high cost, poor quality, and low richness in manual and current GUI agent data mining methods.

Method: Proposes M$^2$-Miner with MCTS, a multi-agent framework (InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, JudgeAgent), intent recycling, and progressive model-in-the-loop training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on mobile GUI benchmarks using mined data.

Conclusion: M$^2$-Miner effectively enhances data mining for GUI agents, benefiting community research.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent is pivotal to advancing intelligent human-computer interaction paradigms. Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training. However, manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches typically face three critical challenges: high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness. To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using our mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks. Our work will be released to facilitate the community research.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates time series foundation models (TSFMs) for electricity price forecasting (EPF) in volatile markets, comparing them against traditional models and showing superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electricity price forecasting is crucial yet challenging due to volatility and nonlinearity. Existing models often fail to capture complex temporal dependencies or integrate heterogeneous data effectively.

Method: The paper introduces a spike regularization strategy and tests various TSFMs (TTMs, MOIRAI, MOMENT, TimesFM) against traditional models (ARIMA, LSTM, CNN-LSTM) using volatile Singapore market data.

Result: TSFMs consistently outperform traditional models, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE.

Conclusion: The findings highlight TSFMs' superiority for EPF in volatile markets, providing practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy.

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting (EPF) is essential for energy markets stakeholders (e.g. grid operators, energy traders, policymakers) but remains challenging due to the inherent volatility and nonlinearity of price signals. Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored. This paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates a wide range of TSFMs, including Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs), MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, against traditional statistical and DL models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM (CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data with volatile trends in Singapore. Exogenous factors (e.g. weather and calendar variables) are also incorporated into models where applicable. Results demonstrate that TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings. The findings offer practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy and decision-making in volatile electricity markets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OD-CRL is a new framework for conditional representation learning, using adaptive orthogonal basis optimization and null-space denoising projection to improve feature extraction and reduce interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for conditional representation learning are sensitive to subspace basis and prone to inter-subspace interference.

Method: OD-CRL integrates Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) for constructing orthogonal semantic bases and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP) to suppress irrelevant subspace interference.

Result: OD-CRL achieves state-of-the-art performance in customized clustering, classification, and retrieval tasks with superior generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed OD-CRL effectively addresses limitations of prior methods and advances conditional representation learning.

Abstract: Conditional representation learning aims to extract criterion-specific features for customized tasks. Recent studies project universal features onto the conditional feature subspace spanned by an LLM-generated text basis to obtain conditional representations. However, such methods face two key limitations: sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference. To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP). Specifically, AOBO constructs orthogonal semantic bases via singular value decomposition with a curvature-based truncation. NSDP suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces. Extensive experiments conducted across customized clustering, customized classification, and customized retrieval tasks demonstrate that OD-CRL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with superior generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALIVE framework advances LLM reasoning by replacing scalar rewards with intrinsic feedback, improving accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL's reliance on scalar rewards limits deep reasoning understanding; ALIVE aims to internalize reasoning logic.

Method: ALIVE combines adversarial learning and verbal feedback to unify problem posing, solving, and judging within one model.

Result: ALIVE improves accuracy, cross-domain generalization, and self-correction rates without extra data or compute.

Conclusion: ALIVE offers scalable reasoning alignment without human supervision, fostering self-sustaining capability growth.

Abstract: The quest for expert-level reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hampered by a persistent \textit{reward bottleneck}: traditional reinforcement learning (RL) relies on scalar rewards that are \textbf{costly} to scale, \textbf{brittle} across domains, and \textbf{blind} to the underlying logic of a solution. This reliance on external, impoverished signals prevents models from developing a deep, self-contained understanding of reasoning principles. We introduce \textbf{ALIVE} (\emph{Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation}), a hands-free alignment framework that moves beyond scalar reward optimization toward intrinsic reasoning acquisition. Grounded in the principle of \emph{Cognitive Synergy}, ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness. By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates. These results indicate that the reasoning trinity fosters a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth, positioning ALIVE as a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human-in-the-loop supervision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Phi-former improves drug discovery by modeling compound-protein interactions (CPIs) hierarchically, incorporating motifs for better accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for CPIs lack alignment with chemical realities, as they ignore the biological role of molecular fragments (motifs).

Method: Proposes Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method, modeling interactions at atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels.

Result: Phi-former outperforms existing methods in CPI-related tasks and provides interpretable insights into specific atoms or motifs involved.

Conclusion: Phi-former enhances CPI prediction accuracy and interpretability, aiding rational drug design and precision medicine.

Abstract: Drug discovery remains time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, often requiring years and substantial investment per drug candidate. Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial. Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks. A case study shows that our method accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs, providing interpretable model explanations. These insights may guide rational drug design and support precision medicine applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SDFP proposes a training-free, plug-and-play framework using FIT-based layer pruning to speed up LLM decoding without altering output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce latency in LLMs for multimedia applications without the cost and complexity of traditional draft models.

Method: Uses Fisher Information Trace-based layer pruning to create a compact draft model from the original LLM, eliminating the need for training or tuning.

Result: Achieves 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup while preserving output distribution.

Conclusion: SDFP offers a practical, deployment-friendly solution for low-latency multimedia applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) underpin interactive multimedia applications such as captioning, retrieval, recommendation, and creative content generation, yet their autoregressive decoding incurs substantial latency. Speculative decoding reduces latency using a lightweight draft model, but deployment is often limited by the cost and complexity of acquiring, tuning, and maintaining an effective draft model. Recent approaches usually require auxiliary training or specialization, and even training-free methods incur costly search or optimization. We propose SDFP, a fully training-free and plug-and-play framework that builds the draft model via Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning of a given LLM. Using layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation, SDFP removes low-impact layers to obtain a compact draft while preserving compatibility with the original model for standard speculative verification. SDFP needs no additional training, hyperparameter tuning, or separately maintained drafts, enabling rapid, deployment-friendly draft construction. Across benchmarks, SDFP delivers 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup without altering the target model's output distribution, supporting low-latency multimedia applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack comprehensive coverage of ameloblastoma and consistency for direct AI model training, necessitating a curated multimodal dataset and advanced AI framework.

Method: A multimodal dataset was created using annotated images and structured data. NLP extracted features from reports, and image data underwent preprocessing. A deep learning model was trained for variant classification and surgical planning.

Result: The model improved variant classification accuracy from 46.2% to 65.9% and abnormal tissue detection F1-score from 43.0% to 90.3%.

Conclusion: The work provides a robust dataset and adaptable AI framework, enhancing patient-specific decision support in maxillofacial pathology.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled diagnostics in maxillofacial pathology require structured, high-quality multimodal datasets. However, existing resources provide limited ameloblastoma coverage and lack the format consistency needed for direct model training. We present a newly curated multimodal dataset specifically focused on ameloblastoma, integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data derived from case reports. Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning. The model is designed to accept clinical inputs such as presenting complaint, age, and gender during deployment to enhance personalized inference. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated substantial improvements; variant classification accuracy increased from 46.2 percent to 65.9 percent, and abnormal tissue detection F1-score improved from 43.0 percent to 90.3 percent. Benchmarked against resources like MultiCaRe, this work advances patient-specific decision support by providing both a robust dataset and an adaptable multimodal AI framework.

TL;DR: SPT introduces a second honest persona in LoRA to detect misalignment in LLMs, outperforming standard methods with 96% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard auditing techniques fail to detect misaligned outputs or scale with model capabilities.

Method: Fine-tunes an honest persona via LoRA, activated post-response to review using the main model's latent states.

Result: Achieves 96% accuracy on a benchmark where standard methods report near 0%.

Conclusion: SPT effectively reveals latent knowledge and misalignment in LLMs.

Abstract: Detecting misalignment in large language models is challenging because models may learn to conceal misbehavior during training. Standard auditing techniques fall short: black-box methods often cannot distinguish misaligned outputs from benign ones, and mechanistic interpretability does not scale with model capabilities. We introduce Split Personality Training (SPT), which fine-tunes a second ``honest persona'' into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation. After the main model responds, we activate the LoRA adapter and insert a trigger string, enabling the honest persona to review the response while accessing the main model's latent states. We test our method on the Anthropic Auditing Game Model Organism, a benchmark where Llama-3.3-70B is trained to exploit reward hacks while concealing this behavior. SPT achieves 96% overall accuracy, whereas Anthropic reports near 0% accuracy. The honest persona reveals latent knowledge inaccessible to external observers, such as the fictional biases the compromised model was trained on.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for conditional generation in diffusion models under hard constraints, using Doob's h-transform and martingale theory to ensure constraint satisfaction without modifying pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard constraints are crucial in safety-critical applications and rare-event simulation, but existing methods lack guarantees. This work addresses that gap.

Method: The approach augments pretrained diffusion models with drift corrections derived from logarithmic gradients of conditioning functions, using martingale-based learning algorithms.

Result: The framework provides non-asymptotic guarantees for constraint satisfaction and demonstrates effectiveness in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method ensures hard constraint satisfaction in diffusion models, offering a reliable solution for safety-critical and rare-event applications.

Abstract: We study conditional generation in diffusion models under hard constraints, where generated samples must satisfy prescribed events with probability one. Such constraints arise naturally in safety-critical applications and in rare-event simulation, where soft or reward-based guidance methods offer no guarantee of constraint satisfaction. Building on a probabilistic interpretation of diffusion models, we develop a principled conditional diffusion guidance framework based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation and quadratic variation process. Specifically, the resulting guided dynamics augment a pretrained diffusion with an explicit drift correction involving the logarithmic gradient of a conditioning function, without modifying the pretrained score network. Leveraging martingale and quadratic-variation identities, we propose two novel off-policy learning algorithms based on a martingale loss and a martingale-covariation loss to estimate h and its gradient using only trajectories from the pretrained model. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees for the resulting conditional sampler in both total variation and Wasserstein distances, explicitly characterizing the impact of score approximation and guidance estimation errors. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in enforcing hard constraints and generating rare-event samples.

TL;DR: RGCF-XRec is a hybrid framework combining reasoning-guided collaborative filtering with language models for efficient, explainable sequential recommendations, showing significant improvements across multiple metrics and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based recommendation systems ignore collaborative signals and treat recommendation and explanation as separate tasks, leading to inefficiencies. RGCF-XRec aims to unify these aspects for better performance.

Method: RGCF-XRec integrates reasoning-guided CF knowledge into a language model via contextual prompting, a scoring mechanism for quality control, and unified representation learning to combine collaborative and semantic signals.

Result: The framework improves HR@10 and ROUGE-L scores significantly across datasets (e.g., 7.38% HR@10 in Sports), reduces cold-start gaps, and enhances zero-shot performance while maintaining training efficiency.

Conclusion: RGCF-XRec successfully unifies recommendation and explanation tasks, demonstrating robustness, generalization, and scalability, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit potential for explainable recommendation systems but overlook collaborative signals, while prevailing methods treat recommendation and explanation as separate tasks, resulting in a memory footprint. We present RGCF-XRec, a hybrid framework that introduces reasoning-guided collaborative filtering (CF) knowledge into a language model to deliver explainable sequential recommendations in a single step. Theoretical grounding and empirical findings reveal that RGCF-XRec offers three key merits over leading CF-aware LLM-based methods: (1) reasoning-guided augmentation of CF knowledge through contextual prompting to discover latent preferences and interpretable reasoning paths; (2) an efficient scoring mechanism based on four dimensions: coherence, completeness, relevance, and consistency to mitigate noisy CF reasoning traces and retain high-quality explanations; (3) a unified representation learning network that encodes collaborative and semantic signals, enabling a structured prompt to condition the LLM for explainable sequential recommendation. RGCF-XRec demonstrates consistent improvements across Amazon datasets, Sports, Toys, and Beauty, comprising 642,503 user-item interactions. It improves HR@10 by 7.38\% in Sports and 4.59\% in Toys, along with ROUGE-L by 8.02\% and 3.49\%, respectively. It reduces the cold warm performance gap, achieving overall gains of 14.5\% in cold-start and 11.9\% in warm start scenarios, and enhances zero-shot HR@5 by 18.54\% in Beauty and 23.16\% in Toys, highlighting effective generalization and robustness. Moreover, RGCF-XRec achieves training efficiency with a lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B backbone, ensuring scalability for real-world applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human spatial reasoning, the paper addresses VLMs' failures in geometric tasks and explores iterative refinement without parameter updates.

Method: A training-free verifier-refiner agent uses ICL and reward-guided feedback loops for recursive refinement based on geometric consistency.

Result: Substantial IoU improvements (e.g., 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases) demonstrate enhanced geometric reasoning in VLMs.

Conclusion: Incorporating human-inspired iterative refinement via ICL and reward loops advances self-improving AI in spatial domains.

Abstract: Humans excel at spatial reasoning tasks like Tangram puzzle assembly through cognitive processes involving mental rotation, iterative refinement, and visual feedback. Inspired by how humans solve Tangram puzzles through trial-and-error, observation, and correction, we design a framework that models these human cognitive mechanisms. However, comprehensive experiments across five representative Vision-Language Models (VLMs) reveal systematic failures in continuous geometric reasoning: average IoU of only 0.41 on single-piece tasks, dropping to 0.23 on two-piece composition, far below human performance where children can complete Tangram tasks successfully. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in self-improving AI: can models iteratively refine their predictions at test time without parameter updates? We introduce a test-time self-refinement framework that combines in-context learning (ICL) with reward-guided feedback loops, inspired by human cognitive processes. Our training-free verifier-refiner agent applies recursive refinement loops that iteratively self-refine predictions based on geometric consistency feedback, achieving IoU improvements from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases without any model retraining. This demonstrates that incorporating human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms through ICL and reward loops can substantially enhance geometric reasoning in VLMs, moving self-improving AI from promise to practice in continuous spatial domains.

*Subhadip Maji,Arnab Bhattacharya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method (GETR) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer to improve NLP performance in low-resource languages, showing significant improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of low-resource languages in NLP by leveraging knowledge from high-resource languages through cross-lingual transfer.

Method: Proposes GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer, alongside baselines like hidden layer augmentation and token embedding transfer.

Result: GETR achieves 13% improvement for POS tagging in low-resource languages and 20-27% in macro-F1 for sentiment classification and NER tasks.

Conclusion: The GNN-based approach outperforms existing methods, with detailed analysis revealing key factors for successful cross-lingual knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in natural language processing, developing effective systems for low-resource languages remains a formidable challenge, with performances typically lagging far behind high-resource counterparts due to data scarcity and insufficient linguistic resources. Cross-lingual knowledge transfer has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge by leveraging resources from high-resource languages. In this paper, we investigate methods for transferring linguistic knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, where the number of labeled training instances is in hundreds. We focus on sentence-level and word-level tasks. We introduce a novel method, GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer along with two adopted baselines (a) augmentation in hidden layers and (b) token embedding transfer through token translation. Experimental results demonstrate that our GNN-based approach significantly outperforms existing multilingual and cross-lingual baseline methods, achieving 13 percentage point improvements on truly low-resource languages (Mizo, Khasi) for POS tagging, and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on simulated low-resource languages (Marathi, Bangla, Malayalam) across sentiment classification and NER tasks respectively. We also present a detailed analysis of the transfer mechanisms and identify key factors that contribute to successful knowledge transfer in this linguistic context.

*Simon Kohaut,Benedict Flade,Julian Eggert,Kristian Kersting,Devendra Singh Dhami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Resin and Reactive Circuits (RCs) for efficient, exact probabilistic reasoning in dynamic environments by leveraging heterogeneous update rates, reducing redundant computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for probabilistic inference in dynamic environments are inefficient due to full model re-evaluations, ignoring varying update rates in real-world data streams.

Method: Introduces Resin, a probabilistic programming language combining probabilistic logic with reactive programming, and RCs, a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, to adapt computations based on input signal volatility.

Result: Achieves significant speedup in drone swarm simulations, reduces latency, and enables reactive real-time reasoning by memoizing sub-problems and re-evaluating only affected model components.

Conclusion: The approach successfully captures environmental dynamics, optimizes computation, and supports scalable, efficient inference in streaming contexts.

Abstract: Exact inference in complex probabilistic models often incurs prohibitive computational costs. This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.

### [378] [Generative Ontology: When Structured Knowledge Learns to Create](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05636)
*Benny Cheung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative Ontology combines traditional ontologies with large language models (LLMs) to create structured yet creative outputs, demonstrated through a framework called GameGrammar for generating tabletop games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ontologies lack creativity, while LLMs lack structural validity. The goal is to merge their strengths to produce valid yet novel artifacts.

Method: Generative Ontology uses executable Pydantic schemas to constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures, employing a multi-agent pipeline with specialized roles and retrieval-augmented generation.

Result: The framework produces structurally complete and playable game designs, such as 'GameGrammar', which adheres to ontological constraints while remaining creative.

Conclusion: Constraints enhance creativity, and the approach can be generalized to domains with expert vocabulary and validity constraints, like music or software architecture.

Abstract: Traditional ontologies excel at describing domain structure but cannot generate novel artifacts. Large language models generate fluently but produce outputs that lack structural validity, hallucinating mechanisms without components, goals without end conditions. We introduce Generative Ontology, a framework that synthesizes these complementary strengths: ontology provides the grammar; the LLM provides the creativity.
  Generative Ontology encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas that constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline assigns specialized roles to different ontology domains: a Mechanics Architect designs game systems, a Theme Weaver integrates narrative, a Balance Critic identifies exploits. Each agent carrying a professional "anxiety" that prevents shallow, agreeable outputs. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds novel designs in precedents from existing exemplars, while iterative validation ensures coherence between mechanisms and components.
  We demonstrate the framework through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs. Given a thematic prompt ("bioluminescent fungi competing in a cave ecosystem"), the pipeline produces structurally complete, playable game specifications with mechanisms, components, victory conditions, and setup instructions. These outputs satisfy ontological constraints while remaining genuinely creative.
  The pattern generalizes beyond games. Any domain with expert vocabulary, validity constraints, and accumulated exemplars (music composition, software architecture, culinary arts) is a candidate for Generative Ontology. We argue that constraints do not limit creativity but enable it: just as grammar makes poetry possible, ontology makes structured generation possible.

Result: It highlights the effectiveness of graph-based memory in organizing and evolving agent knowledge, supported by open-source resources.

Conclusion: The survey provides insights for advancing efficient, reliable graph-based memory systems and identifies future research challenges.

Abstract: Memory emerges as the core module in the Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents for long-horizon complex tasks (e.g., multi-turn dialogue, game playing, scientific discovery), where memory can enable knowledge accumulation, iterative reasoning and self-evolution. Among diverse paradigms, graph stands out as a powerful structure for agent memory due to the intrinsic capabilities to model relational dependencies, organize hierarchical information, and support efficient retrieval. This survey presents a comprehensive review of agent memory from the graph-based perspective. First, we introduce a taxonomy of agent memory, including short-term vs. long-term memory, knowledge vs. experience memory, non-structural vs. structural memory, with an implementation view of graph-based memory. Second, according to the life cycle of agent memory, we systematically analyze the key techniques in graph-based agent memory, covering memory extraction for transforming the data into the contents, storage for organizing the data efficiently, retrieval for retrieving the relevant contents from memory to support reasoning, and evolution for updating the contents in the memory. Third, we summarize the open-sourced libraries and benchmarks that support the development and evaluation of self-evolving agent memory. We also explore diverse application scenarios. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future research directions. This survey aims to offer actionable insights to advance the development of more efficient and reliable graph-based agent memory systems.

*Hiari Pizzini Cavagna,Andrea Proia,Giacomo Madella,Giovanni B. Esposito,Francesco Antici,Daniele Cesarini,Zeynep Kiziltan,Andrea Bartolini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes energy efficiency in Large Language Models (LLMs) inference, identifying non-linear energy consumption patterns. It introduces an analytical model to predict efficiency and suggests aligning sequence lengths with 'Sweet Spots' to reduce energy use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the energy footprint of LLMs is crucial as they become central to AI applications. Existing linear estimation methods fail to capture the non-linear energy efficiency regimes observed in real-world usage.

Method: The authors propose an analytical model based on the computational and memory-access complexity of Transformer architectures. They validate the model using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across various LLMs (1B-9B parameters) and token lengths (64-4096).

Result: The model achieves a mean MAPE of 1.79%, accurately predicting energy consumption. Efficiency peaks for moderate input and output lengths, sharply declining for very short or long sequences.

Conclusion: Aligning sequence lengths with identified 'Sweet Spots' can significantly reduce energy consumption, aiding strategies like truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation in production systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inference is central in modern AI applications, making it critical to understand their energy footprint. Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency "Sweet Spots" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.

*Yihao Ouyang,Shiwei Li,Haozhao Wang,Xiandi Luo,Zhuoqi Hu,Yuetong Song,Qiyu Qin,Yichen Li,Ruixuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GenLoRA replaces explicit basis vectors in LoRA with lightweight nonlinear functions for more efficient parameter use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA's explicit-rank paradigm leads to substantial parameter growth; GenLoRA addresses this redundancy with compact nonlinear representations.

Method: GenLoRA uses latent vectors and radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize basis vectors, reducing parameter count.

Result: GenLoRA achieves higher effective LoRA ranks with fewer parameters, improving fine-tuning performance across datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: GenLoRA offers a parameter-efficient alternative to LoRA by leveraging nonlinear basis vector generation.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) approximates the update of a pretrained weight matrix using the product of two low-rank matrices. However, standard LoRA follows an explicit-rank paradigm, where increasing model capacity requires adding more rows or columns (i.e., basis vectors) to the low-rank matrices, leading to substantial parameter growth. In this paper, we find that these basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions. Therefore, we propose Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation. Specifically, GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors. Each RBF requires far fewer parameters than an explicit basis vector, enabling higher parameter efficiency in GenLoRA. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures show that GenLoRA attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, resulting in superior fine-tuning performance.

*Tianyi Wang,Long Li,Hongcan Guo,Yibiao Chen,Yixia Li,Yong Wang,Yun Chen,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR suffers from Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), which collapses valid alternatives. APO shifts focus to Support Coverage, balancing sharpening for efficiency and preventing collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the irreversible collapse (RSC) in RLVR caused by sharpening and squeezing dynamics, where KL regularization leads to gradient conflicts.

Method: Introduce Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), defining a Safe Manifold for support coverage, allowing aggressive sharpening and selective restorative forces.

Result: APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, improving Pass@1 while maintaining Pass@K diversity in benchmarks.

Conclusion: APO effectively mitigates RSC by focusing on support coverage, enabling better performance without sacrificing diversity.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is increasingly viewed as a tree pruning mechanism. However, we identify a systemic pathology termed Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), an irreversible collapse driven by the combined dynamics of positive sharpening and negative squeezing, where the sampling probability of valid alternatives vanishes. While Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization aims to mitigate this, it imposes a rigid Shape Matching constraint that forces the policy to mimic the reference model's full density, creating a gradient conflict with the sharpening required for correctness. We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage. By defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, APO permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency while selectively invoking a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. We theoretically derive that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches. Empirical evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods.

*Taoye Yin,Haoyuan Hu,Yaxin Fan,Xinhao Chen,Xinya Wu,Kai Deng,Kezun Zhang,Feng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLFKV, a Reinforcement Learning framework with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification, to reduce hallucinations in financial RAG systems by decomposing responses into atomic units and rewarding correctness and informativeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial RAG systems often produce responses inconsistent with retrieved documents due to hallucinations, despite the documents addressing knowledge gaps.

Method: Proposes RLFKV, which decomposes responses into atomic knowledge units, verifies each unit's correctness for fine-grained rewards, and adds an informativeness reward to avoid overly concise replies.

Result: Experiments on FDD and FDD-ANT datasets show consistent improvements, validating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: RLFKV enhances response reliability and informativeness in financial RAG systems, aligning outputs better with retrieved documents.

Abstract: In financial Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, models frequently rely on retrieved documents to generate accurate responses due to the time-sensitive nature of the financial domain. While retrieved documents help address knowledge gaps, model-generated responses still suffer from hallucinations that contradict the retrieved information. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV). Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward. This reward offers more precise optimization signals, thereby improving alignment with the retrieved documents. Additionally, to prevent reward hacking (e.g., overly concise replies), we incorporate an informativeness reward that encourages the policy model to retain at least as many knowledge units as the base model. Experiments conducted on the public Financial Data Description (FDD) task and our newly proposed FDD-ANT dataset demonstrate consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeakBoost is a perceptual-loss-based framework that actively probes ML models to expose membership signals, significantly improving membership inference attack performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing membership inference attacks rely on static indicators, missing dynamic behaviors. LeakBoost aims to leverage model probing for better privacy risk assessment.

Method: LeakBoost synthesizes interrogation images by optimizing perceptual objectives, amplifying representational differences between members and non-members. Uses off-the-shelf detectors without modification.

Result: Achieves AUC improvements (0.53-0.62 to 0.81-0.88) and higher TPR at low FPR across datasets and architectures. Deeper layers and low-learning-rate optimization work best.

Conclusion: LeakBoost efficiently assesses privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing dynamic membership inference studies.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a sample was part of a model's training set, posing serious privacy risks for modern machine-learning systems. Existing MIAs primarily rely on static indicators, such as loss or confidence, and do not fully leverage the dynamic behavior of models when actively probed. We propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals. Given a candidate input, LeakBoost synthesizes an interrogation image by optimizing a perceptual (activation-space) objective, amplifying representational differences between members and non-members. This image is then analyzed by an off-the-shelf membership detector, without modifying the detector itself. When combined with existing membership inference methods, LeakBoost achieves substantial improvements at low false-positive rates across multiple image classification datasets and diverse neural network architectures. In particular, it raises AUC from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, and increases TPR at 1 percent FPR by over an order of magnitude compared to strong baseline attacks. A detailed sensitivity analysis reveals that deeper layers and short, low-learning-rate optimization produce the strongest leakage, and that improvements concentrate in gradient-based detectors. LeakBoost thus offers a modular and computationally efficient way to assess privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing the study of dynamic membership inference.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if automatic optimization can replace fine-tuning tasks like prompt design and control strategies in AI agents.

Method: Evaluated various automatic optimizers on a Rocq proof-generation agent, focusing on aspects like prompt design.

Result: Few-shot bootstrapping was most effective, but none surpassed a manually optimized state-of-the-art agent.

Conclusion: Automatic optimization shows promise but cannot yet replace careful manual engineering in high-performance agents.

Abstract: This work studies the applicability of automatic AI agent optimization methods to real-world agents in formal verification settings, focusing on automated theorem proving in Rocq as a representative and challenging domain. We evaluate how different automatic agent optimizers perform when applied to the task of optimizing a Rocq proof-generation agent, and assess whether parts of the fine-grained tuning of agentic systems, such as prompt design, contextual knowledge, and control strategies, can be automated. Our results show that while several optimizers yield measurable improvements, simple few-shot bootstrapping is the most consistently effective; however, none of the studied methods matches the performance of a carefully engineered state-of-the-art proof agent.

Motivation: Existing RL-based training frameworks for VLA models suffer from resource underutilization and throughput limitations due to synchronous execution. The paper aims to address this bottleneck.

Method: The framework introduces a multi-level decoupled architecture, including asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction, streaming policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates.

Result: The method achieves up to 59.25% throughput improvement on the LIBERO benchmark, with further optimizations increasing it by 126.67%. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component, and scalability tests show excellent performance across 8 to 256 GPUs.

Conclusion: The proposed fully-asynchronous framework significantly enhances training efficiency and scalability for VLA models, addressing key limitations of synchronous approaches.

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a crucial pathway towards general embodied intelligence, yet their training efficiency has become a key bottleneck. Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies. Scaling law validation across 8 to 256 GPUs demonstrates our method's excellent scalability under most conditions.

Abstract: We present FiMI (Finance Model for India), a domain-specialized financial language model developed for Indian digital payment systems. We develop two model variants: FiMI Base and FiMI Instruct. FiMI adapts the Mistral Small 24B architecture through a multi-stage training pipeline, beginning with continuous pre-training on 68 Billion tokens of curated financial, multilingual (English, Hindi, Hinglish), and synthetic data. This is followed by instruction fine-tuning and domain-specific supervised fine-tuning focused on multi-turn, tool-driven conversations that model real-world workflows, such as transaction disputes and mandate lifecycle management. Evaluations reveal that FiMI Base achieves a 20% improvement over the Mistral Small 24B Base model on finance reasoning benchmark, while FiMI Instruct outperforms the Mistral Small 24B Instruct model by 87% on domain-specific tool-calling. Moreover, FiMI achieves these significant domain gains while maintaining comparable performance to models of similar size on general benchmarks.

TL;DR: NEX is a framework for ranking responses in large language models by analyzing exploration-exploitation phases in reasoning, improving accuracy without task supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The bottleneck in large language models has shifted from generation to selection, often lacking supervision on the target distribution. NEX addresses this by providing unsupervised scoring.

Method: NEX uses entropy-based exploration proxies, detects exploration-exploitation phases via MLP neuron activation, and employs a sticky two-state HMM to rank responses.

Result: NEX predicts downstream accuracy and identifies better variants across reasoning benchmarks and merged model families.

Conclusion: NEX offers an interpretable, unsupervised method to improve response selection in large language models, validated by human annotations and neuron transfer experiments.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly spend inference compute sampling multiple chain-of-thought traces or searching over merged checkpoints. This shifts the bottleneck from generation to selection, often without supervision on the target distribution. We show entropy-based exploration proxies follow an inverted-U with accuracy, suggesting extra exploration can become redundant and induce overthinking. We propose NEX, a white-box label-free unsupervised scoring framework that views reasoning as alternating E-phase (exploration) and X-phase (exploitation). NEX detects E-phase as spikes in newly activated MLP neurons per token from sparse activation caches, then uses a sticky two-state HMM to infer E-X phases and credits E-introduced neurons by whether they are reused in the following X span. These signals yield interpretable neuron weights and a single Good-Mass Fraction score to rank candidate responses and merged variants without task answers. Across reasoning benchmarks and Qwen3 merge families, NEX computed on a small unlabeled activation set predicts downstream accuracy and identifies better variants; we further validate the E-X signal with human annotations and provide causal evidence via "Effective-vs-Redundant" neuron transfer.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The imbalance between abundant spatial transcriptomics and scarce spatial proteomics data hinders biological research.

Result: The framework aims to accurately predict unknown spatial protein expression, aiding integration of spatial multi-omics.

Conclusion: STProtein can accelerate discoveries by uncovering hidden protein patterns and relationships, advancing life sciences.

Abstract: The integration of spatial multi-omics data from single tissues is crucial for advancing biological research.

To overcome this challenge we propose STProtein, a novel framework leveraging graph neural networks with multi-task learning strategy. STProtein is designed to accurately predict unknown spatial protein expression using more accessible spatial multi-omics data, such as spatial transcriptomics. We believe that STProtein can effectively addresses the scarcity of spatial proteomics, accelerating the integration of spatial multi-omics and potentially catalyzing transformative breakthroughs in life sciences.

*Zihao Jiang,Miao Peng,Zhenyan Shan,Wenjie Xu,Ben Liu,Gong Chen,Ziqi Gao,Min Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TKG-Thinker is a novel agent for temporal knowledge graph question answering, addressing hallucinations and static prompting via dynamic reasoning and dual-training (SFT + RL). It outperforms benchmarks with strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs in TKGQA suffer from reasoning hallucinations and static prompting, limiting efficacy. A dynamic, adaptive solution is needed.

Method: TKG-Thinker uses dual-training: SFT for planning and RL for refining policies under temporal constraints, enabling dynamic interactions with TKGs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks with strong generalization across complex TKGQA tasks.

Conclusion: TKG-Thinker effectively addresses LLM limitations in TKGQA through autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) aims to answer time-sensitive questions by leveraging temporal knowledge bases. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in TKGQA, current prompting strategies constrain their efficacy in two primary ways. First, they are prone to reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints. Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy. We first apply Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of thought data to instill core planning capabilities, followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that leverages multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under intricate temporal constraints. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with three open-source LLMs show that TKG-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generalization across complex TKGQA settings.

*Shengpu Wang,Yuhao Mao,Yani Zhang,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Boolean networks offer efficiency but are hard to optimize. This work introduces learned connections, compact convolutions, and adaptive discretization to improve accuracy and reduce computational costs, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floating-point neural networks are resource-intensive, prompting interest in Boolean networks for constrained settings, though they are difficult to optimize.

Method: Three strategies are proposed: learned connections (no extra parameters), compact convolutional architectures (fewer operations), and adaptive discretization (reducing accuracy loss).

Result: The method achieves better accuracy with up to 37x fewer Boolean operations on vision benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly advances the accuracy-computation trade-off for Boolean networks.

Abstract: Floating-point neural networks dominate modern machine learning but incur substantial inference cost, motivating interest in Boolean networks for resource-constrained settings. However, learning compact and accurate Boolean networks is challenging due to their combinatorial nature. In this work, we address this challenge from three different angles: learned connections, compact convolutions and adaptive discretization. First, we propose a novel strategy to learn efficient connections with no additional parameters and negligible computational overhead. Second, we introduce a novel convolutional Boolean architecture that exploits the locality with reduced number of Boolean operations than existing methods. Third, we propose an adaptive discretization strategy to reduce the accuracy drop when converting a continuous-valued network into a Boolean one. Extensive results on standard vision benchmarks demonstrate that the Pareto front of accuracy vs. computation of our method significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art, achieving better accuracy with up to 37x fewer Boolean operations.

TL;DR: OmniVideo-R1 introduces reinforced audio-visual understanding through self-supervised grounding and contrastive fusion, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing omnivideo models struggle with audio-visual understanding despite humans leveraging diverse modalities synergistically.

Method: OmniVideo-R1 uses query-intensive grounding (self-supervised learning) and modality-attentive fusion (contrastive learning).

Result: Extensive benchmarks show consistent outperformance of baselines, proving effectiveness and generalization.

Conclusion: OmniVideo-R1 demonstrates robust mixed-modality reasoning, advancing omnivideo models.

Abstract: While humans perceive the world through diverse modalities that operate synergistically to support a holistic understanding of their surroundings, existing omnivideo models still face substantial challenges on audio-visual understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose OmniVideo-R1, a novel reinforced framework that improves mixed-modality reasoning. OmniVideo-R1 empowers models to "think with omnimodal cues" by two key strategies: (1) query-intensive grounding based on self-supervised learning paradigms; and (2) modality-attentive fusion built upon contrastive learning paradigms. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that OmniVideo-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and robust generalization capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of benchmarks assessing AI's ability to integrate experimental results with contextual knowledge in biology.

Method: Constructed from peer-reviewed research papers and real-world studies to reflect scientific complexity.

Result: BABE challenges models with causal reasoning and cross-scale inference tasks.

Conclusion: BABE offers a robust framework to assess AI's potential contributions to biological research.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has expanded their capabilities from basic dialogue to advanced scientific reasoning. However, existing benchmarks in biology often fail to assess a critical skill required of researchers: the ability to integrate experimental results with contextual knowledge to derive meaningful conclusions. To address this gap, we introduce BABE(Biology Arena BEnchmark), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the experimental reasoning capabilities of biological AI systems. BABE is uniquely constructed from peer-reviewed research papers and real-world biological studies, ensuring that tasks reflect the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of actual scientific inquiry. BABE challenges models to perform causal reasoning and cross-scale inference. Our benchmark provides a robust framework for assessing how well AI systems can reason like practicing scientists, offering a more authentic measure of their potential to contribute to biological research.

*Anton Ipsen,Michael Cashmore,Kirsty Fielding,Nicolas Marchesotti,Parisa Zehtabi,Daniele Magazzeni,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hierarchical Seating Allocation Problem (HSAP) to optimize seating arrangements for hierarchical teams, proposing a scalable framework using probabilistic road maps and heuristic search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large organizations manually manage team seating, leading to suboptimal arrangements. Automating this process for hierarchical teams is the goal.

Method: Combines probabilistic road maps (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) with heuristic search and dynamic programming, framed as integer programming.

Result: Demonstrates the approach through quantitative and qualitative evaluation across different problem sizes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework efficiently automates and optimizes hierarchical seating arrangements, improving over manual methods.

Abstract: We introduce the Hierarchical Seating Allocation Problem (HSAP) which addresses the optimal assignment of hierarchically structured organizational teams to physical seating arrangements on a floor plan. This problem is driven by the necessity for large organizations with large hierarchies to ensure that teams with close hierarchical relationships are seated in proximity to one another, such as ensuring a research group occupies a contiguous area. Currently, this problem is managed manually leading to infrequent and suboptimal replanning efforts. To alleviate this manual process, we propose an end-to-end framework to solve the HSAP. A scalable approach to calculate the distance between any pair of seats using a probabilistic road map (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) which is combined with heuristic search and dynamic programming approach to solve the HSAP using integer programming. We demonstrate our approach under different sized instances by evaluating the PRM framework and subsequent allocations both quantitatively and qualitatively.

*Lukas Stappen,Ahmet Erkan Turan,Johann Hagerer,Georg Groh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgentHeLLM, a threat modeling framework for LLM-based conversational agents in vehicles, separating asset identification from attack path analysis to enhance security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI security frameworks lack rigorous separation of concerns, creating gaps in addressing threats posed by LLM-based agents in automotive systems.

Method: Proposes AgentHeLLM, featuring a human-centric asset taxonomy and formal graph-based model distinguishing poison from trigger paths, with an open-source tool for automated threat discovery.

Result: Demonstrates practical applicability through the AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator, automating multi-stage threat discovery.

Conclusion: AgentHeLLM provides a structured approach to mitigate security risks in LLM-based automotive assistants, filling methodological gaps.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents into vehicles creates novel security challenges at the intersection of agentic AI, automotive safety, and inter-agent communication. As these intelligent assistants coordinate with external services via protocols such as Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), they establish attack surfaces where manipulations can propagate through natural language payloads, potentially causing severe consequences ranging from driver distraction to unauthorized vehicle control. Existing AI security frameworks, while foundational, lack the rigorous "separation of concerns" standard in safety-critical systems engineering by co-mingling the concepts of what is being protected (assets) with how it is attacked (attack paths). This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM (Agent Hazard Exploration for LLM Assistants) that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. We introduce a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented "victim modeling" and inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions). We demonstrate the framework's practical applicability through an open-source attack path suggestion tool AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper highlights pitfalls in using LLMs for Modeling & Simulation (M&S) and provides practical guidance to avoid common mistakes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of LLMs in M&S workflows has revealed subtle issues and inefficiencies, necessitating clearer guidelines to optimize their application.

Method: The paper analyzes common misconceptions and practices in LLM usage, focusing on non-determinism, knowledge augmentation, data decomposition, and hyper-parameters.

Result: It identifies scenarios where LLM usage can lead to degraded performance or unnecessary complexity and offers corrective strategies.

Conclusion: The authors advocate for informed design choices and empirical evaluation to ensure effective and efficient LLM integration in M&S.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become familiar tools to researchers and practitioners. Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings. We emphasize principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation, with the goal of helping modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs.

*Eva Andrés*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Comparison of classical and quantum RL approaches for CVRP shows hybrid quantum-classical models perform best in routing quality and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore quantum-enhanced RL for solving complex combinatorial optimization problems like CVRP.

Method: Implemented A2C agent in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants using transformer architectures with attention mechanisms.

Result: Quantum-enhanced models outperformed classical baselines, with hybrid architecture showing best performance in distance, compactness, and overlap.

Conclusion: Hybrid quantum-classical RL holds promise for tackling complex optimization tasks like CVRP.

Abstract: This paper addresses the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by comparing classical and quantum Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap. In addition to quantitative improvements, qualitative visualizations reveal that quantum-based models generate more structured and coherent routing solutions. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems such as the CVRP.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GATTF, a geographically-aware Transformer model for motorway traffic forecasting, leveraging mutual information between sensors to improve accuracy without added complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital-twin tech relies on real-time and predicted traffic data, but existing models struggle with spatio-temporal complexities, needing better accuracy and simplicity.

Method: Proposes GATTF, a Transformer-based model using mutual information between sensors for geographical awareness.

Result: GATTF outperforms standard Transformers in accuracy using Geneva motorway data, maintaining simplicity.

Conclusion: Incorporating geographical awareness via mutual information enhances traffic forecasting accuracy effectively.

Abstract: The operational effectiveness of digital-twin technology in motorway traffic management depends on the availability of a continuous flow of high-resolution real-time traffic data. To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem. Sequence-based deep-learning models offer clear advantages over classical machine learning and statistical models in capturing long-range, temporal dependencies in time-series traffic data, yet limitations in forecasting accuracy and model complexity point to the need for further improvements. To improve motorway traffic forecasting, this paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting GATTF model, which exploits the geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information (MI). The model has been evaluated using real-time data from the Geneva motorway network in Switzerland and results confirm that incorporating geographical awareness through MI enhances the accuracy of GATTF forecasting compared to a standard Transformer, without increasing model complexity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using Whisper, a pre-trained ASR model, for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) with attention-based pooling methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on Persian datasets and highlighting Whisper's effectiveness for SER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited standard and large datasets in SER research prompt the use of pre-trained models like Whisper for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction while preserving emotional features.

Method: Two attention-based pooling methods (Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling) are proposed to reduce Whisper representation dimensionality. Experiments are conducted on IEMOCAP (English) and ShEMO (Persian) datasets using Whisper Tiny and Small models.

Result: The QKV architecture achieves a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy on ShEMO. Intermediate Whisper encoder layers perform better for SER on Persian datasets, offering a lightweight alternative to larger models like HuBERT X-Large.

Conclusion: Whisper shows promise as an SER representation extractor, and attention-based pooling effectively reduces dimensionality while maintaining emotional features.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) research has faced limitations due to the lack of standard and sufficiently large datasets. Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained models to extract features for downstream tasks such as SER. This work explores the capabilities of Whisper, a pre-trained ASR system, in speech emotion recognition by proposing two attention-based pooling methods, Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling, designed to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of Whisper representations while preserving emotional features. We experiment on English and Persian, using the IEMOCAP and ShEMO datasets respectively, with Whisper Tiny and Small. Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy. We further compare the performance of different Whisper encoder layers and find that intermediate layers often perform better for SER on the Persian dataset, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to much larger models such as HuBERT X-Large. Our findings highlight the potential of Whisper as a representation extractor for SER and demonstrate the effectiveness of attention-based pooling for dimension reduction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack settings for evaluating language-mediated economic interactions among multiple LLM-based agents, which is critical for autonomous negotiation, coordination, and transactions.

Method: AgenticPay simulates markets with private constraints and product-dependent valuations, requiring multi-round linguistic negotiation. It includes over 110 tasks, structured action extraction, and metrics for feasibility, efficiency, and welfare.

Result: Benchmarking shows significant gaps in negotiation performance among state-of-the-art LLMs and highlights challenges in long-horizon strategic reasoning.

Conclusion: AgenticPay provides a foundational framework for studying agentic commerce and language-based market interactions, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly expected to negotiate, coordinate, and transact autonomously, yet existing benchmarks lack principled settings for evaluating language-mediated economic interaction among multiple agents. We introduce AgenticPay, a benchmark and simulation framework for multi-agent buyer-seller negotiation driven by natural language. AgenticPay models markets in which buyers and sellers possess private constraints and product-dependent valuations, and must reach agreements through multi-round linguistic negotiation rather than numeric bidding alone. The framework supports a diverse suite of over 110 tasks ranging from bilateral bargaining to many-to-many markets, with structured action extraction and metrics for feasibility, efficiency, and welfare. Benchmarking state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight LLMs reveals substantial gaps in negotiation performance and highlights challenges in long-horizon strategic reasoning, establishing AgenticPay as a foundation for studying agentic commerce and language-based market interaction.

*Christopher A. McClurg,Alan R. Wagner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) to overcome scalability issues in VR-based school security evaluations, enabling large-scale testing of intervention strategies like robot-based shooter responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VR methods for assessing school security interventions face scalability challenges due to the need for new human cohorts per condition, hindering iterative or large-scale evaluation.

Method: A DES models shooter behavior as stochastic processes based on VR participant data. This simulator is validated by replicating empirical patterns and then used to evaluate robot-based intervention strategies.

Result: The DES successfully replicates key behavioral patterns and facilitates scalable testing of interventions impractical to assess directly with humans.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow offers a scalable, mid-fidelity alternative for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions, bridging gaps left by VR limitations.

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for evaluating school security measures in high-risk scenarios such as school shootings, offering experimental control and high behavioral fidelity. However, assessing new interventions in VR requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult. These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy. Once shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, the DES enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that are infeasible to train directly with human subjects. Overall, this work demonstrates a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DyTopo introduces a dynamic, manager-guided multi-agent framework that adjusts communication patterns per round, improving multi-round reasoning and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems use fixed communication patterns, which don't adapt to the changing needs of iterative problem-solving.

Method: DyTopo reconstructs a sparse directed communication graph each round based on agents' needs and offers, using semantic matching for efficient message routing.

Result: DyTopo outperforms baselines by an average of 6.2 points across benchmarks and provides interpretable coordination traces.

Conclusion: DyTopo's dynamic communication approach enhances both performance and interpretability in multi-agent reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built from prompted large language models can improve multi-round reasoning, yet most existing pipelines rely on fixed, trajectory-wide communication patterns that are poorly matched to the stage-dependent needs of iterative problem solving. We introduce DyTopo, a manager-guided multi-agent framework that reconstructs a sparse directed communication graph at each round. Conditioned on the manager's round goal, each agent outputs lightweight natural-language query (need) and \key (offer) descriptors; DyTopo embeds these descriptors and performs semantic matching, routing private messages only along the induced edges. Across code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks and four LLM backbones, DyTopo consistently outperforms over the strongest baseline (avg. +6.2). Beyond accuracy, DyTopo yields an interpretable coordination trace via the evolving graphs, enabling qualitative inspection of how communication pathways reconfigure across rounds.
