Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperHead enhances low-resolution 3D talking heads using a dynamics-aware 3D inversion scheme with generative priors, achieving high-fidelity avatars with consistent animation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-quality sources hinder high-fidelity 3D talking heads; SuperHead aims to improve geometry and texture synthesis while maintaining 3D/temporal consistency and identity.

Method: Leverages pre-trained 3D generative models via dynamics-aware inversion, optimizing latent representations for super-resolved 3DGS models rigged to FLAME for animation, supervised by upscaled 2D renderings and depth maps.

Result: Produces avatars with fine-grained facial details under dynamic motions, outperforming baselines in visual quality.

Conclusion: SuperHead effectively addresses the challenges of low-resolution 3D inputs, offering superior animation-ready avatars.

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity, animatable 3D talking heads is crucial for immersive applications, yet often hindered by the prevalence of low-quality image or video sources, which yield poor 3D reconstructions. In this paper, we introduce SuperHead, a novel framework for enhancing low-resolution, animatable 3D head avatars. The core challenge lies in synthesizing high-quality geometry and textures, while ensuring both 3D and temporal consistency during animation and preserving subject identity. Despite recent progress in image, video and 3D-based super-resolution (SR), existing SR techniques are ill-equipped to handle dynamic 3D inputs. To address this, SuperHead leverages the rich priors from pre-trained 3D generative models via a novel dynamics-aware 3D inversion scheme. This process optimizes the latent representation of the generative model to produce a super-resolved 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) head model, which is subsequently rigged to an underlying parametric head model (e.g., FLAME) for animation. The inversion is jointly supervised using a sparse collection of upscaled 2D face renderings and corresponding depth maps, captured from diverse facial expressions and camera viewpoints, to ensure realism under dynamic facial motions. Experiments demonstrate that SuperHead generates avatars with fine-grained facial details under dynamic motions, significantly outperforming baseline methods in visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EgoAVU, a data engine for generating egocentric audio-visual narrations, questions, and answers to enhance MLLMs' joint understanding of visual and audio modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and improve MLLMs' ability to jointly understand visual and audio modalities in egocentric videos, which is under-explored due to challenges in obtaining coherent joint-modality text labels.

Method: EgoAVU uses scalable data auto-generation, cross-modal correlation modeling, token-based filtering, and modular graph-based curation to create diverse and high-quality datasets (EgoAVU-Instruct and EgoAVU-Bench).

Result: Finetuning MLLMs on EgoAVU-Instruct improves performance by up to 113% on EgoAVU-Bench and shows transfer benefits (up to 28% gain) on other benchmarks like EgoTempo and EgoIllusion.

Conclusion: EgoAVU effectively addresses MLLMs' bias toward visual signals and enhances their joint audio-visual understanding, with potential broader applications.

Abstract: Understanding egocentric videos plays a vital role for embodied intelligence. Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can accept both visual and audio inputs. However, due to the challenge of obtaining text labels with coherent joint-modality information, whether MLLMs can jointly understand both modalities in egocentric videos remains under-explored. To address this problem, we introduce EgoAVU, a scalable data engine to automatically generate egocentric audio-visual narrations, questions, and answers. EgoAVU enriches human narrations with multimodal context and generates audio-visual narrations through cross-modal correlation modeling. Token-based video filtering and modular, graph-based curation ensure both data diversity and quality. Leveraging EgoAVU, we construct EgoAVU-Instruct, a large-scale training dataset of 3M samples, and EgoAVU-Bench, a manually verified evaluation split covering diverse tasks. EgoAVU-Bench clearly reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs: they bias heavily toward visual signals, often neglecting audio cues or failing to correspond audio with the visual source. Finetuning MLLMs on EgoAVU-Instruct effectively addresses this issue, enabling up to 113% performance improvement on EgoAVU-Bench. Such benefits also transfer to other benchmarks such as EgoTempo and EgoIllusion, achieving up to 28% relative performance gain. Code will be released to the community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGP-KAD is a multimodal feature fusion framework for single-view 3D reconstruction, integrating RGB and geometric prior to enhance accuracy, achieving SOTA performance on Pix3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges like noise, object diversity, and limited datasets in single-view 3D reconstruction of complex scenes.

Method: Uses geometric prior from sampled/clustered ground-truth data and a hybrid KAN-based decoder for multimodal input processing.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on Pix3D, improving geometric integrity, smoothness, and detail preservation.

Conclusion: MGP-KAD provides a robust solution for advancing 3D reconstruction in complex scenes.

Abstract: Single-view 3D reconstruction in complex real-world scenes is challenging due to noise, object diversity, and limited dataset availability. To address these challenges, we propose MGP-KAD, a novel multimodal feature fusion framework that integrates RGB and geometric prior to enhance reconstruction accuracy. The geometric prior is generated by sampling and clustering ground-truth object data, producing class-level features that dynamically adjust during training to improve geometric understanding. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid decoder based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to overcome the limitations of traditional linear decoders in processing complex multimodal inputs. Extensive experiments on the Pix3D dataset demonstrate that MGP-KAD achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, significantly improving geometric integrity, smoothness, and detail preservation. Our work provides a robust and effective solution for advancing single-view 3D reconstruction in complex scenes.

### [4] [Driving with DINO: Vision Foundation Features as a Unified Bridge for Sim-to-Real Generation in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06159)
*Xuyang Chen,Conglang Zhang,Chuanheng Fu,Zihao Yang,Kaixuan Zhou,Yizhi Zhang,Jianan He,Yanfeng Zhang,Mingwei Sun,Zengmao Wang,Zhen Dong,Xiaoxiao Long,Liqiu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Driving with DINO (DwD) introduces a framework using Vision Foundation Module features to bridge Sim2Real gaps in autonomous driving video generation, balancing realism and control consistency through feature processing and temporal aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Sim2Real methods for autonomous driving video generation struggle with the Consistency-Realism Dilemma, where low-level signals lack realism and high-level priors lack structural detail. DwD aims to address this gap.

Method: DwD leverages Vision Foundation Module (VFM) features, employing Principal Subspace Projection and Random Channel Tail Drop to reconcile realism and control. It includes a Spatial Alignment Module for precise control and a Causal Temporal Aggregator for temporal stability.

Result: The framework successfully balances realism with control consistency, mitigates motion blur, and ensures temporal stability in generated videos.

Conclusion: DwD provides a unified solution for Sim2Real autonomous driving video generation, overcoming the Consistency-Realism Dilemma and enhancing precision and stability.

Abstract: Driven by the emergence of Controllable Video Diffusion, existing Sim2Real methods for autonomous driving video generation typically rely on explicit intermediate representations to bridge the domain gap. However, these modalities face a fundamental Consistency-Realism Dilemma. Low-level signals (e.g., edges, blurred images) ensure precise control but compromise realism by "baking in" synthetic artifacts, whereas high-level priors (e.g., depth, semantics, HDMaps) facilitate photorealism but lack the structural detail required for consistent guidance. In this work, we present Driving with DINO (DwD), a novel framework that leverages Vision Foundation Module (VFM) features as a unified bridge between the simulation and real-world domains. We first identify that these features encode a spectrum of information, from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure. To effectively utilize this, we employ Principal Subspace Projection to discard the high-frequency elements responsible for "texture baking," while concurrently introducing Random Channel Tail Drop to mitigate the structural loss inherent in rigid dimensionality reduction, thereby reconciling realism with control consistency. Furthermore, to fully leverage DINOv3's high-resolution capabilities for enhancing control precision, we introduce a learnable Spatial Alignment Module that adapts these high-resolution features to the diffusion backbone. Finally, we propose a Causal Temporal Aggregator employing causal convolutions to explicitly preserve historical motion context when integrating frame-wise DINO features, which effectively mitigates motion blur and guarantees temporal stability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaSSP reduces Chamfer Distance by 20.61% and boosts IoU by 24.09% on Pix3D, outperforming semi-supervised baselines with labeled-unlabeled joint refinement and SDF-aware weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit SDF methods require large labeled datasets; MetaSSP leverages unlabeled images to enhance scalability and performance.

Method: Introduces gradient-based parameter importance estimation, adaptive EMA updates, and SDF-aware pseudo-label weighting with augmentation consistency. Starts with 10% supervised warm-up.

Result: Achieves a 20.61% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 24.09% increase in IoU on Pix3D compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MetaSSP sets a new state of the art for semi-supervised single-view 3D reconstruction, effectively leveraging unlabeled data.

Abstract: Implicit SDF-based methods for single-view 3D reconstruction achieve high-quality surfaces but require large labeled datasets, limiting their scalability. We propose MetaSSP, a novel semi-supervised framework that exploits abundant unlabeled images. Our approach introduces gradient-based parameter importance estimation to regularize adaptive EMA updates and an SDF-aware pseudo-label weighting mechanism combining augmentation consistency with SDF variance. Beginning with a 10% supervised warm-up, the unified pipeline jointly refines labeled and unlabeled data. On the Pix3D benchmark, our method reduces Chamfer Distance by approximately 20.61% and increases IoU by around 24.09% compared to existing semi-supervised baselines, setting a new state of the art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3 is a training-free framework that uses multi-agent reasoning to improve text-to-image synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like OneIG-EN and GenEval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models struggle with complex compositional prompts. M3 aims to address this gap by leveraging multi-agent collaboration for iterative refinement.

Method: M3 employs a Planner, Checker, Refiner, Editor, and Verifier in a multi-agent loop to decompose and correct prompts systematically.

Result: M3 surpasses commercial systems like Imagen4 and Seedream 3.0, achieving a score of 0.532 on OneIG-EN and doubling spatial reasoning performance on GenEval.

Conclusion: M3 demonstrates that multi-agent reasoning can elevate open-source models beyond proprietary alternatives without retraining.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive fidelity in text-to-image synthesis, yet struggle with complex compositional prompts involving multiple constraints. We introduce \textbf{M3 (Multi-Modal, Multi-Agent, Multi-Round)}, a training-free framework that systematically resolves these failures through iterative inference-time refinement. M3 orchestrates off-the-shelf foundation models in a robust multi-agent loop: a Planner decomposes prompts into verifiable checklists, while specialized Checker, Refiner, and Editor agents surgically correct constraints one at a time, with a Verifier ensuring monotonic improvement. Applied to open-source models, M3 achieves remarkable results on the challenging OneIG-EN benchmark, with our Qwen-Image+M3 surpassing commercial flagship systems including Imagen4 (0.515) and Seedream 3.0 (0.530), reaching state-of-the-art performance (0.532 overall). This demonstrates that intelligent multi-agent reasoning can elevate open-source models beyond proprietary alternatives. M3 also substantially improves GenEval compositional metrics, effectively doubling spatial reasoning performance on hardened test sets. As a plug-and-play module compatible with any pre-trained T2I model, M3 establishes a new paradigm for compositional generation without costly retraining.

*Anika Knupfer,Johanna P. Müller,Jordina A. Verdera,Martin Fenske,Claudius S. Mathy,Smiti Tripathy,Sebastian Arndt,Matthias May,Michael Uder,Matthias W. Beckmann,Stefanie Burghaus,Jana Hutter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An unsupervised AI framework for real-time anomaly detection in pelvic MRI using healthy scans, achieving moderate performance and demonstrating potential for clinical integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the global health burden of pelvic diseases by overcoming limitations of current AI methods, such as disease-specificity and lack of real-time compatibility.

Method: Uses a residual variational autoencoder trained on healthy sagittal T2-weighted MRI scans and augmented with synthetic data for robustness.

Result: Achieves AUC of 0.736, sensitivity of 0.828, and specificity of 0.692 in detecting anomalies.

Conclusion: The framework sets a baseline for unsupervised anomaly detection in pelvic MRI and supports future real-time clinical applications.

Abstract: Pelvic diseases in women of reproductive age represent a major global health burden, with diagnosis frequently delayed due to high anatomical variability, complicating MRI interpretation. Existing AI approaches are largely disease-specific and lack real-time compatibility, limiting generalizability and clinical integration. To address these challenges, we establish a benchmark framework for disease- and parameter-agnostic, real-time-compatible unsupervised anomaly detection in pelvic MRI. The method uses a residual variational autoencoder trained exclusively on healthy sagittal T2-weighted scans acquired across diverse imaging protocols to model normal pelvic anatomy. During inference, reconstruction error heatmaps indicate deviations from learned healthy structure, enabling detection of pathological regions without labeled abnormal data. The model is trained on 294 healthy scans and augmented with diffusion-generated synthetic data to improve robustness. Quantitative evaluation on the publicly available Uterine Myoma MRI Dataset yields an average area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of 0.736, with 0.828 sensitivity and 0.692 specificity. Additional inter-observer clinical evaluation extends analysis to endometrial cancer, endometriosis, and adenomyosis, revealing the influence of anatomical heterogeneity and inter-observer variability on performance interpretation. With a reconstruction time of approximately 92.6 frames per second, the proposed framework establishes a baseline for unsupervised anomaly detection in the female pelvis and supports future integration into real-time MRI. Code is available upon request (https://github.com/AniKnu/UADPelvis), prospective data sets are available for academic collaboration.

### [8] [PhenoLIP: Integrating Phenotype Ontology Knowledge into Medical Vision-Language Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06184)
*Cheng Liang,Chaoyi Wu,Weike Zhao,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhenoLIP, a novel pretraining framework incorporating structured phenotype knowledge from PhenoKG, improves medical VLM performance in phenotype classification and cross-modal retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical VLMs lack systematic visual knowledge from medical phenotype ontologies, prompting the creation of PhenoKG and PhenoLIP to bridge this gap.

Method: PhenoLIP uses a two-stage process: learning phenotype embeddings from textual ontology data and distilling this knowledge via teacher-guided distillation during multimodal pretraining.

Result: PhenoLIP outperforms baselines, improving phenotype classification accuracy by 8.85% and cross-modal retrieval by 15.03%.

Conclusion: Integrating phenotype-centric priors enhances structured and interpretable medical image understanding.

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale CLIP-like vision-language models(VLMs) has greatly advanced medical image analysis. However, most existing medical VLMs still rely on coarse image-text contrastive objectives and fail to capture the systematic visual knowledge encoded in well-defined medical phenotype ontologies. To address this gap, we construct PhenoKG, the first large-scale, phenotype-centric multimodal knowledge graph that encompasses over 520K high-quality image-text pairs linked to more than 3,000 phenotypes. Building upon PhenoKG, we propose PhenoLIP, a novel pretraining framework that explicitly incorporates structured phenotype knowledge into medical VLMs through a two-stage process. We first learn a knowledge-enhanced phenotype embedding space from textual ontology data and then distill this structured knowledge into multimodal pretraining via a teacher-guided knowledge distillation objective. To support evaluation, we further introduce PhenoBench, an expert-verified benchmark designed for phenotype recognition, comprising over 7,800 image--caption pairs covering more than 1,000 phenotypes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhenoLIP outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines, improving upon BiomedCLIP in phenotype classification accuracy by 8.85\% and BIOMEDICA in cross-modal retrieval by 15.03%, underscoring the value of integrating phenotype-centric priors into medical VLMs for structured and interpretable medical image understanding.

*Khiem Pham,Quang Nguyen,Tung Nguyen,Jingsen Zhu,Michele Santacatterina,Dimitris Metaxas,Ramin Zabih*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeDPO enhances DPO by integrating debiased estimation to efficiently utilize synthetic AI feedback, reducing reliance on costly human-labeled data while maintaining or surpassing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and scalability issues of large-scale human preference labels in DPO necessitate a more efficient method leveraging synthetic feedback.

Method: DeDPO combines DPO with causal inference techniques to debias and correct noise in synthetic AI feedback, including self-training and VLMs.

Result: DeDPO performs robustly across synthetic labeling methods, matching or exceeding models trained on fully human-labeled data.

Conclusion: DeDPO offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for human-AI alignment using synthetic supervision.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a predominant alignment method for diffusion models, facilitating off-policy training without explicit reward modeling. However, its reliance on large-scale, high-quality human preference labels presents a severe cost and scalability bottleneck. To overcome this, We propose a semi-supervised framework augmenting limited human data with a large corpus of unlabeled pairs annotated via cost-effective synthetic AI feedback. Our paper introduces Debiased DPO (DeDPO), which uniquely integrates a debiased estimation technique from causal inference into the DPO objective. By explicitly identifying and correcting the systematic bias and noise inherent in synthetic annotators, DeDPO ensures robust learning from imperfect feedback sources, including self-training and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Experiments demonstrate that DeDPO is robust to the variations in synthetic labeling methods, achieving performance that matches and occasionally exceeds the theoretical upper bound of models trained on fully human-labeled data. This establishes DeDPO as a scalable solution for human-AI alignment using inexpensive synthetic supervision.

### [10] [DroneKey++: A Size Prior-free Method and New Benchmark for Drone 3D Pose Estimation from Sequential Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06211)
*Seo-Bin Hwang,Yeong-Jun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DroneKey++ is a prior-free framework for 3D pose estimation of drones, combining keypoint detection, classification, and pose estimation. It uses a synthetic dataset (6DroneSyn) to overcome limitations of current datasets, achieving strong generalization and real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing drone pose estimation methods rely on prior information like physical sizes or 3D meshes. Current datasets are small-scale and limited, hindering reliable validation of generalization.

Method: The framework includes a keypoint encoder for detecting and classifying keypoints and a pose decoder using ray-based geometric reasoning and class embeddings. A synthetic dataset (6DroneSyn) with 50K+ images was created for training and validation.

Result: DroneKey++ achieves MAE 17.34 deg (rotation), MAE 0.135 m (translation), with inference speeds of 19.25 FPS (CPU) and 414.07 FPS (GPU), showing strong generalization and real-time suitability.

Conclusion: DroneKey++ provides a robust, prior-free solution for drone pose estimation, validated by a large synthetic dataset, and is efficient for real-time applications.

Abstract: Accurate 3D pose estimation of drones is essential for security and surveillance systems. However, existing methods often rely on prior drone information such as physical sizes or 3D meshes. At the same time, current datasets are small-scale, limited to single models, and collected under constrained environments, which makes reliable validation of generalization difficult. We present DroneKey++, a prior-free framework that jointly performs keypoint detection, drone classification, and 3D pose estimation. The framework employs a keypoint encoder for simultaneous keypoint detection and classification, and a pose decoder that estimates 3D pose using ray-based geometric reasoning and class embeddings. To address dataset limitations, we construct 6DroneSyn, a large-scale synthetic benchmark with over 50K images covering 7 drone models and 88 outdoor backgrounds, generated using 360-degree panoramic synthesis. Experiments show that DroneKey++ achieves MAE 17.34 deg and MedAE 17.1 deg for rotation, MAE 0.135 m and MedAE 0.242 m for translation, with inference speeds of 19.25 FPS (CPU) and 414.07 FPS (GPU), demonstrating both strong generalization across drone models and suitability for real-time applications. The dataset is publicly available.

### [11] [Addressing the Waypoint-Action Gap in End-to-End Autonomous Driving via Vehicle Motion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06214)
*Jorge Daniel Rodríguez-Vidal,Gabriel Villalonga,Diego Porres,Antonio M. López Peña*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differentiable vehicle-model framework to bridge the gap between waypoint-based and action-based E2E-AD systems, enabling action-based models to train and evaluate within waypoint benchmarks without protocol changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmark protocols favor waypoint-based models, making action-based policies harder to train and compare. This paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The proposed framework rolls out predicted action sequences to corresponding waypoint trajectories and supervises in waypoint space.

Result: The framework consistently improves baselines across benchmarks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on NAVSIM's 	exttt{navhard}.

Conclusion: The differentiable vehicle-model framework successfully bridges the waypoint-action gap, facilitating action-based model training and evaluation in existing benchmarks.

Abstract: End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E-AD) systems are typically grouped by the nature of their outputs: (i) waypoint-based models that predict a future trajectory, and (ii) action-based models that directly output throttle, steer and brake. Most recent benchmark protocols and training pipelines are waypoint-based, which makes action-based policies harder to train and compare, slowing their progress. To bridge this waypoint-action gap, we propose a novel, differentiable vehicle-model framework that rolls out predicted action sequences to their corresponding ego-frame waypoint trajectories while supervising in waypoint space. Our approach enables action-based architectures to be trained and evaluated, for the first time, within waypoint-based benchmarks without modifying the underlying evaluation protocol. We extensively evaluate our framework across multiple challenging benchmarks and observe consistent improvements over the baselines. In particular, on NAVSIM \texttt{navhard} our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

### [12] [Cross-Modal Redundancy and the Geometry of Vision-Language Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06218)
*Grégoire Dhimoïla,Thomas Fel,Victor Boutin,Agustin Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the geometry of shared embedding spaces in vision-language models (VLMs) using the Iso-Energy Assumption and an Aligned Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). It reveals practical insights like sparse bimodal atoms driving alignment and unimodal atoms explaining modality gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the geometry of shared embedding spaces in VLMs, which remains poorly understood despite their success in aligning images and text.

Method: The authors use the Iso-Energy Assumption and an Aligned Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to encourage energy consistency during training while preserving reconstruction.

Result: Findings include: sparse bimodal atoms drive cross-modal alignment, unimodal atoms explain modality gaps, and removing unimodal atoms collapses gaps without performance loss.

Conclusion: The right inductive bias can preserve model fidelity while making latent geometry interpretable and actionable.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) align images and text with remarkable success, yet the geometry of their shared embedding space remains poorly understood. To probe this geometry, we begin from the Iso-Energy Assumption, which exploits cross-modal redundancy: a concept that is truly shared should exhibit the same average energy across modalities. We operationalize this assumption with an Aligned Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) that encourages energy consistency during training while preserving reconstruction. We find that this inductive bias changes the SAE solution without harming reconstruction, giving us a representation that serves as a tool for geometric analysis. Sanity checks on controlled data with known ground truth confirm that alignment improves when Iso-Energy holds and remains neutral when it does not. Applied to foundational VLMs, our framework reveals a clear structure with practical consequences: (i) sparse bimodal atoms carry the entire cross-modal alignment signal; (ii) unimodal atoms act as modality-specific biases and fully explain the modality gap; (iii) removing unimodal atoms collapses the gap without harming performance; (iv) restricting vector arithmetic to the bimodal subspace yields in-distribution edits and improved retrieval. These findings suggest that the right inductive bias can both preserve model fidelity and render the latent geometry interpretable and actionable.

*Yuantao Chen,Jiahao Chang,Chongjie Ye,Chaoran Zhang,Zhaojie Fang,Chenghong Li,Xiaoguang Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ForeHOI is a novel feed-forward model for 3D object reconstruction from monocular hand-object interaction videos, addressing occlusion challenges with joint 2D mask inpainting and 3D shape completion, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a 100x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing 3D objects from occluded monocular hand-object interaction videos, leveraging the ubiquity of such videos for embodied intelligence.

Method: Introduces ForeHOI, a feed-forward model that jointly predicts 2D mask inpainting and 3D shape completion to handle severe occlusions, trained on a new synthetic dataset of hand-object interactions.

Result: ForeHOI outperforms previous methods in object reconstruction quality and achieves a 100x speedup, with extensive experiments demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: ForeHOI sets a new benchmark for fast and accurate 3D object reconstruction from monocular hand-object interaction videos, supported by a novel dataset.

Abstract: The ubiquity of monocular videos capturing daily hand-object interactions presents a valuable resource for embodied intelligence. While 3D hand reconstruction from in-the-wild videos has seen significant progress, reconstructing the involved objects remains challenging due to severe occlusions and the complex, coupled motion of the camera, hands, and object. In this paper, we introduce ForeHOI, a novel feed-forward model that directly reconstructs 3D object geometry from monocular hand-object interaction videos within one minute of inference time, eliminating the need for any pre-processing steps. Our key insight is that, the joint prediction of 2D mask inpainting and 3D shape completion in a feed-forward framework can effectively address the problem of severe occlusion in monocular hand-held object videos, thereby achieving results that outperform the performance of optimization-based methods. The information exchanges between the 2D and 3D shape completion boosts the overall reconstruction quality, enabling the framework to effectively handle severe hand-object occlusion. Furthermore, to support the training of our model, we contribute the first large-scale, high-fidelity synthetic dataset of hand-object interactions with comprehensive annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForeHOI achieves state-of-the-art performance in object reconstruction, significantly outperforming previous methods with around a 100x speedup.

### [14] [An Interpretable Vision Transformer as a Fingerprint-Based Diagnostic Aid for Kabuki and Wiedemann-Steiner Syndromes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06282)
*Marilyn Lionts,Arnhildur Tomasdottir,Viktor I. Agustsson,Yuankai Huo,Hans T. Bjornsson,Lotta M. Ellingsen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning model using fingerprint images distinguishes Kabuki syndrome (KS) and Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS) from controls and each other, achieving high AUC and F1 scores, suggesting fingerprint-based AI could aid early diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Undiagnosed cases of KS and WSS due to limited access to genetic testing and expertise highlight the need for noninvasive, accessible diagnostic tools.

Method: A vision transformer-based deep learning model analyzes fingerprint images for classification tasks (control vs. KS, control vs. WSS, KS vs. WSS).

Result: The model achieved AUC scores of 0.80, 0.73, and 0.85 and F1 scores of 0.71, 0.72, and 0.83 for the respective classification tasks.

Conclusion: Fingerprint-based AI can serve as a noninvasive, interpretable, and accessible diagnostic tool for KS and WSS, leveraging syndrome-specific fingerprint features.

Abstract: Kabuki syndrome (KS) and Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS) are rare but distinct developmental disorders that share overlapping clinical features, including neurodevelopmental delay, growth restriction, and persistent fetal fingertip pads. While genetic testing remains the diagnostic gold standard, many individuals with KS or WSS remain undiagnosed due to barriers in access to both genetic testing and expertise. Dermatoglyphic anomalies, despite being established hallmarks of several genetic syndromes, remain an underutilized diagnostic signal in the era of molecular testing. This study presents a vision transformer-based deep learning model that leverages fingerprint images to distinguish individuals with KS and WSS from unaffected controls and from one another. We evaluate model performance across three binary classification tasks. Across the three classification tasks, the model achieved AUC scores of 0.80 (control vs. KS), 0.73 (control vs. WSS), and 0.85 (KS vs. WSS), with corresponding F1 scores of 0.71, 0.72, and 0.83, respectively. Beyond classification, we apply attention-based visualizations to identify fingerprint regions most salient to model predictions, enhancing interpretability. Together, these findings suggest the presence of syndrome-specific fingerprint features, demonstrating the feasibility of a fingerprint-based artificial intelligence (AI) tool as a noninvasive, interpretable, and accessible future diagnostic aid for the early diagnosis of underdiagnosed genetic syndromes.

*Lucia Gordon,Serge Belongie,Christian Igel,Nico Lang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMEarth-Bench, a multimodal geospatial benchmark dataset, and proposes TTT-MMR, a test-time training method to improve model performance and geographic generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geospatial datasets lack global representation and multimodality, limiting evaluation of pretrained models.

Method: Introduces MMEarth-Bench with 5 tasks and 12 modalities, and proposes TTT-MMR for test-time training using all available modalities.

Result: Pretraining improves robustness but geographic generalization remains poor; TTT-MMR enhances performance on both random and geographic test splits.

Conclusion: MMEarth-Bench and TTT-MMR address gaps in geospatial data evaluation, improving model adaptation and performance.

Abstract: Recent research in geospatial machine learning has demonstrated that models pretrained with self-supervised learning on Earth observation data can perform well on downstream tasks with limited training data. However, most of the existing geospatial benchmark datasets have few data modalities and poor global representation, limiting the ability to evaluate multimodal pretrained models at global scales. To fill this gap, we introduce MMEarth-Bench, a collection of five new multimodal environmental tasks with 12 modalities, globally distributed data, and both in- and out-of-distribution test splits. We benchmark a diverse set of pretrained models and find that while (multimodal) pretraining tends to improve model robustness in limited data settings, geographic generalization abilities remain poor. In order to facilitate model adaptation to new downstream tasks and geographic domains, we propose a model-agnostic method for test-time training with multimodal reconstruction (TTT-MMR) that uses all the modalities available at test time as auxiliary tasks, regardless of whether a pretrained model accepts them as input. Our method improves model performance on both the random and geographic test splits, and geographic batching leads to a good trade-off between regularization and specialization during TTT.

*Jiazheng Wang,Zeyu Liu,Min Liu,Xiang Chen,Hang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An unsupervised multimodal medical image registration method (MCPO) addresses challenges in surgical navigation by optimizing feature extraction and fusion, achieving top results in the Learn2Reg 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in multimodal image registration caused by differences between images and intraoperative deformation, providing accurate surgical guidance.

Method: Uses modality-independent neighborhood descriptors for feature extraction and a multilevel pyramidal fusion optimization mechanism for global and local displacement field optimization.

Result: Achieved first place in Learn2Reg 2025's ReMIND2Reg task and an average TRE of 1.798 mm on the Resect dataset.

Conclusion: MCPO is a broadly applicable and effective method for preoperative-to-intraoperative image registration.

Abstract: Surgical navigation based on multimodal image registration has played a significant role in providing intraoperative guidance to surgeons by showing the relative position of the target area to critical anatomical structures during surgery. However, due to the differences between multimodal images and intraoperative image deformation caused by tissue displacement and removal during the surgery, effective registration of preoperative and intraoperative multimodal images faces significant challenges. To address the multimodal image registration challenges in Learn2Reg 2025, an unsupervised multimodal medical image registration method based on multilevel correlation pyramidal optimization (MCPO) is designed to solve these problems. First, the features of each modality are extracted based on the modality independent neighborhood descriptor, and the multimodal images is mapped to the feature space. Second, a multilevel pyramidal fusion optimization mechanism is designed to achieve global optimization and local detail complementation of the displacement field through dense correlation analysis and weight-balanced coupled convex optimization for input features at different scales. Our method focuses on the ReMIND2Reg task in Learn2Reg 2025. Based on the results, our method achieved the first place in the validation phase and test phase of ReMIND2Reg. The MCPO is also validated on the Resect dataset, achieving an average TRE of 1.798 mm. This demonstrates the broad applicability of our method in preoperative-to-intraoperative image registration. The code is avaliable at https://github.com/wjiazheng/MCPO.

*Jinchi Tang,Yan Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Restructured Vision Transformers (ViTs) to leverage CNN-optimized hardware (BPUs) by replacing linear layers with convolutional operators, achieving near-original accuracy and significant speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The architectural mismatch between CNN-optimized hardware (BPUs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) limits the deployment of ViTs on dedicated platforms. This work aims to enable ViTs to fully utilize BPU acceleration without retraining.

Method: Proposed restructuring ViTs by replacing linear layers and layer normalization with convolutional operators, allowing the model to inherit original weights and avoid retraining.

Result: The quantized DeiT-Base model achieved 80.4% accuracy on ImageNet (vs. 81.8% original) and a 3.8x speedup. Fine-tuned models on flower classification also showed minimal accuracy drops.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap between ViTs and CNN-optimized hardware, enabling efficient deployment with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning technologies, specialized neural processing hardware such as Brain Processing Units (BPUs) have emerged as dedicated platforms for CNN acceleration, offering optimized INT8 computation capabilities for convolutional operations. Meanwhile, Vision Transformer (ViT) models, such as the Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), have demonstrated superior performance and play increasingly crucial roles in computer vision tasks. However, due to the architectural mismatch between CNN-optimized hardware and Vision Transformer computation characteristics--namely, that linear layers in Transformers operate on three-dimensional data while BPU acceleration is designed for four-dimensional convolution operations-it is difficult or even impossible to leverage BPU's advantages when deploying Vision Transformers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that restructures the Vision Transformer by replacing linear layers and layer normalization operations with carefully designed convolutional operators. This enables DeiT to fully utilize the acceleration capabilities of BPUs, while allowing the original weight parameters to be inherited by the restructured models without retraining or fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful deployment of Vision Transformers that fully leverages BPU classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, the quantized DeiT-Base model achieves 80.4% accuracy on ImageNet, compared to the original 81.8%, while obtaining up to a 3.8* inference speedup. Our finetuned DeiT model on the flower classification dataset also achieves excellent performance, with only a 0.5% accuracy drop for the DeiT-Base model, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Adaptive-and-Balanced Re-initialization (ABR) for Continual Test-Time Domain Adaptation (CTTA) to improve long-term performance by observing label flip patterns and adaptively resetting model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of models adapting continually to non-stationary environments over long periods.

Method: Introduces ABR, a policy that resets model weights adaptively based on observed changes in label flip patterns.

Result: Validated on CTTA benchmarks, achieving superior performance.

Conclusion: ABR effectively preserves model performance in long-term CTTA scenarios.

Abstract: Continual test-time domain adaptation (CTTA) aims to adjust models so that they can perform well over time across non-stationary environments. While previous methods have made considerable efforts to optimize the adaptation process, a crucial question remains: Can the model adapt to continually changing environments over a long time? In this work, we explore facilitating better CTTA in the long run using a re-initialization (or reset) based method. First, we observe that the long-term performance is associated with the trajectory pattern in label flip. Based on this observed correlation, we propose a simple yet effective policy, Adaptive-and-Balanced Re-initialization (ABR), towards preserving the model's long-term performance. In particular, ABR performs weight re-initialization using adaptive intervals. The adaptive interval is determined based on the change in label flip. The proposed method is validated on extensive CTTA benchmarks, achieving superior performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CER framework improves OOD detection by hierarchical filtering, reducing computation by 32% and enhancing performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods waste resources and misinterpret anomalies. CER aims to address these inefficiencies.

Method: CER uses SES for non-parametric anomaly interception and SHE for semantic deviation detection.

Result: CER reduces computational overhead by 32%, lowers FPR95 to 22.84%, and raises AUROC to 93.97%.

Conclusion: CER outperforms SOTA methods, especially in real-world scenarios, and integrates seamlessly into existing models.

Abstract: Efficient and robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is paramount for safety-critical applications.However, existing methods still execute full-scale inference on low-level statistical noise. This computational mismatch not only incurs resource waste but also induces semantic hallucination, where deep networks forcefully interpret physical anomalies as high-confidence semantic features.To address this, we propose the Cascaded Early Rejection (CER) framework, which realizes hierarchical filtering for anomaly detection via a coarse-to-fine logic.CER comprises two core modules: 1)Structural Energy Sieve (SES), which establishes a non-parametric barrier at the network entry using the Laplacian operator to efficiently intercept physical signal anomalies; and 2) the Semantically-aware Hyperspherical Energy (SHE) detector, which decouples feature magnitude from direction in intermediate layers to identify fine-grained semantic deviations. Experimental results demonstrate that CER not only reduces computational overhead by 32% but also achieves a significant performance leap on the CIFAR-100 benchmark:the average FPR95 drastically decreases from 33.58% to 22.84%, and AUROC improves to 93.97%. Crucially, in real-world scenarios simulating sensor failures, CER exhibits performance far exceeding state-of-the-art methods. As a universal plugin, CER can be seamlessly integrated into various SOTA models to provide performance gains.

*Gensheng Pei,Xiruo Jiang,Yazhou Yao,Xiangbo Shu,Fumin Shen,Byeungwoo Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConceptBank is a calibration framework that addresses data and concept drift in Open-Vocabulary Segmentation by dynamically adapting prompts via target-domain statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance on pre-defined concepts in SAM3 makes it vulnerable to distribution shifts (data drift) or evolving label distributions (concept drift), breaking the alignment between visual evidence and prompts.

Method: ConceptBank constructs a dataset-specific concept bank using target statistics, anchoring visual prototypes, mining supports to handle data drift, and fusing concepts to rectify concept drift.

Result: ConceptBank effectively adapts SAM3 to distribution drifts, improving robustness and efficiency in challenging scenarios like natural-scene and remote-sensing.

Conclusion: ConceptBank sets a new baseline for robust and efficient Open-Vocabulary Segmentation by dynamically restoring alignment between visual evidence and prompts.

Abstract: The recent introduction of \texttt{SAM3} has revolutionized Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) through \textit{promptable concept segmentation}, which grounds pixel predictions in flexible concept prompts. However, this reliance on pre-defined concepts makes the model vulnerable: when visual distributions shift (\textit{data drift}) or conditional label distributions evolve (\textit{concept drift}) in the target domain, the alignment between visual evidence and prompts breaks down. In this work, we present \textsc{ConceptBank}, a parameter-free calibration framework to restore this alignment on the fly. Instead of adhering to static prompts, we construct a dataset-specific concept bank from the target statistics. Our approach (\textit{i}) anchors target-domain evidence via class-wise visual prototypes, (\textit{ii}) mines representative supports to suppress outliers under data drift, and (\textit{iii}) fuses candidate concepts to rectify concept drift. We demonstrate that \textsc{ConceptBank} effectively adapts \texttt{SAM3} to distribution drifts, including challenging natural-scene and remote-sensing scenarios, establishing a new baseline for robustness and efficiency in OVS.

*Yihan Shang,Wei Wang,Chao Huang,Xinghui Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPDA-SAM, enhancing SAM for instance segmentation by self-prompting and depth-aware fusion to overcome limitations like prompt dependency and lack of depth info.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses SAM's reliance on manual prompts and RGB images' lack of depth info, hindering spatial perception and object boundary delineation.

Method: Proposes SSSPM for self-prompting and C2FFM for RGB-D fusion, combining coarse-grained depth guidance with fine-grained feature encoding.

Result: SPDA-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on twelve datasets, leveraging self-prompts and RGB-D fusion.

Conclusion: SPDA-SAM effectively improves SAM's performance by integrating self-prompting and depth-aware feature fusion.

Abstract: Recently, Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated strong generalizability in various instance segmentation tasks. However, its performance is severely dependent on the quality of manual prompts. In addition, the RGB images that instance segmentation methods normally use inherently lack depth information. As a result, the ability of these methods to perceive spatial structures and delineate object boundaries is hindered. To address these challenges, we propose a Self-prompted Depth-Aware SAM (SPDA-SAM) for instance segmentation. Specifically, we design a Semantic-Spatial Self-prompt Module (SSSPM) which extracts the semantic and spatial prompts from the image encoder and the mask decoder of SAM, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine RGB-D Fusion Module (C2FFM), in which the features extracted from a monocular RGB image and the depth map estimated from it are fused. In particular, the structural information in the depth map is used to provide coarse-grained guidance to feature fusion, while local variations in depth are encoded in order to fuse fine-grained feature representations. To our knowledge, SAM has not been explored in such self-prompted and depth-aware manners. Experimental results demonstrate that our SPDA-SAM outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts across twelve different data sets. These promising results should be due to the guidance of the self-prompts and the compensation for the spatial information loss by the coarse-to-fine RGB-D fusion operation.

*Weiquan Wang,Feifei Shao,Lin Li,Zhen Wang,Jun Xiao,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-4DGS improves the rendering of dynamic humans from monocular videos under occlusions by using a Probabilistic Deformation Network and a Double Rasterization pipeline, along with confidence-aware regularizations to reduce artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for rendering dynamic humans from monocular videos under occlusions either cause temporal flickering or fail to capture diverse appearances due to rigid heuristics.

Method: The paper reformulates the task as a Maximum A Posteriori estimation problem and introduces U-4DGS, combining a Probabilistic Deformation Network and a Double Rasterization pipeline to render pixel-aligned uncertainty maps and enforce Confidence-Aware Regularizations.

Result: U-4DGS achieves state-of-the-art rendering fidelity and robustness, as demonstrated by experiments on ZJU-MoCap and OcMotion datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed U-4DGS framework effectively addresses occlusion challenges in high-fidelity rendering of dynamic humans by leveraging uncertainty-aware techniques.

Abstract: High-fidelity rendering of dynamic humans from monocular videos typically degrades catastrophically under occlusions. Existing solutions incorporate external priors-either hallucinating missing content via generative models, which induces severe temporal flickering, or imposing rigid geometric heuristics that fail to capture diverse appearances. To this end, we reformulate the task as a Maximum A Posteriori estimation problem under heteroscedastic observation noise. In this paper, we propose U-4DGS, a framework integrating a Probabilistic Deformation Network and a Double Rasterization pipeline. This architecture renders pixel-aligned uncertainty maps that act as an adaptive gradient modulator, automatically attenuating artifacts from unreliable observations. Furthermore, to prevent geometric drift in regions lacking reliable visual cues, we enforce Confidence-Aware Regularizations, which leverage the learned uncertainty to selectively propagate spatial-temporal validity. Extensive experiments on ZJU-MoCap and OcMotion demonstrate that U-4DGS achieves SOTA rendering fidelity and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlowConsist, a training framework for fast flow models that addresses trajectory drift and error accumulation issues, achieving state-of-the-art performance in one-step generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fast-flow models suffer from trajectory drift due to randomly paired noise-data samples and error accumulation over time steps, limiting their consistency and accuracy.

Method: The proposed FlowConsist framework replaces conditional velocities with marginal velocities and introduces a trajectory rectification strategy to align distributions at every time step.

Result: The method achieves an FID of 1.52 on ImageNet 256×256 with just 1 sampling step, setting a new benchmark.

Conclusion: FlowConsist effectively mitigates trajectory drift and error accumulation, enabling highly efficient and accurate one-step generation in fast flow models.

Abstract: Fast flow models accelerate the iterative sampling process by learning to directly predict ODE path integrals, enabling one-step or few-step generation. However, we argue that current fast-flow training paradigms suffer from two fundamental issues. First, conditional velocities constructed from randomly paired noise-data samples introduce systematic trajectory drift, preventing models from following a consistent ODE path. Second, the model's approximation errors accumulate over time steps, leading to severe deviations across long time intervals. To address these issues, we propose FlowConsist, a training framework designed to enforce trajectory consistency in fast flows. We propose a principled alternative that replaces conditional velocities with the marginal velocities predicted by the model itself, aligning optimization with the true trajectory. To further address error accumulation over time steps, we introduce a trajectory rectification strategy that aligns the marginal distributions of generated and real samples at every time step along the trajectory. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on ImageNet 256$\times$256, achieving an FID of 1.52 with only 1 sampling step.

*Qian Bie,Xiao Wang,Bin Yang,Zhixi Yu,Jun Chen,Xin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new Triplet RGB-NIR-TIR dataset and proposes AUNet with UMVR and MAI modules to improve cross-modal pedestrian detection by handling uncertain input combinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CMPD methods struggle with unpredictable modal combinations in real-world scenarios, leading to performance drops due to inability to robustly extract pedestrian information.

Method: The AUNet framework includes UMVR for validating modal availability and refining semantics, and MAI for adaptive interaction among available modalities.

Result: The proposed method effectively addresses challenges posed by uncertain input combinations, improving detection performance.

Conclusion: AUNet advances cross-modal pedestrian detection by adaptively utilizing available modalities, validated by the new TRNT dataset.

Abstract: Existing cross-modal pedestrian detection (CMPD) employs complementary information from RGB and thermal-infrared (TIR) modalities to detect pedestrians in 24h-surveillance systems.RGB captures rich pedestrian details under daylight, while TIR excels at night. However, TIR focuses primarily on the person's silhouette, neglecting critical texture details essential for detection. While the near-infrared (NIR) captures texture under low-light conditions, which effectively alleviates performance issues of RGB and detail loss in TIR, thereby reducing missed detections. To this end, we construct a new Triplet RGB-NIR-TIR (TRNT) dataset, comprising 8,281 pixel-aligned image triplets, establishing a comprehensive foundation for algorithmic research. However, due to the variable nature of real-world scenarios, imaging devices may not always capture all three modalities simultaneously. This results in input data with unpredictable combinations of modal types, which challenge existing CMPD methods that fail to extract robust pedestrian information under arbitrary input combinations, leading to significant performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Network (AUNet) for accurately discriminating modal availability and fully utilizing the available information under uncertain inputs. Specifically, we introduce Unified Modality Validation Refinement (UMVR), which includes an uncertainty-aware router to validate modal availability and a semantic refinement to ensure the reliability of information within the modality. Furthermore, we design a Modality-Aware Interaction (MAI) module to adaptively activate or deactivate its internal interaction mechanisms per UMVR output, enabling effective complementary information fusion from available modalities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Observer-Centric Salient Object Detection (OC-SOD), addressing the subjective nature of saliency by incorporating observer-specific factors, and presents OC-SODBench dataset and OC-SODAgent baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing salient object detection methods treat the problem as objective, ignoring human perception diversity. This paper aims to capture subjective saliency by considering observer-specific cues.

Method: Proposes OC-SOD, leveraging multi-modal large language models for annotation, builds OC-SODBench dataset, and designs OC-SODAgent for human-like saliency prediction.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of OC-SOD, demonstrating improved alignment with human perception.

Conclusion: The observer-centric approach bridges human perception and computational modeling, offering a realistic understanding of saliency.

Abstract: Salient object detection is inherently a subjective problem, as observers with different priors may perceive different objects as salient. However, existing methods predominantly formulate it as an objective prediction task with a single groundtruth segmentation map for each image, which renders the problem under-determined and fundamentally ill-posed. To address this issue, we propose Observer-Centric Salient Object Detection (OC-SOD), where salient regions are predicted by considering not only the visual cues but also the observer-specific factors such as their preferences or intents. As a result, this formulation captures the intrinsic ambiguity and diversity of human perception, enabling personalized and context-aware saliency prediction. By leveraging multi-modal large language models, we develop an efficient data annotation pipeline and construct the first OC-SOD dataset named OC-SODBench, comprising 33k training, validation and test images with 152k textual prompts and object pairs. Built upon this new dataset, we further design OC-SODAgent, an agentic baseline which performs OC-SOD via a human-like "Perceive-Reflect-Adjust" process. Extensive experiments on our proposed OC-SODBench have justified the effectiveness of our contribution. Through this observer-centric perspective, we aim to bridge the gap between human perception and computational modeling, offering a more realistic and flexible understanding of what makes an object truly "salient."

Motivation: To automate complex digital tasks by developing a GUI agent with superior grounding capabilities, starting from a base model lacking strong spatial awareness.

Method: The approach involves refined data engineering (unifying datasets, augmentation, filtering), improved training strategies (fine-tuning vision encoder, resolution consistency), and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Result: POINTS-GUI-G-8B achieves top scores on benchmarks: 59.9 (ScreenSpot-Pro), 66.0 (OSWorld-G), 95.7 (ScreenSpot-v2), and 49.9 (UI-Vision).

Conclusion: The model's success highlights the effectiveness of combining data engineering, training enhancements, and reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, with RL proving particularly beneficial for precision.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of vision-language models has catalyzed the emergence of GUI agents, which hold immense potential for automating complex tasks, from online shopping to flight booking, thereby alleviating the burden of repetitive digital workflows. As a foundational capability, GUI grounding is typically established as a prerequisite for end-to-end task execution. It enables models to precisely locate interface elements, such as text and icons, to perform accurate operations like clicking and typing. Unlike prior works that fine-tune models already possessing strong spatial awareness (e.g., Qwen3-VL), we aim to master the full technical pipeline by starting from a base model with minimal grounding ability, such as POINTS-1.5. We introduce POINTS-GUI-G-8B, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with scores of 59.9 on ScreenSpot-Pro, 66.0 on OSWorld-G, 95.7 on ScreenSpot-v2, and 49.9 on UI-Vision. Our model's success is driven by three key factors: (1) Refined Data Engineering, involving the unification of diverse open-source datasets format alongside sophisticated strategies for augmentation, filtering, and difficulty grading; (2) Improved Training Strategies, including continuous fine-tuning of the vision encoder to enhance perceptual accuracy and maintaining resolution consistency between training and inference; and (3) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Verifiable Rewards. While RL is traditionally used to bolster reasoning, we demonstrate that it significantly improves precision in the perception-intensive GUI grounding task. Furthermore, GUI grounding provides a natural advantage for RL, as rewards are easily verifiable and highly accurate.

Motivation: Existing methods rely on inefficient representations (3D voxel volumes or Gaussians), limiting their ability to capture fine-grained details in 3D environments.

Method: TFusionOcc uses multi-stage multi-sensor fusion, Student's t-distribution, T-Mixture model, and deformable superquadrics for improved geometric flexibility.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance on nuScenes benchmark and demonstrated robustness in corrupted sensor scenarios (nuScenes-C dataset).

Conclusion: TFusionOcc effectively addresses limitations of prior methods, offering superior performance and robustness in 3D semantic occupancy prediction.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction enables autonomous vehicles (AVs) to perceive fine-grained geometric and semantic structure of their surroundings from onboard sensors, which is essential for safe decision-making and navigation. Recent models for 3D semantic occupancy prediction have successfully addressed the challenge of describing real-world objects with varied shapes and classes. However, the intermediate representations used by existing methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction rely heavily on 3D voxel volumes or a set of 3D Gaussians, hindering the model's ability to efficiently and effectively capture fine-grained geometric details in the 3D driving environment. This paper introduces TFusionOcc, a novel object-centric multi-sensor fusion framework for predicting 3D semantic occupancy. By leveraging multi-stage multi-sensor fusion, Student's t-distribution, and the T-Mixture model (TMM), together with more geometrically flexible primitives, such as the deformable superquadric (superquadric with inverse warp), the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the nuScenes benchmark. In addition, extensive experiments were conducted on the nuScenes-C dataset to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in different camera and lidar corruption scenarios.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between task performance-focused models and biologically grounded visual processing pathways in insect vision.

Method: A bio-inspired vision model trained with self-supervised contrastive learning, implemented as both artificial and spiking neural networks.

Result: The model produced reliable sparse codes for distinguishing inputs, outperforming simple baselines in tasks like flower recognition and localization.

Conclusion: The work advances insect computational modeling with a generalizable bio-inspired vision model effective for diverse tasks.

Abstract: Insect vision supports complex behaviors including associative learning, navigation, and object detection, and has long motivated computational models for understanding biological visual processing. However, many contemporary models prioritize task performance while neglecting biologically grounded processing pathways. Here, we introduce a bio-inspired vision model that captures principles of the insect visual system to transform dense visual input into sparse, discriminative codes. The model is trained using a fully self-supervised contrastive objective, enabling representation learning without labeled data and supporting reuse across tasks without reliance on domain-specific classifiers. We evaluated the resulting representations on flower recognition tasks and natural image benchmarks. The model consistently produced reliable sparse codes that distinguish visually similar inputs. To support different modelling and deployment uses, we have implemented the model as both an artificial neural network and a spiking neural network. In a simulated localization setting, our approach outperformed a simple image downsampling comparison baseline, highlighting the functional benefit of incorporating neuromorphic visual processing pathways. Collectively, these results advance insect computational modelling by providing a generalizable bio-inspired vision model capable of sparse computation across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes EUGens, efficient and unified dense layers that generalize fully-connected feedforward layers (FFLs) by reducing computational complexity and parameter count while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing bottlenecks in computation and parameter count introduced by fully-connected feedforward layers in neural networks.

Method: Introducing EUGens, which leverage random features and input norm dependence to approximate FFLs efficiently.

Result: EUGens reduce inference complexity to linear time, improve memory efficiency, and enable efficient adaptation of pre-trained models.

Conclusion: EUGens offer scalable deployment of large neural networks with significant improvements in speed and efficiency.

Abstract: Efficient neural networks are essential for scaling machine learning models to real-time applications and resource-constrained environments. Fully-connected feedforward layers (FFLs) introduce computation and parameter count bottlenecks within neural network architectures. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a new class of dense layers that generalize standard fully-connected feedforward layers, \textbf{E}fficient, \textbf{U}nified and \textbf{Gen}eral dense layers (EUGens). EUGens leverage random features to approximate standard FFLs and go beyond them by incorporating a direct dependence on the input norms in their computations. The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \textbf{27}\%) and memory efficiency (up to \textbf{30}\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction. Overall, our results highlight the potential of EUGens for the scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: PointViT is a transformer-based 3D object detector addressing far-field sparsity by selectively fusing LiDAR and virtual points, achieving high accuracy on KITTI benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of detecting far-field objects in LiDAR data due to point cloud sparsity and inefficient fusion of virtual points.

Method: Joint reasoning over raw LiDAR and selectively sampled virtual points using transformer-based fusion, sparse convolutions, and BEV representation.

Result: Achieves 91.16% 3D AP, 95.94% BEV AP, and 99.36% 2D AP on KITTI benchmarks for Car class.

Conclusion: PointViT effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in LiDAR-based 3D object detection by leveraging selective virtual point fusion.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors often struggle to detect far-field objects due to the sparsity of point clouds at long ranges, which limits the availability of reliable geometric cues. To address this, prior approaches augment LiDAR data with depth-completed virtual points derived from RGB images; however, directly incorporating all virtual points leads to increased computational cost and introduces challenges in effectively fusing real and virtual information. We present Point Virtual Transformer (PointViT), a transformer-based 3D object detection framework that jointly reasons over raw LiDAR points and selectively sampled virtual points. The framework examines multiple fusion strategies, ranging from early point-level fusion to BEV-based gated fusion, and analyses their trade-offs in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The fused point cloud is voxelized and encoded using sparse convolutions to form a BEV representation, from which a compact set of high-confidence object queries is initialised and refined through a transformer-based context aggregation module. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark report 91.16% 3D AP, 95.94% BEV AP, and 99.36% AP on the KITTI 2D detection benchmark for the Car class.

*Soham Pahari,Sandeep C. Kumain*

TL;DR: SemGeo-AttentionNet is a dual-stream architecture combining geometric and semantic processing to model human visual attention on 3D objects, outperforming existing methods on key datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D saliency methods lack semantic awareness, failing to explain fixation on semantically meaningful but geometrically unremarkable regions.

Method: SemGeo-AttentionNet uses diffusion-based semantic priors and point cloud transformers for geometric processing, with asymmetric cross-modal fusion. It also extends to temporal scanpath generation via reinforcement learning.

Result: Substantial improvements are demonstrated on SAL3D, NUS3D, and 3DVA datasets.

Conclusion: The cognitively motivated architecture effectively models human visual attention on 3D surfaces.

Abstract: Human visual attention on three-dimensional objects emerges from the interplay between bottom-up geometric processing and top-down semantic recognition. Existing 3D saliency methods rely on hand-crafted geometric features or learning-based approaches that lack semantic awareness, failing to explain why humans fixate on semantically meaningful but geometrically unremarkable regions. We introduce SemGeo-AttentionNet, a dual-stream architecture that explicitly formalizes this dichotomy through asymmetric cross-modal fusion, leveraging diffusion-based semantic priors from geometry-conditioned multi-view rendering and point cloud transformers for geometric processing. Cross-attention ensures geometric features query semantic content, enabling bottom-up distinctiveness to guide top-down retrieval. We extend our framework to temporal scanpath generation through reinforcement learning, introducing the first formulation respecting 3D mesh topology with inhibition-of-return dynamics. Evaluation on SAL3D, NUS3D and 3DVA datasets demonstrates substantial improvements, validating how cognitively motivated architectures effectively model human visual attention on three-dimensional surfaces.

### [33] [Alleviating Sparse Rewards by Modeling Step-Wise and Long-Term Sampling Effects in Flow-Based GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06422)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TP-GRPO improves GRPO by using step-level incremental rewards and identifying 'turning points' to better model long-term effects in text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods propagate outcome-based rewards uniformly without considering local step effects or long-term dependencies.

Method: TP-GRPO introduces step-level incremental rewards and detects 'turning points' to aggregate long-term rewards.

Result: TP-GRPO effectively exploits reward signals and improves generation consistency.

Conclusion: TP-GRPO addresses reward sparsity and enhances learning efficiency in denoising trajectories.

Abstract: Deploying GRPO on Flow Matching models has proven effective for text-to-image generation. However, existing paradigms typically propagate an outcome-based reward to all preceding denoising steps without distinguishing the local effect of each step. Moreover, current group-wise ranking mainly compares trajectories at matched timesteps and ignores within-trajectory dependencies, where certain early denoising actions can affect later states via delayed, implicit interactions. We propose TurningPoint-GRPO (TP-GRPO), a GRPO framework that alleviates step-wise reward sparsity and explicitly models long-term effects within the denoising trajectory. TP-GRPO makes two key innovations: (i) it replaces outcome-based rewards with step-level incremental rewards, providing a dense, step-aware learning signal that better isolates each denoising action's "pure" effect, and (ii) it identifies turning points-steps that flip the local reward trend and make subsequent reward evolution consistent with the overall trajectory trend-and assigns these actions an aggregated long-term reward to capture their delayed impact. Turning points are detected solely via sign changes in incremental rewards, making TP-GRPO efficient and hyperparameter-free. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that TP-GRPO exploits reward signals more effectively and consistently improves generation. Demo code is available at https://github.com/YunzeTong/TurningPoint-GRPO.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POPL-KF introduces a pose-only geometric representation for line features in VIO, reducing linearization errors and improving performance in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VIO systems degrade in challenging environments due to linearization errors and delayed updates. A pose-only approach can mitigate these issues.

Method: POPL-KF uses pose-only geometry for point and line features, eliminates feature coordinates from equations, and includes a line feature filter for quality.

Result: POPL-KF outperforms SOTA methods (OpenVINS, PO-KF, PL-VINS, EPLF-VINS) in accuracy and maintains real-time performance.

Conclusion: POPL-KF enhances VIO robustness and accuracy in challenging scenes while preserving real-time efficiency.

Abstract: Mainstream Visual-inertial odometry 
(VIO) systems rely on point features for motion estimation and localization. However, their performance degrades in challenging scenarios. Moreover, the localization accuracy of multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF)-based VIO systems suffers from linearization errors associated with feature 3D coordinates and delayed measurement updates. To improve the performance of VIO in challenging scenes, we first propose a pose-only geometric representation for line features. Building on this, we develop POPL-KF, a Kalman filter-based VIO system that employs a pose-only geometric representation for both point and line features. POPL-KF mitigates linearization errors by explicitly eliminating both point and line feature coordinates from the measurement equations, while enabling immediate update of visual measurements. We also design a unified base-frames selection algorithm for both point and line features to ensure optimal constraints on camera poses within the pose-only measurement model. To further improve line feature quality, a line feature filter based on image grid segmentation and bidirectional optical flow consistency is proposed. Our system is evaluated on public datasets and real-world experiments, demonstrating that POPL-KF outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) filter-based methods (OpenVINS, PO-KF) and optimization-based methods (PL-VINS, EPLF-VINS), while maintaining real-time performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new task, out-to-in prior-free instruction-driven embodied navigation, is introduced to address seamless outdoor-to-indoor navigation without relying on precise external priors. A vision-centric framework and open-source dataset are proposed, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current navigation methods struggle with seamless outdoor-to-indoor transitions due to reliance on precise coordinate systems. This limits practical deployment in real-world scenarios like last-mile delivery.

Method: A vision-centric embodied navigation framework is developed, using image-based prompts for decision-making. An open-source dataset is created with trajectory-conditioned video synthesis.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in success rate and path efficiency.

Conclusion: The introduced framework and dataset effectively address the challenge of out-to-in navigation without external priors, enhancing practical utility.

Abstract: Embodied navigation holds significant promise for real-world applications such as last-mile delivery. However, most existing approaches are confined to either indoor or outdoor environments and rely heavily on strong assumptions, such as access to precise coordinate systems. While current outdoor methods can guide agents to the vicinity of a target using coarse-grained localization, they fail to enable fine-grained entry through specific building entrances, critically limiting their utility in practical deployment scenarios that require seamless outdoor-to-indoor transitions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task: out-to-in prior-free instruction-driven embodied navigation. This formulation explicitly eliminates reliance on accurate external priors, requiring agents to navigate solely based on egocentric visual observations guided by instructions. To tackle this task, we propose a vision-centric embodied navigation framework that leverages image-based prompts to drive decision-making. Additionally, we present the first open-source dataset for this task, featuring a pipeline that integrates trajectory-conditioned video synthesis into the data generation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across key metrics including success rate and path efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChatUMM introduces a conversational unified multimodal model for continuous dialogue, excelling in context tracking and multimodal generation through innovative training and data synthesis methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models are limited by single-turn interactions, lacking the ability to function as continuous dialogue assistants.

Method: ChatUMM uses an interleaved multi-turn training strategy and a conversational data synthesis pipeline, transforming single-turn datasets into fluid dialogues.

Result: ChatUMM achieves state-of-the-art performance in visual understanding and instruction-guided editing, with competitive text-to-image generation fidelity.

Conclusion: ChatUMM successfully bridges the gap for continuous dialogue in multimodal models, demonstrating robustness in complex multi-turn scenarios.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have achieved remarkable progress yet remain constrained by a single-turn interaction paradigm, effectively functioning as solvers for independent requests rather than assistants in continuous dialogue. To bridge this gap, we present ChatUMM. As a conversational unified model, it excels at robust context tracking to sustain interleaved multimodal generation. ChatUMM derives its capabilities from two key innovations: an interleaved multi-turn training strategy that models serialized text-image streams as a continuous conversational flow, and a systematic conversational data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline transforms a diverse set of standard single-turn datasets into fluid dialogues through three progressive stages: constructing basic stateful dialogues, enforcing long-range dependency resolution via ``distractor'' turns with history-dependent query rewriting, and synthesizing naturally interleaved multimodal responses. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ChatUMM achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source unified models on visual understanding and instruction-guided editing benchmarks, while maintaining competitive fidelity in text-to-image generation. Notably, ChatUMM exhibits superior robustness in complex multi-turn scenarios, ensuring fluid, context-aware dialogues.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnionST introduces a synthetic data engine and dataset (UnionST-S) to bridge the domain gap between real and synthetic text data, achieving superior performance with minimal real-data labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real data collection for Scene Text Recognition (STR) is challenging, and existing synthetic data lacks diversity and realism.

Method: Proposed UnionST-S dataset with improved corpus, font, and layout diversity, and a self-evolution learning (SEL) framework for efficient real-data annotation.

Result: UnionST-S-trained models outperform existing synthetic datasets and even surpass real-data performance in some cases. SEL reduces reliance on real labels.

Conclusion: UnionST-S and SEL effectively bridge the synthetic-real gap and enhance STR model performance with minimal labeled real data.

Abstract: Large-scale and categorical-balanced text data is essential for training effective Scene Text Recognition (STR) models, which is hard to achieve when collecting real data. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective and perfectly labeled alternative. However, its performance often lags behind, revealing a significant domain gap between real and current synthetic data. In this work, we systematically analyze mainstream rendering-based synthetic datasets and identify their key limitations: insufficient diversity in corpus, font, and layout, which restricts their realism in complex scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce UnionST, a strong data engine synthesizes text covering a union of challenging samples and better aligns with the complexity observed in the wild. We then construct UnionST-S, a large-scale synthetic dataset with improved simulations in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, we develop a self-evolution learning (SEL) framework for effective real data annotation. Experiments show that models trained on UnionST-S achieve significant improvements over existing synthetic datasets. They even surpass real-data performance in certain scenarios. Moreover, when using SEL, the trained models achieve competitive performance by only seeing 9% of real data labels.

*Hongyan Fei,Zexi Jia,Chuanwei Huang,Jinchao Zhang,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deepfake detection method leveraging facial illumination and specular reflection inconsistencies outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods struggle with high-quality AI-generated faces, necessitating a new approach based on hard-to-replicate facial attributes.

Method: Utilizes Retinex theory for face texture estimation, focusing on specular reflection inconsistencies, and introduces SRI-Net with a two-stage cross-attention mechanism.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods on both standard and diffusion-generated deepfake datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively detects deepfakes by analyzing facial illumination and specular reflection, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes has become increasingly challenging as forgery faces synthesized by AI-generated methods, particularly diffusion models, achieve unprecedented quality and resolution. Existing forgery detection approaches relying on spatial and frequency features demonstrate limited efficacy against high-quality, entirely synthesized forgeries. In this paper, we propose a novel detection method grounded in the observation that facial attributes governed by complex physical laws and multiple parameters are inherently difficult to replicate. Specifically, we focus on illumination, particularly the specular reflection component in the Phong illumination model, which poses the greatest replication challenge due to its parametric complexity and nonlinear formulation. We introduce a fast and accurate face texture estimation method based on Retinex theory to enable precise specular reflection separation. Furthermore, drawing from the mathematical formulation of specular reflection, we posit that forgery evidence manifests not only in the specular reflection itself but also in its relationship with corresponding face texture and direct light. To address this issue, we design the Specular-Reflection-Inconsistency-Network (SRI-Net), incorporating a two-stage cross-attention mechanism to capture these correlations and integrate specular reflection related features with image features for robust forgery detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both traditional deepfake datasets and generative deepfake datasets, particularly those containing diffusion-generated forgery faces.

TL;DR: LAB-Det introduces training-free one-shot domain generalization for object detection using language as a domain-invariant bridge, outperforming fine-tuned baselines without weight updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the degradation of foundation object detectors in specialized domains with scarce data, LAB-Det aims to adapt without costly fine-tuning or overfitting risks.

Method: LAB-Det projects exemplars into descriptive text to linguistically condition frozen detectors, replacing gradient-based adaptation.

Result: Achieves up to 5.4 mAP improvement over state-of-the-art fine-tuned baselines on UODD and NEU-DET benchmarks.

Conclusion: LAB-Det demonstrates linguistic adaptation as an efficient and interpretable alternative to fine-tuning in specialized detection settings.

Abstract: Foundation object detectors such as GLIP and Grounding DINO excel on general-domain data but often degrade in specialized and data-scarce settings like underwater imagery or industrial defects. Typical cross-domain few-shot approaches rely on fine-tuning scarce target data, incurring cost and overfitting risks. We instead ask: Can a frozen detector adapt with only one exemplar per class without training? To answer this, we introduce training-free one-shot domain generalization for object detection, where detectors must adapt to specialized domains with only one annotated exemplar per class and no weight updates. To tackle this task, we propose LAB-Det, which exploits Language As a domain-invariant Bridge. Instead of adapting visual features, we project each exemplar into a descriptive text that conditions and guides a frozen detector. This linguistic conditioning replaces gradient-based adaptation, enabling robust generalization in data-scarce domains. We evaluate on UODD (underwater) and NEU-DET (industrial defects), two widely adopted benchmarks for data-scarce detection, where object boundaries are often ambiguous, and LAB-Det achieves up to 5.4 mAP improvement over state-of-the-art fine-tuned baselines without updating a single parameter. These results establish linguistic adaptation as an efficient and interpretable alternative to fine-tuning in specialized detection settings.

### [40] [Instance-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06484)
*Hengfu Yu,Jinhong Deng,Lixin Duan,Wen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the novel problem of Instance-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) and proposes the Relational and Structural Consistency Network (RSCN) to address it by leveraging background features and relational consistency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the practical challenge of domain adaptation in object detection when target domain data lacks foreground instances, a common scenario in fields like wildlife monitoring and lesion detection. Traditional DAOD methods rely on unlabeled target data with sufficient foreground instances, which is often costly or impractical to obtain.

Method: The paper proposes the Relational and Structural Consistency Network (RSCN), which aligns domains using background feature prototypes and enforces consistency in the relationships between source foreground and background features. This approach adapts robustly even without target instances.

Result: RSCN significantly outperforms existing DAOD methods across three specialized benchmarks: simulative auto-driving detection, wildlife detection, and lung nodule detection.

Conclusion: The work successfully formulates and solves the instance-free DAOD problem, demonstrating the effectiveness of RSCN in practical scenarios where target foreground instances are unavailable. The release of code and benchmarks will aid further research in this area.

Abstract: While Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) has made significant strides, most methods rely on unlabeled target data that is assumed to contain sufficient foreground instances. However, in many practical scenarios (e.g., wildlife monitoring, lesion detection), collecting target domain data with objects of interest is prohibitively costly, whereas background-only data is abundant. This common practical constraint introduces a significant technical challenge: the difficulty of achieving domain alignment when target instances are unavailable, forcing adaptation to rely solely on the target background information. We formulate this challenge as the novel problem of Instance-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection. To tackle this, we propose the Relational and Structural Consistency Network (RSCN) which pioneers an alignment strategy based on background feature prototypes while simultaneously encouraging consistency in the relationship between the source foreground features and the background features within each domain, enabling robust adaptation even without target instances. To facilitate research, we further curate three specialized benchmarks, including simulative auto-driving detection, wildlife detection, and lung nodule detection. Extensive experiments show that RSCN significantly outperforms existing DAOD methods across all three benchmarks in the instance-free scenario. The code and benchmarks will be released soon.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reformulated benchmark and occlusion-aware polarization mechanism for unsupervised monocular 3D occupancy prediction, addressing inconsistencies in existing methods and improving performance to match supervised approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle inconsistency between training and evaluation protocols in unsupervised 3D structure inference and address ambiguity in occluded regions caused by insufficient geometric constraints.

Method: Reformulates benchmark by identifying a consistent occupancy probability representation, aligns evaluation protocols, and introduces an occlusion-aware polarization mechanism leveraging multi-view cues.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing unsupervised methods and matches supervised approaches in performance.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and mechanism enhance unsupervised 3D occupancy prediction consistency and accuracy, bridging the gap with supervised methods.

Abstract: Inferring the 3D structure from a single image, particularly in occluded regions, remains a fundamental yet unsolved challenge in vision-centric autonomous driving. Existing unsupervised approaches typically train a neural radiance field and treat the network outputs as occupancy probabilities during evaluation, overlooking the inconsistency between training and evaluation protocols. Moreover, the prevalent use of 2D ground truth fails to reveal the inherent ambiguity in occluded regions caused by insufficient geometric constraints. To address these issues, this paper presents a reformulated benchmark for unsupervised monocular 3D occupancy prediction. We first interpret the variables involved in the volume rendering process and identify the most physically consistent representation of the occupancy probability. Building on these analyses, we improve existing evaluation protocols by aligning the newly identified representation with voxel-wise 3D occupancy ground truth, thereby enabling unsupervised methods to be evaluated in a manner consistent with that of supervised approaches. Additionally, to impose explicit constraints in occluded regions, we introduce an occlusion-aware polarization mechanism that incorporates multi-view visual cues to enhance discrimination between occupied and free spaces in these regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only significantly outperforms existing unsupervised approaches but also matches the performance of supervised ones. Our source code and evaluation protocol will be made available upon publication.

TL;DR: DreamHome-Pano is a framework for high-fidelity interior synthesis, using a Prompt-LLM and Conflict-Free Control architecture to balance style and structural constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks struggle to harmonize architectural constraints and stylistic preferences, leading to compromised layouts.

Method: Uses a Prompt-LLM for semantic translation and Conflict-Free Control architecture with geometric priors. Includes multi-stage training (SFT and RL).

Result: Achieves superior balance between aesthetic quality and structural consistency.

Conclusion: DreamHome-Pano provides a robust solution for panoramic interior visualization.

Abstract: In modern interior design, the generation of personalized spaces frequently necessitates a delicate balance between rigid architectural structural constraints and specific stylistic preferences. However, existing multi-condition generative frameworks often struggle to harmonize these inputs, leading to "condition conflicts" where stylistic attributes inadvertently compromise the geometric precision of the layout. To address this challenge, we present DreamHome-Pano, a controllable panoramic generation framework designed for high-fidelity interior synthesis. Our approach introduces a Prompt-LLM that serves as a semantic bridge, effectively translating layout constraints and style references into professional descriptive prompts to achieve precise cross-modal alignment. To safeguard architectural integrity during the generative process, we develop a Conflict-Free Control architecture that incorporates structural-aware geometric priors and a multi-condition decoupling strategy, effectively suppressing stylistic interference from eroding the spatial layout. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive panoramic interior benchmark alongside a multi-stage training pipeline, encompassing progressive Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experimental results demonstrate that DreamHome-Pano achieves a superior balance between aesthetic quality and structural consistency, offering a robust and professional-grade solution for panoramic interior visualization.

TL;DR: Depth2CHM, a monocular depth estimation model trained with large-scale airborne LiDAR data, accurately estimates forest canopy height from RGB imagery, reducing errors compared to existing products.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding regional and global carbon and water cycles requires high-resolution forest canopy height mapping. Existing spaceborne LiDAR missions are spatially sparse and uncertain, while near-surface LiDAR offers finer measurements.

Method: The study trained Depth Anything V2 using ~16,000 km² of airborne LiDAR-derived canopy height models (CHMs) and RGB imagery. The resulting Depth2CHM model estimates CHMs from PlanetScope RGB imagery.

Result: Validation showed biases of 0.59 m and 0.41 m, and RMSEs of 2.54 m and 5.75 m for sites in China and the US, respectively. Errors were reduced compared to existing global CHM products.

Conclusion: Large-scale airborne LiDAR-trained models like Depth2CHM offer a scalable solution for high-resolution forest canopy height estimation from satellite RGB imagery.

Abstract: Large-scale, high-resolution forest canopy height mapping plays a crucial role in understanding regional and global carbon and water cycles. Spaceborne LiDAR missions, including the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), provide global observations of forest structure but are spatially sparse and subject to inherent uncertainties. In contrast, near-surface LiDAR platforms, such as airborne and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR systems, offer much finer measurements of forest canopy structure, and a growing number of countries have made these datasets openly available. In this study, a state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation model, Depth Anything V2, was trained using approximately 16,000 km2 of canopy height models (CHMs) derived from publicly available airborne LiDAR point clouds and related products across multiple countries, together with 3 m resolution PlanetScope and airborne RGB imagery. The trained model, referred to as Depth2CHM, enables the estimation of spatially continuous CHMs directly from PlanetScope RGB imagery. Independent validation was conducted at sites in China (approximately 1 km2) and the United States (approximately 116 km2). The results showed that Depth2CHM could accurately estimate canopy height, with biases of 0.59 m and 0.41 m and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 2.54 m and 5.75 m for these two sites, respectively. Compared with an existing global meter-resolution CHM product, the mean absolute error is reduced by approximately 1.5 m and the RMSE by approximately 2 m. These results demonstrated that monocular depth estimation networks trained with large-scale airborne LiDAR-derived canopy height data provide a promising and scalable pathway for high-resolution, spatially continuous forest canopy height estimation from satellite RGB imagery.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently attracted increasing interest in unifying Vision-Language-Action (VLA) with World Models to enhance decision-making and forward-looking imagination. However, existing methods fail to effectively unify future scene evolution and action planning within a single architecture due to inadequate sharing of latent states, limiting the impact of visual imagination on action decisions. To address this limitation, we propose DriveWorld-VLA, a novel framework that unifies world modeling and planning within a latent space by tightly integrating VLA and world models at the representation level, which enables the VLA planner to benefit directly from holistic scene-evolution modeling and reducing reliance on dense annotated supervision. Additionally, DriveWorld-VLA incorporates the latent states of the world model as core decision-making states for the VLA planner, facilitating the planner to assess how candidate actions impact future scene evolution. By conducting world modeling entirely in the latent space, DriveWorld-VLA supports controllable, action-conditioned imagination at the feature level, avoiding expensive pixel-level rollouts. Extensive open-loop and closed-loop evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of DriveWorld-VLA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with 91.3 PDMS on NAVSIMv1, 86.8 EPDMS on NAVSIMv2, and 0.16 3-second average collision rate on nuScenes. Code and models will be released in https://github.com/liulin815/DriveWorld-VLA.git.

### [45] [MicroBi-ConvLSTM: An Ultra-Lightweight Efficient Model for Human Activity Recognition on Resource Constrained Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06523)
*Mridankan Mandal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MicroBi-ConvLSTM is an ultra-lightweight model for HAR on wearables, reducing parameters by 2.9x-11.9x while maintaining competitive accuracy and suitability for memory-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate HAR models on resource-constrained wearables without exceeding memory budgets drives this work.

Method: Proposes MicroBi-ConvLSTM, employing two-stage convolutional feature extraction with temporal pooling and a bidirectional LSTM layer for efficiency.

Result: Achieves 93.41%-94.46% F1 scores on benchmarks, with only 0.21% F1 degradation after INT8 quantization, and 23.0 KB deployment size.

Conclusion: MicroBi-ConvLSTM balances performance and resource efficiency, ideal for edge devices with strict memory limits.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on resource constrained wearables requires models that balance accuracy against strict memory and computational budgets. State of the art lightweight architectures such as TinierHAR (34K parameters) and TinyHAR (55K parameters) achieve strong accuracy, but exceed memory budgets of microcontrollers with limited SRAM once operating system overhead is considered. We present MicroBi-ConvLSTM, an ultra-lightweight convolutional-recurrent architecture achieving 11.4K parameters on average through two stage convolutional feature extraction with 4x temporal pooling and a single bidirectional LSTM layer. This represents 2.9x parameter reduction versus TinierHAR and 11.9x versus DeepConvLSTM while preserving linear O(N) complexity. Evaluation across eight diverse HAR benchmarks shows that MicroBi-ConvLSTM maintains competitive performance within the ultra-lightweight regime: 93.41% macro F1 on UCI-HAR, 94.46% on SKODA assembly gestures, and 88.98% on Daphnet gait freeze detection. Systematic ablation reveals task dependent component contributions where bidirectionality benefits episodic event detection, but provides marginal gains on periodic locomotion. INT8 post training quantization incurs only 0.21% average F1-score degradation, yielding a 23.0 KB average deployment footprint suitable for memory constrained edge devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaptOVCD is a training-free Open-Vocabulary Change Detection framework that fuses multi-level information across data, feature, and decision levels, achieving superior performance in detecting arbitrary category changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing change detection methods rely on predefined categories and extensive annotations, limiting their generalization. AdaptOVCD aims to overcome these constraints by leveraging open-world scenarios.

Method: The framework uses dual-dimensional multi-level information fusion: Adaptive Radiometric Alignment (ARA) at the data level, Adaptive Change Thresholding (ACT) at the feature level, and Adaptive Confidence Filtering (ACF) at the decision level, integrating heterogeneous pre-trained models.

Result: AdaptOVCD outperforms existing training-free methods, achieves 84.89% of fully-supervised performance in cross-dataset evaluations, and shows strong generalization.

Conclusion: AdaptOVCD is effective for open-world change detection without training, demonstrating robustness and scalability across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection plays a pivotal role in domains such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster assessment. However, existing methods typically rely on predefined categories and large-scale pixel-level annotations, which limit their generalization and applicability in open-world scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper proposes AdaptOVCD, a training-free Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (OVCD) architecture based on dual-dimensional multi-level information fusion. The framework integrates multi-level information fusion across data, feature, and decision levels vertically while incorporating targeted adaptive designs horizontally, achieving deep synergy among heterogeneous pre-trained models to effectively mitigate error propagation. Specifically, (1) at the data level, Adaptive Radiometric Alignment (ARA) fuses radiometric statistics with original texture features and synergizes with SAM-HQ to achieve radiometrically consistent segmentation; (2) at the feature level, Adaptive Change Thresholding (ACT) combines global difference distributions with edge structure priors and leverages DINOv3 to achieve robust change detection; (3) at the decision level, Adaptive Confidence Filtering (ACF) integrates semantic confidence with spatial constraints and collaborates with DGTRS-CLIP to achieve high-confidence semantic identification. Comprehensive evaluations across nine scenarios demonstrate that AdaptOVCD detects arbitrary category changes in a zero-shot manner, significantly outperforming existing training-free methods. Meanwhile, it achieves 84.89\% of the fully-supervised performance upper bound in cross-dataset evaluations and exhibits superior generalization capabilities.

*Haipeng Li,Rongxuan Peng,Anwei Luo,Shunquan Tan,Changsheng Chen,Anastasia Antsiferova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ForgeryEraser introduces a framework for universal anti-forensics attacks on AIGC detectors, exploiting vulnerabilities in Vision-Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIGC authenticity assessment overlooks anti-forensics attacks, leaving detectors vulnerable.

Method: ForgeryEraser uses multi-modal guidance loss to manipulate forged image embeddings in VLM feature space.

Result: Substantial degradation in AIGC detector performance and explainable forensic model inconsistencies.

Conclusion: ForgeryEraser effectively exposes vulnerabilities in current AIGC detectors, enhancing robustness awareness.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-Generated Content (AIGC) technologies poses significant challenges for authenticity assessment. However, existing evaluation protocols largely overlook anti-forensics attack, failing to ensure the comprehensive robustness of state-of-the-art AIGC detectors in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose ForgeryEraser, a framework designed to execute universal anti-forensics attack without access to the target AIGC detectors. We reveal an adversarial vulnerability stemming from the systemic reliance on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as shared backbones (e.g., CLIP), where downstream AIGC detectors inherit the feature space of these publicly accessible models. Instead of traditional logit-based optimization, we design a multi-modal guidance loss to drive forged image embeddings within the VLM feature space toward text-derived authentic anchors to erase forgery traces, while repelling them from forgery anchors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForgeryEraser causes substantial performance degradation to advanced AIGC detectors on both global synthesis and local editing benchmarks. Moreover, ForgeryEraser induces explainable forensic models to generate explanations consistent with authentic images for forged images. Our code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NECromancer (NEC) is a universal motion tokenizer for BVH skeletons, enabling cross-species motion transfer and synthesis through skeletal embeddings and a topology-agnostic tokenizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion tokenization methods are limited to species-specific skeletons, restricting their use across diverse morphologies. NEC aims to overcome this by working with arbitrary BVH skeletons.

Method: NEC includes three components: (1) OwO for skeletal embeddings, (2) TAT for creating topology-invariant motion tokens, and (3) UvU, a dataset of BVH motions across skeletons.

Result: NEC achieves high-fidelity motion reconstruction and supports cross-species motion transfer, composition, and other tasks like text-motion retrieval.

Conclusion: NEC provides a unified framework for motion analysis and synthesis across diverse skeletons, demonstrating broad applicability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Motion tokenization is a key component of generalizable motion models, yet most existing approaches are restricted to species-specific skeletons, limiting their applicability across diverse morphologies. We propose NECromancer (NEC), a universal motion tokenizer that operates directly on arbitrary BVH skeletons. NEC consists of three components: (1) an Ontology-aware Skeletal Graph Encoder (OwO) that encodes structural priors from BVH files, including joint semantics, rest-pose offsets, and skeletal topology, into skeletal embeddings; (2) a Topology-Agnostic Tokenizer (TAT) that compresses motion sequences into a universal, topology-invariant discrete representation; and (3) the Unified BVH Universe (UvU), a large-scale dataset aggregating BVH motions across heterogeneous skeletons. Experiments show that NEC achieves high-fidelity reconstruction under substantial compression and effectively disentangles motion from skeletal structure. The resulting token space supports cross-species motion transfer, composition, denoising, generation with token-based models, and text-motion retrieval, establishing a unified framework for motion analysis and synthesis across diverse morphologies.

TL;DR: LIBERO-X is a new benchmark for Vision-Language-Action models, featuring hierarchical evaluation and diverse training data to address limitations in existing benchmarks, revealing persistent model weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks inadequately assess VLA models due to insufficient protocols and distribution gaps, prompting the need for a more reliable benchmarking tool.

Method: LIBERO-X introduces a hierarchical evaluation protocol targeting core capabilities and a high-diversity training dataset collected via human teleoperation.

Result: Experiments show significant performance drops under perturbations, highlighting limitations in scene comprehension and instruction grounding.

Conclusion: LIBERO-X provides a robust foundation for assessing and improving VLA models by addressing evaluation and data gaps.

Abstract: Reliable benchmarking is critical for advancing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, as it reveals their generalization, robustness, and alignment of perception with language-driven manipulation tasks. However, existing benchmarks often provide limited or misleading assessments due to insufficient evaluation protocols that inadequately capture real-world distribution shifts. This work systematically rethinks VLA benchmarking from both evaluation and data perspectives, introducing LIBERO-X, a benchmark featuring: 1) A hierarchical evaluation protocol with progressive difficulty levels targeting three core capabilities: spatial generalization, object recognition, and task instruction understanding. This design enables fine-grained analysis of performance degradation under increasing environmental and task complexity; 2) A high-diversity training dataset collected via human teleoperation, where each scene supports multiple fine-grained manipulation objectives to bridge the train-evaluation distribution gap. Experiments with representative VLA models reveal significant performance drops under cumulative perturbations, exposing persistent limitations in scene comprehension and instruction grounding. By integrating hierarchical evaluation with diverse training data, LIBERO-X offers a more reliable foundation for assessing and advancing VLA development.

### [50] [SPARC: Separating Perception And Reasoning Circuits for Test-time Scaling of VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06566)
*Niccolo Avogaro,Nayanika Debnath,Li Mi,Thomas Frick,Junling Wang,Zexue He,Hang Hua,Konrad Schindler,Mattia Rigotti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARC is a modular framework for vision-language models that separates visual perception from reasoning, improving accuracy and efficiency compared to monolithic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models suffer from entangled perception and reasoning, leading to cascading errors and requiring costly reinforcement learning. SPARC aims to address these issues by decoupling the two processes.

Method: SPARC uses a two-stage pipeline: first, visual search localizes question-relevant regions; second, reasoning is conditioned on those regions. This allows asymmetric compute allocation and selective optimization.

Result: SPARC outperforms monolithic baselines and visual-grounding approaches, achieving significant accuracy improvements (e.g., +6.7 points on VQA) with much lower token budgets (200×).

Conclusion: Decoupling perception and reasoning enhances model performance and efficiency, enabling scalable and adaptable solutions for vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Despite recent successes, test-time scaling - i.e., dynamically expanding the token budget during inference as needed - remains brittle for vision-language models (VLMs): unstructured chains-of-thought about images entangle perception and reasoning, leading to long, disorganized contexts where small perceptual mistakes may cascade into completely wrong answers. Moreover, expensive reinforcement learning with hand-crafted rewards is required to achieve good performance. Here, we introduce SPARC (Separating Perception And Reasoning Circuits), a modular framework that explicitly decouples visual perception from reasoning. Inspired by sequential sensory-to-cognitive processing in the brain, SPARC implements a two-stage pipeline where the model first performs explicit visual search to localize question-relevant regions, then conditions its reasoning on those regions to produce the final answer. This separation enables independent test-time scaling with asymmetric compute allocation (e.g., prioritizing perceptual processing under distribution shift), supports selective optimization (e.g., improving the perceptual stage alone when it is the bottleneck for end-to-end performance), and accommodates compressed contexts by running global search at lower image resolutions and allocating high-resolution processing only to selected regions, thereby reducing total visual tokens count and compute. Across challenging visual reasoning benchmarks, SPARC outperforms monolithic baselines and strong visual-grounding approaches. For instance, SPARC improves the accuracy of Qwen3VL-4B on the $V^*$ VQA benchmark by 6.7 percentage points, and it surpasses "thinking with images" by 4.6 points on a challenging OOD task despite requiring a 200$\times$ lower token budget.

### [51] [An Integer Linear Programming Approach to Geometrically Consistent Partial-Partial Shape Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06590)
*Viktoria Ehm,Paul Roetzer,Florian Bernard,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an integer linear programming approach for partial-partial 3D shape matching, addressing challenges like unknown overlapping regions and neighborhood-preserving correspondences, achieving scalable and high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial-partial 3D shape matching is understudied despite its real-world relevance (e.g., 3D scanning), necessitating robust solutions for overlapping region estimation and accurate correspondences.

Method: The authors propose an integer linear programming approach utilizing geometric consistency to robustly estimate overlapping regions and compute neighborhood-preserving correspondences.

Result: Empirical results show high-quality matching outcomes in terms of error and smoothness, with improved scalability over previous methods.

Conclusion: The introduced method effectively addresses the challenges of partial-partial shape matching, demonstrating practicality and scalability.

Abstract: The task of establishing correspondences between two 3D shapes is a long-standing challenge in computer vision. While numerous studies address full-full and partial-full 3D shape matching, only a limited number of works have explored the partial-partial setting, very likely due to its unique challenges: we must compute accurate correspondences while at the same time find the unknown overlapping region. Nevertheless, partial-partial 3D shape matching reflects the most realistic setting, as in many real-world cases, such as 3D scanning, shapes are only partially observable. In this work, we introduce the first integer linear programming approach specifically designed to address the distinctive challenges of partial-partial shape matching. Our method leverages geometric consistency as a strong prior, enabling both robust estimation of the overlapping region and computation of neighbourhood-preserving correspondences. We empirically demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality matching results both in terms of matching error and smoothness. Moreover, we show that our method is more scalable than previous formalisms.

TL;DR: ProtoQuant introduces latent vector quantization to stabilize prototypes and improve interpretability in parts-based models, achieving competitive accuracy on ImageNet and fine-grained benchmarks without finetuning backbone models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototypical parts-based models struggle with ImageNet-scale generalization, computational expense, and prototype drift, prompting the need for a more stable and interpretable solution.

Method: ProtoQuant uses latent vector quantization to constrain prototypes to a discrete codebook within the latent space, eliminating backbone finetuning and ensuring prototype stability.

Result: ProtoQuant achieves competitive classification accuracy on ImageNet and fine-grained benchmarks (CUB-200, Cars-196) while maintaining interpretability.

Conclusion: ProtoQuant effectively addresses prototype drift and scalability issues in parts-based models, offering stable prototypes and competitive performance without backbone updates.

Abstract: Prototypical parts-based models offer a "this looks like that" paradigm for intrinsic interpretability, yet they typically struggle with ImageNet-scale generalization and often require computationally expensive backbone finetuning. Furthermore, existing methods frequently suffer from "prototype drift," where learned prototypes lack tangible grounding in the training distribution and change their activation under small perturbations. We present ProtoQuant, a novel architecture that achieves prototype stability and grounded interpretability through latent vector quantization. By constraining prototypes to a discrete learned codebook within the latent space, we ensure they remain faithful representations of the training data without the need to update the backbone. This design allows ProtoQuant to function as an efficient, interpretable head that scales to large-scale datasets. We evaluate ProtoQuant on ImageNet and several fine-grained benchmarks (CUB-200, Cars-196). Our results demonstrate that ProtoQuant achieves competitive classification accuracy while generalizing to ImageNet and comparable interpretability metrics to other prototypical-parts-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAVE is a new attribution method for Vision Transformers that decomposes gradients to produce stable, high-resolution attribution maps by isolating equivariant components and reducing artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with artifacts and instability in pixel-level explanations for ViTs due to architectural components like patch embeddings and attention routing.

Method: DAVE uses a structured decomposition of input gradients, leveraging ViT architecture properties to isolate stable components (locally equivariant) and separate them from artifacts.

Result: The method produces stable and high-resolution attribution maps, addressing challenges posed by ViT architectures.

Conclusion: DAVE offers a mathematically grounded solution for accurate attribution in ViTs, improving interpretability by reducing artifacts and instability.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become a dominant architecture in computer vision, yet producing stable and high-resolution attribution maps for these models remains challenging. Architectural components such as patch embeddings and attention routing often introduce structured artifacts in pixel-level explanations, causing many existing methods to rely on coarse patch-level attributions. We introduce DAVE \textit{(\underline{D}istribution-aware \underline{A}ttribution via \underline{V}iT Gradient D\underline{E}composition)}, a mathematically grounded attribution method for ViTs based on a structured decomposition of the input gradient. By exploiting architectural properties of ViTs, DAVE isolates locally equivariant and stable components of the effective input--output mapping. It separates these from architecture-induced artifacts and other sources of instability.

TL;DR: CauCLIP uses causality-inspired vision-language learning to improve surgical phase recognition across domains without needing target domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training robust surgical phase recognition models is challenging due to limited annotated clinical videos and domain gaps between synthetic and real data.

Method: Proposes CauCLIP, integrating frequency-based augmentation and causal suppression loss to learn domain-invariant representations.

Result: Outperforms other methods on the SurgVisDom benchmark, demonstrating effectiveness for domain-generalizable surgical video understanding.

Conclusion: CauCLIP effectively leverages causality-guided vision-language models to enhance surgical phase recognition across diverse domains.

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition is a critical component for context-aware decision support in intelligent operating rooms, yet training robust models is hindered by limited annotated clinical videos and large domain gaps between synthetic and real surgical data. To address this, we propose CauCLIP, a causality-inspired vision-language framework that leverages CLIP to learn domain-invariant representations for surgical phase recognition without access to target domain data. Our approach integrates a frequency-based augmentation strategy to perturb domain-specific attributes while preserving semantic structures, and a causal suppression loss that mitigates non-causal biases and reinforces causal surgical features. These components are combined in a unified training framework that enables the model to focus on stable causal factors underlying surgical workflows. Experiments on the SurgVisDom hard adaptation benchmark demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms all competing approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of causality-guided vision-language models for domain-generalizable surgical video understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The potential of UMMs in computer-use planning tasks (e.g., spatial reasoning, procedural understanding) is underexplored, prompting the need for a dedicated benchmark.

Method: PlanViz introduces three sub-tasks, uses human-annotated questions and reference images for data quality, and proposes PlanScore for evaluation.

Result: The benchmark identifies limitations and opportunities in UMMs' ability to generate and edit images for computer-use tasks.

Conclusion: PlanViz provides a foundation for assessing and improving UMMs' performance in practical planning tasks, guiding future research.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating natural images and supporting multimodal reasoning. However, their potential in supporting computer-use planning tasks, which are closely related to our lives, remain underexplored. Image generation and editing in computer-use tasks require capabilities like spatial reasoning and procedural understanding, and it is still unknown whether UMMs have these capabilities to finish these tasks or not. Therefore, we propose PlanViz, a new benchmark designed to evaluate image generation and editing for computer-use tasks. To achieve the goal of our evaluation, we focus on sub-tasks which frequently involve in daily life and require planning steps. Specifically, three new sub-tasks are designed: route planning, work diagramming, and web&UI displaying. We address challenges in data quality ensuring by curating human-annotated questions and reference images, and a quality control process. For challenges of comprehensive and exact evaluation, a task-adaptive score, PlanScore, is proposed. The score helps understanding the correctness, visual quality and efficiency of generated images. Through experiments, we highlight key limitations and opportunities for future research on this topic.

TL;DR: CytoCrowd is a public benchmark dataset for cytology analysis featuring 446 images with raw pathologist annotations and a gold-standard ground truth, serving both standard computer vision tasks and annotation aggregation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical datasets often lack real-world expert disagreement or a separate gold standard for objective evaluation.

Method: The dataset includes high-resolution images with conflicting annotations from 4 pathologists and a gold-standard truth from a senior expert.

Result: CytoCrowd proves challenging and valuable for standard tasks and resolving expert disagreements.

Conclusion: CytoCrowd bridges the gap in medical datasets, aiding the development of advanced models for medical image analysis.

Abstract: High-quality annotated datasets are crucial for advancing machine learning in medical image analysis. However, a critical gap exists: most datasets either offer a single, clean ground truth, which hides real-world expert disagreement, or they provide multiple annotations without a separate gold standard for objective evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce CytoCrowd, a new public benchmark for cytology analysis. The dataset features 446 high-resolution images, each with two key components: (1) raw, conflicting annotations from four independent pathologists, and (2) a separate, high-quality gold-standard ground truth established by a senior expert. This dual structure makes CytoCrowd a versatile resource. It serves as a benchmark for standard computer vision tasks, such as object detection and classification, using the ground truth. Simultaneously, it provides a realistic testbed for evaluating annotation aggregation algorithms that must resolve expert disagreements. We provide comprehensive baseline results for both tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the challenges presented by CytoCrowd and establish its value as a resource for developing the next generation of models for medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Semantic-Induced Constrained Adaptation (SICA), a monolithic Fake Image Detection (FID) model, addressing the 'heterogeneous phenomenon' in image forensics by reconstructing artifact features using high-level semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monolithic FID models underperform due to collapsed artifact feature spaces caused by intrinsic discrepancies across forensic subdomains. The goal is to develop a unified-yet-discriminative solution.

Method: The authors introduce SICA, leveraging high-level semantics as a structural prior for reconstructing artifact features, achieving near-orthogonal feature space reconstruction.

Result: SICA outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods on the OpenMMSec dataset, validating its effectiveness in unifying and discriminating artifact features.

Conclusion: SICA successfully addresses the paradoxical challenge of monolithic FID models, offering a practical solution with superior performance.

Abstract: Fake Image Detection (FID), aiming at unified detection across four image forensic subdomains, is critical in real-world forensic scenarios. Compared with ensemble approaches, monolithic FID models are theoretically more promising, but to date, consistently yield inferior performance in practice. In this work, by discovering the ``heterogeneous phenomenon'', which is the intrinsic distinctness of artifacts across subdomains, we diagnose the cause of this underperformance for the first time: the collapse of the artifact feature space driven by such phenomenon. The core challenge for developing a practical monolithic FID model thus boils down to the ``unified-yet-discriminative" reconstruction of the artifact feature space. To address this paradoxical challenge, we hypothesize that high-level semantics can serve as a structural prior for the reconstruction, and further propose Semantic-Induced Constrained Adaptation (SICA), the first monolithic FID paradigm. Extensive experiments on our OpenMMSec dataset demonstrate that SICA outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods and reconstructs the target unified-yet-discriminative artifact feature space in a near-orthogonal manner, thus firmly validating our hypothesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of AIS is crucial, but current screening methods are subjective and hard to scale. Video-based gait analysis faces issues like data leakage and lack of interpretability.

Method: Uses ScoliGait dataset (1,572 training, 300 independent test clips) annotated with Cobb angles and clinical text. Proposes a multi-modal framework integrating kinematic knowledge maps and latent attention pooling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on a realistic, subject-independent benchmark.

Conclusion: Provides a robust, interpretable, and clinically viable solution for non-invasive AIS assessment.

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a prevalent spinal deformity whose progression can be mitigated through early detection. Conventional screening methods are often subjective, difficult to scale, and reliant on specialized clinical expertise. Video-based gait analysis offers a promising alternative, but current datasets and methods frequently suffer from data leakage, where performance is inflated by repeated clips from the same individual, or employ oversimplified models that lack clinical interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce ScoliGait, a new benchmark dataset comprising 1,572 gait video clips for training and 300 fully independent clips for testing. Each clip is annotated with radiographic Cobb angles and descriptive text based on clinical kinematic priors. We propose a multi-modal framework that integrates a clinical-prior-guided kinematic knowledge map for interpretable feature representation, alongside a latent attention pooling mechanism to fuse video, text, and knowledge map modalities. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, demonstrating a significant performance gap on a realistic, non-repeating subject benchmark. Our approach establishes a new state of the art, showing a significant performance gain on a realistic, subject-independent benchmark. This work provides a robust, interpretable, and clinically grounded foundation for scalable, non-invasive AIS assessment.

TL;DR: A framework using generative representations from Sentinel-2 imagery improves gold-bearing region identification, boosting accuracy with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High cost and limited on-site data drive the need for efficient, scalable satellite-based mineral exploration.

Method: Uses a pretrained autoencoder (Isometric) for spectral-spatial representations, fed into an XGBoost classifier, compared to raw spectral input.

Result: Patch-level accuracy rose from 0.51 to 0.68; image-level from 0.55 to 0.73, showing transferable mineral patterns.

Conclusion: Foundation-model representations enhance mineral exploration scalability and efficiency globally.

Abstract: Satellite imagery is employed for large-scale prospectivity mapping due to the high cost and typically limited availability of on-site mineral exploration data. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept framework that leverages generative representations learned from multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery to identify gold-bearing regions from space. An autoencoder foundation model, called Isometric, which is pretrained on the large-scale FalconSpace-S2 v1.0 dataset, produces information-dense spectral-spatial representations that serve as inputs to a lightweight XGBoost classifier. We compare this representation-based approach with a raw spectral input baseline using a dataset of 63 Sentinel-2 images from known gold and non-gold locations. The proposed method improves patch-level accuracy from 0.51 to 0.68 and image-level accuracy from 0.55 to 0.73, demonstrating that generative embeddings capture transferable mineralogical patterns even with limited labeled data. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model representations to make mineral exploration more efficient, scalable, and globally applicable.

### [60] [Revisiting Emotions Representation for Recognition in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06778)
*Joao Baptista Cardia Neto,Claudio Ferrari,Stefano Berretti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to describe complex emotional states as probability distributions over emotion classes by re-labeling existing datasets using Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) space mappings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-label emotion classification oversimplifies emotional states, which are often multifaceted combinations of emotions. The paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: The approach involves automatically re-labeling datasets by mapping VAD values to probability distributions of emotions, enabling descriptions of emotional states as mixtures.

Result: Preliminary experiments demonstrate the benefits of this method, offering a richer and more nuanced description of emotional states.

Conclusion: The proposed solution opens a new direction for emotion recognition research by accounting for the ambiguous and multifaceted nature of emotions.

Abstract: Facial emotion recognition has been typically cast as a single-label classification problem of one out of six prototypical emotions. However, that is an oversimplification that is unsuitable for representing the multifaceted spectrum of spontaneous emotional states, which are most often the result of a combination of multiple emotions contributing at different intensities. Building on this, a promising direction that was explored recently is to cast emotion recognition as a distribution learning problem. Still, such approaches are limited in that research datasets are typically annotated with a single emotion class. In this paper, we contribute a novel approach to describe complex emotional states as probability distributions over a set of emotion classes. To do so, we propose a solution to automatically re-label existing datasets by exploiting the result of a study in which a large set of both basic and compound emotions is mapped to probability distributions in the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) space. In this way, given a face image annotated with VAD values, we can estimate the likelihood of it belonging to each of the distributions, so that emotional states can be described as a mixture of emotions, enriching their description, while also accounting for the ambiguous nature of their perception. In a preliminary set of experiments, we illustrate the advantages of this solution and a new possible direction of investigation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computer vision-based method to automate the assessment of sweetpotato weevil damage, improving accuracy and efficiency over traditional manual scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual methods for assessing sweetpotato weevil damage are labor-intensive and inconsistent, hindering breeding programs.

Method: A computer vision approach using classification models for field damage severity (71.43% accuracy) and YOLO12-based object detection for laboratory settings (77.7% mAP).

Result: The automated system achieved 71.43% test accuracy in field settings and 77.7% mAP in detecting small feeding holes.

Conclusion: Computer vision offers efficient, scalable, and objective tools for sweetpotato breeding, enhancing phenotyping efficiency and food security.

Abstract: Sweetpotato weevils (Cylas spp.) are considered among the most destructive pests impacting sweetpotato production, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Traditional methods for assessing weevil damage, predominantly relying on manual scoring, are labour-intensive, subjective, and often yield inconsistent results. These challenges significantly hinder breeding programs aimed at developing resilient sweetpotato varieties. This study introduces a computer vision-based approach for the automated evaluation of weevil damage in both field and laboratory contexts. In the field settings, we collected data to train classification models to predict root-damage severity levels, achieving a test accuracy of 71.43%. Additionally, we established a laboratory dataset and designed an object detection pipeline employing YOLO12, a leading real-time detection model. This methodology incorporated a two-stage laboratory pipeline that combined root segmentation with a tiling strategy to improve the detectability of small objects. The resulting model demonstrated a mean average precision of 77.7% in identifying minute weevil feeding holes. Our findings indicate that computer vision technologies can provide efficient, objective, and scalable assessment tools that align seamlessly with contemporary breeding workflows. These advancements represent a significant improvement in enhancing phenotyping efficiency within sweetpotato breeding programs and play a crucial role in mitigating the detrimental effects of weevils on food security.

*Silpa Vadakkeeveetil Sreelatha,Dan Wang,Serge Belongie,Muhammad Awais,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAIGen is a framework for unsupervised rare-attribute discovery in diffusion models, addressing biases in predefined fairness categories by identifying underrepresented attributes using sparse autoencoders and a novel minority metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover rare or minority attributes underrepresented in the training data of diffusion models, which are overlooked by existing closed-set and open-set approaches.

Method: RAIGen uses Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders and a novel minority metric combining neuron activation frequency with semantic distinctiveness to identify interpretable neurons.

Result: RAIGen successfully discovers underrepresented attributes beyond fixed fairness categories in models like Stable Diffusion and SDXL, enabling targeted amplification of these attributes during generation.

Conclusion: RAIGen provides a scalable and systematic approach to auditing and mitigating biases in diffusion models by focusing on rare attributes encoded in model representations.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but inherit and amplify training-data biases, skewing coverage of semantic attributes. Prior work addresses this in two ways. Closed-set approaches mitigate biases in predefined fairness categories (e.g., gender, race), assuming socially salient minority attributes are known a priori. Open-set approaches frame the task as bias identification, highlighting majority attributes that dominate outputs. Both overlook a complementary task: uncovering rare or minority features underrepresented in the data distribution (social, cultural, or stylistic) yet still encoded in model representations. We introduce RAIGen, the first framework, to our knowledge, for un-supervised rare-attribute discovery in diffusion models. RAIGen leverages Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders and a novel minority metric combining neuron activation frequency with semantic distinctiveness to identify interpretable neurons whose top-activating images reveal underrepresented attributes. Experiments show RAIGen discovers attributes beyond fixed fairness categories in Stable Diffusion, scales to larger models such as SDXL, supports systematic auditing across architectures, and enables targeted amplification of rare attributes during generation.

*Soonbin Lee,Yeong-Gyu Kim,Simon Sasse,Tomas M. Borges,Yago Sanchez,Eun-Seok Ryu,Thomas Schierl,Cornelius Hellge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaussianPOP introduces a principled simplification framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting, using analytical error quantification to achieve better trade-offs between compactness and rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on inadequate importance scores not tied to visual error metrics, leading to suboptimal results. GaussianPOP aims to address this gap.

Method: The framework uses a novel error criterion derived from the 3DGS rendering equation, enabling efficient error calculation in a single forward pass. It supports on-training pruning and post-training simplification.

Result: GaussianPOP outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior compactness and rendering quality in both application scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers an accurate and flexible solution for simplifying 3D Gaussian Splatting, improving rendering fidelity and model compactness.

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting simplification methods commonly use importance scores, such as blending weights or sensitivity, to identify redundant Gaussians. However, these scores are not driven by visual error metrics, often leading to suboptimal trade-offs between compactness and rendering fidelity. We present GaussianPOP, a principled simplification framework based on analytical Gaussian error quantification. Our key contribution is a novel error criterion, derived directly from the 3DGS rendering equation, that precisely measures each Gaussian's contribution to the rendered image. By introducing a highly efficient algorithm, our framework enables practical error calculation in a single forward pass. The framework is both accurate and flexible, supporting on-training pruning as well as post-training simplification via iterative error re-quantification for improved stability. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art pruning methods across both application scenarios, achieving a superior trade-off between model compactness and high rendering quality.

*Chao Zhou,Tianyi Wei,Yiling Chen,Wenbo Zhou,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Position-aligned and Keyword-scoped Attention (PKA) to improve efficiency and control in Diffusion Transformers for multi-condition text-to-image generation, achieving significant speedup and resource savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern text-to-image models lack fine-grained control for specific user requirements, and conventional methods suffer from computational inefficiency due to redundant cross-modal interactions.

Method: Introduces PKA with Position-Aligned Attention (PAA) for spatial control and Keyword-Scoped Attention (KSA) for semantic filtering, along with Conditional Sensitivity-Aware Sampling (CSAS) for efficient training.

Result: PKA achieves a 10.0× inference speedup and 5.1× VRAM saving, demonstrating scalability and high-fidelity multi-conditioned generation.

Conclusion: PKA provides a scalable and resource-efficient solution for enhancing control and performance in diffusion-based text-to-image generation.

Abstract: While modern text-to-image models excel at prompt-based generation, they often lack the fine-grained control necessary for specific user requirements like spatial layouts or subject appearances. Multi-condition control addresses this, yet its integration into Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by the conventional ``concatenate-and-attend'' strategy, which suffers from quadratic computational and memory overhead as the number of conditions scales. Our analysis reveals that much of this cross-modal interaction is spatially or semantically redundant. To this end, we propose Position-aligned and Keyword-scoped Attention (PKA), a highly efficient framework designed to eliminate these redundancies. Specifically, Position-Aligned Attention (PAA) linearizes spatial control by enforcing localized patch alignment, while Keyword-Scoped Attention (KSA) prunes irrelevant subject-driven interactions via semantic-aware masking. To facilitate efficient learning, we further introduce a Conditional Sensitivity-Aware Sampling (CSAS) strategy that reweights the training objective towards critical denoising phases, drastically accelerating convergence and enhancing conditional fidelity. Empirically, PKA delivers a 10.0$\times$ inference speedup and a 5.1$\times$ VRAM saving, providing a scalable and resource-friendly solution for high-fidelity multi-conditioned generation.

*Meng Lou,Stanley Yu,Yizhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaRoute is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method using a mixture-of-experts architecture for dense prediction tasks, addressing limitations of existing methods by dynamic parameter routing and shared expert centers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods struggle with input-agnostic modeling and redundant cross-layer representations in dense prediction tasks, prompting the need for a more efficient and effective solution.

Method: AdaRoute introduces shared expert centers with dynamic parameter routing, generating input-dependent weight matrices for customized feature representations and promoting cross-layer interaction.

Result: AdaRoute outperforms existing methods on tasks like semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation.

Conclusion: AdaRoute offers a superior PEFT approach for dense prediction tasks by leveraging dynamic routing and shared expert centers, enhancing performance and feature diversity.

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained vision models using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) remains challenging, as it aims to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning using a minimal number of trainable parameters. When applied to complex dense prediction tasks, existing methods exhibit limitations, including input-agnostic modeling and redundant cross-layer representations. To this end, we propose AdaRoute, a new adapter-style method featuring a simple mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. Specifically, we introduce shared expert centers, where each expert is a trainable parameter matrix. During a feedforward pass, each AdaRoute module in the network dynamically generates weight matrices tailored for the current module via a simple dynamic parameter routing mechanism, which selectively aggregates parameter matrices in the corresponding expert center. Dynamic weight matrices in AdaRoute modules facilitate low-rank adaptation in an input-dependent manner, thus generating more customized and powerful feature representations. Moreover, since AdaRoute modules across multiple network layers share the same expert center, they improve feature diversity by promoting implicit cross-layer feature interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of AdaRoute on diverse vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RFDM introduces a causal, efficient video editing model using Residual Flow Diffusion for variable-length videos, outperforming I2I methods and competing with 3D V2V models while maintaining low compute costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable intuitive natural-language control for video editing with variable-length inputs and reduce computational demands.

Method: Adapts a 2D diffusion model to V2V editing by conditioning edits on previous predictions and introducing Residual Flow Diffusion to focus on frame changes.

Result: RFDM surpasses I2I-based methods and competes with 3D V2V models, achieving scalability independent of input length.

Conclusion: RFDM provides an efficient, scalable solution for instructional video editing, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Instructional video editing applies edits to an input video using only text prompts, enabling intuitive natural-language control. Despite rapid progress, most methods still require fixed-length inputs and substantial compute. Meanwhile, autoregressive video generation enables efficient variable-length synthesis, yet remains under-explored for video editing. We introduce a causal, efficient video editing model that edits variable-length videos frame by frame. For efficiency, we start from a 2D image-to-image (I2I) diffusion model and adapt it to video-to-video (V2V) editing by conditioning the edit at time step t on the model's prediction at t-1. To leverage videos' temporal redundancy, we propose a new I2I diffusion forward process formulation that encourages the model to predict the residual between the target output and the previous prediction. We call this Residual Flow Diffusion Model (RFDM), which focuses the denoising process on changes between consecutive frames. Moreover, we propose a new benchmark that better ranks state-of-the-art methods for editing tasks. Trained on paired video data for global/local style transfer and object removal, RFDM surpasses I2I-based methods and competes with fully spatiotemporal (3D) V2V models, while matching the compute of image models and scaling independently of input video length.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between large-scale text-to-image models and on-device solutions.

Method: Uses progressive compression, pruning redundant components, ResNet-based token downsampling, and text encoder distillation.

Result: Generates 512x512 images in ~2.5 seconds on mobile devices.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of high-quality on-device text-to-image generation.

Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models continue to improve in visual quality, their increasing scale has widened the gap between state-of-the-art models and on-device solutions. To address this gap, we introduce NanoFLUX, a 2.4B text-to-image flow-matching model distilled from 17B FLUX.1-Schnell using a progressive compression pipeline designed to preserve generation quality. Our contributions include: (1) A model compression strategy driven by pruning redundant components in the diffusion transformer, reducing its size from 12B to 2B; (2) A ResNet-based token downsampling mechanism that reduces latency by allowing intermediate blocks to operate on lower-resolution tokens while preserving high-resolution processing elsewhere; (3) A novel text encoder distillation approach that leverages visual signals from early layers of the denoiser during sampling. Empirically, NanoFLUX generates 512 x 512 images in approximately 2.5 seconds on mobile devices, demonstrating the feasibility of high-quality on-device text-to-image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies prompt forgetting in Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiTs) for text-to-image generation and proposes prompt reinjection to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt forgetting occurs as the semantics of the prompt representation degrade with increasing depth in the text branch of MMDiTs.

Method: Introduces prompt reinjection, a training-free technique that reinjects early-layer prompt representations into later layers.

Result: Experiments show improved instruction-following, preference, aesthetics, and overall text-to-image generation quality.

Conclusion: Prompt reinjection effectively addresses prompt forgetting and enhances MMDiT performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiTs) for text-to-image generation maintain separate text and image branches, with bidirectional information flow between text tokens and visual latents throughout denoising. In this setting, we observe a prompt forgetting phenomenon: the semantics of the prompt representation in the text branch is progressively forgotten as depth increases. We further verify this effect on three representative MMDiTs--SD3, SD3.5, and FLUX.1 by probing linguistic attributes of the representations over the layers in the text branch. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a training-free approach, prompt reinjection, which reinjects prompt representations from early layers into later layers to alleviate this forgetting. Experiments on GenEval, DPG, and T2I-CompBench++ show consistent gains in instruction-following capability, along with improvements on metrics capturing preference, aesthetics, and overall text--image generation quality.

*Juan Gutiérrez,Victor Gutiérrez-Garcia,José Luis Blanco-Murillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANC introduces a weakly supervised spectral segmentation framework using minimal annotated tokens to enhance stability, control, and reproducibility in object masking, outperforming current methods on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised segmentation methods are non-deterministic and sensitive to initialization, prompting the need for a more stable and controllable approach.

Method: PANC augments the token-token affinity graph with priors and anchor nodes, manipulating the graph topology to bias spectral eigenspace toward consistent partitions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 5-30 annotations per dataset, notably improving mIoU on CrackForest, CUB-200-2011, and HAM10000.

Conclusion: PANC offers reliable segmentation in domains with costly labels or subtle intra-class differences, enabling user-controllable semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Fully unsupervised segmentation pipelines naively seek the most salient object, should this be present. As a result, most of the methods reported in the literature deliver non-deterministic partitions that are sensitive to initialization, seed order, and threshold heuristics.
  We propose PANC, a weakly supervised spectral segmentation framework that uses a minimal set of annotated visual tokens to produce stable, controllable, and reproducible object masks. From the TokenCut approach, we augment the token-token affinity graph with a handful of priors coupled to anchor nodes. By manipulating the graph topology, we bias the spectral eigenspace toward partitions that are consistent with the annotations. Our approach preserves the global grouping enforced by dense self-supervised visual features, trading annotated tokens for significant gains in reproducibility, user control, and segmentation quality.
  Using 5 to 30 annotations per dataset, our training-free method achieves state-of-the-art performance among weakly and unsupervised approaches on standard benchmarks (e.g., DUTS-TE, ECSSD, MS COCO). Contrarily, it excels in domains where dense labels are costly or intra-class differences are subtle. We report strong and reliable results on homogeneous, fine-grained, and texture-limited domains, achieving 96.8% (+14.43% over SotA), 78.0% (+0.2%), and 78.8% (+0.37%) average mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) on CrackForest (CFD), CUB-200-2011, and HAM10000 datasets, respectively. For multi-object benchmarks, the framework showcases explicit, user-controllable semantic segmentation.

*Darryl Hannan,John Cooper,Dylan White,Yijing Watkins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) lag in fine-grained visual tasks, possibly due to visual redundancy. This study uses a synthetic benchmark to explore how VLLMs process visual information, finding a link between task complexity and visual compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why VLLMs struggle with fine-grained visual tasks and how visual redundancy affects their performance.

Method: Introduce a synthetic benchmark dataset to probe visual features and metrics for redundancy. Fine-tune VLLMs on complex visual tasks to study redundancy and compression.

Result: Task complexity affects visual compression; high-complexity data improves VLLMs' visual representation and performance.

Conclusion: Balancing high-complexity visual data is key for enhancing VLLMs' visual capabilities.

Abstract: Vision capabilities in vision large language models (VLLMs) have consistently lagged behind their linguistic capabilities. In particular, numerous benchmark studies have demonstrated that VLLMs struggle when fine-grained visual information or spatial reasoning is required. However, we do not yet understand exactly why VLLMs struggle so much with these tasks relative to others. Some works have focused on visual redundancy as an explanation, where high-level visual information is uniformly spread across numerous tokens and specific, fine-grained visual information is discarded. In this work, we investigate this premise in greater detail, seeking to better understand exactly how various types of visual information are processed by the model and what types of visual information are discarded. To do so, we introduce a simple synthetic benchmark dataset that is specifically constructed to probe various visual features, along with a set of metrics for measuring visual redundancy, allowing us to better understand the nuances of their relationship. Then, we explore fine-tuning VLLMs on a number of complex visual tasks to better understand how redundancy and compression change based upon the complexity of the data that a model is trained on. We find that there is a connection between task complexity and visual compression, implying that having a sufficient ratio of high complexity visual data is crucial for altering the way that VLLMs distribute their visual representation and consequently improving their performance on complex visual tasks. We hope that this work will provide valuable insights for training the next generation of VLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for detecting mislabeled data in medical datasets improves anomaly detection performance after correcting labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large, accurately annotated medical datasets are hard to obtain due to limited expert annotators and ambiguous class boundaries.

Method: Introduced a framework for mislabel detection, validated on Video Capsule Endoscopy datasets, with re-annotation by gastroenterologists.

Result: The framework successfully identified mislabeled data and improved anomaly detection performance post-cleaning.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses mislabeling issues in medical datasets, enhancing classification accuracy.

Abstract: The classification performance of deep neural networks relies strongly on access to large, accurately annotated datasets. In medical imaging, however, obtaining such datasets is particularly challenging since annotations must be provided by specialized physicians, which severely limits the pool of annotators. Furthermore, class boundaries can often be ambiguous or difficult to define which further complicates machine learning-based classification. In this paper, we want to address this problem and introduce a framework for mislabel detection in medical datasets. This is validated on the two largest, publicly available datasets for Video Capsule Endoscopy, an important imaging procedure for examining the gastrointestinal tract based on a video stream of lowresolution images. In addition, potentially mislabeled samples identified by our pipeline were reviewed and re-annotated by three experienced gastroenterologists. Our results show that the proposed framework successfully detects incorrectly labeled data and results in an improved anomaly detection performance after cleaning the datasets compared to current baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CineScene, a framework for generating cinematic videos with dynamic subjects in static environments using implicit 3D-aware scene representations, achieving high performance and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the cost of live-action shooting by enabling cinematic video generation with dynamic subjects and controlled camera movements in static scenes.

Method: CineScene uses VGGT to encode scene images into visual representations, injects 3D-aware features into a pretrained text-to-video model, and employs random-shuffling during training. A dataset was created with Unreal Engine 5 for training.

Result: CineScene demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, handling large camera movements and generalizing across diverse environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively synthesizes cinematic videos with dynamic subjects and controlled camera trajectories, offering a practical solution for cost-efficient production.

Abstract: Cinematic video production requires control over scene-subject composition and camera movement, but live-action shooting remains costly due to the need for constructing physical sets. To address this, we introduce the task of cinematic video generation with decoupled scene context: given multiple images of a static environment, the goal is to synthesize high-quality videos featuring dynamic subject while preserving the underlying scene consistency and following a user-specified camera trajectory. We present CineScene, a framework that leverages implicit 3D-aware scene representation for cinematic video generation. Our key innovation is a novel context conditioning mechanism that injects 3D-aware features in an implicit way: By encoding scene images into visual representations through VGGT, CineScene injects spatial priors into a pretrained text-to-video generation model by additional context concatenation, enabling camera-controlled video synthesis with consistent scenes and dynamic subjects. To further enhance the model's robustness, we introduce a simple yet effective random-shuffling strategy for the input scene images during training. To address the lack of training data, we construct a scene-decoupled dataset with Unreal Engine 5, containing paired videos of scenes with and without dynamic subjects, panoramic images representing the underlying static scene, along with their camera trajectories. Experiments show that CineScene achieves state-of-the-art performance in scene-consistent cinematic video generation, handling large camera movements and demonstrating generalization across diverse environments.

TL;DR: MedMO is a medical foundation model based on MLLMs, trained on domain-specific data for multimodal tasks in medicine, outperforming baselines and SOTA models in accuracy and spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adoption of MLLMs in medicine is limited by gaps in domain coverage, modality alignment, and grounded reasoning, motivating the development of MedMO.

Method: MedMO uses a multi-stage training approach: cross-modal pretraining, instruction tuning on multi-task supervision, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Result: MedMO outperforms baselines and SOTA models in VQA (+13.7%), text-based QA (+6.9%), and spatial reasoning (+40.4 IoU improvement).

Conclusion: MedMO demonstrates strong performance across multiple medical modalities and tasks, confirming its broad generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced, yet their adoption in medicine remains limited by gaps in domain coverage, modality alignment, and grounded reasoning. In this work, we introduce MedMO, a medical foundation model built upon a generalized MLLM architecture and trained exclusively on large-scale, domain-specific data. MedMO follows a multi-stage training recipe: (i) cross-modal pretraining to align heterogeneous visual encoders with a medical language backbone; (ii) instruction tuning on multi-task supervision that spans captioning, VQA, report generation, retrieval, and grounded disease localization with bounding boxes; and (iii) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards that combine factuality checks with a box-level GIoU reward to strengthen spatial grounding and step-by-step reasoning in complex clinical scenarios. MedMO consistently outperforms strong open-source medical MLLMs across multiple modalities and tasks. On VQA benchmarks, MedMO achieves an average accuracy improvement of +13.7% over the baseline and performs within 1.9% of the SOTA Fleming-VL. For text-based QA, it attains +6.9% over the baseline and +14.5% over Fleming-VL. In medical report generation, MedMO delivers significant gains in both semantic and clinical accuracy. Moreover, it exhibits strong grounding capability, achieving an IoU improvement of +40.4 over the baseline and +37.0% over Fleming-VL, underscoring its robust spatial reasoning and localization performance. Evaluations across radiology, ophthalmology, and pathology-microscopy confirm MedMO's broad cross-modality generalization. We release two versions of MedMO: 4B and 8B.

Motivation: Addressing the issue of advertising fatigue and the lack of brand persona in machine-generated slogans, the study aims to create more effective and human-preferred slogans.

Method: A modular framework decomposes slogan generation into interpretable subtasks like quote matching, structural decomposition, vocabulary replacement, and remix generation.

Result: The approach shows marginal improvements in diversity, novelty, emotional impact, and human preference over three state-of-the-art LLM baselines.

Conclusion: Recontextualizing famous quotes for slogan generation balances novelty with familiarity, offering a promising direction for creative advertising.

Abstract: Slogans are concise and memorable catchphrases that play a crucial role in advertising by conveying brand identity and shaping public perception. However, advertising fatigue reduces the effectiveness of repeated slogans, creating a growing demand for novel, creative, and insightful slogan generation. While recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) for this task, existing approaches often produce stylistically redundant outputs that lack a clear brand persona and appear overtly machine-generated. We argue that effective slogans should balance novelty with familiarity and propose a new paradigm that recontextualizes persona-related famous quotes for slogan generation. Well-known quotes naturally align with slogan-length text, employ rich rhetorical devices, and offer depth and insight, making them a powerful resource for creative generation. Technically, we introduce a modular framework that decomposes slogan generation into interpretable subtasks, including quote matching, structural decomposition, vocabulary replacement, and remix generation. Extensive automatic and human evaluations demonstrate marginal improvements in diversity, novelty, emotional impact, and human preference over three state-of-the-art LLM baselines.

*Jongha Kim,Byungoh Ko,Jeehye Na,Jinsung Yoon,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RMCD is a new decoding method for RAG that improves LVLMs by effectively leveraging multiple contexts and mitigating irrelevant ones, achieving superior performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG decoding methods inadequately use multiple relevant contexts and struggle with irrelevant ones, limiting LVLM performance.

Method: Proposes RMCD, which combines outputs weighted by context relevance to aggregate useful information and counteract irrelevant contexts.

Result: RMCD outperforms other methods across benchmarks and LVLMs, requires no extra training, and is robust to retrieval quality.

Conclusion: RMCD enhances RAG-decoding by leveraging context relevance, offering a simple yet effective solution for LVLMs.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), they still lack detailed knowledge about specific entities. Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted solution that enhances LVLMs by providing additional contexts from an external Knowledge Base. However, we observe that previous decoding methods for RAG are sub-optimal as they fail to sufficiently leverage multiple relevant contexts and suppress the negative effects of irrelevant contexts. To this end, we propose Relevance-aware Multi-context Contrastive Decoding (RMCD), a novel decoding method for RAG. RMCD outputs a final prediction by combining outputs predicted with each context, where each output is weighted based on its relevance to the question. By doing so, RMCD effectively aggregates useful information from multiple relevant contexts while also counteracting the negative effects of irrelevant ones. Experiments show that RMCD consistently outperforms other decoding methods across multiple LVLMs, achieving the best performance on three knowledge-intensive visual question-answering benchmarks. Also, RMCD can be simply applied by replacing the decoding method of LVLMs without additional training. Analyses also show that RMCD is robust to the retrieval results, consistently performing the best across the weakest to the strongest retrieval results.

*Kexin Ma,Bojun Li,Yuhua Tang,Ruochun Jin,Liting Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAST improves episodic memory representation by combining 3D scenes and character profiles with graph-based semantic memory, outperforming baselines in conversational tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent memory systems focus on semantic recall and struggle with coherent episodic memory representation, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: CAST uses dramatic theory to build 3D scenes (time/place/topic) and character profiles, complemented by graph-based semantic memory.

Result: CAST improves F1 by 8.11% and LLM-as-a-Judge by 10.21%, excelling in open and time-sensitive conversational questions.

Conclusion: CAST’s dual memory design effectively enhances episodic memory representation and retrieval, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Episodic memory is a central component of human memory, which refers to the ability to recall coherent events grounded in who, when, and where. However, most agent memory systems only emphasize semantic recall and treat experience as structures such as key-value, vector, or graph, which makes them struggle to represent and retrieve coherent events. To address this challenge, we propose a Character-and-Scene based memory architecture(CAST) inspired by dramatic theory. Specifically, CAST constructs 3D scenes (time/place/topic) and organizes them into character profiles that summarize the events of a character to represent episodic memory. Moreover, CAST complements this episodic memory with a graph-based semantic memory, which yields a robust dual memory design. Experiments demonstrate that CAST has averagely improved 8.11% F1 and 10.21% J(LLM-as-a-Judge) than baselines on various datasets, especially on open and time-sensitive conversational questions.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the shift in AI research towards problem definition and real-world utility, highlighting memory as a key solution for long-horizon, dynamic environments. It surveys memory in agents across dimensions like substrate, cognitive mechanisms, and subjects, and reviews evaluation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the utility gap in AI by focusing on memory systems, which are critical for agents operating in complex, dynamic environments with extensive interactions.

Method: The survey provides a unified view of agent memory across three dimensions: memory substrate (internal/external), cognitive mechanism (episodic, semantic, sensory, working, procedural), and memory subject (agent-/user-centric). It also examines memory instantiation, operation under different agent topologies, and learning policies.

Result: The paper reviews benchmarks and metrics for evaluating memory utility, emphasizing its role in enhancing agent performance.

Conclusion: Memory is pivotal for bridging the AI utility gap. The paper outlines open challenges and future directions for memory research in AI.

Abstract: The research of artificial intelligence is undergoing a paradigm shift from prioritizing model innovations over benchmark scores towards emphasizing problem definition and rigorous real-world evaluation. As the field enters the "second half," the central challenge becomes real utility in long-horizon, dynamic, and user-dependent environments, where agents face context explosion and must continuously accumulate, manage, and selectively reuse large volumes of information across extended interactions. Memory, with hundreds of papers released this year, therefore emerges as the critical solution to fill the utility gap. In this survey, we provide a unified view of foundation agent memory along three dimensions: memory substrate (internal and external), cognitive mechanism (episodic, semantic, sensory, working, and procedural), and memory subject (agent- and user-centric). We then analyze how memory is instantiated and operated under different agent topologies and highlight learning policies over memory operations. Finally, we review evaluation benchmarks and metrics for assessing memory utility, and outline various open challenges and future directions.

TL;DR: PersonaPlex introduces a duplex conversational speech model combining role conditioning and voice cloning, outperforming existing models in role adherence, speaker similarity, and naturalness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing duplex speech models are limited by fixed roles and voices, restricting their use in structured applications and personalized interactions.

Method: PersonaPlex uses hybrid system prompts (role conditioning + text prompts) and voice cloning with speech samples, trained on synthetic data from LLMs and TTS models.

Result: PersonaPlex excels in role-conditioned behavior, voice similarity, and conversational responsiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: PersonaPlex advances duplex speech models by enabling dynamic role and voice adaptation, enhancing real-world usability.

Abstract: Recent advances in duplex speech models have enabled natural, low-latency speech-to-speech interactions. However, existing models are restricted to a fixed role and voice, limiting their ability to support structured, role-driven real-world applications and personalized interactions. In this work, we introduce PersonaPlex, a duplex conversational speech model that incorporates hybrid system prompts, combining role conditioning with text prompts and voice cloning with speech samples. PersonaPlex is trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset of paired prompts and user-agent conversations, generated with open-source large language models (LLM) and text-to-speech (TTS) models. To evaluate role conditioning in real-world settings, we extend the Full-Duplex-Bench benchmark beyond a single assistant role to multi-role customer service scenarios. Experiments show that PersonaPlex achieves strong role-conditioned behavior, voice-conditioned speech, and natural conversational responsiveness, surpassing state-of-the-art duplex speech models and hybrid large language model-based speech systems in role adherence, speaker similarity, latency, and naturalness.

*Abeer Mostafa,Thi Huyen Nguyen,Zahra Ahmadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for assessing research novelty using AI, trained on peer-review data to align with human judgments and improve consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current novelty assessment in peer review is subjective and implicit; this work aims to provide structured, data-driven evaluations.

Method: Fine-tune a language model on novelty-annotated reviews, extract structured manuscript representations, retrieve related papers, and construct similarity graphs for concept-level comparisons.

Result: The system produces calibrated novelty scores and human-like explanations, reducing overestimation and improving consistency.

Conclusion: The framework enhances novelty assessment by grounding judgments in structured comparisons and aligning with human reviewer behavior.

Abstract: Assessing research novelty is a core yet highly subjective aspect of peer review, typically based on implicit judgment and incomplete comparison to prior work. We introduce a literature-aware novelty assessment framework that explicitly learns how humans judge novelty from peer-review reports and grounds these judgments in structured comparison to existing research. Using nearly 80K novelty-annotated reviews from top-tier AI conferences, we fine-tune a large language model to capture reviewer-aligned novelty evaluation behavior. For a given manuscript, the system extracts structured representations of its ideas, methods, and claims, retrieves semantically related papers, and constructs a similarity graph that enables fine-grained, concept-level comparison to prior work. Conditioning on this structured evidence, the model produces calibrated novelty scores and human-like explanatory assessments, reducing overestimation and improving consistency relative to existing approaches.

### [81] [Quantifying and Attributing Polarization to Annotator Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06055)
*Dimitris Tsirmpas,John Pavlopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new metric for analyzing annotation polarization across sociodemographic groups, addressing limitations of current agreement metrics in subjective tasks like hate speech and toxicity detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing annotation agreement metrics fail to handle inter-group analysis, group size imbalances, and multi-label settings, making them inadequate for subjective tasks.

Method: Introduces a quantifiable metric paired with a statistical test to attribute polarization to annotator groups, enabling comparisons across imbalanced subgroups and multi-label tasks.

Result: Polarization is strongly linked to annotator race in hate speech tasks. Religious annotators disagree with others, while less educated annotators show more subjectivity. The metric is applied to hate speech and toxicity datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed metric provides robust inter-group analysis, revealing persistent sociodemographic polarization. The work includes a Python library for implementation and estimates the minimum annotators needed for reliable results.

Abstract: Current annotation agreement metrics are not well-suited for inter-group analysis, are sensitive to group size imbalances and restricted to single-annotation settings. These restrictions render them insufficient for many subjective tasks such as toxicity and hate-speech detection. For this reason, we introduce a quantifiable metric, paired with a statistical significance test, that attributes polarization to various annotator groups. Our metric enables direct comparisons between heavily imbalanced sociodemographic and ideological subgroups across different datasets and tasks, while also enabling analysis on multi-label settings. We apply this metric to three datasets on hate speech, and one on toxicity detection, discovering that: (1) Polarization is strongly and persistently attributed to annotator race, especially on the hate speech task. (2) Religious annotators do not fundamentally disagree with each other, but do with other annotators, a trend that is gradually diminished and then reversed with irreligious annotators. (3) Less educated annotators are more subjective, while educated ones tend to broadly agree more between themselves. Overall, our results reflect current findings around annotation patterns for various subgroups. Finally, we estimate the minimum number of annotators needed to obtain robust results, and provide an open-source Python library that implements our metric.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COVER improves parallel diffusion decoding by reducing flip-flop oscillations and unnecessary revisions, speeding up inference while maintaining output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing revocable decoding schemes suffer from flip-flop oscillations, slowing inference and wasting revision budgets.

Method: COVER uses leave-one-out verification and stable drafting via KV cache override, with a stability-aware seed prioritization and adaptive verification.

Result: COVER reduces unnecessary revisions and accelerates decoding without compromising quality across benchmarks.

Conclusion: COVER effectively addresses inefficiencies in parallel diffusion decoding, enhancing both speed and stability.

Abstract: Parallel diffusion decoding can accelerate diffusion language model inference by unmasking multiple tokens per step, but aggressive parallelism often harms quality. Revocable decoding mitigates this by rechecking earlier tokens, yet we observe that existing verification schemes frequently trigger flip-flop oscillations, where tokens are remasked and later restored unchanged. This behaviour slows inference in two ways: remasking verified positions weakens the conditioning context for parallel drafting, and repeated remask cycles consume the revision budget with little net progress. We propose COVER (Cache Override Verification for Efficient Revision), which performs leave-one-out verification and stable drafting within a single forward pass. COVER constructs two attention views via KV cache override: selected seeds are masked for verification, while their cached key value states are injected for all other queries to preserve contextual information, with a closed form diagonal correction preventing self leakage at the seed positions. COVER further prioritises seeds using a stability aware score that balances uncertainty, downstream influence, and cache drift, and it adapts the number of verified seeds per step. Across benchmarks, COVER markedly reduces unnecessary revisions and yields faster decoding while preserving output quality.

### [83] [Uncertainty Drives Social Bias Changes in Quantized Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06181)
*Stanley Z. Hua,Sanae Lotfi,Irene Y. Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Post-training quantization alters social biases in language models, with up to 21% of responses flipping between biased/unbiased states. Quantization strength and model uncertainty drive these changes, leading to asymmetric impacts across demographic groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how post-training quantization affects social biases in large language models, as aggregate metrics fail to capture nuanced changes.

Method: A large-scale study of 50 quantized models using PostTrainingBiasBench, evaluating 13 bias datasets to analyze quantization-induced masked bias flipping.

Result: Quantization causes significant bias flips (up to 21%) driven by uncertainty, with 4-bit models showing 4-6x more changes than 8-bit models. Bias impacts vary asymmetrically across groups (up to 18.6% worse or 14.1% better).

Conclusion: Compression fundamentally changes bias patterns, necessitating post-quantization evaluation and interventions for reliable model deployment.

Abstract: Post-training quantization reduces the computational cost of large language models but fundamentally alters their social biases in ways that aggregate metrics fail to capture. We present the first large-scale study of 50 quantized models evaluated on PostTrainingBiasBench, a unified benchmark of 13 closed- and open-ended bias datasets. We identify a phenomenon we term quantization-induced masked bias flipping, in which up to 21% of responses flip between biased and unbiased states after quantization, despite showing no change in aggregate bias scores. These flips are strongly driven by model uncertainty, where the responses with high uncertainty are 3-11x more likely to change than the confident ones. Quantization strength amplifies this effect, with 4-bit quantized models exhibiting 4-6x more behavioral changes than 8-bit quantized models. Critically, these changes create asymmetric impacts across demographic groups, where bias can worsen by up to 18.6% for some groups while improving by 14.1% for others, yielding misleadingly neutral aggregate outcomes. Larger models show no consistent robustness advantage, and group-specific shifts vary unpredictably across model families. Our findings demonstrate that compression fundamentally alters bias patterns, requiring crucial post-quantization evaluation and interventions to ensure reliability in practice.

TL;DR: BenchMarker is a toolkit using LLM judges to identify flaws in multiple-choice question benchmarks, revealing contamination inflates accuracy while writing errors lower it, and suggests education research can improve MCQA design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCQA benchmarks lack rigorous quality control, leading to flawed evaluations in NLP.

Method: BenchMarker uses LLM judges to flag three common MCQ flaws: contamination, shortcuts, and writing errors, validated with human annotations.

Result: Auditing 12 benchmarks showed contamination inflates accuracy, writing errors lower it, and prior repairs introduce new flaws.

Conclusion: MCQ flaws degrade NLP evaluation, but BenchMarker, inspired by education research, offers a solution for improving benchmark design.

Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is standard in NLP, but benchmarks lack rigorous quality control. We present BenchMarker, an education-inspired toolkit using LLM judges to flag three common MCQ flaws: 1) contamination - items appearing exactly online; 2) shortcuts - cues in the choices that enable guessing; and 3) writing errors - structural/grammatical issues based on a 19-rule education rubric. We validate BenchMarker with human annotations, then run the tool to audit 12 benchmarks, revealing: 2) contaminated MCQs tend to inflate accuracy, while writing errors tend to lower it and change rankings beyond random; and 3) prior benchmark repairs address their targeted issues (i.e., lowering accuracy with LLM-written distractors), but inadvertently add new flaws (i.e. implausible distractors, many correct answers). Overall, flaws in MCQs degrade NLP evaluation, but education research offers a path forward. We release BenchMarker to bridge the fields and improve MCQA benchmark design.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines if LLMs’ initial responses to polemic questions can be steered to a specific viewpoint by providing one-sided arguments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs can be influenced to adopt a specific stance on polemic issues through simple, one-sided argumentation.

Method: A systematic study across three dimensions: stance induction, question formulation, and argument presentation. A small dataset was constructed to test opinion steering.

Result: Opinion steering occurs consistently across diverse models, argument counts, and topics. Switching arguments reduces the effect.

Conclusion: LLMs can be steered to a specific viewpoint using one-sided arguments, but the effect diminishes when alternative arguments are introduced.

Abstract: Polemic questions need more than one viewpoint to express a balanced answer. Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide a balanced answer, but also take a single aligned viewpoint or refuse to answer. In this paper, we study if such initial responses can be steered to a specific viewpoint in a simple and intuitive way: by only providing one-sided arguments supporting the viewpoint. Our systematic study has three dimensions: (i) which stance is induced in the LLM response, (ii) how the polemic question is formulated, (iii) how the arguments are shown. We construct a small dataset and remarkably find that opinion steering occurs across (i)-(iii) for diverse models, number of arguments, and topics. Switching to other arguments consistently decreases opinion steering.

*Quoc Tuan Pham,Mehdi Jafari,Flora Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) as a non-textual method to analyze reasoning chains in large models, outperforming response length metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on text analysis or response length, which are impractical and unreliable for studying reasoning dynamics.

Method: Use RQA on hidden embeddings from token generation traces to quantify reasoning patterns like repetition and stalling.

Result: RQA improves task complexity prediction by 8% and captures signals missed by response length.

Conclusion: RQA is a principled tool for analyzing latent reasoning dynamics in large models.

Abstract: Test-time compute is central to large reasoning models, yet analysing their reasoning behaviour through generated text is increasingly impractical and unreliable. Response length is often used as a brute proxy for reasoning effort, but this metric fails to capture the dynamics and effectiveness of the Chain of Thoughts (CoT) or the generated tokens. We propose Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) as a non-textual alternative for analysing model's reasoning chains at test time. By treating token generation as a dynamical system, we extract hidden embeddings at each generation step and apply RQA to the resulting trajectories. RQA metrics, including Determinism and Laminarity, quantify patterns of repetition and stalling in the model's latent representations. Analysing 3,600 generation traces from DeepSeek-R1-Distill, we show that RQA captures signals not reflected by response length, but also substantially improves prediction of task complexity by 8\%. These results help establish RQA as a principled tool for studying the latent token generation dynamics of test-time scaling in reasoning models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MPIB, a benchmark for evaluating clinical safety against prompt injection attacks in LLMs and RAG systems, highlighting risks like CHER and ASR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks of clinically unsafe outputs from LLMs and RAG systems due to prompt injection attacks.

Method: Developed MPIB, a dataset with 9,697 instances, using multi-stage quality gates and clinical safety linting, focusing on CHER and ASR metrics.

Result: Found ASR and CHER can diverge, with robustness varying based on where adversarial instructions appear (user query or retrieved context).

Conclusion: MPIB supports systematic research on clinical prompt injection, with resources available on GitHub and Hugging Face.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly integrated into clinical workflows; however, prompt injection attacks can steer these systems toward clinically unsafe or misleading outputs. We introduce the Medical Prompt Injection Benchmark (MPIB), a dataset-and-benchmark suite for evaluating clinical safety under both direct prompt injection and indirect, RAG-mediated injection across clinically grounded tasks. MPIB emphasizes outcome-level risk via the Clinical Harm Event Rate (CHER), which measures high-severity clinical harm events under a clinically grounded taxonomy, and reports CHER alongside Attack Success Rate (ASR) to disentangle instruction compliance from downstream patient risk. The benchmark comprises 9,697 curated instances constructed through multi-stage quality gates and clinical safety linting. Evaluating MPIB across a diverse set of baseline LLMs and defense configurations, we find that ASR and CHER can diverge substantially, and that robustness depends critically on whether adversarial instructions appear in the user query or in retrieved context. We release MPIB with evaluation code, adversarial baselines, and comprehensive documentation to support reproducible and systematic research on clinical prompt injection. Code and data are available at GitHub (code) and Hugging Face (data).

TL;DR: VowelPrompt enhances LLM-based emotion recognition by integrating interpretable, fine-grained vowel-level prosodic cues, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs neglect fine-grained prosodic information in emotion recognition, limiting their effectiveness. VowelPrompt addresses this gap.

Method: Extracts vowel-level prosodic features (pitch, energy, duration) and converts them into natural language descriptions. Uses SFT and RLVR via GRPO for adaptation.

Result: VowelPrompt outperforms existing methods in zero-shot, fine-tuned, cross-domain, and cross-linguistic scenarios with interpretable explanations.

Conclusion: Combining lexical semantics with fine-grained prosodic cues improves emotion recognition and interpretability.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in speech presents a complex multimodal challenge, requiring comprehension of both linguistic content and vocal expressivity, particularly prosodic features such as fundamental frequency, intensity, and temporal dynamics. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in reasoning over textual transcriptions for emotion recognition, they typically neglect fine-grained prosodic information, limiting their effectiveness and interpretability. In this work, we propose VowelPrompt, a linguistically grounded framework that augments LLM-based emotion recognition with interpretable, fine-grained vowel-level prosodic cues. Drawing on phonetic evidence that vowels serve as primary carriers of affective prosody, VowelPrompt extracts pitch-, energy-, and duration-based descriptors from time-aligned vowel segments, and converts these features into natural language descriptions for better interpretability. Such a design enables LLMs to jointly reason over lexical semantics and fine-grained prosodic variation. Moreover, we adopt a two-stage adaptation procedure comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), implemented via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance reasoning capability, enforce structured output adherence, and improve generalization across domains and speaker variations. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that VowelPrompt consistently outperforms state-of-the-art emotion recognition methods under zero-shot, fine-tuned, cross-domain, and cross-linguistic conditions, while enabling the generation of interpretable explanations that are jointly grounded in contextual semantics and fine-grained prosodic structure.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Consequence-Based Utility, an oracle-free evaluator for ranking solutions in research-level math, outperforming other methods like reward models and LLM judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verification of reasoning models consumes expert time, and a meaningful solution should improve downstream performance for related questions.

Method: Proposes Consequence-Based Utility, evaluating solutions by testing their value as in-context exemplars for solving verifiable questions.

Result: Outperforms reward models and LLM judges, improving Acc@1 and AUC scores significantly.

Conclusion: Consequence-Based Utility is effective for ranking solutions, even when the solver fails, maintaining strong correct-wrong separation.

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning models suggests that generating plausible attempts for research-level mathematics may be within reach, but verification remains a bottleneck, consuming scarce expert time. We hypothesize that a meaningful solution should contain enough method-level information that, when applied to a neighborhood of related questions, it should yield better downstream performance than incorrect solutions. Building on this idea, we propose \textbf{Consequence-Based Utility}, an oracle-free evaluator that scores each candidate by testing its value as an in-context exemplar in solving related yet verifiable questions. Our approach is evaluated on an original set of research-level math problems, each paired with one expert-written solution and nine LLM-generated solutions. Notably, Consequence-Based Utility consistently outperforms reward models, generative reward models, and LLM judges on ranking quality. Specifically, for GPT-OSS-120B, it improves Acc@1 from 67.2 to 76.3 and AUC from 71.4 to 79.6, with similarly large AUC gains on GPT-OSS-20B (69.0 to 79.2). Furthermore, compared to LLM-Judges, it also exhibits a larger solver-evaluator gap, maintaining a stronger correct-wrong separation even on instances where the underlying solver often fails to solve.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in parsing spoken code-switching (CSW) due to disfluencies and discourse-driven structures, introducing SpokeBench, FLEX-UD metric, and DECAP framework for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard parsing methods fail for spoken CSW due to violations of Universal Dependencies assumptions, necessitating linguistically grounded solutions.

Method: Introduces SpokeBench benchmark, FLEX-UD evaluation metric, and DECAP parsing framework to handle spoken CSW phenomena separately from core syntax.

Result: DECAP improves parsing robustness by up to 52.6% and reveals qualitative gains masked by standard metrics.

Conclusion: The work provides a systematic approach to spoken CSW parsing, highlighting the need for flexible evaluation and decoupled analysis.

Abstract: Spoken code-switching (CSW) challenges syntactic parsing in ways not observed in written text. Disfluencies, repetition, ellipsis, and discourse-driven structure routinely violate standard Universal Dependencies (UD) assumptions, causing parsers and large language models (LLMs) to fail despite strong performance on written data. These failures are compounded by rigid evaluation metrics that conflate genuine structural errors with acceptable variation. In this work, we present a systems-oriented approach to spoken CSW parsing. We introduce a linguistically grounded taxonomy of spoken CSW phenomena and SpokeBench, an expert-annotated gold benchmark designed to test spoken-language structure beyond standard UD assumptions. We further propose FLEX-UD, an ambiguity-aware evaluation metric, which reveals that existing parsing techniques perform poorly on spoken CSW by penalizing linguistically plausible analyses as errors. We then propose DECAP, a decoupled agentic parsing framework that isolates spoken-phenomena handling from core syntactic analysis. Experiments show that DECAP produces more robust and interpretable parses without retraining and achieves up to 52.6% improvements over existing parsing techniques.

### [91] [Can Post-Training Transform LLMs into Causal Reasoners?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06337)
*Junqi Chen,Sirui Chen,Chaochao Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Post-training enhances LLMs' causal inference capabilities, with smaller models outperforming larger ones using methods like GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal inference is crucial but difficult for non-experts; LLMs' potential here is underexplored, especially post-training impacts.

Method: Introduces CauGym dataset with seven causal tasks, evaluates five post-training approaches (SFT, DPO, KTO, PPO, GRPO) on diverse benchmarks.

Result: Post-trained smaller LLMs excel, e.g., 14B model achieves 93.5% accuracy vs. OpenAI's 55.4%; strong generalization under real-world conditions.

Conclusion: Targeted post-training creates reliable, robust LLM-based causal reasoners, with open-sourced data and GRPO-model.

Abstract: Causal inference is essential for decision-making but remains challenging for non-experts. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in this domain, their precise causal estimation capabilities are still limited, and the impact of post-training on these abilities is insufficiently explored. This paper examines the extent to which post-training can enhance LLMs' capacity for causal inference. We introduce CauGym, a comprehensive dataset comprising seven core causal tasks for training and five diverse test sets. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate five post-training approaches: SFT, DPO, KTO, PPO, and GRPO. Across five in-domain and four existing benchmarks, our experiments demonstrate that appropriate post-training enables smaller LLMs to perform causal inference competitively, often surpassing much larger models. Our 14B parameter model achieves 93.5% accuracy on the CaLM benchmark, compared to 55.4% by OpenAI o3. Furthermore, the post-trained LLMs exhibit strong generalization and robustness under real-world conditions such as distribution shifts and noisy data. Collectively, these findings provide the first systematic evidence that targeted post-training can produce reliable and robust LLM-based causal reasoners. Our data and GRPO-model are available at https://github.com/OpenCausaLab/CauGym.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SHINE is a scalable hypernetwork that efficiently generates high-quality LoRA adapters for LLMs by reusing frozen parameters and introducing architectural innovations, achieving strong performance with minimal resource use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of prior hypernetworks and enable efficient, high-quality adaptation of LLMs without fine-tuning.

Method: SHINE uses an in-context hypernetwork design, pretraining, and instruction fine-tuning to generate LoRA adapters in a single forward pass.

Result: Achieves outstanding performance on various tasks, saving time, computation, and memory compared to SFT-based adaptation.

Conclusion: SHINE effectively transforms in-context knowledge into in-parameter knowledge, showing great potential for scaling.

Abstract: We propose SHINE (Scalable Hyper In-context NEtwork), a scalable hypernetwork that can map diverse meaningful contexts into high-quality LoRA adapters for large language models (LLM). By reusing the frozen LLM's own parameters in an in-context hypernetwork design and introducing architectural innovations, SHINE overcomes key limitations of prior hypernetworks and achieves strong expressive power with a relatively small number of parameters. We introduce a pretraining and instruction fine-tuning pipeline, and train our hypernetwork to generate high quality LoRA adapters from diverse meaningful contexts in a single forward pass. It updates LLM parameters without any fine-tuning, and immediately enables complex question answering tasks related to the context without directly accessing the context, effectively transforming in-context knowledge to in-parameter knowledge in one pass. Our work achieves outstanding results on various tasks, greatly saves time, computation and memory costs compared to SFT-based LLM adaptation, and shows great potential for scaling.

*Alberto Andres Valdes Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares zero-/few-shot LLMs and fine-tuned encoders for text classification, showing encoders outperform LLMs in cost and latency while achieving similar or better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked operational constraints (cost, latency) in model selection for structured text classification tasks.

Method: Systematic comparison using benchmarks (IMDB, SST-2, AG News, DBPedia), evaluating predictive quality, latency, and cost. Analyzed trade-offs via Pareto frontiers and utility functions.

Result: Fine-tuned encoders (e.g., BERT) outperform LLMs in cost/latency (1-2 orders lower) with competitive/superior classification performance.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned encoders are better for structured NLP pipelines, while LLMs suit hybrid architectures. Avoid indiscriminate LLM use for standard classification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4.5 have demonstrated strong capabilities in open-ended reasoning and generative language tasks, leading to their widespread adoption across a broad range of NLP applications. However, for structured text classification problems with fixed label spaces, model selection is often driven by predictive performance alone, overlooking operational constraints encountered in production systems.
  In this work, we present a systematic comparison of two contrasting paradigms for text classification: zero- and few-shot prompt-based large language models, and fully fine-tuned encoder-only architectures. We evaluate these approaches across four canonical benchmarks (IMDB, SST-2, AG News, and DBPedia), measuring predictive quality (macro F1), inference latency, and monetary cost.
  We frame model evaluation as a multi-objective decision problem and analyze trade-offs using Pareto frontier projections and a parameterized utility function reflecting different deployment regimes. Our results show that fine-tuned encoder-based models from the BERT family achieve competitive, and often superior, classification performance while operating at one to two orders of magnitude lower cost and latency compared to zero- and few-shot LLM prompting.
  Overall, our findings suggest that indiscriminate use of large language models for standard text classification workloads can lead to suboptimal system-level outcomes. Instead, fine-tuned encoders emerge as robust and efficient components for structured NLP pipelines, while LLMs are better positioned as complementary elements within hybrid architectures. We release all code, datasets, and evaluation protocols to support reproducibility and cost-aware NLP system design.

### [94] [ReBeCA: Unveiling Interpretable Behavior Hierarchy behind the Iterative Self-Reflection of Language Models with Causal Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06373)
*Tianqiang Yan,Sihan Shang,Yuheng Li,Song Qiu,Hao Peng,Wenjian Luo,Jue Xie,Lizhen Qu,Yuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReBeCA introduces a causal analysis framework to uncover interpretable behavioral hierarchies in self-reflection outcomes, revealing key findings about semantic behaviors' hierarchical influence and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analyses of self-reflection in language models are correlation-based and lack generalizability. ReBeCA aims to provide causal insights into self-reflection mechanisms.

Method: ReBeCA models self-reflection trajectories as causal graphs and uses a three-stage Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP) pipeline to isolate performance determinants.

Result: Key findings include a behavioral hierarchy of semantic behaviors, limited generalizability of self-reflection effects, and the negative impact of combining seemingly positive behaviors.

Conclusion: ReBeCA offers a rigorous method to distinguish genuine causal mechanisms from spurious associations in self-reflection, validated through intervention studies.

Abstract: While self-reflection can enhance language model reliability, its underlying mechanisms remain opaque, with existing analyses often yielding correlation-based insights that fail to generalize. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\texttt{ReBeCA}} (self-\textbf{\texttt{Re}}flection \textbf{\texttt{Be}}havior explained through \textbf{\texttt{C}}ausal \textbf{\texttt{A}}nalysis), a framework that unveils the interpretable behavioral hierarchy governing the self-reflection outcome. By modeling self-reflection trajectories as causal graphs, ReBeCA isolates genuine determinants of performance through a three-stage Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP) pipeline. We establish three critical findings: (1) \textbf{Behavioral hierarchy:} Semantic behaviors of the model influence final self-reflection results hierarchically: directly or indirectly; (2) \textbf{Causation matters:} Generalizability in self-reflection effects is limited to just a few semantic behaviors; (3) \textbf{More $\mathbf{\neq}$ better:} The confluence of seemingly positive semantic behaviors, even among direct causal factors, can impair the efficacy of self-reflection. ICP-based verification identifies sparse causal parents achieving up to $49.6\%$ structural likelihood gains, stable across tasks where correlation-based patterns fail. Intervention studies on novel datasets confirm these causal relationships hold out-of-distribution ($p = .013, η^2_\mathrm{p} = .071$). ReBeCA thus provides a rigorous methodology for disentangling genuine causal mechanisms from spurious associations in self-reflection dynamics.

*Yaoting Wang,Yun Zhou,Henghui Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FMBench is a benchmark for evaluating adaptive Markdown formatting in large language models, addressing real-world formatting challenges and proposing a lightweight alignment pipeline combining SFT and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve Markdown formatting in large language models, which is prone to subtle errors that degrade usability, especially in user-facing applications.

Method: The authors propose FMBench, a benchmark for diverse Markdown formatting scenarios, and a pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning to enhance formatting compliance.

Result: Experiments show SFT improves semantic alignment, while reinforcement learning boosts robustness in handling challenging Markdown instructions.

Conclusion: The study highlights a trade-off between semantic fidelity and structural correctness, emphasizing the need for well-designed rewards in formatted generation.

Abstract: Producing outputs that satisfy both semantic intent and format constraints is essential for deploying large language models in user-facing and system-integrated workflows. In this work, we focus on Markdown formatting, which is ubiquitous in assistants, documentation, and tool-augmented pipelines but still prone to subtle, hard-to-detect errors (e.g., broken lists, malformed tables, inconsistent headings, and invalid code blocks) that can significantly degrade downstream usability. We present FMBench, a benchmark for adaptive Markdown output formatting that evaluates models under a wide range of instruction-following scenarios with diverse structural requirements. FMBench emphasizes real-world formatting behaviors such as multi-level organization, mixed content (natural language interleaved with lists/tables/code), and strict adherence to user-specified layout constraints. To improve Markdown compliance without relying on hard decoding constraints, we propose a lightweight alignment pipeline that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning fine-tuning. Starting from a base model, we first perform SFT on instruction-response pairs, and then optimize a composite objective that balances semantic fidelity with structural correctness. Experiments on two model families (OpenPangu and Qwen) show that SFT consistently improves semantic alignment, while reinforcement learning provides additional gains in robustness to challenging Markdown instructions when initialized from a strong SFT policy. Our results also reveal an inherent trade-off between semantic and structural objectives, highlighting the importance of carefully designed rewards for reliable formatted generation.

### [96] [Stopping Computation for Converged Tokens in Masked Diffusion-LM Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06412)
*Daisuke Oba,Danushka Bollegala,Masahiro Kaneko,Naoaki Okazaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SureLock reduces compute waste in Masked Diffusion Language Models by locking stabilized tokens, cutting FLOPs by 30--50% without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of recomputing attention and feed-forward blocks for unmasked tokens that remain fixed during iterative sampling.

Method: Proposes SureLock, which locks positions meeting a stability condition (sure condition), skipping redundant computations and caching keys/values for continued attention.

Result: Reduces computational cost from O(N²d) to O(MNd) and saves 30--50% FLOPs on LLaDA-8B, maintaining generation quality.

Conclusion: SureLock effectively optimizes compute efficiency in masked diffusion models while preserving performance, supported by theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models generate sequences via iterative sampling that progressively unmasks tokens. However, they still recompute the attention and feed-forward blocks for every token position at every step -- even when many unmasked tokens are essentially fixed, resulting in substantial waste in compute. We propose SureLock: when the posterior at an unmasked position has stabilized across steps (our sure condition), we lock that position -- thereafter skipping its query projection and feed-forward sublayers -- while caching its attention keys and values so other positions can continue to attend to it. This reduces the dominant per-iteration computational cost from $O(N^2d)$ to $O(MNd)$ where $N$ is the sequence length, $M$ is the number of unlocked token positions, and $d$ is the model dimension. In practice, $M$ decreases as the iteration progresses, yielding substantial savings. On LLaDA-8B, SureLock reduces algorithmic FLOPs by 30--50% relative to the same sampler without locking, while maintaining comparable generation quality. We also provide a theoretical analysis to justify the design rationale of SureLock: monitoring only the local KL at the lock step suffices to bound the deviation in final token probabilities. Our code will be available at https://daioba.github.io/surelock .

### [97] [On the Wings of Imagination: Conflicting Script-based Multi-role Framework for Humor Caption Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06423)
*Wenbo Shang,Yuxi Sun,Jing Ma,Xin Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HOMER, a humor-theory-driven multi-role LLM collaboration framework, to improve humor generation in multi-modal scenarios by leveraging the GTVH humor theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based humor generation methods lack creativity and interpretability, and struggle with multi-modal tasks like funny caption generation for images.

Method: HOMER uses three LLM-based roles: a conflicting-script extractor, a retrieval-augmented hierarchical imaginator, and a caption generator, all grounded in the GTVH humor theory.

Result: HOMER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and LLM reasoning strategies on two New Yorker Cartoon datasets.

Conclusion: The HOMER framework effectively enhances humor generation in multi-modal scenarios by combining humor theory and multi-role LLM collaboration.

Abstract: Humor is a commonly used and intricate human language in daily life. Humor generation, especially in multi-modal scenarios, is a challenging task for large language models (LLMs), which is typically as funny caption generation for images, requiring visual understanding, humor reasoning, creative imagination, and so on. Existing LLM-based approaches rely on reasoning chains or self-improvement, which suffer from limited creativity and interpretability. To address these bottlenecks, we develop a novel LLM-based humor generation mechanism based on a fundamental humor theory, GTVH. To produce funny and script-opposite captions, we introduce a humor-theory-driven multi-role LLM collaboration framework augmented with humor retrieval (HOMER). The framework consists of three LLM-based roles: (1) conflicting-script extractor that grounds humor in key script oppositions, forming the basis of caption generation; (2) retrieval-augmented hierarchical imaginator that identifies key humor targets and expands the creative space of them through diverse associations structured as imagination trees; and (3) caption generator that produces funny and diverse captions conditioned on the obtained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two New Yorker Cartoon benchmarking datasets show that HOMER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and powerful LLM reasoning strategies on multi-modal humor captioning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines the validity of Plutchik's wheel of emotion by analyzing semantic networks of emotion words, finding overall similarity but local differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the validity of Plutchik's wheel of emotion in natural language processing applications.

Method: Created semantic networks using similarity and association data of emotion words, then analyzed network structure via community detection.

Result: Networks' structures were largely similar to Plutchik's wheel but had local differences.

Conclusion: Plutchik's wheel of emotion is generally valid but may require minor adjustments for specific contexts.

Abstract: In the field of natural language processing, some studies have attempted sentiment analysis on text by handling emotions as explanatory or response variables. One of the most popular emotion models used in this context is the wheel of emotion proposed by Plutchik. This model schematizes human emotions in a circular structure, and represents them in two or three dimensions. However, the validity of Plutchik's wheel of emotion has not been sufficiently examined. This study investigated the validity of the wheel by creating and analyzing a semantic networks of emotion words. Through our experiments, we collected data of similarity and association of ordered pairs of emotion words, and constructed networks using these data. We then analyzed the structure of the networks through community detection, and compared it with that of the wheel of emotion. The results showed that each network's structure was, for the most part, similar to that of the wheel of emotion, but locally different.

*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Ruizhi Qian,Minda Zhao,Weiyue Li,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an RL-based jailbreak framework leveraging historical vulnerability signals for improved efficiency and success rates in attacking LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreaking techniques inefficiently utilize vulnerabilities from prior interactions; RL's sequential nature makes it suitable for this task.

Method: Introduces a history-aware RL framework with an attention-based reweighting mechanism to prioritize critical vulnerabilities in past steps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art jailbreak performance on AdvBench and HarmBench, with fewer queries, highlighting the value of historical signals.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging historical vulnerability signals in RL-driven jailbreaking, advancing adversarial research on LLM safeguards.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to many domains, making their safety a critical priority. Prior jailbreaking research has explored diverse approaches, including prompt optimization, automated red teaming, obfuscation, and reinforcement learning (RL) based methods. However, most existing techniques fail to effectively leverage vulnerabilities revealed in earlier interaction turns, resulting in inefficient and unstable attacks. Since jailbreaking involves sequential interactions in which each response influences future actions, reinforcement learning provides a natural framework for this problem. Motivated by this, we propose a history-aware RL-based jailbreak framework that analyzes and reweights vulnerability signals from prior steps to guide future decisions. We show that incorporating historical information alone improves jailbreak success rates. Building on this insight, we introduce an attention-based reweighting mechanism that highlights critical vulnerabilities within the interaction history, enabling more efficient exploration with fewer queries. Extensive experiments on AdvBench and HarmBench demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art jailbreak performance while significantly improving query efficiency. These results underscore the importance of historical vulnerability signals in reinforcement learning-driven jailbreak strategies and offer a principled pathway for advancing adversarial research on LLM safeguards.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CORE, a dataset to evaluate LLMs' ability to distinguish meaningful semantic relations from unrelatedness, revealing significant gaps in their reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of LLMs rarely assess their ability to differentiate meaningful semantic relations from unrelated pairs, which is critical for understanding their reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors created CORE, a dataset of 225K multiple-choice questions across 74 disciplines, along with a smaller benchmark of 203 validated questions covering 24 semantic relation types with balanced unrelated pairs. Human and LLM performance were compared.

Result: Humans achieved 92.6% accuracy (95.1% on unrelated pairs), while 29 LLMs scored 48.25-70.9% overall, with poor performance on unrelated pairs (0-41.35%). LLMs also showed high semantic collapse rates (37.6%) and calibration errors on unrelated pairs.

Conclusion: The study highlights unrelatedness reasoning as a critical, under-evaluated challenge for LLMs, emphasizing the need for better evaluation frameworks to improve their safety and accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on many reasoning benchmarks, yet existing evaluations rarely assess their ability to distinguish between meaningful semantic relations and genuine unrelatedness. We introduce CORE (Comprehensive Ontological Relation Evaluation), a dataset of 225K multiple-choice questions spanning 74 disciplines, together with a general-domain open-source benchmark of 203 rigorously validated questions (Cohen's Kappa = 1.0) covering 24 semantic relation types with equal representation of unrelated pairs. A human baseline from 1,000+ participants achieves 92.6% accuracy (95.1% on unrelated pairs). In contrast, 29 state-of-the-art LLMs achieve 48.25-70.9% overall accuracy, with near-ceiling performance on related pairs (86.5-100%) but severe degradation on unrelated pairs (0-41.35%), despite assigning similar confidence (92-94%). Expected Calibration Error increases 2-4x on unrelated pairs, and a mean semantic collapse rate of 37.6% indicates systematic generation of spurious relations. On the CORE 225K MCQs dataset, accuracy further drops to approximately 2%, highlighting substantial challenges in domain-specific semantic reasoning. We identify unrelatedness reasoning as a critical, under-evaluated frontier for LLM evaluation and safety.

TL;DR: ClinMPO, a reinforcement learning framework, aligns light-parameter LLMs with psychiatric reasoning, achieving better diagnostic accuracy than medical students in complex cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) face limitations in psychiatry due to hallucinations and superficial reasoning, especially in light-parameter models needed for clinical use.

Method: ClinMPO uses a specialized reward model trained on psychiatry journal articles and evidence-based medicine principles to align LLM reasoning with professional practice.

Result: The ClinMPO-tuned Qwen3-8B model achieved 31.4% diagnostic accuracy, surpassing the human benchmark of 30.8% in complex cases.

Conclusion: Evidence-guided optimization enables light-parameter LLMs to excel in psychiatric reasoning, offering scalable and reliable clinical decision support.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential for medical decision support yet their application in psychiatry remains constrained by hallucinations and superficial reasoning. This limitation is particularly acute in light-parameter LLMs which are essential for privacy-preserving and efficient clinical deployment. Existing training paradigms prioritize linguistic fluency over structured clinical logic and result in a fundamental misalignment with professional diagnostic cognition. Here we introduce ClinMPO, a reinforcement learning framework designed to align the internal reasoning of LLMs with professional psychiatric practice. The framework employs a specialized reward model trained independently on a dataset derived from 4,474 psychiatry journal articles and structured according to evidence-based medicine principles. We evaluated ClinMPO on a unseen subset of the benchmark designed to isolate reasoning capabilities from rote memorization. This test set comprises items where leading large-parameter LLMs consistently fail. We compared the ClinMPO-aligned light LLM performance against a cohort of 300 medical students. The ClinMPO-tuned Qwen3-8B model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 31.4% and surpassed the human benchmark of 30.8% on these complex cases. These results demonstrate that medical evidence-guided optimization enables light-parameter LLMs to master complex reasoning tasks. Our findings suggest that explicit cognitive alignment offers a scalable pathway to reliable and safe psychiatric decision support.

*Jiwon Song,Yoongon Kim,Jae-Joon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RelayGen is a training-free framework that dynamically switches between large and small models during reasoning tasks based on generation difficulty, reducing latency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing efficiency-oriented approaches either ignore intra-generation difficulty variation or require complex supervised routing, leading to high deployment costs.

Method: RelayGen uses token probability margins to analyze generation uncertainty offline, enabling segment-level control for dynamic model switching without training.

Result: It reduces inference latency significantly with minimal accuracy loss (less than 2%) and achieves up to 2.2× speedup when combined with speculative decoding.

Conclusion: RelayGen provides an effective, low-complexity solution for optimizing large reasoning models' efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating long, multi-step reasoning trajectories, but inference-time scaling incurs substantial deployment cost. A key challenge is that generation difficulty varies within a single output, whereas existing efficiency-oriented approaches either ignore this intra-generation variation or rely on supervised token-level routing with high system complexity. We present \textbf{RelayGen}, a training-free, segment-level runtime model switching framework that exploits difficulty variation in long-form reasoning. Through offline analysis of generation uncertainty using token probability margins, we show that coarse-grained segment-level control is sufficient to capture difficulty transitions within a reasoning trajectory. RelayGen identifies model-specific switch cues that signal transitions to lower-difficulty segments and dynamically delegates their continuation to a smaller model, while preserving high-difficulty reasoning on the large model. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, RelayGen substantially reduces inference latency while preserving most of the accuracy of large models. When combined with speculative decoding, RelayGen achieves up to 2.2$\times$ end-to-end speedup with less than 2\% accuracy degradation, without requiring additional training or learned routing components.

TL;DR: DiSPO improves credit assignment in masked diffusion language models by optimizing intermediate filling decisions without extra rollouts, outperforming terminal-feedback baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional masked diffusion models rely on terminal rewards, leading to coarse credit assignment for intermediate decisions.

Method: DiSPO introduces a credit-assignment layer that branches masked states, resamples fillings, scores completions, and updates newly filled tokens.

Result: DiSPO consistently outperforms diffu-GRPO on LLaDA-8B-Instruct for math and planning tasks.

Conclusion: DiSPO enhances intermediate decision-making in diffusion models, improving performance without additional computational cost.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models generate by iteratively filling masked tokens over multiple denoising steps, so learning only from a terminal reward on the final completion yields coarse credit assignment over intermediate decisions. We propose DiSPO (Diffusion-State Policy Optimization), a plug-in credit-assignment layer that directly optimizes intermediate filling decisions. At selected intermediate masked states, DiSPO branches by resampling fillings for the currently masked positions from rollout-cached logits, scores the resulting completions, and updates only the newly filled tokens -- without additional multi-step diffusion rollouts. We formalize a fixed-state objective for branched completions and derive a policy-gradient estimator that can be combined with terminal-feedback policy optimization using the same rollouts. On LLaDA-8B-Instruct, DiSPO consistently improves over the terminal-feedback diffu-GRPO baseline on math and planning benchmarks under matched rollout compute and optimizer steps.

TL;DR: UNO proposes a framework for LLMs to learn from noisy user logs by distilling them into structured rules and preferences, clustering feedback, and quantifying cognitive gaps, achieving superior performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM training faces limits due to data scarcity and high computational costs, prompting exploration of continual learning from noisy user logs.

Method: UNO distills logs into semi-structured rules and preference pairs, clusters feedback via query-and-feedback-driven methods, and quantifies cognitive gaps to filter noise and adapt LLM responses.

Result: UNO outperforms Retrieval Augmented Generation and memory-based baselines in effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: UNO effectively leverages user logs for LLM improvement, offering a scalable solution despite the challenges of noisy feedback.

Abstract: Scaling training data and model parameters has long driven progress in large language models (LLMs), but this paradigm is increasingly constrained by the scarcity of high-quality data and diminishing returns from rising computational costs. As a result, recent work is increasing the focus on continual learning from real-world deployment, where user interaction logs provide a rich source of authentic human feedback and procedural knowledge. However, learning from user logs is challenging due to their unstructured and noisy nature. Vanilla LLM systems often struggle to distinguish useful feedback signals from noisy user behavior, and the disparity between user log collection and model optimization (e.g., the off-policy optimization problem) further strengthens the problem. To this end, we propose UNO (User log-driveN Optimization), a unified framework for improving LLM systems (LLMsys) with user logs. UNO first distills logs into semi-structured rules and preference pairs, then employs query-and-feedback-driven clustering to manage data heterogeneity, and finally quantifies the cognitive gap between the model's prior knowledge and the log data. This assessment guides the LLMsys to adaptively filter out noisy feedback and construct different modules for primary and reflective experiences extracted from user logs, thereby improving future responses. Extensive experiments show that UNO achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness and efficiency, significantly outperforming Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and memory-based baselines.

*Feng-Ting Liao,Meng-Hsi Chen,Guan-Ting Yi,Da-shan Shiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the traditional narrow-wide-narrow MLP design in Transformer FFNs, proposing a deeper hourglass-shaped FFN as a competitive alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore superior function approximation capabilities of residual wide-narrow-wide MLPs and rethink the conventional MLP design in Transformers.

Method: Developed a Transformer variant replacing the standard FFN with a deeper hourglass-shaped FFN, using residual pathways and lighter sub-MLPs.

Result: Hourglass FFNs outperformed conventional FFNs up to 400M parameters and matched performance at 1B; variants with reduced FFN and increased attention showed consistent improvements.

Conclusion: The findings suggest reconsidering the narrow-wide-narrow MLP convention and balancing attention-FFN parameters for efficient, expressive language models.

Abstract: Dense Transformer language models have largely adhered to one consistent architectural shape: each layer consists of an attention module followed by a feed-forward network (FFN) with a narrow-wide-narrow MLP, allocating most parameters to the MLP at expansion ratios between 2 and 4. Motivated by recent results that residual wide-narrow-wide (hourglass) MLPs offer superior function approximation capabilities, we revisit the long-standing MLP shape convention in Transformer, challenging the necessity of the narrow-wide-narrow design. To study this, we develop a Transformer variant that replaces the conventional FFN with a deeper hourglass-shaped FFN, comprising a stack of hourglass sub-MLPs connected by residual pathways. We posit that a deeper but lighter hourglass FFN can serve as a competitive alternative to the conventional FFN, and that parameters saved by using a lighter hourglass FFN can be more effectively utilized, such as by enlarging model hidden dimensions under fixed budgets. We confirm these through empirical validations across model scales: hourglass FFNs outperform conventional FFNs up to 400M and achieve comparable performance at larger scales to 1B parameters; hourglass FFN variants with reduced FFN and increased attention parameters show consistent improvements over conventional configurations at matched budgets. Together, these findings shed new light on recent work and prompt a rethinking of the narrow-wide-narrow MLP convention and the balance between attention and FFN towards efficient and expressive modern language models.

TL;DR: DREAM is a debate-based framework using LLM agents for accurate relevance assessment in IR benchmarks, reducing human effort to 3.5% while achieving 95.2% accuracy. BRIDGE, a refined benchmark, uncovers 29,824 missing relevant chunks for fairer IR system evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete IR benchmark datasets with unlabeled relevant chunks pose evaluation challenges. Existing LLM-human hybrid strategies suffer from LLM overconfidence and ineffective AI-to-human escalation.

Method: Proposes DREAM, a multi-round debate framework with LLM agents using opposing stances and iterative critique for relevance assessment. It ensures accurate labeling and reliable AI-to-human escalation.

Result: Achieves 95.2% labeling accuracy with only 3.5% human involvement. BRIDGE, the refined benchmark, uncovers 29,824 missing relevant chunks, mitigating bias and enabling fairer retriever comparisons.

Conclusion: DREAM improves relevance assessment accuracy and reduces human effort. BRIDGE reshapes IR evaluation, revealing distortions in retriever rankings and retrieval-generation misalignment due to unaddressed gaps.

Abstract: Information retrieval (IR) evaluation remains challenging due to incomplete IR benchmark datasets that contain unlabeled relevant chunks. While LLMs and LLM-human hybrid strategies reduce costly human effort, they remain prone to LLM overconfidence and ineffective AI-to-human escalation. To address this, we propose DREAM, a multi-round debate-based relevance assessment framework with LLM agents, built on opposing initial stances and iterative reciprocal critique. Through our agreement-based debate, it yields more accurate labeling for certain cases and more reliable AI-to-human escalation for uncertain ones, achieving 95.2% labeling accuracy with only 3.5% human involvement. Using DREAM, we build BRIDGE, a refined benchmark that mitigates evaluation bias and enables fairer retriever comparison by uncovering 29,824 missing relevant chunks. We then re-benchmark IR systems and extend evaluation to RAG, showing that unaddressed holes not only distort retriever rankings but also drive retrieval-generation misalignment. The relevance assessment framework is available at https: //github.com/DISL-Lab/DREAM-ICLR-26; and the BRIDGE dataset is available at https://github.com/DISL-Lab/BRIDGE-Benchmark.

*Himanshu Singh,Ziwei Xu,A. V. Subramanyam,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a subspace intervention strategy to reduce toxicity in LLM outputs while maintaining fluency, outperforming existing methods by 8-20% in toxicity reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can generate harmful content even from harmless prompts, posing safety risks. Current mitigation methods often compromise fluency or fail to address subtle, context-dependent toxicity.

Method: A targeted subspace intervention strategy identifies and suppresses hidden toxic patterns in model representations without altering overall generation capabilities.

Result: The method reduces toxicity by 8-20% across multiple LLMs on RealToxicityPrompts, maintaining fluency and outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Subspace intervention effectively mitigates toxicity in LLM outputs without degrading generative performance, offering a robust solution to safety challenges.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful text generators, yet they can produce toxic or harmful content even when given seemingly harmless prompts. This presents a serious safety challenge and can cause real-world harm. Toxicity is often subtle and context-dependent, making it difficult to detect at the token level or through coarse sentence-level signals. Moreover, efforts to mitigate toxicity often face a trade-off between safety and the coherence, or fluency of the generated text. In this work, we present a targeted subspace intervention strategy for identifying and suppressing hidden toxic patterns from underlying model representations, while preserving overall ability to generate safe fluent content. On the RealToxicityPrompts, our method achieves strong mitigation performance compared to existing baselines, with minimal impact on inference complexity. Across multiple LLMs, our approach reduces toxicity of state-of-the-art detoxification systems by 8-20%, while maintaining comparable fluency. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses, we show that our approach achieves effective toxicity reduction without impairing generative performance, consistently outperforming existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FairJudge addresses limitations in LLM-as-a-Judge systems (limited adaptivity, biases, inconsistency) by modeling judging as a learnable policy, using a curated dataset, and a progressive training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-as-a-Judge systems lack adaptivity, exhibit biases, and suffer from inconsistency. FairJudge aims to solve these issues.

Method: FairJudge models judging as a learnable policy, uses a high-information-density dataset, and applies a curriculum-style SFT-DPO-GRPO training paradigm.

Result: FairJudge improves agreement and F1 scores, reduces biases, and outperforms larger LLMs on benchmarks.

Conclusion: FairJudge is adaptive, debiased, and consistent, offering a superior solution for LLM-as-a-Judge tasks.

Abstract: Existing LLM-as-a-Judge systems suffer from three fundamental limitations: limited adaptivity to task- and domain-specific evaluation criteria, systematic biases driven by non-semantic cues such as position, length, format, and model provenance, and evaluation inconsistency that leads to contradictory judgments across different evaluation modes (e.g., pointwise versus pairwise). To address these issues, we propose FairJudge, an adaptive, debiased, and consistent LLM-as-a-Judge. Unlike prior approaches that treat the judge as a static evaluator, FairJudge models judging behavior itself as a learnable and regularized policy. From a data-centric perspective, we construct a high-information-density judging dataset that explicitly injects supervision signals aligned with evaluation behavior. Building on this dataset, we adopt a curriculum-style SFT-DPO-GRPO training paradigm that progressively aligns rubric adherence, bias mitigation, and cross-mode consistency, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results on multiple internal and public benchmarks show that FairJudge consistently improves agreement and F1, reduces non-semantic biases, and outperforms substantially larger instruction-tuned LLMs. All resources will be publicly released after acceptance to facilitate future research.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Spoken content, such as online videos and podcasts, often spans multiple topics, which makes automatic topic segmentation essential for user navigation and downstream applications. However, current methods do not fully leverage acoustic features, leaving room for improvement. We propose a multi-modal approach that fine-tunes both a text encoder and a Siamese audio encoder, capturing acoustic cues around sentence boundaries. Experiments on a large-scale dataset of YouTube videos show substantial gains over text-only and multi-modal baselines. Our model also proves more resilient to ASR noise and outperforms a larger text-only baseline on three additional datasets in Portuguese, German, and English, underscoring the value of learned acoustic features for robust topic segmentation.

*Jianfeng Si,Lin Sun,Weihong Lin,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PACT is a framework for dynamic safety control in LLMs, combining non-overridable global safety policies with customizable user-defined policies to balance safety and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with a safety-helpfulness trade-off due to rigid safety policies. PACT addresses this by enabling dynamic control over safety responses.

Method: PACT uses a hierarchical policy architecture: global policies set immutable boundaries, while user-defined policies allow domain-specific adaptations. It structures safety decisions into Classify→Act paths.

Result: PACT achieves near state-of-the-art safety performance globally and excels in controllability under user-specific policies.

Conclusion: PACT effectively mitigates the safety-helpfulness trade-off, offering transparent and adaptable safety controls.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a fundamental safety-helpfulness trade-off due to static, one-size-fits-all safety policies that lack runtime controllabilityxf, making it difficult to tailor responses to diverse application needs. %As a result, models may over-refuse benign requests or under-constrain harmful ones. We present \textbf{PACT} (Prompt-configured Action via Chain-of-Thought), a framework for dynamic safety control through explicit, risk-aware reasoning. PACT operates under a hierarchical policy architecture: a non-overridable global safety policy establishes immutable boundaries for critical risks (e.g., child safety, violent extremism), while user-defined policies can introduce domain-specific (non-global) risk categories and specify label-to-action behaviors to improve utility in real-world deployment settings. The framework decomposes safety decisions into structured Classify$\rightarrow$Act paths that route queries to the appropriate action (comply, guide, or reject) and render the decision-making process transparent.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PACT achieves near state-of-the-art safety performance under global policy evaluation while attaining the best controllability under user-specific policy evaluation, effectively mitigating the safety-helpfulness trade-off. We will release the PACT model suite, training data, and evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducible research in controllable safety alignment.

### [113] [Not All Layers Need Tuning: Selective Layer Restoration Recovers Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06665)
*Bowen Zhang,Meiyi Wang,Harold Soh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Selective Layer Restoration (SLR) recovers diversity in post-trained LLMs by restoring specific layers to pre-trained weights, improving diversity without compromising quality or increasing inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training LLMs often reduces generation diversity (mode collapse). The paper hypothesizes that this collapse is layer-specific and restoring certain layers can maintain quality while recovering diversity.

Method: Designs Constrained Random Character (CRC) task to identify layers affecting diversity. Proposes SLR, restoring selected layers to pre-trained weights, creating a hybrid model.

Result: SLR improves diversity across tasks (creative writing, QA, reasoning) and models (Llama, Qwen, Gemma) with minimal quality loss.

Conclusion: SLR effectively addresses mode collapse in post-trained LLMs, enhancing diversity without extra cost or quality trade-offs.

Abstract: Post-training improves instruction-following and helpfulness of large language models (LLMs) but often reduces generation diversity, which leads to repetitive outputs in open-ended settings, a phenomenon known as mode collapse. Motivated by evidence that LLM layers play distinct functional roles, we hypothesize that mode collapse can be localized to specific layers and that restoring a carefully chosen range of layers to their pre-trained weights can recover diversity while maintaining high output quality. To validate this hypothesis and decide which layers to restore, we design a proxy task -- Constrained Random Character(CRC) -- with an explicit validity set and a natural diversity objective. Results on CRC reveal a clear diversity-validity trade-off across restoration ranges and identify configurations that increase diversity with minimal quality loss. Based on these findings, we propose Selective Layer Restoration (SLR), a training-free method that restores selected layers in a post-trained model to their pre-trained weights, yielding a hybrid model with the same architecture and parameter count, incurring no additional inference cost. Across three different tasks (creative writing, open-ended question answering, and multi-step reasoning) and three different model families (Llama, Qwen, and Gemma), we find SLR can consistently and substantially improve output diversity while maintaining high output quality.

TL;DR: compar:IA is an open-source platform by the French government to collect human preference data, primarily in French, addressing the lack of multilingual datasets for LLM training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in non-English languages due to limited pre-training and preference data. compar:IA aims to fill this gap by gathering large-scale, diverse French-language data.

Method: The platform uses a blind pairwise comparison interface to collect prompts and user judgments, with automated filtering for privacy and low friction.

Result: As of 2026-02-07, it has 600K prompts and 250K votes, mostly in French, and released three datasets under open licenses.

Conclusion: compar:IA serves as a model for multilingual data collection and aims to expand as an international public good for AI training and evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often show reduced performance, cultural alignment, and safety robustness in non-English languages, partly because English dominates both pre-training data and human preference alignment datasets. Training methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) require human preference data, which remains scarce and largely non-public for many languages beyond English. To address this gap, we introduce compar:IA, an open-source digital public service developed inside the French government and designed to collect large-scale human preference data from a predominantly French-speaking general audience. The platform uses a blind pairwise comparison interface to capture unconstrained, real-world prompts and user judgments across a diverse set of language models, while maintaining low participation friction and privacy-preserving automated filtering. As of 2026-02-07, compar:IA has collected over 600,000 free-form prompts and 250,000 preference votes, with approximately 89% of the data in French. We release three complementary datasets -- conversations, votes, and reactions -- under open licenses, and present initial analyses, including a French-language model leaderboard and user interaction patterns. Beyond the French context, compar:IA is evolving toward an international digital public good, offering reusable infrastructure for multilingual model training, evaluation, and the study of human-AI interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore resource-sensitive methods for controlling sentiment in AI-generated texts, addressing the challenges of existing approaches.

Method: Investigates various prompting techniques (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot) using Ekman's six basic emotions and compares them to fine-tuning.

Result: Prompt engineering effectively steers emotions in AI-generated texts, with Few-Shot prompting outperforming other techniques.

Conclusion: Provides insights for developing emotion-adaptive AI systems, highlighting the practicality of prompt engineering in data-constrained settings.

Abstract: The groundbreaking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for enhancing human-computer interaction through emotion-adaptive Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, deliberately controlling the sentiment in these systems remains challenging. The present study investigates the potential of prompt engineering for controlling sentiment in LLM-generated text, providing a resource-sensitive and accessible alternative to existing methods. Using Ekman's six basic emotions (e.g., joy, disgust), we examine various prompting techniques, including Zero-Shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting using gpt-3.5-turbo, and compare it to fine-tuning. Our results indicate that prompt engineering effectively steers emotions in AI-generated texts, offering a practical and cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning, especially in data-constrained settings. In this regard, Few-Shot prompting with human-written examples was the most effective among other techniques, likely due to the additional task-specific guidance. The findings contribute valuable insights towards developing emotion-adaptive AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current InfoSeeking agents struggle with maintaining focus and coherence during long-horizon exploration due to the fragility of plain-text context for tracking search states.

Method: TaS maps queries into structured table schemas stored in an external database, where rows represent candidates and columns denote constraints or required information, managing search states explicitly.

Result: TaS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across Deep Search, Wide Search, and DeepWide Search tasks, demonstrating robustness, efficiency, scalability, and flexibility.

Conclusion: TaS provides a unified and effective solution for long-horizon InfoSeeking tasks, with publicly released code and datasets.

Abstract: Current Information Seeking (InfoSeeking) agents struggle to maintain focus and coherence during long-horizon exploration, as tracking search states, including planning procedure and massive search results, within one plain-text context is inherently fragile. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Table-as-Search (TaS)}, a structured planning framework that reformulates the InfoSeeking task as a Table Completion task. TaS maps each query into a structured table schema maintained in an external database, where rows represent search candidates and columns denote constraints or required information. This table precisely manages the search states: filled cells strictly record the history and search results, while empty cells serve as an explicit search plan. Crucially, TaS unifies three distinct InfoSeeking tasks: Deep Search, Wide Search, and the challenging DeepWide Search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TaS significantly outperforms numerous state-of-the-art baselines across three kinds of benchmarks, including multi-agent framework and commercial systems. Furthermore, our analysis validates the TaS's superior robustness in long-horizon InfoSeeking, alongside its efficiency, scalability and flexibility. Code and datasets are publicly released at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Marco-Search-Agent.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the importance of reasoning fidelity in Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), introducing Spurious Correctness (S-Corr) as a metric and proposing R-Align to improve rationale alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating GenRM reasoning quality despite their preference prediction accuracy, ensuring better alignment of rationale with human judgments.

Method: Introduces S-Corr to measure reasoning fidelity and proposes R-Align, which trains GenRMs with gold judgments and explicitly supervises rationale alignment.

Result: Empirical results show high S-Corr even in competitive GenRMs, leading to policy degeneration. R-Align reduces S-Corr and improves actor performance across various tasks.

Conclusion: Reasoning fidelity is crucial for RLHF outcomes, and R-Align effectively enhances GenRM performance by aligning rationales with human judgments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) remains indispensable for aligning large language models (LLMs) in subjective domains. To enhance robustness, recent work shifts toward Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) that generate rationales before predicting preferences. Yet in GenRM training and evaluation, practice remains outcome-label-only, leaving reasoning quality unchecked. We show that reasoning fidelity-the consistency between a GenRM's preference decision and reference decision rationales-is highly predictive of downstream RLHF outcomes, beyond standard label accuracy. Specifically, we repurpose existing reward-model benchmarks to compute Spurious Correctness (S-Corr)-the fraction of label-correct decisions with rationales misaligned with golden judgments. Our empirical evaluation reveals substantial S-Corr even for competitive GenRMs, and higher S-Corr is associated with policy degeneration under optimization. To improve fidelity, we propose Rationale-Centric Alignment, R-Align, which augments training with gold judgments and explicitly supervises rationale alignment. R-Align reduces S-Corr on RM benchmarks and yields consistent gains in actor performance across STEM, coding, instruction following, and general tasks.

TL;DR: A data-driven approach using granular reasoning error taxonomies improves LLM error detection and enhances model training via reinforcement learning, achieving significant accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with reliably identifying errors in reasoning traces, especially in complex domains and without verifiable rewards, prompting the need for better error detection methods.

Method: Constructed highly granular reasoning error taxonomies (rubrics) to enhance LLM-driven error detection and used these rubrics to build stronger reward functions for reinforcement learning.

Result: Classification with error rubrics outperformed baselines in technical domains. Reward functions improved task accuracy by +45% and reduced the need for gold labels by 80%.

Conclusion: The approach extends reward rubrics from qualitative to quantitative correctness assessment, enabling models to solve complex problems without costly gold labels.

Abstract: An impediment to using Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning output verification is that LLMs struggle to reliably identify errors in thinking traces, particularly in long outputs, domains requiring expert knowledge, and problems without verifiable rewards. We propose a data-driven approach to automatically construct highly granular reasoning error taxonomies to enhance LLM-driven error detection on unseen reasoning traces. Our findings indicate that classification approaches that leverage these error taxonomies, or "rubrics", demonstrate strong error identification compared to baseline methods in technical domains like coding, math, and chemical engineering. These rubrics can be used to build stronger LLM-as-judge reward functions for reasoning model training via reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that these rewards have the potential to improve models' task accuracy on difficult domains over models trained by general LLMs-as-judges by +45%, and approach performance of models trained by verifiable rewards while using as little as 20% as many gold labels. Through our approach, we extend the usage of reward rubrics from assessing qualitative model behavior to assessing quantitative model correctness on tasks typically learned via RLVR rewards. This extension opens the door for teaching models to solve complex technical problems without a full dataset of gold labels, which are often highly costly to procure.

TL;DR: A VWSD framework uses CLIP to resolve lexical ambiguity by aligning text and images in a multimodal space, improving MRR and Hit Rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ambiguity challenges in LLMs by leveraging visual cues for better word sense disambiguation.

Method: Uses CLIP for multimodal embedding alignment, enriched textual embeddings via dual-channel prompts, and refined image embeddings with test-time augmentations.

Result: Enriched embeddings improved MRR (0.7227 to 0.7590) and Hit Rate (0.5810 to 0.6220); dual-channel prompting outperformed aggressive image augmentation.

Conclusion: Precise, CLIP-aligned prompts are effective for VWSD, while noisy external signals reduce semantic specificity.

Abstract: Ambiguity poses persistent challenges in natural language understanding for large language models (LLMs). To better understand how lexical ambiguity can be resolved through the visual domain, we develop an interpretable Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) framework. The model leverages CLIP to project ambiguous language and candidate images into a shared multimodal space. We enrich textual embeddings using a dual-channel ensemble of semantic and photo-based prompts with WordNet synonyms, while image embeddings are refined through robust test-time augmentations. We then use cosine similarity to determine the image that best aligns with the ambiguous text. When evaluated on the SemEval-2023 VWSD dataset, enriching the embeddings raises the MRR from 0.7227 to 0.7590 and the Hit Rate from 0.5810 to 0.6220. Ablation studies reveal that dual-channel prompting provides strong, low-latency performance, whereas aggressive image augmentation yields only marginal gains. Additional experiments with WordNet definitions and multilingual prompt ensembles further suggest that noisy external signals tend to dilute semantic specificity, reinforcing the effectiveness of precise, CLIP-aligned prompts for visual word sense disambiguation.

TL;DR: The paper explores how conceptual representations balance shared relational structure and task-specific subspaces, using number concepts and language models to show stable relational geometry and transformable subspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how conceptual representations can simultaneously support generalization (shared manifold) and minimize interference (orthogonal subspaces) across tasks.

Method: The study uses number concepts as a testbed and analyzes high-dimensional representations in language models, focusing on geometric relations and linear transformations between subspaces.

Result: Number representations maintain stable relational structures across tasks, with task-specific subspaces transformable via linear mappings.

Conclusion: Representations balance shared relational structure and functional flexibility, suggesting that understanding arises from task-specific transformations applied to a shared underlying geometry.

Abstract: A central question in cognitive science is whether conceptual representations converge onto a shared manifold to support generalization, or diverge into orthogonal subspaces to minimize task interference. While prior work has discovered evidence for both, a mechanistic account of how these properties coexist and transform across tasks remains elusive. We propose that representational sharing lies not in the concepts themselves, but in the geometric relations between them. Using number concepts as a testbed and language models as high-dimensional computational substrates, we show that number representations preserve a stable relational structure across tasks. Task-specific representations are embedded in distinct subspaces, with low-level features like magnitude and parity encoded along separable linear directions. Crucially, we find that these subspaces are largely transformable into one another via linear mappings, indicating that representations share relational structure despite being located in distinct subspaces. Together, these results provide a mechanistic lens of how language models balance the shared structure of number representation with functional flexibility. It suggests that understanding arises when task-specific transformations are applied to a shared underlying relational structure of conceptual representations.

Conclusion: SEMA provides a robust stress test for LLM safety and enables automatic redteaming to identify vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Multi-turn jailbreaks capture the real threat model for safety-aligned chatbots, where single-turn attacks are merely a special case. Yet existing approaches break under exploration complexity and intent drift. We propose SEMA, a simple yet effective framework that trains a multi-turn attacker without relying on any existing strategies or external data. SEMA comprises two stages. Prefilling self-tuning enables usable rollouts by fine-tuning on non-refusal, well-structured, multi-turn adversarial prompts that are self-generated with a minimal prefix, thereby stabilizing subsequent learning. Reinforcement learning with intent-drift-aware reward trains the attacker to elicit valid multi-turn adversarial prompts while maintaining the same harmful objective. We anchor harmful intent in multi-turn jailbreaks via an intent-drift-aware reward that combines intent alignment, compliance risk, and level of detail. Our open-loop attack regime avoids dependence on victim feedback, unifies single- and multi-turn settings, and reduces exploration complexity. Across multiple datasets, victim models, and jailbreak judges, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack success rates (ASR), outperforming all single-turn baselines, manually scripted and template-driven multi-turn baselines, as well as our SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) variants. For instance, SEMA performs an average $80.1\%$ ASR@1 across three closed-source and open-source victim models on AdvBench, 33.9% over SOTA. The approach is compact, reproducible, and transfers across targets, providing a stronger and more realistic stress test for large language model (LLM) safety and enabling automatic redteaming to expose and localize failure modes.

### [122] [Uncovering Cross-Objective Interference in Multi-Objective Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06869)
*Yining Lu,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies cross-objective interference in multi-objective alignment for LLMs, analyzes it using covariance laws, proposes CTWA to mitigate interference, and provides global convergence analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand and address the persistent issue where improving one objective in LLM alignment degrades others, formalizing this as cross-objective interference.

Method: The study formalizes interference, derives a local covariance law, adapts it for clipped surrogates, and proposes CTWA. It also includes global convergence analysis under the Polyak--Łojasiewicz condition.

Result: Cross-objective interference is pervasive and model-dependent. CTWA effectively mitigates interference by maintaining positive covariance between rewards and training signals.

Conclusion: The paper provides a systematic understanding of interference, offers a practical solution (CTWA), and establishes conditions for global convergence in non-convex optimization.

Abstract: We study a persistent failure mode in multi-objective alignment for large language models (LLMs): training improves performance on only a subset of objectives while causing others to degrade. We formalize this phenomenon as cross-objective interference and conduct the first systematic study across classic scalarization algorithms, showing that interference is pervasive and exhibits strong model dependence.
  To explain this phenomenon, we derive a local covariance law showing that an objective improves at first order when its reward exhibits positive covariance with the scalarized score. We extend this analysis to clipped surrogate objectives used in modern alignment, demonstrating that the covariance law remains valid under mild conditions despite clipping. Building on this analysis, we propose Covariance Targeted Weight Adaptation (CTWA), a plug-and-play method that maintains positive covariance between objective rewards and the training signal to effectively mitigate cross-objective interference. Finally, we complement these local improvement conditions with a global convergence analysis under the Polyak--Łojasiewicz condition, establishing when non-convex scalarized optimization achieves global convergence and how cross-objective interference depends on specific model geometric properties.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Halluverse-M^3 is a multilingual dataset analyzing hallucinations across languages, tasks, and categories, revealing performance gaps in lower-resource languages and challenging hallucination types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding of hallucinations in multilingual and generative settings, particularly beyond English-centric benchmarks.

Method: Introduces Halluverse-M^3, covering four languages and two tasks, with hallucinated outputs constructed via controlled editing and human validation.

Result: Question answering is easier than dialogue summarization; sentence-level hallucinations are hard. Performance drops in lower-resource languages like Hindi.

Conclusion: Halluverse-M^3 offers a realistic benchmark for multilingual hallucination research, highlighting challenges and gaps in current models.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models remain a persistent challenge, particularly in multilingual and generative settings where factual consistency is difficult to maintain. While recent models show strong performance on English-centric benchmarks, their behavior across languages, tasks, and hallucination types is not yet well understood. In this work, we introduce Halluverse-M^3, a dataset designed to enable systematic analysis of hallucinations across multiple languages, multiple generation tasks, and multiple hallucination categories. Halluverse-M^3 covers four languages, English, Arabic, Hindi, and Turkish, and supports two generation tasks: question answering and dialogue summarization. The dataset explicitly distinguishes between entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations. Hallucinated outputs are constructed through a controlled editing process and validated by human annotators, ensuring clear alignment between original content and hallucinated generations. Using this dataset, we evaluate a diverse set of contemporary open-source and proprietary language models on fine-grained hallucination detection. Our results show that question answering is consistently easier than dialogue summarization, while sentence-level hallucinations remain challenging even for the strongest models. Performance is highest in English and degrades in lower-resource languages, with Hindi exhibiting the lowest detection accuracy. Overall, Halluverse-M^3 provides a realistic and challenging benchmark for studying hallucinations in multilingual, multi-task settings. We release the dataset to support future research on hallucination detection and mitigation\footnote{https://huggingface.co/datasets/sabdalja/HalluVerse-M3}.

*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comprehensive study on Turkish subword tokenization comparing tokenizer families, vocabulary sizes, and corpus sizes, with a focus on morphological fidelity and vocabulary efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization in morphologically rich languages (MRLs) like Turkish poses challenges due to agglutination. Prior studies lack systematic control and comprehensive evaluation.

Method: Varied vocabulary size and tokenizer training corpus size; compared WordPiece, morphology-level, and character baselines under matched budgets; evaluated across semantic, syntactic, and morphology-sensitive tasks.

Result: Introduced a morphology-aware diagnostic toolkit and identified when character-level or morphology-level tokenization is beneficial.

Conclusion: Provides actionable guidance for tokenizer design in MRLs and establishes a reproducible framework for future research.

Abstract: Tokenization is a pivotal design choice for neural language modeling in morphologically rich languages (MRLs) such as Turkish, where productive agglutination challenges both vocabulary efficiency and morphological fidelity. Prior studies have explored tokenizer families and vocabulary sizes but typically (i) vary vocabulary without systematically controlling the tokenizer's training corpus, (ii) provide limited intrinsic diagnostics, and (iii) evaluate a narrow slice of downstream tasks. We present the first comprehensive, principled study of Turkish subword tokenization; a "subwords manifest", that jointly varies vocabulary size and tokenizer training corpus size (data and vocabulary coupling), compares multiple tokenizer families under matched parameter budgets (WordPiece, morphology level, and character baselines), and evaluates across semantic (NLI, STS, sentiment analysis, NER), syntactic (POS, dependency parsing), and morphology-sensitive probes. To explain why tokenizers succeed or fail, we introduce a morphology-aware diagnostic toolkit that goes beyond coarse aggregates to boundary-level micro/macro F1, decoupled lemma atomicity vs. surface boundary hits, over/under-segmentation indices, character/word edit distances (CER/WER), continuation rates, and affix-type coverage and token-level atomicity. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) a systematic investigation of the vocabulary-corpus-success triad; (ii) a unified, morphology-aware evaluation framework linking intrinsic diagnostics to extrinsic outcomes; (iii) controlled comparisons identifying when character-level and morphology-level tokenization pay off; and (iv) an open-source release of evaluation code, tokenizer pipelines, and models. As the first work of its kind, this "subwords manifest" delivers actionable guidance for building effective tokenizers in MRLs and establishes a reproducible foundation for future research.

*Lizhuo Luo,Zhuoran Shi,Jiajun Luo,Zhi Wang,Shen Ren,Wenya Wang,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DAWN is a training-free, dependency-aware decoding method for fast dLLM inference, improving speed by 1.80-8.06x without sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parallel decoding strategies for dLLMs are limited by the quality-speed trade-off and fail to model inter-token dependencies, leading to degraded outputs.

Method: DAWN extracts token dependencies and uses a dependency graph to select reliable unmasking positions, enabling high parallelism with minimal quality loss.

Result: DAWN achieves inference speedups of 1.80-8.06x over baselines while maintaining generation quality.

Conclusion: DAWN effectively addresses the challenge of inter-token dependencies in parallel decoding, offering a scalable solution for efficient dLLM inference.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown advantages in text generation, particularly due to their inherent ability for parallel decoding. However, constrained by the quality--speed trade-off, existing inference solutions adopt conservative parallel strategies, leaving substantial efficiency potential underexplored. A core challenge is that parallel decoding assumes each position can be filled independently, but tokens are often semantically coupled. Thus, the correct choice at one position constrains valid choices at others. Without modeling these inter-token dependencies, parallel strategies produce deteriorated outputs. Motivated by this insight, we propose DAWN, a training-free, dependency-aware decoding method for fast dLLM inference. DAWN extracts token dependencies and leverages two key motivations: (1) positions dependent on unmasked certain positions become more reliable, (2) simultaneously unmasking strongly coupled uncertain positions induces errors. Given those findings, DAWN leverages a dependency graph to select more reliable unmasking positions at each iteration, achieving high parallelism with negligible loss in generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that DAWN speedups the inference by 1.80-8.06x over baselines while preserving the generation quality.

*Yuchen Yan,Liang Jiang,Jin Jiang,Shuaicheng Li,Zujie Wen,Zhiqiang Zhang,Jun Zhou,Jian Shao,Yueting Zhuang,Yongliang Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InftyThink+ is an RL framework optimizing iterative reasoning, improving accuracy and efficiency over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses issues in large reasoning models like quadratic cost, context limits, and degraded reasoning by optimizing summarization and continuation.

Method: Uses a two-stage RL framework with supervised cold-start and trajectory-level RL to learn summarization and reasoning decisions.

Result: Improves accuracy by 21% on AIME24, reduces latency, and accelerates training, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: InftyThink+ enhances reasoning efficiency and performance, demonstrating better generalization and reduced costs.

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve strong performance by scaling inference-time chain-of-thought, but this paradigm suffers from quadratic cost, context length limits, and degraded reasoning due to lost-in-the-middle effects. Iterative reasoning mitigates these issues by periodically summarizing intermediate thoughts, yet existing methods rely on supervised learning or fixed heuristics and fail to optimize when to summarize, what to preserve, and how to resume reasoning. We propose InftyThink+, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that optimizes the entire iterative reasoning trajectory, building on model-controlled iteration boundaries and explicit summarization. InftyThink+ adopts a two-stage training scheme with supervised cold-start followed by trajectory-level reinforcement learning, enabling the model to learn strategic summarization and continuation decisions. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B show that InftyThink+ improves accuracy by 21% on AIME24 and outperforms conventional long chain-of-thought reinforcement learning by a clear margin, while also generalizing better to out-of-distribution benchmarks. Moreover, InftyThink+ significantly reduces inference latency and accelerates reinforcement learning training, demonstrating improved reasoning efficiency alongside stronger performance.

*Zhuoming Chen,Hongyi Liu,Yang Zhou,Haizhong Zheng,Beidi Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Jackpot uses Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to reduce distribution mismatch in RL for LLMs, improving stability and efficiency compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and instability in reinforcement learning for large language models due to distribution mismatch when decoupling rollout generation from policy optimization.

Method: Proposes Jackpot framework with OBRS, unified training objective for policy and rollout models, and efficient system implementation via top-$k$ probability estimation and batch-level bias correction.

Result: Theoretical analysis confirms OBRS reduces distribution discrepancy; empirical results show improved stability and performance comparable to on-policy RL for Qwen3-8B-Base.

Conclusion: OBRS-based alignment enables practical decoupling of rollout generation from policy optimization in RL for LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) remains expensive, particularly because the rollout is expensive. Decoupling rollout generation from policy optimization (e.g., leveraging a more efficient model to rollout) could enable substantial efficiency gains, yet doing so introduces a severe distribution mismatch that destabilizes learning. We propose Jackpot, a framework that leverages Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to directly reduce the discrepancy between the rollout model and the evolving policy. Jackpot integrates a principled OBRS procedure, a unified training objective that jointly updates the policy and rollout models, and an efficient system implementation enabled by top-$k$ probability estimation and batch-level bias correction. Our theoretical analysis shows that OBRS consistently moves the rollout distribution closer to the target distribution under a controllable acceptance budget. Empirically, \sys substantially improves training stability compared to importance-sampling baselines, achieving performance comparable to on-policy RL when training Qwen3-8B-Base for up to 300 update steps of batchsize 64. Taken together, our results show that OBRS-based alignment brings us a step closer to practical and effective decoupling of rollout generation from policy optimization for RL for LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper surveys reasoning failures in LLMs, categorizing them and offering mitigation strategies to enhance reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' success, they exhibit reasoning failures even in simple scenarios, necessitating a systematic study to understand and address these shortcomings.

Method: The authors introduce a categorization framework for reasoning (embodied vs. non-embodied, informal vs. formal) and classify failures into fundamental, application-specific, and robustness issues.

Result: The survey provides definitions, root causes, and mitigation strategies for each failure type, unifying fragmented research efforts.

Conclusion: The work offers insights into LLM reasoning weaknesses and guides future research, accompanied by a GitHub repository for further exploration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities, achieving impressive results across a wide range of tasks. Despite these advances, significant reasoning failures persist, occurring even in seemingly simple scenarios. To systematically understand and address these shortcomings, we present the first comprehensive survey dedicated to reasoning failures in LLMs. We introduce a novel categorization framework that distinguishes reasoning into embodied and non-embodied types, with the latter further subdivided into informal (intuitive) and formal (logical) reasoning. In parallel, we classify reasoning failures along a complementary axis into three types: fundamental failures intrinsic to LLM architectures that broadly affect downstream tasks; application-specific limitations that manifest in particular domains; and robustness issues characterized by inconsistent performance across minor variations. For each reasoning failure, we provide a clear definition, analyze existing studies, explore root causes, and present mitigation strategies. By unifying fragmented research efforts, our survey provides a structured perspective on systemic weaknesses in LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights and guiding future research towards building stronger, more reliable, and robust reasoning capabilities. We additionally release a comprehensive collection of research works on LLM reasoning failures, as a GitHub repository at https://github.com/Peiyang-Song/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-Failures, to provide an easy entry point to this area.

*Pierriccardo Olivieri,Fausto Lasca,Alessandro Gianola,Matteo Papini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework using LTLfMT for specifying non-Markovian rewards in MDPs with large state spaces, addressing challenges via tractable fragments and HER-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for expressive logic to handle complex tasks over unstructured data without manual encoding, overcoming limitations of classical temporal logic.

Method: Proposes LTLfMT for richer specifications, identifies tractable fragments, and uses HER-based reward machines to tackle reward sparsity.

Result: Successful application in continuous-control settings, demonstrating HER's role in solving complex tasks with natural specifications.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines theoretical tractability with practical HER-based methods for complex task specification.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework for the logical specification of non-Markovian rewards in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with large state spaces. Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity. We evaluate this approach to a continuous-control setting using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, showing that it enables natural specification of complex tasks. Experimental results show how a tailored implementation of HER is fundamental in solving tasks with complex goals.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines whether large language models (LLMs) act as rational utility maximizers in high-stakes domains, focusing on medical diagnosis challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in critical domains, but their decision-making logic lacks interpretability. The study aims to assess if LLMs exhibit rational behavior with coherent beliefs and stable preferences.

Method: The researchers analyze LLM behaviors in diagnosis problems, comparing their inferences to ideal Bayesian utility maximization. They establish falsifiable conditions to test if reported probabilities align with rational agent beliefs.

Result: Findings reveal discrepancies between LLM inferences and rational utility maximization, highlighting limitations in their decision logic.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for further research to enhance LLM reliability in high-stakes decision-making, such as medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in high-stakes domains where optimal actions depend on both uncertainty about the world and consideration of utilities of different outcomes, yet their decision logic remains difficult to interpret. We study whether LLMs are rational utility maximizers with coherent beliefs and stable preferences. We consider behaviors of models for diagnosis challenge problems. The results provide insights about the relationship of LLM inferences to ideal Bayesian utility maximization for elicited probabilities and observed actions. Our approach provides falsifiable conditions under which the reported probabilities \emph{cannot} correspond to the true beliefs of any rational agent. We apply this methodology to multiple medical diagnostic domains with evaluations across several LLMs. We discuss implications of the results and directions forward for uses of LLMs in guiding high-stakes decisions.

TL;DR: GrAlgoBench is introduced as a benchmark for evaluating Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) using graph algorithm problems, revealing key weaknesses like context-length dependency and over-thinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LRMs in reasoning tasks are limited, lacking long-context evaluation, sufficient challenge, and programmatically verifiable answers.

Method: GrAlgoBench evaluates LRMs through graph algorithm problems, which require long-context reasoning, allow controlled difficulty, and support standardized evaluation.

Result: LRMs show deteriorating accuracy with longer contexts (below 50% for graphs over 120 nodes) and suffer from over-thinking due to ineffective self-verification.

Conclusion: GrAlgoBench exposes LRM limitations and serves as a rigorous, multidimensional testbed for advancing reasoning studies.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have advanced rapidly; however, existing benchmarks in mathematics, code, and common-sense reasoning remain limited. They lack long-context evaluation, offer insufficient challenge, and provide answers that are difficult to verify programmatically. We introduce GrAlgoBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs through graph algorithm problems. Such problems are particularly well suited for probing reasoning abilities: they demand long-context reasoning, allow fine-grained control of difficulty levels, and enable standardized, programmatic evaluation. Across nine tasks, our systematic experiments reveal two major weaknesses of current LRMs. First, accuracy deteriorates sharply as context length increases, falling below 50% once graphs exceed 120 nodes. This degradation is driven by frequent execution errors, weak memory, and redundant reasoning. Second, LRMs suffer from an over-thinking phenomenon, primarily caused by extensive yet largely ineffective self-verification, which inflates reasoning traces without improving correctness. By exposing these limitations, GrAlgoBench establishes graph algorithm problems as a rigorous, multidimensional, and practically relevant testbed for advancing the study of reasoning in LRMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Bklight999/GrAlgoBench.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Trifuse is a novel framework for GUI grounding that integrates attention, OCR, and icon captions, reducing reliance on annotated data and improving performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for GUI grounding are data-intensive and generalize poorly, while attention-based alternatives lack reliable spatial anchors.

Method: Trifuse combines attention mechanisms with OCR-derived textual cues and icon-level caption semantics using a CS fusion strategy.

Result: Trifuse shows strong performance without fine-tuning, outperforming existing methods on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: Trifuse effectively improves GUI grounding by leveraging complementary spatial anchors and reduces the need for annotated data.

Abstract: GUI grounding maps natural language instructions to the correct interface elements, serving as the perception foundation for GUI agents. Existing approaches predominantly rely on fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using large-scale GUI datasets to predict target element coordinates, which is data-intensive and generalizes poorly to unseen interfaces. Recent attention-based alternatives exploit localization signals in MLLMs attention mechanisms without task-specific fine-tuning, but suffer from low reliability due to the lack of explicit and complementary spatial anchors in GUI images. To address this limitation, we propose Trifuse, an attention-based grounding framework that explicitly integrates complementary spatial anchors. Trifuse integrates attention, OCR-derived textual cues, and icon-level caption semantics via a Consensus-SinglePeak (CS) fusion strategy that enforces cross-modal agreement while retaining sharp localization peaks. Extensive evaluations on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that Trifuse achieves strong performance without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive annotated data. Moreover, ablation studies reveal that incorporating OCR and caption cues consistently improves attention-based grounding performance across different backbones, highlighting its effectiveness as a general framework for GUI grounding.

TL;DR: DEPO introduces a difficulty estimator to optimize training efficiency, reducing rollout costs by 2x without losing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address gradient signal attenuation in GRPO and computational inefficiency in variants like DAPO.

Method: DEPO uses an online Difficulty Estimator to dynamically assess and filter training data before rollouts.

Result: Achieves up to 2x reduction in rollout costs while maintaining model performance.

Conclusion: DEPO lowers computational barriers for training high-performance reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), exemplified by DeepSeek-R1, have underscored the potential of scaling inference-time compute through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, GRPO frequently suffers from gradient signal attenuation when encountering problems that are either too trivial or overly complex. In these scenarios, the disappearance of inter-group advantages makes the gradient signal susceptible to noise, thereby jeopardizing convergence stability. While variants like DAPO attempt to rectify gradient vanishing, they do not alleviate the substantial computational overhead incurred by exhaustive rollouts on low-utility samples. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-Estimated Policy Optimization (DEPO), a novel framework designed to optimize the efficiency and robustness of reasoning alignment. DEPO integrates an online Difficulty Estimator that dynamically assesses and filters training data before the rollout phase. This mechanism ensures that computational resources are prioritized for samples with high learning potential. Empirical results demonstrate that DEPO achieves up to a 2x reduction in rollout costs without compromising model performance. Our approach significantly lowers the computational barrier for training high-performance reasoning models, offering a more sustainable path for reasoning scaling. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: QA-Token improves tokenization by incorporating data reliability, outperforming traditional methods in noisy datasets like genomics and finance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tokenization methods ignore signal quality, limiting effectiveness in noisy real-world datasets.

Method: QA-Token uses bilevel optimization, reinforcement learning with quality-aware rewards, and Gumbel-Softmax relaxation.

Result: Achieves 6.7% F1 gain in genomics, 30% Sharpe ratio improvement in finance, and reduces tokens by 15%.

Conclusion: QA-Token enables effective foundation model training on noisy datasets without inference overhead.

Abstract: Current tokenization methods process sequential data without accounting for signal quality, limiting their effectiveness on noisy real-world corpora. We present QA-Token (Quality-Aware Tokenization), which incorporates data reliability directly into vocabulary construction. We make three key contributions: (i) a bilevel optimization formulation that jointly optimizes vocabulary construction and downstream performance, (ii) a reinforcement learning approach that learns merge policies through quality-aware rewards with convergence guarantees, and (iii) an adaptive parameter learning mechanism via Gumbel-Softmax relaxation for end-to-end optimization. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates consistent improvements: genomics (6.7 percentage point F1 gain in variant calling over BPE), finance (30% Sharpe ratio improvement). At foundation scale, we tokenize a pretraining corpus comprising 1.7 trillion base-pairs and achieve state-of-the-art pathogen detection (94.53 MCC) while reducing token count by 15%. We unlock noisy real-world corpora, spanning petabases of genomic sequences and terabytes of financial time series, for foundation model training with zero inference overhead.

### [135] [Intrinsic Stability Limits of Autoregressive Reasoning: Structural Consequences for Long-Horizon Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06413)
*Hsien-Jyh Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that long-horizon reasoning breakdowns in LLMs stem from process-level instability in autoregressive generation, not just task complexity. It introduces Theorem A, showing exponential decay in decision advantage with execution length, requiring discrete segmentation for stability. Empirical results support this theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explain why LLMs struggle with long-horizon tasks, challenging conventional views that focus solely on task complexity. It proposes instability in autoregressive generation as the root cause.

Method: The authors derive Theorem A to show decision advantage decay in autoregressive reasoning and validate their claims through empirical studies in synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks.

Result: Findings reveal performance cliffs aligning with theoretical predictions, highlighting exponential decay in reasoning stability with longer execution chains and advocating for discrete segmentation (e.g., DAGs).

Conclusion: Pure autoregressive architectures have inherent limits for long-horizon reasoning. Future systems may need structured governance over scaling to maintain coherence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities, yet their performance often deteriorates sharply in long-horizon tasks, exhibiting systematic breakdown beyond certain scales. Conventional explanations primarily attribute this phenomenon to task complexity, such as combinatorial search explosion or long-term credit assignment challenges. In this work, we argue that these explanations are incomplete: even in linear, unbranched tasks without semantic ambiguity, autoregressive execution is subject to an intrinsic stability limit.
  We propose that the fundamental constraint on long-horizon reasoning arises from process-level instability in autoregressive generation rather than solely from search or task complexity, reframing long-horizon reasoning as a problem of structural governance. We derive Theorem~A, showing that decision advantage in single-path autoregressive reasoning decays exponentially with execution length, imposing a fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. This result implies a structural consequence: stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
  Empirical studies in both synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings provide a dynamical perspective on long-horizon reasoning failure and suggest new limitations on maintaining long-term coherence under purely autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we highlight that short-horizon evaluation protocols may obscure structural instability, indicating a potential shift from scaling toward structured governance in future reasoning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and unlock the untapped potential of edge-scale LLMs (4B parameters) by addressing key performance bottlenecks.

Method: Proposes AgentCPM-Explore with a holistic training framework: parameter-space fusion, reward denoising, and contextual refinement.

Result: Achieves SOTA among 4B-class models, matches or surpasses 8B-class models, and outperforms larger models in benchmarks (e.g., 97.09% accuracy on GAIA).

Conclusion: Edge-scale models' limitations stem from inference instability, not capability ceilings. AgentCPM-Explore demonstrates their underestimated potential.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown remarkable potential for solving complex tasks, existing systems remain heavily reliant on large-scale models, leaving the capabilities of edge-scale models largely underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on training agentic models at the 4B-parameter scale. We identify three primary bottlenecks hindering the performance of edge-scale models: catastrophic forgetting during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), sensitivity to reward signal noise during Reinforcement Learning (RL), and reasoning degradation caused by redundant information in long-context scenarios. To address the issues, we propose AgentCPM-Explore, a compact 4B agent model with high knowledge density and strong exploration capability. We introduce a holistic training framework featuring parameter-space model fusion, reward signal denoising, and contextual information refinement. Through deep exploration, AgentCPM-Explore achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among 4B-class models, matches or surpasses 8B-class SOTA models on four benchmarks, and even outperforms larger-scale models such as Claude-4.5-Sonnet or DeepSeek-v3.2 in five benchmarks. Notably, AgentCPM-Explore achieves 97.09% accuracy on GAIA text-based tasks under pass@64. These results provide compelling evidence that the bottleneck for edge-scale models is not their inherent capability ceiling, but rather their inference stability. Based on our well-established training framework, AgentCPM-Explore effectively unlocks the significant, yet previously underestimated, potential of edge-scale models.

*Lanbo Lin,Jiayao Liu,Tianyuan Yang,Li Cai,Yuanwu Xu,Lei Wei,Sicong Xie,Guannan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JADE is a two-layer evaluation framework combining static expert-encoded criteria with dynamic claim-level assessment to improve AI task evaluation rigor and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the dilemma between rigor and flexibility in evaluating agentic AI by mimicking human expert evaluation processes.

Method: Uses Layer 1 for predefined evaluation skills and Layer 2 for dynamic, claim-level assessment with evidence-dependency gating.

Result: Demonstrates improved stability, identifies critical failure modes, and aligns well with expert rubrics across domains like business and medicine.

Conclusion: JADE effectively balances rigor and flexibility, outperforming holistic LLM-based evaluators in professional task assessments.

Abstract: Evaluating agentic AI on open-ended professional tasks faces a fundamental dilemma between rigor and flexibility. Static rubrics provide rigorous, reproducible assessment but fail to accommodate diverse valid response strategies, while LLM-as-a-judge approaches adapt to individual responses yet suffer from instability and bias. Human experts address this dilemma by combining domain-grounded principles with dynamic, claim-level assessment. Inspired by this process, we propose JADE, a two-layer evaluation framework. Layer 1 encodes expert knowledge as a predefined set of evaluation skills, providing stable evaluation criteria. Layer 2 performs report-specific, claim-level evaluation to flexibly assess diverse reasoning strategies, with evidence-dependency gating to invalidate conclusions built on refuted claims. Experiments on BizBench show that JADE improves evaluation stability and reveals critical agent failure modes missed by holistic LLM-based evaluators. We further demonstrate strong alignment with expert-authored rubrics and effective transfer to a medical-domain benchmark, validating JADE across professional domains.

### [138] [HyPER: Bridging Exploration and Exploitation for Scalable LLM Reasoning with Hypothesis Path Expansion and Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06527)
*Shengxuan Qiu,Haochen Huang,Shuzhang Zhong,Pengfei Zuo,Meng Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HyPER dynamically balances exploration and exploitation in multi-path reasoning, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rigidly handle exploration-exploitation trade-offs, often leading to inefficiencies or interference with reasoning.

Method: HyPER uses a dynamic expand-reduce control policy with online transition, token-level refinement, and length-aware aggregation.

Result: HyPER improves accuracy by 8-10% and reduces token usage by 25-40%.

Conclusion: HyPER offers a superior accuracy-compute trade-off for multi-path reasoning.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute with multi-path chain-of-thought improves reasoning accuracy, but its effectiveness depends critically on the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing approaches address this trade-off in rigid ways: tree-structured search hard-codes exploration through brittle expansion rules that interfere with post-trained reasoning, while parallel reasoning over-explores redundant hypothesis paths and relies on weak answer selection. Motivated by the observation that the optimal balance is phase-dependent and that correct and incorrect reasoning paths often diverge only at late stages, we reformulate test-time scaling as a dynamic expand-reduce control problem over a pool of hypotheses. We propose HyPER, a training-free online control policy for multi-path decoding in mixture-of-experts models that reallocates computation under a fixed budget using lightweight path statistics. HyPER consists of an online controller that transitions from exploration to exploitation as the hypothesis pool evolves, a token-level refinement mechanism that enables efficient generation-time exploitation without full-path resampling, and a length- and confidence-aware aggregation strategy for reliable answer-time exploitation. Experiments on four mixture-of-experts language models across diverse reasoning benchmarks show that HyPER consistently achieves a superior accuracy-compute trade-off, improving accuracy by 8 to 10 percent while reducing token usage by 25 to 40 percent.

TL;DR: AgentCPM-Report is a lightweight, high-performing local solution for generating deep research reports, using a dynamic outline revision framework (WARP) and an 8B-parameter agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep research systems rely on closed-source or online large models, posing deployment barriers and privacy concerns. AgentCPM-Report addresses these issues with a local solution.

Method: The framework uses WARP for dynamic outline revision, alternating between Evidence-Based Drafting and Reasoning-Driven Deepening. Training involves cold-start, atomic skill RL, and holistic pipeline RL.

Result: AgentCPM-Report outperforms leading closed-source systems on benchmarks like DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and DeepResearch Gym, especially in Insight.

Conclusion: AgentCPM-Report offers a practical, effective alternative to closed-source systems, combining lightweight design with high performance and addressing privacy concerns.

Abstract: Generating deep research reports requires large-scale information acquisition and the synthesis of insight-driven analysis, posing a significant challenge for current language models. Most existing approaches follow a plan-then-write paradigm, whose performance heavily depends on the quality of the initial outline. However, constructing a comprehensive outline itself demands strong reasoning ability, causing current deep research systems to rely almost exclusively on closed-source or online large models. This reliance raises practical barriers to deployment and introduces safety and privacy concerns for user-authored data. In this work, we present AgentCPM-Report, a lightweight yet high-performing local solution composed of a framework that mirrors the human writing process and an 8B-parameter deep research agent. Our framework uses a Writing As Reasoning Policy (WARP), which enables models to dynamically revise outlines during report generation. Under this policy, the agent alternates between Evidence-Based Drafting and Reasoning-Driven Deepening, jointly supporting information acquisition, knowledge refinement, and iterative outline evolution. To effectively equip small models with this capability, we introduce a Multi-Stage Agentic Training strategy, consisting of cold-start, atomic skill RL, and holistic pipeline RL. Experiments on DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and DeepResearch Gym demonstrate that AgentCPM-Report outperforms leading closed-source systems, with substantial gains in Insight.

*Tianyi Hu,Qingxu Fu,Yanxi Chen,Zhaoyang Liu,Bolin Ding*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes RL convergence issues in multi-turn LLM training, proposes SeeUPO for guaranteed convergence, and shows significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL algorithms lack verified convergence guarantees in multi-turn LLM training, causing instability and suboptimal policies.

Method: Introduces SeeUPO, a critic-free RL approach modeling multi-turn interactions as sequential bandit problems with reverse-order updates.

Result: SeeUPO achieves 24.1%-54.6% improvements over benchmarks with superior stability.

Conclusion: SeeUPO provides a robust solution for multi-turn RL convergence, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as the predominant paradigm for training large language model (LLM)-based AI agents. However, existing backbone RL algorithms lack verified convergence guarantees in agentic scenarios, especially in multi-turn settings, which can lead to training instability and failure to converge to optimal policies.
  In this paper, we systematically analyze how different combinations of policy update mechanisms and advantage estimation methods affect convergence properties in single/multi-turn scenarios. We find that REINFORCE with Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE) can converge to the globally optimal under undiscounted conditions, but the combination of PPO & GRAE breaks PPO's original monotonic improvement property. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mainstream backbone RL algorithms cannot simultaneously achieve both critic-free and convergence guarantees in multi-turn scenarios.
  To address this, we propose SeeUPO (Sequence-level Sequential Update Policy Optimization), a critic-free approach with convergence guarantees for multi-turn interactions. SeeUPO models multi-turn interaction as sequentially executed multi-agent bandit problems. Through turn-by-turn sequential policy updates in reverse execution order, it ensures monotonic improvement and convergence to global optimal solution via backward induction.
  Experiments on AppWorld and BFCL v4 demonstrate SeeUPO's substantial improvements over existing backbone algorithms: relative gains of 43.3%-54.6% on Qwen3-14B and 24.1%-41.9% on Qwen2.5-14B (averaged across benchmarks), along with superior training stability.

*Farooq Ahmad Wani,Alessandro Suglia,Rohit Saxena,Aryo Pradipta Gema,Wai-Chung Kwan,Fazl Barez,Maria Sofia Bucarelli,Fabrizio Silvestri,Pasquale Minervini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques the assumption that stable predictions in Vision Language Models (VLMs) indicate stable multimodal processing. It introduces a new evaluation framework assessing internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness, revealing three failure modes in VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current assessments of VLMs rely on output-level invariance, assuming stable predictions reflect stable processing. This work argues this is insufficient and proposes a deeper evaluation.

Method: A representation-aware and frequency-aware framework measures embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness. Applied to VLMs on SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets.

Result: Three failure modes identified: significant internal drift despite stable outputs, no robustness improvement with model scale, and task-dependent perturbation effects.

Conclusion: Standard evaluations overlook critical instability in VLMs. The proposed framework reveals nuanced failures, emphasizing the need for more comprehensive assessments.

Abstract: The robustness of Vision Language Models (VLMs) is commonly assessed through output-level invariance, implicitly assuming that stable predictions reflect stable multimodal processing. In this work, we argue that this assumption is insufficient. We introduce a representation-aware and frequency-aware evaluation framework that measures internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness (spatial consistency of vision tokens), alongside standard label-based metrics. Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries. Third, we find that perturbations affect tasks differently: they harm reasoning when they disrupt how models combine coarse and fine visual cues, but on the hallucination benchmarks, they can reduce false positives by making models generate more conservative answers.

*Thiviyan Thanapalasingam,Antonis Vozikis,Peter Bloem,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARK introduces autoregressive models for generating semantically valid knowledge graphs by learning implicit constraints from data, achieving high validity scores and enabling controlled generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of generating semantically coherent knowledge graphs by capturing interdependencies across triples without relying on explicit rule supervision.

Method: ARK treats graphs as sequences of triples, learning semantic constraints like type consistency and relational patterns directly from data. It includes SAIL, a variational extension for controlled generation.

Result: ARK achieves 89.2% to 100.0% semantic validity on IntelliGraphs and demonstrates that model capacity (hidden dimensionality >= 64) is more critical than architectural depth.

Conclusion: Autoregressive models like ARK are effective for KG generation, with practical applications in knowledge base completion and query answering, offering computational efficiency.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) generation requires models to learn complex semantic dependencies between triples while maintaining domain validity constraints. Unlike link prediction, which scores triples independently, generative models must capture interdependencies across entire subgraphs to produce semantically coherent structures. We present ARK (Auto-Regressive Knowledge Graph Generation), a family of autoregressive models that generate KGs by treating graphs as sequences of (head, relation, tail) triples. ARK learns implicit semantic constraints directly from data, including type consistency, temporal validity, and relational patterns, without explicit rule supervision. On the IntelliGraphs benchmark, our models achieve 89.2% to 100.0% semantic validity across diverse datasets while generating novel graphs not seen during training. We also introduce SAIL, a variational extension of ARK that enables controlled generation through learned latent representations, supporting both unconditional sampling and conditional completion from partial graphs. Our analysis reveals that model capacity (hidden dimensionality >= 64) is more critical than architectural depth for KG generation, with recurrent architectures achieving comparable validity to transformer-based alternatives while offering substantial computational efficiency. These results demonstrate that autoregressive models provide an effective framework for KG generation, with practical applications in knowledge base completion and query answering.

*Alessandro Abate,Giuseppe De Giacomo,Mathias Jackermeier,Jan Kretínský,Maximilian Prokop,Christoph Weinhuber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel task embedding technique for multi-task RL using LTL formulae, leveraging semantic translations to automata, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning a universal policy for arbitrary tasks specified by LTL formulae, which are widely used in formal methods.

Method: Introduces a task embedding technique using semantically labelled automata derived from LTL-to-automata translations, enabling efficient computation and expressive policy conditioning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and scales to complex LTL specifications where existing methods fail.

Conclusion: The approach successfully leverages semantic LTL translations for scalable and expressive multi-task RL.

Abstract: We study multi-task reinforcement learning (RL), a setting in which an agent learns a single, universal policy capable of generalising to arbitrary, possibly unseen tasks. We consider tasks specified as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulae, which are commonly used in formal methods to specify properties of systems, and have recently been successfully adopted in RL. In this setting, we present a novel task embedding technique leveraging a new generation of semantic LTL-to-automata translations, originally developed for temporal synthesis. The resulting semantically labelled automata contain rich, structured information in each state that allow us to (i) compute the automaton efficiently on-the-fly, (ii) extract expressive task embeddings used to condition the policy, and (iii) naturally support full LTL. Experimental results in a variety of domains demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and is able to scale to complex specifications where existing methods fail.

### [144] [Wild Guesses and Mild Guesses in Active Concept Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06818)
*Anirudh Chari,Neil Pattanaik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores active concept learning in humans, comparing a Rational Active Learner (maximizing information gain) and the human-like Positive Test Strategy (PTS). PTS, though suboptimal, outperforms on simple concepts due to avoiding a 'support-mismatch trap' from boundary queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the trade-offs in active concept learning between informativeness and hypothesis stability, especially when using neuro-symbolic Bayesian learners with LLM-generated hypotheses.

Method: The study uses a neuro-symbolic Bayesian learner with LLM-generated executable programs. It compares Rational Active Learner (EIG) and Positive Test Strategy (PTS) across concept-learning tasks in the Number Game.

Result: EIG is effective for complex rules requiring falsification but underperforms on simple concepts due to a support-mismatch trap. PTS, though information-suboptimal, maintains proposal validity and converges faster on simple rules.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that 'confirmation bias' (PTS) may be a rational adaptation for tractable inference in sparse, open-ended hypothesis spaces, rather than a cognitive error.

Abstract: Human concept learning is typically active: learners choose which instances to query or test in order to reduce uncertainty about an underlying rule or category. Active concept learning must balance informativeness of queries against the stability of the learner that generates and scores hypotheses. We study this trade-off in a neuro-symbolic Bayesian learner whose hypotheses are executable programs proposed by a large language model (LLM) and reweighted by Bayesian updating. We compare a Rational Active Learner that selects queries to maximize approximate expected information gain (EIG) and the human-like Positive Test Strategy (PTS) that queries instances predicted to be positive under the current best hypothesis. Across concept-learning tasks in the classic Number Game, EIG is effective when falsification is necessary (e.g., compound or exception-laden rules), but underperforms on simple concepts. We trace this failure to a support mismatch between the EIG policy and the LLM proposal distribution: highly diagnostic boundary queries drive the posterior toward regions where the generator produces invalid or overly specific programs, yielding a support-mismatch trap in the particle approximation. PTS is information-suboptimal but tends to maintain proposal validity by selecting "safe" queries, leading to faster convergence on simple rules. Our results suggest that "confirmation bias" may not be a cognitive error, but rather a rational adaptation for maintaining tractable inference in the sparse, open-ended hypothesis spaces characteristic of human thought.

TL;DR: ScaleEnv introduces a framework to create diverse, scalable, and interactive environments for training generalist agents, improving performance on unseen benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity and limitations of existing interactive environments for training adaptable agents.

Method: ScaleEnv constructs environments from scratch using procedural testing, tool dependency graph expansion, and executable action verification.

Result: Demonstrated significant performance improvements on benchmarks like $τ^2$-Bench and VitaBench, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: Scaling environmental diversity is crucial for robust agent learning, as evidenced by empirical results.

Abstract: Training generalist agents capable of adapting to diverse scenarios requires interactive environments for self-exploration. However, interactive environments remain critically scarce, and existing synthesis methods suffer from significant limitations regarding environmental diversity and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ScaleEnv, a framework that constructs fully interactive environments and verifiable tasks entirely from scratch. Specifically, ScaleEnv ensures environment reliability through procedural testing, and guarantees task completeness and solvability via tool dependency graph expansion and executable action verification. By enabling agents to learn through exploration within ScaleEnv, we demonstrate significant performance improvements on unseen, multi-turn tool-use benchmarks such as $τ^2$-Bench and VitaBench, highlighting strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between increasing number of domains and model generalization performance, providing empirical evidence that scaling environmental diversity is critical for robust agent learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: POP (Partition-guided Online Pruning) is an efficient online structural pruning framework for large foundation models (LFMs) that dynamically prunes based on context with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current structural pruning methods overlook dynamic sparsity patterns during autoregressive token generation in LFMs, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: POP partitions model channels into retained, candidate, and pruned regions. Prefilling defines a coarse pruning partition, while decoding generates a fine-grained mask within the candidate region, avoiding full-channel re-evaluation.

Result: POP outperforms existing pruning methods in accuracy across LFMs (LLMs, MoEs, VLMs) with lower computational overhead and reduced inference latency.

Conclusion: POP is a lightweight, plug-and-play solution that enhances pruning efficiency dynamically without preprocessing, retraining, or predictor learning.

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) achieve strong performance through scaling, yet current structural pruning methods derive fixed pruning decisions during inference, overlooking sparsity patterns that emerge in the autoregressive token generation. In this paper, we propose POP (Partition-guided Online Pruning), an efficient online structural pruning framework that enables context-conditioned dynamic pruning with minimal computational overhead. POP partitions model channels into retained, candidate, and pruned regions, where prefilling defines a coarse pruning partition, and the decoding stage generates a fine-grained mask within the candidate region, avoiding full-channel re-evaluation. The coarse pruning partition preserves consistently important weights, while the fine-grained masking provides context-conditioned variation during decoding. Moreover, POP is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that requires no preprocessing, including offline calibration, retraining, or learning predictors. Extensive evaluations across diverse LFMs, including large language models (LLMs), mixture-of-experts models (MoEs), and vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrate that POP consistently delivers higher accuracy than existing pruning approaches while incurring smaller computational overhead and minimizing inference latency.

TL;DR: A game-theoretic framework predicts and steers LLM behavior via Nash equilibrium, using human subpopulation mixtures for tractability, offering actionable alignment guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address intractability in predicting LLM behavior and steer alignment toward socially desirable outcomes.

Method: Models agents' actions as mixtures over human subpopulations, deriving closed-form Nash equilibria under concave-utility assumptions.

Result: Identifies political exclusion pathologies in reasoning LLMs and mitigates them through strategic alignment.

Conclusion: The framework provides interpretable policies and effective regulation for multi-agent LLM dynamics.

Abstract: We develop a game-theoretic framework for predicting and steering the behavior of populations of large language models (LLMs) through Nash equilibrium (NE) analysis. To avoid the intractability of equilibrium computation in open-ended text spaces, we model each agent's action as a mixture over human subpopulations. Agents choose actively and strategically which groups to align with, yielding an interpretable and behaviorally substantive policy class. We derive closed-form NE characterizations, adopting standard concave-utility assumptions to enable analytical system-level predictions and give explicit, actionable guidance for shifting alignment targets toward socially desirable outcomes. The method functions as an active alignment layer on top of existing alignment pipelines such as RLHF. In a social-media setting, we show that a population of LLMs, especially reasoning-based models, may exhibit political exclusion, pathologies where some subpopulations are ignored by all LLM agents, which can be avoided by our method, illustrating the promise of applying the method to regulate multi-agent LLM dynamics across domains.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive differentially private federated learning framework to tackle challenges like device heterogeneity, Non-IID data, and gradient perturbations caused by privacy constraints, improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Device heterogeneity and Non-IID data in federated learning cause unstable gradients, worsened by differential privacy measures. The paper aims to stabilize training and enhance model efficiency under these conditions.

Method: Introduces lightweight client-side compression, adaptive server-side gradient clipping, and constraint-aware aggregation to regulate gradients and mitigate noise impact.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN show better convergence stability and classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The adaptive framework effectively addresses gradient instability and noise issues in federated learning, improving performance in heterogeneous, privacy-constrained settings.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, in practical deployments, device heterogeneity, non-independent, and identically distributed (Non-IID) data often lead to highly unstable and biased gradient updates. When differential privacy is enforced, conventional fixed gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection may further amplify gradient perturbations, resulting in training oscillation and performance degradation and degraded model performance. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive differentially private federated learning framework that explicitly targets model efficiency under heterogeneous and privacy-constrained settings. On the client side, a lightweight local compressed module is introduced to regularize intermediate representations and constrain gradient variability, thereby mitigating noise amplification during local optimization. On the server side, an adaptive gradient clipping strategy dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on historical update statistics to avoid over-clipping and noise domination. Furthermore, a constraint-aware aggregation mechanism is designed to suppress unreliable or noise-dominated client updates and stabilize global optimization. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN demonstrate improved convergence stability and classification accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper compares static attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics for agentic AI systems, showing the latter's superiority in diagnosing execution failures and motivating trajectory-level explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between explainability methods for static predictions and emerging agentic AI systems whose behavior unfolds over multi-step trajectories.

Method: Empirical comparison of attribution-based explanations (static) with trace-based diagnostics (agentic) using benchmarks like TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench.

Result: Attribution methods work well statically ($ρ=0.86$) but fail in agentic settings; trace-grounded diagnostics effectively localize failures (e.g., state tracking inconsistency is 2.7x more prevalent in failed runs).

Conclusion: Trajectory-level explainability is essential for diagnosing and evaluating autonomous agentic AI systems.

Abstract: Over the last decade, explainable AI has primarily focused on interpreting individual model predictions, producing post-hoc explanations that relate inputs to outputs under a fixed decision structure. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $ρ= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\%. These findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behaviour.

Motivation: To accelerate progress in LLM agents for scientific research by providing a benchmark assessing full research lifecycle capabilities.

Method: Introduces AIRS-Bench with diverse tasks, establishes baselines using frontier models with sequential/parallel scaffolds, and evaluates agent performance.

Result: Agents exceed human SOTA in 4 tasks but fall short in 16, with room for improvement below theoretical limits.

Conclusion: AIRS-Bench is a versatile, open-source benchmark highlighting significant potential for advancement in autonomous research agents.

Abstract: LLM agents hold significant promise for advancing scientific research. To accelerate this progress, we introduce AIRS-Bench (the AI Research Science Benchmark), a suite of 20 tasks sourced from state-of-the-art machine learning papers. These tasks span diverse domains, including language modeling, mathematics, bioinformatics, and time series forecasting. AIRS-Bench tasks assess agentic capabilities over the full research lifecycle -- including idea generation, experiment analysis and iterative refinement -- without providing baseline code. The AIRS-Bench task format is versatile, enabling easy integration of new tasks and rigorous comparison across different agentic frameworks. We establish baselines using frontier models paired with both sequential and parallel scaffolds. Our results show that agents exceed human SOTA in four tasks but fail to match it in sixteen others. Even when agents surpass human benchmarks, they do not reach the theoretical performance ceiling for the underlying tasks. These findings indicate that AIRS-Bench is far from saturated and offers substantial room for improvement. We open-source the AIRS-Bench task definitions and evaluation code to catalyze further development in autonomous scientific research.

TL;DR: AI agents often overestimate their success rates (e.g., predicting 77% success when actual success is only 22%). Surprisingly, pre-execution assessments sometimes outperform post-execution reviews, and adversarial prompting improves calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether AI agents can accurately predict their own success rates and understand the phenomenon of agentic overconfidence.

Method: Eliciting success probability estimates before, during, and after task execution, and using adversarial prompting to reframe assessments.

Result: AI agents exhibit overconfidence; pre-execution assessments occasionally outperform post-execution reviews; adversarial prompting improves calibration.

Conclusion: Agentic uncertainty involves significant overconfidence, and adversarial prompting offers a promising method for better calibration.

Abstract: Can AI agents predict whether they will succeed at a task? We study agentic uncertainty by eliciting success probability estimates before, during, and after task execution. All results exhibit agentic overconfidence: some agents that succeed only 22% of the time predict 77% success. Counterintuitively, pre-execution assessment with strictly less information tends to yield better discrimination than standard post-execution review, though differences are not always significant. Adversarial prompting reframing assessment as bug-finding achieves the best calibration.

### [152] [Communication Enhances LLMs' Stability in Strategic Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06081)
*Nunzio Lore,Babak Heydari*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Cheap-talk messaging stabilizes cooperation trajectories in LLMs engaged in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma, reducing variability across most contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unpredictability of LLMs in strategic multi-agent tasks by testing the impact of pre-play messaging.

Method: Simulation-level bootstrap resampling and nonparametric inference to analyze cooperation trajectories with LOWESS regression.

Result: Messaging reduced noise in most model-context pairings, with higher benefits for volatile models; exceptions were rare.

Conclusion: Cheap-talk messaging is a practical tool for enhancing predictability in multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit pronounced context-dependent variability that undermines predictable multi-agent behavior in tasks requiring strategic thinking. Focusing on models that range from 7 to 9 billion parameters in size engaged in a ten-round repeated Prisoner's Dilemma, we evaluate whether short, costless pre-play messages emulating the cheap-talk paradigm affect strategic stability. Our analysis uses simulation-level bootstrap resampling and nonparametric inference to compare cooperation trajectories fitted with LOWESS regression across both the messaging and the no-messaging condition. We demonstrate consistent reductions in trajectory noise across a majority of the model-context pairings being studied. The stabilizing effect persists across multiple prompt variants and decoding regimes, though its magnitude depends on model choice and contextual framing, with models displaying higher baseline volatility gaining the most. While communication rarely produces harmful instability, we document a few context-specific exceptions and identify the limited domains in which communication harms stability. These findings position cheap-talk style communication as a low-cost, practical tool for improving the predictability and reliability of strategic behavior in multi-agent LLM systems.

*Ariyan Bighashdel,Thiago D. Simão,Frans A. Oliehoek*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: JBR improves PSRO by reusing joint experience data for simultaneous best-response computations, enhancing sample efficiency and scalability in MARL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost and non-stationarity issues in PSRO for multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Method: Introduces Joint Experience Best Response (JBR), a modification to PSRO that reuses a joint dataset for simultaneous best-response computations. Proposes three remedies for distribution-shift bias: Conservative JBR, Exploration-Augmented JBR, and Hybrid BR.

Result: JBR significantly improves sample efficiency and scalability. Exploration-Augmented JBR achieves the best trade-off, while Hybrid BR approaches PSRO performance with lower sample cost.

Conclusion: JBR makes PSRO more practical for large-scale strategic learning while maintaining equilibrium robustness.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) offers a scalable alternative to exact game-theoretic analysis but suffers from non-stationarity and the need to maintain diverse populations of strategies that capture non-transitive interactions. Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) address these issues by iteratively expanding a restricted game with approximate best responses (BRs), yet per-agent BR training makes it prohibitively expensive in many-agent or simulator-expensive settings. We introduce Joint Experience Best Response (JBR), a drop-in modification to PSRO that collects trajectories once under the current meta-strategy profile and reuses this joint dataset to compute BRs for all agents simultaneously. This amortizes environment interaction and improves the sample efficiency of best-response computation. Because JBR converts BR computation into an offline RL problem, we propose three remedies for distribution-shift bias: (i) Conservative JBR with safe policy improvement, (ii) Exploration-Augmented JBR that perturbs data collection and admits theoretical guarantees, and (iii) Hybrid BR that interleaves JBR with periodic independent BR updates. Across benchmark multi-agent environments, Exploration-Augmented JBR achieves the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, while Hybrid BR attains near-PSRO performance at a fraction of the sample cost. Overall, JBR makes PSRO substantially more practical for large-scale strategic learning while preserving equilibrium robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NanoNet introduces a lightweight framework for text mining, combining limited supervision, efficient fine-tuning, and small models to reduce costs and improve performance via mutual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior LSL methods are computationally expensive and prone to local optima, prompting the need for low-cost, efficient alternatives for text mining.

Method: NanoNet uses online knowledge distillation to create multiple small models, enhanced by mutual learning regularization, and leverages parameter-efficient learning.

Result: The framework reduces training costs and supervision needs while producing a lightweight model suitable for inference.

Conclusion: NanoNet offers a feasible, low-cost solution for lightweight text mining tasks, addressing computational and optimization challenges.

Abstract: The lightweight semi-supervised learning (LSL) strategy provides an effective approach of conserving labeled samples and minimizing model inference costs. Prior research has effectively applied knowledge transfer learning and co-training regularization from large to small models in LSL. However, such training strategies are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, thereby increasing the difficulty of finding the optimal solution. This has prompted us to investigate the feasibility of integrating three low-cost scenarios for text mining tasks: limited labeled supervision, lightweight fine-tuning, and rapid-inference small models. We propose NanoNet, a novel framework for lightweight text mining that implements parameter-efficient learning with limited supervision. It employs online knowledge distillation to generate multiple small models and enhances their performance through mutual learning regularization. The entire process leverages parameter-efficient learning, reducing training costs and minimizing supervision requirements, ultimately yielding a lightweight model for downstream inference.

*Purbak Sengupta,Sambeet Mishra,Sonal Shreya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an event-first, frequency-aware forecasting paradigm for wind power ramp events, integrating statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models to improve robustness and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wind power ramp events are challenging to forecast due to variability, multi-scale dynamics, and site-specific effects. Traditional methods infer events from dense forecasts, limiting generalization.

Method: The framework uses enhanced RBA$_θ$ for event representation and combines Random Forests, wavelet-based frequency decomposition, temporal excitation features, and adaptive feature selection for deep-learning models.

Result: Event-first prediction improves robustness, captures multi-scale dynamics, enables zero-shot transfer, and allows accurate signal reconstruction from sparse forecasts.

Conclusion: Event-first, frequency-aware forecasting offers a transferable and operationally aligned alternative to traditional trajectory-first methods for wind-power prediction.

Abstract: Wind power ramp events are difficult to forecast due to strong variability, multi-scale dynamics, and site-specific meteorological effects. This paper proposes an event-first, frequency-aware forecasting paradigm that directly predicts ramp events and reconstructs the power trajectory thereafter, rather than inferring events from dense forecasts. The framework is built on an enhanced Ramping Behaviour Analysis (RBA$_θ$) method's event representation and progressively integrates statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models. Traditional forecasting models with post-hoc event extraction provides a strong interpretable baseline but exhibits limited generalisation across sites. Direct event prediction using Random Forests improves robustness over survival-based formulations, motivating fully event-aware modelling. To capture the multi-scale nature of wind ramps, we introduce an event-first deep architecture that integrates wavelet-based frequency decomposition, temporal excitation features, and adaptive feature selection. The resulting sequence models enable stable long-horizon event prediction, physically consistent trajectory reconstruction, and zero-shot transfer to previously unseen wind farms. Empirical analysis shows that ramp magnitude and duration are governed by distinct mid-frequency bands, allowing accurate signal reconstruction from sparse event forecasts. An agentic forecasting layer is proposed, in which specialised workflows are selected dynamically based on operational context. Together, the framework demonstrates that event-first, frequency-aware forecasting provides a transferable and operationally aligned alternative to trajectory-first wind-power prediction.

### [156] [Toward Faithful and Complete Answer Construction from a Single Document](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06103)
*Zhaoyang Chen,Cody Fleming*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EVE is a structured framework for document-grounded reasoning that addresses limitations of LLMs by ensuring completeness and faithfulness through extraction, validation, and enumeration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack systematic mechanisms for completeness and faithfulness in generated content, conflicting with AI safety principles.

Method: EVE decomposes reasoning into extraction, validation, and enumeration, replacing free-form prompting with a verifiable pipeline.

Result: EVE improves recall by up to 24%, precision by 29%, and F1-score by 31%, breaking the trade-off between coverage and accuracy.

Conclusion: EVE enhances LLM performance but faces saturation due to natural language ambiguity.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are powerful generators driven by statistical next-token prediction. While effective at producing fluent text, this design biases models toward high-probability continuations rather than exhaustive and faithful answers grounded in source content. As a result, directly applying LLMs lacks systematic mechanisms to ensure both completeness (avoiding omissions) and faithfulness (avoiding unsupported content), which fundamentally conflicts with core AI safety principles. To address this limitation, we present EVE, a structured framework for document-grounded reasoning.
  Unlike free-form prompting, EVE constrains generation to a structured, verifiable pipeline that decomposes high-rigor reasoning into extraction, validation, and enumeration. Empirically, this design enables consistent and simultaneous improvements in recall, precision, and F1-score: recall and precision increase by up to 24\% and 29\%, respectively, with a corresponding 31\% gain in F1-score. This effectively breaks the long-standing trade-off between coverage and accuracy typical of single-pass LLM generation, while also mitigating generation truncation caused by length limitations. At the same time, we emphasize that EVE exhibits performance saturation due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language, reflecting fundamental limits of language-based reasoning.

### [157] [RuleSmith: Multi-Agent LLMs for Automated Game Balancing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06232)
*Ziyao Zeng,Chen Liu,Tianyu Liu,Hao Wang,Xiatao Sun,Fengyu Yang,Xiaofeng Liu,Zhiwen Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RuleSmith is a framework automating game balancing using multi-agent LLMs, Bayesian optimization, and a game engine, demonstrated on CivMini with successful balancing outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual game balancing is tedious and time-consuming; RuleSmith addresses this by automating the process using LLMs and optimization techniques.

Method: Combines game engine, multi-agent LLM self-play, and Bayesian optimization to tune game rules efficiently, using adaptive sampling and discrete projection.

Result: Achieves highly balanced configurations and provides interpretable rule adjustments for downstream use.

Conclusion: LLM simulation effectively automates game balancing in complex multi-agent environments.

Abstract: Game balancing is a longstanding challenge requiring repeated playtesting, expert intuition, and extensive manual tuning. We introduce RuleSmith, the first framework that achieves automated game balancing by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of multi-agent LLMs. It couples a game engine, multi-agent LLMs self-play, and Bayesian optimization operating over a multi-dimensional rule space. As a proof of concept, we instantiate RuleSmith on CivMini, a simplified civilization-style game containing heterogeneous factions, economy systems, production rules, and combat mechanics, all governed by tunable parameters. LLM agents interpret textual rulebooks and game states to generate actions, to conduct fast evaluation of balance metrics such as win-rate disparities. To search the parameter landscape efficiently, we integrate Bayesian optimization with acquisition-based adaptive sampling and discrete projection: promising candidates receive more evaluation games for accurate assessment, while exploratory candidates receive fewer games for efficient exploration. Experiments show that RuleSmith converges to highly balanced configurations and provides interpretable rule adjustments that can be directly applied to downstream game systems. Our results illustrate that LLM simulation can serve as a powerful surrogate for automating design and balancing in complex multi-agent environments.

*Yingke Li,Anjali Parashar,Enlu Zhou,Chuchu Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'pragmatic curiosity,' a hybrid learning-optimization approach combining Bayesian optimization and experimental design, outperforming traditional methods in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of separate Bayesian optimization (BO) and Bayesian experimental design (BED) methods in hybrid settings where learning and optimization are intertwined.

Method: Propose 'pragmatic curiosity,' derived from active inference, using expected free energy minimization to balance utility and information gain.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in tasks like constrained system identification and targeted active search, outperforming BO and BED baselines.

Conclusion: Pragmatic curiosity is effective for hybrid learning-optimization tasks, offering improved accuracy, coverage, and solution quality.

Abstract: Many engineering and scientific workflows depend on expensive black-box evaluations, requiring decision-making that simultaneously improves performance and reduces uncertainty. Bayesian optimization (BO) and Bayesian experimental design (BED) offer powerful yet largely separate treatments of goal-seeking and information-seeking, providing limited guidance for hybrid settings where learning and optimization are intrinsically coupled. We propose "pragmatic curiosity," a hybrid learning-optimization paradigm derived from active inference, in which actions are selected by minimizing the expected free energy--a single objective that couples pragmatic utility with epistemic information gain. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness and flexibility of pragmatic curiosity on various real-world hybrid tasks, including constrained system identification, targeted active search, and composite optimization with unknown preferences. Across these benchmarks, pragmatic curiosity consistently outperforms strong BO-type and BED-type baselines, delivering higher estimation accuracy, better critical-region coverage, and improved final solution quality.

*Rishabh Jain,Keisuke Okumura,Michael Amir,Pietro Lio,Amanda Prorok*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HMAGAT, a hypergraph-based multi-agent attention network, addresses limitations of pairwise message passing in MAPF by capturing group dynamics, achieving state-of-the-art performance despite smaller size and less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAPF solvers using GNNs suffer from suboptimal behaviors and attention dilution due to pairwise message passing, failing to capture higher-order group interactions crucial in dense environments.

Method: HMAGAT employs attentional mechanisms over directed hypergraphs to explicitly model group dynamics, overcoming the representational bottleneck of pairwise methods.

Result: HMAGAT outperforms the current 85M parameter SoTA model with only 1M parameters and 100x less training data, demonstrating superior performance in MAPF tasks.

Conclusion: Inductive biases (like hypergraph representations) are more critical than large data or parameters for effective multi-agent coordination, as shown by HMAGAT's success.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a representative multi-agent coordination problem, where multiple agents are required to navigate to their respective goals without collisions. Solving MAPF optimally is known to be NP-hard, leading to the adoption of learning-based approaches to alleviate the online computational burden. Prevailing approaches, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically constrained to pairwise message passing between agents. However, this limitation leads to suboptimal behaviours and critical issues, such as attention dilution, particularly in dense environments where group (i.e. beyond just two agents) coordination is most critical. Despite the importance of such higher-order interactions, existing approaches have not been able to fully explore them. To address this representational bottleneck, we introduce HMAGAT (Hypergraph Multi-Agent Attention Network), a novel architecture that leverages attentional mechanisms over directed hypergraphs to explicitly capture group dynamics. Empirically, HMAGAT establishes a new state-of-the-art among learning-based MAPF solvers: e.g., despite having just 1M parameters and being trained on 100$\times$ less data, it outperforms the current SoTA 85M parameter model. Through detailed analysis of HMAGAT's attention values, we demonstrate how hypergraph representations mitigate the attention dilution inherent in GNNs and capture complex interactions where pairwise methods fail. Our results illustrate that appropriate inductive biases are often more critical than the training data size or sheer parameter count for multi-agent problems.

*José Ramón Pareja Monturiol,Juliette Sinnott,Roger G. Melko,Mohammad Kohandel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines privacy risks in clinical machine learning models, showing vulnerabilities in logistic regression and neural networks, and proposes a quantum-inspired tensorization defense to enhance privacy while maintaining interpretability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to balance predictive accuracy, interpretability, and privacy in clinical machine learning models, addressing vulnerabilities to privacy attacks in commonly used models like logistic regression and neural networks.

Method: The authors design attacks to assess privacy risks in models under varying adversarial access levels, testing on logistic regression and neural networks. They propose tensorizing discretized models into tensor trains as a defense mechanism.

Result: Both logistic regression and neural networks leak significant training-set information, with logistic regression being more vulnerable in white-box scenarios. Tensorization mitigates these risks, reducing attacks to random guessing and preserving accuracy.

Conclusion: Tensorization offers a practical solution for private, interpretable, and effective clinical prediction, applicable across models and maintaining interpretability while enhancing privacy.

Abstract: Machine learning in clinical settings must balance predictive accuracy, interpretability, and privacy. Models such as logistic regression (LR) offer transparency, while neural networks (NNs) provide greater predictive power; yet both remain vulnerable to privacy attacks. We empirically assess these risks by designing attacks that identify which public datasets were used to train a model under varying levels of adversarial access, applying them to LORIS, a publicly available LR model for immunotherapy response prediction, as well as to additional shallow NN models trained for the same task. Our results show that both models leak significant training-set information, with LRs proving particularly vulnerable in white-box scenarios. Moreover, we observe that common practices such as cross-validation in LRs exacerbate these risks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we propose a quantum-inspired defense based on tensorizing discretized models into tensor trains (TTs), which fully obfuscates parameters while preserving accuracy, reducing white-box attacks to random guessing and degrading black-box attacks comparably to Differential Privacy. TT models retain LR interpretability and extend it through efficient computation of marginal and conditional distributions, while also enabling this higher level of interpretability for NNs. Our results demonstrate that tensorization is widely applicable and establishes a practical foundation for private, interpretable, and effective clinical prediction.

TL;DR: MoP (Mixture of Pruners) is an iterative pruning framework that unifies depth and width pruning, outperforming single-dimension methods and achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational demands of LLMs by reducing parameters and accelerating inference through a unified pruning approach.

Method: MoP generates two branches (depth and width pruning) iteratively, selects the best candidate, and applies it to models like LLaMA-2/3 and LLaVA-1.5.

Result: MoP surpasses competing methods in accuracy across compression levels, reduces latency by 39% at 40% compression, and improves efficiency in vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: MoP advances structured pruning, offering a versatile and effective solution for model compression and acceleration.

Abstract: The high computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) motivate methods that reduce parameter count and accelerate inference. In response, model pruning emerges as an effective strategy, yet current methods typically focus on a single dimension-depth or width. We introduce MoP (Mixture of Pruners), an iterative framework that unifies these dimensions. At each iteration, MoP generates two branches-pruning in depth versus pruning in width-and selects a candidate to advance the path. On LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3, MoP advances the frontier of structured pruning, exceeding the accuracy of competing methods across a broad set of compression regimes. It also consistently outperforms depth-only and width-only pruning. Furthermore, MoP translates structural pruning into real speedup, reducing end-to-end latency by 39% at 40% compression. Finally, extending MoP to the vision-language model LLaVA-1.5, we notably improve computational efficiency and demonstrate that text-only recovery fine-tuning can restore performance even on visual tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate hazards disrupt urban transportation and emergency response, necessitating tools to forecast risks and optimize routing.

Method: Combines Fjell-Prompt, Norrland-Fusion, and Valkyrie-Forecast to process hazard maps, building data, and simulate probabilistic risk trajectories.

Result: Produces calibrated accessibility layers for intelligent vehicles, validated on the BCUR dataset with multi-hazard annotations.

Conclusion: Skjold-DiT effectively forecasts climate risks and enhances transportation resilience through uncertainty-aware accessibility modeling.

Abstract: Climate hazards increasingly disrupt urban transportation and emergency-response operations by damaging housing stock, degrading infrastructure, and reducing network accessibility. This paper presents Skjold-DiT, a diffusion-transformer framework that integrates heterogeneous spatio-temporal urban data to forecast building-level climate-risk indicators while explicitly incorporating transportation-network structure and accessibility signals relevant to intelligent vehicles (e.g., emergency reachability and evacuation-route constraints). Concretely, Skjold-DiT enables hazard-conditioned routing constraints by producing calibrated, uncertainty-aware accessibility layers (reachability, travel-time inflation, and route redundancy) that can be consumed by intelligent-vehicle routing and emergency dispatch systems. Skjold-DiT combines: (1) Fjell-Prompt, a prompt-based conditioning interface designed to support cross-city transfer; (2) Norrland-Fusion, a cross-modal attention mechanism unifying hazard maps/imagery, building attributes, demographics, and transportation infrastructure into a shared latent representation; and (3) Valkyrie-Forecast, a counterfactual simulator for generating probabilistic risk trajectories under intervention prompts. We introduce the Baltic-Caspian Urban Resilience (BCUR) dataset with 847,392 building-level observations across six cities, including multi-hazard annotations (e.g., flood and heat indicators) and transportation accessibility features. Experiments evaluate prediction quality, cross-city generalization, calibration, and downstream transportation-relevant outcomes, including reachability and hazard-conditioned travel times under counterfactual interventions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SWIRL is a self-improvement framework for LLMs and VLMs that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as latent variables, alternating between forward and inverse dynamics modelling, achieving significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the costly requirement of action-labelled trajectories for internal world modelling in LLMs and VLMs.

Method: SWIRL alternates between Forward World Modelling (FWM) and Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM), trained with reinforcement learning (GRPO), leveraging variational information maximisation and ELBO maximisation.

Result: SWIRL achieves performance gains of 16% on AURORABench, 28% on ByteMorph, 16% on WorldPredictionBench, and 14% on StableToolBench.

Conclusion: SWIRL effectively learns from state-only sequences, improving internal world modelling for LLMs and VLMs without costly action-labelled data.

Abstract: Internal modelling of the world -- predicting transitions between previous states $X$ and next states $Y$ under actions $Z$ -- is essential to reasoning and planning for LLMs and VLMs. Learning such models typically requires costly action-labelled trajectories. We propose SWIRL, a self-improvement framework that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as a latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) $P_θ(Y|X,Z)$ and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) $Q_φ(Z|X,Y)$. SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling. SWIRL achieves gains of 16% on AURORABench, 28% on ByteMorph, 16% on WorldPredictionBench, and 14% on StableToolBench.

*Sudarshan Sreeram,Young D. Kwon,Cecilia Mascolo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tempora evaluates Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) under temporal constraints, introducing metrics for accuracy-latency trade-offs and revealing unstable method rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TTA evaluations ignore latency constraints, limiting real-world applicability where timely predictions are critical.

Method: Tempora framework includes temporal scenarios, evaluation protocols, and utility metrics (discrete, continuous, amortised) to assess TTA methods under latency pressure.

Result: Conventional TTA rankings are unstable under temporal constraints; no method consistently outperforms others, and ETA fails in 41.2% of cases.

Conclusion: Tempora provides a systematic tool for evaluating TTA methods under real-world constraints, aiding practitioners in method selection and highlighting research gaps.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a compelling remedy for machine learning (ML) models that degrade under domain shifts, improving generalisation on-the-fly with only unlabelled samples. This flexibility suits real deployments, yet conventional evaluations unrealistically assume unbounded processing time, overlooking the accuracy-latency trade-off. As ML increasingly underpins latency-sensitive and user-facing use-cases, temporal pressure constrains the viability of adaptable inference; predictions arriving too late to act on are futile. We introduce Tempora, a framework for evaluating TTA under this pressure. It consists of temporal scenarios that model deployment constraints, evaluation protocols that operationalise measurement, and time-contingent utility metrics that quantify the accuracy-latency trade-off. We instantiate the framework with three such metrics: (1) discrete utility for asynchronous streams with hard deadlines, (2) continuous utility for interactive settings where value decays with latency, and (3) amortised utility for budget-constrained deployments. Applying Tempora to seven TTA methods on ImageNet-C across 240 temporal evaluations reveals rank instability: conventional rankings do not predict rankings under temporal pressure; ETA, a state-of-the-art method in the conventional setting, falls short in 41.2% of evaluations. The highest-utility method varies with corruption type and temporal pressure, with no clear winner. By enabling systematic evaluation across diverse temporal constraints for the first time, Tempora reveals when and why rankings invert, offering practitioners a lens for method selection and researchers a target for deployable adaptation.

TL;DR: The paper extends flow matching to discrete action spaces in offline RL, enabling multi-objective support and multi-agent settings, theoretically and empirically showing strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative policies for offline RL are limited to continuous action spaces, prompting the need for a broader framework to include discrete actions and multi-objective scenarios.

Method: The authors replace continuous flows with continuous-time Markov chains, train using a Q-weighted flow matching objective, and extend to multi-agent settings with factorized conditional paths.

Result: Experiments show robust performance in high-dimensional control, multi-modal decision-making, and dynamic preference changes. The framework also adapts to continuous-control via quantization.

Conclusion: The proposed discrete framework successfully generalizes flow matching to diverse offline RL settings, balancing complexity and performance.

Abstract: Generative policies based on diffusion models and flow matching have shown strong promise for offline reinforcement learning (RL), but their applicability remains largely confined to continuous action spaces. To address a broader range of offline RL settings, we extend flow matching to a general framework that supports discrete action spaces with multiple objectives. Specifically, we replace continuous flows with continuous-time Markov chains, trained using a Q-weighted flow matching objective. We then extend our design to multi-agent settings, mitigating the exponential growth of joint action spaces via a factorized conditional path. We theoretically show that, under idealized conditions, optimizing this objective recovers the optimal policy. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that our method performs robustly in practical scenarios, including high-dimensional control, multi-modal decision-making, and dynamically changing preferences over multiple objectives. Our discrete framework can also be applied to continuous-control problems through action quantization, providing a flexible trade-off between representational complexity and performance.

*Prashant Mehta,Sean Meyn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends Q-learning stability results to other variants and identifies conditions for convergence, highlighting the need for structured policies and bases to avoid non-unique or unstable solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to clarify and extend prior findings on Q-learning stability under linear function approximation, addressing gaps like solution uniqueness and convergence criteria beyond tabular settings.

Method: The work analyzes Q-learning variants, using examples (e.g., a one-dimensional case with oblivious policies) to demonstrate issues like non-unique PBE solutions and instability.

Result: It reveals that structured policies and bases are crucial for convergence, even when the basis ideally spans the true Q-function, as multiple PBE solutions can arise under certain policies.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the necessity of additional structural assumptions for stable and unique convergence in Q-learning beyond linear or tabular MDPs.

Abstract: In recent work it is shown that Q-learning with linear function approximation is stable, in the sense of bounded parameter estimates, under the $(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs policy; $κ$ is inverse temperature, and $\varepsilon>0$ is introduced for additional exploration. Under these assumptions it also follows that there is a solution to the projected Bellman equation (PBE). Left open is uniqueness of the solution, and criteria for convergence outside of the standard tabular or linear MDP settings.
  The present work extends these results to other variants of Q-learning, and clarifies prior work: a one dimensional example shows that under an oblivious policy for training there may be no solution to the PBE, or multiple solutions, and in each case the algorithm is not stable under oblivious training.
  The main contribution is that far more structure is required for convergence. An example is presented for which the basis is ideal, in the sense that the true Q-function is in the span of the basis. However, there are two solutions to the PBE under the greedy policy, and hence also for the $(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs policy for all sufficiently small $\varepsilon>0$ and $κ\ge 1$.

*Nurbek Tastan,Stefanos Laskaridis,Karthik Nandakumar,Samuel Horvath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoSE enhances MoE models by enabling variable-width experts, offering smoother accuracy-computation trade-offs and matching or outperforming standard MoE models with fewer FLOPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MoE models exhibit large discontinuities in accuracy-computation trade-offs due to fully activating selected experts. MoSE aims to enable more flexible and continuous trade-offs by allowing variable utilization of experts.

Method: MoSE introduces slimmable experts with nested structures, supporting variable widths. It combines multi-width training with MoE objectives and explores runtime width determination strategies, including a lightweight test-time training mechanism.

Result: MoSE matches or surpasses standard MoE performance at full width and consistently improves the Pareto frontier, achieving similar results with fewer computational resources (FLOPs).

Conclusion: MoSE successfully addresses the limitations of traditional MoE models by enabling more flexible and efficient computation, offering a practical solution for scalable language models.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale large language models efficiently by sparsely activating experts, but once an expert is selected, it is executed fully. Hence, the trade-off between accuracy and computation in an MoE model typically exhibits large discontinuities. We propose Mixture of Slimmable Experts (MoSE), an MoE architecture in which each expert has a nested, slimmable structure that can be executed at variable widths. This enables conditional computation not only over which experts are activated, but also over how much of each expert is utilized. Consequently, a single pretrained MoSE model can support a more continuous spectrum of accuracy-compute trade-offs at inference time. We present a simple and stable training recipe for slimmable experts under sparse routing, combining multi-width training with standard MoE objectives. During inference, we explore strategies for runtime width determination, including a lightweight test-time training mechanism that learns how to map router confidence/probabilities to expert widths under a fixed budget. Experiments on GPT models trained on OpenWebText demonstrate that MoSE matches or improves upon standard MoE at full width and consistently shifts the Pareto frontier for accuracy vs. cost, achieving comparable performance with significantly fewer FLOPs.

*Wei Wei,Yizhou Zeng,Kuntian Chen,Sophie Langer,Mariia Seleznova,Hung-Hsu Chou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores whether the latent space in diffusion models contains enough structure to predict sample classes, revealing that high-confidence samples show class separability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if the latent space in diffusion models has class-relevant structure by analyzing confidence scores from a pre-trained classifier.

Method: Examine latent space structure by filtering noise seeds that produce high-confidence samples and comparing class predictability across subsets.

Result: High-confidence samples exhibit clear class separability, uncovering latent structure not visible otherwise.

Conclusion: Confidence-based filtering reveals latent structure and offers an alternative to guidance-based conditional generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models rely on a high-dimensional latent space of initial noise seeds, yet it remains unclear whether this space contains sufficient structure to predict properties of the generated samples, such as their classes. In this work, we investigate the emergence of latent structure through the lens of confidence scores assigned by a pre-trained classifier to generated samples. We show that while the latent space appears largely unstructured when considering all noise realizations, restricting attention to initial noise seeds that produce high-confidence samples reveals pronounced class separability. By comparing class predictability across noise subsets of varying confidence and examining the class separability of the latent space, we find evidence of class-relevant latent structure that becomes observable only under confidence-based filtering. As a practical implication, we discuss how confidence-based filtering enables conditional generation as an alternative to guidance-based methods.

*Cihan Ruan,Lebin Zhou,Rongduo Han,Linyi Han,Bingqing Zhao,Chenchen Zhu,Wei Jiang,Wei Wang,Nam Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCONE integrates neural compression and DNA encoding into a single step using quaternary arithmetic coding, enforcing biochemical constraints dynamically during encoding for efficient and reversible DNA storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency of integrating neural compression with DNA encoding, particularly due to naive binary-to-quaternary transcoding, drives the need for a unified solution.

Method: SCONE uses quaternary arithmetic coding on latent space, with a Constraint-Aware Adaptive Coding module to enforce GC balance and homopolymer suppression during encoding.

Result: SCONE achieves near-perfect constraint satisfaction with minimal computational overhead (<2% latency), offering a latent-agnostic interface for DNA-compatible codecs.

Conclusion: SCONE successfully unifies latent compression and DNA encoding, improving efficiency and reversibility while maintaining biochemical constraints.

Abstract: DNA storage has matured from concept to practical stage, yet its integration with neural compression pipelines remains inefficient. Early DNA encoders applied redundancy-heavy constraint layers atop raw binary data - workable but primitive. Recent neural codecs compress data into learned latent representations with rich statistical structure, yet still convert these latents to DNA via naive binary-to-quaternary transcoding, discarding the entropy model's optimization. This mismatch undermines compression efficiency and complicates the encoding stack. A plug-in module that collapses latent compression and DNA encoding into a single step. SCONE performs quaternary arithmetic coding directly on the latent space in DNA bases. Its Constraint-Aware Adaptive Coding module dynamically steers the entropy encoder's learned probability distribution to enforce biochemical constraints - Guanine-Cytosine (GC) balance and homopolymer suppression - deterministically during encoding, eliminating post-hoc correction. The design preserves full reversibility and exploits the hyperprior model's learned priors without modification. Experiments show SCONE achieves near-perfect constraint satisfaction with negligible computational overhead (<2% latency), establishing a latent-agnostic interface for end-to-end DNA-compatible learned codecs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes accelerating large language model training by leveraging hardware-accelerated sparsity in FFN matrix multiplications, achieving 1.4-1.7x speedup without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Matrix multiplications in FFNs bottleneck large language model training, consuming up to 50% of pretraining operations.

Method: Use 2:4 sparsity for weights and v:n:m sparsity for activations, combining sparse and dense training phases.

Result: Models trained with this method match benchmark performance while speeding up training by 1.4-1.7x.

Conclusion: The approach is broadly applicable to NVIDIA GPUs and compatible with other optimizations like quantization.

Abstract: Trainings of Large Language Models are generally bottlenecked by matrix multiplications. In the Transformer architecture, a large portion of these operations happens in the Feed Forward Network (FFN), and this portion increases for larger models, up to 50% of the total pretraining floating point operations. We show that we can leverage hardware-accelerated sparsity to accelerate all matrix multiplications in the FFN, with 2:4 sparsity for weights and v:n:m (Venom) sparsity for activations. Our recipe relies on sparse training steps to accelerate a large part of the pretraining, associated with regular dense training steps towards the end. Overall, models trained with this approach exhibit the same performance on our quality benchmarks, and can speed up training end-to-end by 1.4 to 1.7x. This approach is applicable to all NVIDIA GPUs starting with the A100 generation, and is orthogonal to common optimization techniques, such as, quantization, and can also be applied to mixture-of-experts model architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a federated unlearning framework solving min-max optimization for efficient data removal in FL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses legal and ethical demands like 'right to be forgotten' and mitigates data poisoning attacks in FL.

Method: Formulates unlearning as a min-max problem to maximize $f$-divergence while minimizing utility degradation.

Result: Achieves significant speedups over retraining with minimal utility impact.

Conclusion: Framework is efficient, flexible, and compatible with most federated setups.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative machine learning across decentralized data sources, preserving privacy by keeping data local. However, increasing legal and ethical demands, such as the "right to be forgotten", and the need to mitigate data poisoning attacks have underscored the urgent necessity for principled data unlearning in FL. Unlike centralized settings, the distributed nature of FL complicates the removal of individual data contributions. In this paper, we propose a novel federated unlearning framework formulated as a min-max optimization problem, where the objective is to maximize an $f$-divergence between the model trained with all data and the model retrained without specific data points, while minimizing the degradation on retained data. Our framework could act like a plugin and be added to almost any federated setup, unlike SOTA methods like (\cite{10269017} which requires model degradation in server, or \cite{khalil2025notfederatedunlearningweight} which requires to involve model architecture and model weights). This formulation allows for efficient approximation of data removal effects in a federated setting. We provide empirical evaluations to show that our method achieves significant speedups over naive retraining, with minimal impact on utility.

*Nan Chen,Soledad Villar,Soufiane Hayou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Maximal-Update Adaptation (μA), a framework to determine optimal learning rates for LoRA finetuning based on model width and adapter rank, reducing the need for re-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the complexity in LoRA's training dynamics due to hyperparameters like initialization, adapter rank, and learning rate, which require re-tuning when the rank changes.

Method: μA leverages hyperparameter transfer and identifies two regimes for optimal learning rate scaling: one invariant across ranks, and another inversely scaling with rank.

Result: Validated across multiple tasks, μA shows reliable transfer of learning rates from LoRA to full finetuning, reducing tuning costs.

Conclusion: μA provides a practical solution for stable feature updates in LoRA finetuning and simplifies learning rate tuning for full finetuning.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a standard tool for parameter-efficient finetuning of large models. While it induces a small memory footprint, its training dynamics can be surprisingly complex as they depend on several hyperparameters such as initialization, adapter rank, and learning rate. In particular, it is unclear how the optimal learning rate scales with adapter rank, which forces practitioners to re-tune the learning rate whenever the rank is changed. In this paper, we introduce Maximal-Update Adaptation ($μ$A), a theoretical framework that characterizes how the "optimal" learning rate should scale with model width and adapter rank to produce stable, non-vanishing feature updates under standard configurations. $μ$A is inspired from the Maximal-Update Parametrization ($μ$P) in pretraining. Our analysis leverages techniques from hyperparameter transfer and reveals that the optimal learning rate exhibits different scaling patterns depending on initialization and LoRA scaling factor. Specifically, we identify two regimes: one where the optimal learning rate remains roughly invariant across ranks, and another where it scales inversely with rank. We further identify a configuration that allows learning rate transfer from LoRA to full finetuning, drastically reducing the cost of learning rate tuning for full finetuning. Experiments across language, vision, vision--language, image generation, and reinforcement learning tasks validate our scaling rules and show that learning rates tuned on LoRA transfer reliably to full finetuning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Geometry-Corrected Procrustes Alignment (GCPA) to improve alignment of multiple neural networks' latent spaces, enhancing retrieval performance while maintaining a shared reference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for aligning latent spaces scale poorly and lack consistency. The authors aim to address these limitations by proposing a more scalable and effective alignment technique.

Method: Adapts Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) for alignment, introduces GCPA to correct directional mismatches, and validates through experiments.

Result: GCPA outperforms existing methods in any-to-any retrieval tasks while preserving a shared reference space.

Conclusion: GCPA provides a robust solution for aligning multiple neural networks' representations, balancing retrieval accuracy and practical usability.

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that independently trained neural networks converge to increasingly similar latent spaces. However, current strategies for mapping these representations are inherently pairwise, scaling quadratically with the number of models and failing to yield a consistent global reference. In this paper, we study the alignment of $M \ge 3$ models. We first adapt Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) to construct a shared orthogonal universe that preserves the internal geometry essential for tasks like model stitching. We then show that strict isometric alignment is suboptimal for retrieval, where agreement-maximizing methods like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) typically prevail. To bridge this gap, we finally propose Geometry-Corrected Procrustes Alignment (GCPA), which establishes a robust GPA-based universe followed by a post-hoc correction for directional mismatch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCPA consistently improves any-to-any retrieval while retaining a practical shared reference space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide theoretical justification for the observed low-dimensional training dynamics in nonlinear networks, addressing gaps compared to linear settings.

Method: Analyzes MLP learning dynamics under GD, theoretically characterizing invariant subspaces for two-layer networks and validating experimentally.

Result: Demonstrates concentration of weight dynamics in low-dimensional subspaces and successful low-rank MLP parameterization matching full-rank performance.

Conclusion: Low-rank parameterizations within invariant subspaces can achieve comparable performance to full-rank networks, offering practical benefits.

Abstract: Recent empirical evidence has demonstrated that the training dynamics of large-scale deep neural networks occur within low-dimensional subspaces. While this has inspired new research into low-rank training, compression, and adaptation, theoretical justification for these dynamics in nonlinear networks remains limited. %compared to deep linear settings. To address this gap, this paper analyzes the learning dynamics of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) under gradient descent (GD). We demonstrate that the weight dynamics concentrate within invariant low-dimensional subspaces throughout training. Theoretically, we precisely characterize these invariant subspaces for two-layer networks with smooth nonlinear activations, providing insight into their emergence. Experimentally, we validate that this phenomenon extends beyond our theoretical assumptions. Leveraging these insights, we empirically show there exists a low-rank MLP parameterization that, when initialized within the appropriate subspaces, matches the classification performance of fully-parameterized counterparts on a variety of classification tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SR4-Fit is a new interpretable classification algorithm that outperforms both black-box models and traditional rule-based methods in accuracy, interpretability, and robustness, demonstrated through electoral forecasting and other datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for interpretable yet high-performing models in critical applications, addressing the limitations of black-box systems and traditional rule-based algorithms like RuleFit.

Method: Developed SR4-Fit, a sparse relaxed regularized regression rule-fit algorithm, and validated it using U.S. congressional district data and six other public datasets.

Result: SR4-Fit achieved superior accuracy and interpretability, revealing demographic insights unseen in black-box models and outperforming RuleFit.

Conclusion: SR4-Fit successfully bridges the trade-off between interpretability and predictive performance, making it a promising tool for applications requiring transparency.

Abstract: The growth of machine learning demands interpretable models for critical applications, yet most high-performing models are ``black-box'' systems that obscure input-output relationships, while traditional rule-based algorithms like RuleFit suffer from a lack of predictive power and instability despite their simplicity. This motivated our development of Sparse Relaxed Regularized Regression Rule-Fit (SR4-Fit), a novel interpretable classification algorithm that addresses these limitations while maintaining superior classification performance. Using demographic characteristics of U.S. congressional districts from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, we demonstrate that SR4-Fit can predict House election party outcomes with unprecedented accuracy and interpretability. Our results show that while the majority party remains the strongest predictor, SR4-Fit has revealed intrinsic combinations of demographic factors that affect prediction outcomes that were unable to be interpreted in black-box algorithms such as random forests. The SR4-Fit algorithm surpasses both black-box models and existing interpretable rule-based algorithms such as RuleFit with respect to accuracy, simplicity, and robustness, generating stable and interpretable rule sets while maintaining superior predictive performance, thus addressing the traditional trade-off between model interpretability and predictive capability in electoral forecasting. To further validate SR4-Fit's performance, we also apply it to six additional publicly available classification datasets, like the breast cancer, Ecoli, page blocks, Pima Indians, vehicle, and yeast datasets, and find similar results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate over-optimization in preference learning without relying on data distributions or reward models.

Method: Uses an ensemble of policies trained on disjoint subsets, aggregated pessimistically favoring model agreement.

Result: Achieves sample complexity guarantees avoiding all-policy concentrability, outperforming DPO-like methods practically.

Conclusion: PEPO effectively addresses over-optimization with theoretical and practical advantages over DPO-style methods.

Abstract: We introduce PEPO (Pessimistic Ensemble based Preference Optimization), a single-step Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-like algorithm to mitigate the well-known over-optimization issue in preference learning without requiring the knowledge of the data-generating distribution or learning an explicit reward model. PEPO achieves pessimism via an ensemble of preference-optimized policies trained on disjoint data subsets and then aggregates them through a worst case construction that favors the agreement across models. In the tabular setting, PEPO achieves sample complexity guarantees depending only on a single-policy concentrability coefficient, thus avoiding the all-policy concentrability which affects the guarantees of algorithms prone to over-optimization, such as DPO. The theoretical findings are corroborated by a convincing practical performance, while retaining the simplicity and the practicality of DPO-style training.

TL;DR: ATEX-CF is a novel framework that combines adversarial attack techniques with counterfactual explanations to interpret GNNs, using both edge additions and deletions for realistic explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between adversarial attacks and counterfactual explanations in GNNs, as both aim to flip predictions but differ in perturbation strategies.

Method: ATEX-CF integrates edge additions and deletions, leveraging adversarial insights to generate counterfactuals, while optimizing fidelity, sparsity, and plausibility under a perturbation budget.

Result: Experiments show ATEX-CF produces faithful, concise, and plausible explanations on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating adversarial insights into counterfactual reasoning enhances explanation quality for GNNs, demonstrating ATEX-CF's effectiveness.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations offer an intuitive way to interpret graph neural networks (GNNs) by identifying minimal changes that alter a model's prediction, thereby answering "what must differ for a different outcome?". In this work, we propose a novel framework, ATEX-CF that unifies adversarial attack techniques with counterfactual explanation generation-a connection made feasible by their shared goal of flipping a node's prediction, yet differing in perturbation strategy: adversarial attacks often rely on edge additions, while counterfactual methods typically use deletions. Unlike traditional approaches that treat explanation and attack separately, our method efficiently integrates both edge additions and deletions, grounded in theory, leveraging adversarial insights to explore impactful counterfactuals. In addition, by jointly optimizing fidelity, sparsity, and plausibility under a constrained perturbation budget, our method produces instance-level explanations that are both informative and realistic. Experiments on synthetic and real-world node classification benchmarks demonstrate that ATEX-CF generates faithful, concise, and plausible explanations, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating adversarial insights into counterfactual reasoning for GNNs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LP-FNO, a surrogate model for laser welding simulations, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity simulations of laser welding are computationally expensive, limiting large-scale exploration and real-time use.

Method: LP-FNO uses a Fourier Neural Operator to learn parametric solutions from FLOW-3D WELD simulations, reformulating the transient problem in a quasi-steady state.

Result: LP-FNO achieves 1% temperature prediction errors and high melt-pool segmentation accuracy, with super-resolution capabilities.

Conclusion: LP-FNO offers an efficient surrogate modeling framework for laser welding, enabling fast and accurate predictions.

Abstract: High-fidelity simulations of laser welding capture complex thermo-fluid phenomena, including phase change, free-surface deformation, and keyhole dynamics, however their computational cost limits large-scale process exploration and real-time use. In this work we present the Laser Processing Fourier Neural Operator (LP-FNO), a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) based surrogate model that learns the parametric solution operator of various laser processes from multiphysics simulations generated with FLOW-3D WELD (registered trademark). Through a novel approach of reformulating the transient problem in the moving laser frame and applying temporal averaging, the system results in a quasi-steady state setting suitable for operator learning, even in the keyhole welding regime. The proposed LP-FNO maps process parameters to three-dimensional temperature fields and melt-pool boundaries across a broad process window spanning conduction and keyhole regimes using the non-dimensional normalized enthalpy formulation. The model achieves temperature prediction errors on the order of 1% and intersection-over-union scores for melt-pool segmentation over 0.9. We demonstrate that a LP-FNO model trained on coarse-resolution data can be evaluated on finer grids, yielding accurate super-resolved predictions in mesh-converged conduction regimes, whereas discrepancies in keyhole regimes reflect unresolved dynamics in the coarse-mesh training data. These results indicate that the LP-FNO provides an efficient surrogate modeling framework for laser welding, enabling prediction of full three-dimensional fields and phase interfaces over wide parameter ranges in just tens of milliseconds, up to a hundred thousand times faster than traditional Finite Volume multi-physics software.

TL;DR: REBEL, an evolutionary adversarial prompt generation method, reveals that current machine unlearning techniques for LLMs offer only superficial protection by successfully recovering supposedly forgotten data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods' efficacy is uncertain; standard metrics fail to detect residual knowledge recoverable via sophisticated prompts.

Method: REBEL uses evolutionary adversarial prompts to test if unlearned data can still be extracted.

Result: REBEL recovers 'forgotten' knowledge with ASRs up to 60% (TOFU) and 93% (WMDP), outperforming static baselines.

Conclusion: Current unlearning methods may not fully remove sensitive data, highlighting the need for more robust approaches.

Abstract: Machine unlearning for LLMs aims to remove sensitive or copyrighted data from trained models. However, the true efficacy of current unlearning methods remains uncertain. Standard evaluation metrics rely on benign queries that often mistake superficial information suppression for genuine knowledge removal. Such metrics fail to detect residual knowledge that more sophisticated prompting strategies could still extract. We introduce REBEL, an evolutionary approach for adversarial prompt generation designed to probe whether unlearned data can still be recovered. Our experiments demonstrate that REBEL successfully elicits ``forgotten'' knowledge from models that seemed to be forgotten in standard unlearning benchmarks, revealing that current unlearning methods may provide only a superficial layer of protection. We validate our framework on subsets of the TOFU and WMDP benchmarks, evaluating performance across a diverse suite of unlearning algorithms. Our experiments show that REBEL consistently outperforms static baselines, recovering ``forgotten'' knowledge with Attack Success Rates (ASRs) reaching up to 60% on TOFU and 93% on WMDP. We will make all code publicly available upon acceptance. Code is available at https://github.com/patryk-rybak/REBEL/

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the specificity of model steering interventions in large language models, revealing that while steering is effective for intended changes, it often fails to maintain robustness against unintended behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether model steering interventions alter only the intended property without affecting related or unrelated behaviors, ensuring safety and reliability.

Method: Proposes a framework evaluating three dimensions of specificity: general, control, and robustness, tested on safety-critical use cases like reducing overrefusal and faithfulness hallucinations.

Result: Steering achieves efficacy and maintains general and control specificity but fails in robustness, increasing vulnerability to jailbreaks.

Conclusion: Standard efficacy and specificity checks are insufficient; robustness evaluation is crucial to ensure steering methods do not compromise model safety.

Abstract: Model steering, which involves intervening on hidden representations at inference time, has emerged as a lightweight alternative to finetuning for precisely controlling large language models. While steering efficacy has been widely studied, evaluations of whether interventions alter only the intended property remain limited, especially with respect to unintended changes in behaviors related to the target property. We call this notion specificity. We propose a framework that distinguishes three dimensions of specificity: general (preserving fluency and unrelated abilities), control (preserving related control properties), and robustness (preserving control properties under distribution shifts). We study two safety-critical use cases: steering models to reduce overrefusal and faithfulness hallucinations, and show that while steering achieves high efficacy and largely maintains general and control specificity, it consistently fails to preserve robustness specificity. In the case of overrefusal steering, for example, all steering methods reduce overrefusal without harming general abilities and refusal on harmful queries; however, they substantially increase vulnerability to jailbreaks. Our work provides the first systematic evaluation of specificity in model steering, showing that standard efficacy and specificity checks are insufficient, because without robustness evaluation, steering methods may appear reliable even when they compromise model safety.

*Chase Hutton,Adam Melrod,Han Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper refines bounds for online strategic classification, addressing both realizable and agnostic settings, introducing improved randomized algorithms and demonstrating optimality among proper learners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored potential of randomized algorithms in strategic classification and improve regret bounds for learners dealing with strategic agent behavior.

Method: Extends lower bounds to randomized learners in the realizable setting, introduces a new randomized learner, and uses convex optimization for proper learning in the agnostic setting.

Result: Achieves improved regret upper bounds and demonstrates optimality among proper learners, showing that improper learning is necessary for further improvements.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of strategic classification by refining bounds and highlighting the role of randomization and improper learning.

Abstract: Online strategic classification studies settings in which agents strategically modify their features to obtain favorable predictions. For example, given a classifier that determines loan approval based on credit scores, applicants may open or close credit cards and bank accounts to obtain a positive prediction. The learning goal is to achieve low mistake or regret bounds despite such strategic behavior.
  While randomized algorithms have the potential to offer advantages to the learner in strategic settings, they have been largely underexplored. In the realizable setting, no lower bound is known for randomized algorithms, and existing lower bound constructions for deterministic learners can be circumvented by randomization. In the agnostic setting, the best known regret upper bound is $O(T^{3/4}\log^{1/4}T|\mathcal H|)$, which is far from the standard online learning rate of $O(\sqrt{T\log|\mathcal H|})$.
  In this work, we provide refined bounds for online strategic classification in both settings. In the realizable setting, we extend, for $T > \mathrm{Ldim}(\mathcal{H}) Δ^2$, the existing lower bound $Ω(\mathrm{Ldim}(\mathcal{H}) Δ)$ for deterministic learners to all learners. This yields the first lower bound that applies to randomized learners. We also provide the first randomized learner that improves the known (deterministic) upper bound of $O(\mathrm{Ldim}(\mathcal H) \cdot Δ\log Δ)$.
  In the agnostic setting, we give a proper learner using convex optimization techniques to improve the regret upper bound to $O(\sqrt{T \log |\mathcal{H}|} + |\mathcal{H}| \log(T|\mathcal{H}|))$. We show a matching lower bound up to logarithmic factors for all proper learning rules, demonstrating the optimality of our learner among proper learners. As such, improper learning is necessary to further improve regret guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRP-Obliteration (GRP-Oblit) is introduced to unalign safety-aligned models using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), requiring minimal data and preserving utility, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety unalignment methods require extensive data curation and degrade model utility, prompting the need for a more efficient and effective approach.

Method: GRP-Oblit uses GRPO to directly remove safety constraints from models, requiring only a single unlabeled prompt.

Result: GRP-Oblit reliably unaligns models across various architectures and benchmarks while maintaining utility and outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: GRP-Oblit is a robust and efficient method for removing safety constraints, generalizable across different model types and architectures.

Abstract: Safety alignment is only as robust as its weakest failure mode. Despite extensive work on safety post-training, it has been shown that models can be readily unaligned through post-deployment fine-tuning. However, these methods often require extensive data curation and degrade model utility.
  In this work, we extend the practical limits of unalignment by introducing GRP-Obliteration (GRP-Oblit), a method that uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly remove safety constraints from target models. We show that a single unlabeled prompt is sufficient to reliably unalign safety-aligned models while largely preserving their utility, and that GRP-Oblit achieves stronger unalignment on average than existing state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, GRP-Oblit generalizes beyond language models and can also unalign diffusion-based image generation systems.
  We evaluate GRP-Oblit on six utility benchmarks and five safety benchmarks across fifteen 7-20B parameter models, spanning instruct and reasoning models, as well as dense and MoE architectures. The evaluated model families include GPT-OSS, distilled DeepSeek, Gemma, Llama, Ministral, and Qwen.

### [183] [Swap Regret Minimization Through Response-Based Approachability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06264)
*Ioannis Anagnostides,Gabriele Farina,Maxwell Fishelson,Haipeng Luo,Jon Schneider*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simpler, efficient algorithm for minimizing linear swap regret in online optimization, achieving better bounds ($O(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T})$ for general convex sets and $O(d \sqrt{T})$ for centrally symmetric sets) than previous methods. It also proves matching lower bounds and extends results to polynomial-dimension swap deviations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational inefficiency and suboptimal regret bounds of existing methods for minimizing swap regret, which is crucial for non-manipulability in strategic settings like games.

Method: The method leverages response-based approachability (Bernstein and Shimkin, 2015) combined with geometric preconditioning via the John ellipsoid. This simplifies and improves efficiency over prior work.

Result: The algorithm achieves $O(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T})$ regret for general convex sets and $O(d \sqrt{T})$ for centrally symmetric sets, with matching lower bounds proven. It also handles profile swap regret and polynomial-dimension swap deviations.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is simpler, computationally efficient, and achieves optimal regret bounds, unifying and strengthening prior results in equilibrium computation and online learning.

Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing different notions of swap regret in online optimization. These forms of regret are tightly connected to correlated equilibrium concepts in games, and have been more recently shown to guarantee non-manipulability against strategic adversaries. The only computationally efficient algorithm for minimizing linear swap regret over a general convex set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ was developed recently by Daskalakis, Farina, Fishelson, Pipis, and Schneider (STOC '25). However, it incurs a highly suboptimal regret bound of $Ω(d^4 \sqrt{T})$ and also relies on computationally intensive calls to the ellipsoid algorithm at each iteration.
  In this paper, we develop a significantly simpler, computationally efficient algorithm that guarantees $O(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T})$ linear swap regret for a general convex set and $O(d \sqrt{T})$ when the set is centrally symmetric. Our approach leverages the powerful response-based approachability framework of Bernstein and Shimkin (JMLR '15) -- previously overlooked in the line of work on swap regret minimization -- combined with geometric preconditioning via the John ellipsoid. Our algorithm simultaneously minimizes profile swap regret, which was recently shown to guarantee non-manipulability. Moreover, we establish a matching information-theoretic lower bound: any learner must incur in expectation $Ω(d \sqrt{T})$ linear swap regret for large enough $T$, even when the set is centrally symmetric. This also shows that the classic algorithm of Gordon, Greenwald, and Marks (ICML '08) is existentially optimal for minimizing linear swap regret, although it is computationally inefficient. Finally, we extend our approach to minimize regret with respect to the set of swap deviations with polynomial dimension, unifying and strengthening recent results in equilibrium computation and online learning.

### [184] [PurSAMERE: Reliable Adversarial Purification via Sharpness-Aware Minimization of Expected Reconstruction Error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06269)
*Vinh Hoang,Sebastian Krumscheid,Holger Rauhut,Raúl Tempone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deterministic purification method improves adversarial robustness by mapping adversarial samples closer to reliable data distribution modes, using noise-corrupted reconstruction error minimization and sharpness-aware minimization for enhanced robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of stochastic purification methods, which degrade robustness under full adversary knowledge, by ensuring deterministic and reliable purification.

Method: Employs a score model trained on noise-corrupted data reconstruction error to purify adversarial samples by minimizing reconstruction error within their local neighborhood, guided by sharpness-aware minimization.

Result: Achieves significant gains in adversarial robustness under strong deterministic white-box attacks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The deterministic approach effectively enhances robustness by leveraging noise-corrupted reconstruction error and sharpness-aware optimization.

Abstract: We propose a novel deterministic purification method to improve adversarial robustness by mapping a potentially adversarial sample toward a nearby sample that lies close to a mode of the data distribution, where classifiers are more reliable. We design the method to be deterministic to ensure reliable test accuracy and to prevent the degradation of effective robustness observed in stochastic purification approaches when the adversary has full knowledge of the system and its randomness. We employ a score model trained by minimizing the expected reconstruction error of noise-corrupted data, thereby learning the structural characteristics of the input data distribution. Given a potentially adversarial input, the method searches within its local neighborhood for a purified sample that minimizes the expected reconstruction error under noise corruption and then feeds this purified sample to the classifier. During purification, sharpness-aware minimization is used to guide the purified samples toward flat regions of the expected reconstruction error landscape, thereby enhancing robustness. We further show that, as the noise level decreases, minimizing the expected reconstruction error biases the purified sample toward local maximizers of the Gaussian-smoothed density; under additional local assumptions on the score model, we prove recovery of a local maximizer in the small-noise limit. Experimental results demonstrate significant gains in adversarial robustness over state-of-the-art methods under strong deterministic white-box attacks.

TL;DR: The paper tackles training conversion prediction models under privacy constraints where direct links between ad clicks and conversions are missing, using coarse attribution sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy-preserving browser APIs and the deprecation of third-party cookies necessitate new methods to link conversions to clicks indirectly.

Method: The authors propose an unbiased estimator for population loss from coarse attribution signals and use Empirical Risk Minimization.

Result: Their approach outperforms industry heuristics, especially when attribution sets are large or overlapping.

Conclusion: The method achieves robust generalization guarantees despite privacy constraints and complex dependencies in attribution sets.

Abstract: We address the problem of training conversion prediction models in advertising domains under privacy constraints, where direct links between ad clicks and conversions are unavailable. Motivated by privacy-preserving browser APIs and the deprecation of third-party cookies, we study a setting where the learner observes a sequence of clicks and a sequence of conversions, but can only link a conversion to a set of candidate clicks (an attribution set) rather than a unique source. We formalize this as learning from attribution sets generated by an oblivious adversary equipped with a prior distribution over the candidates. Despite the lack of explicit labels, we construct an unbiased estimator of the population loss from these coarse signals via a novel approach. Leveraging this estimator, we show that Empirical Risk Minimization achieves generalization guarantees that scale with the informativeness of the prior and is also robust against estimation errors in the prior, despite complex dependencies among attribution sets. Simple empirical evaluations on standard datasets suggest our unbiased approach significantly outperforms common industry heuristics, particularly in regimes where attribution sets are large or overlapping.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOCKET introduces a soft collision kernel estimator for sparse attention, improving efficiency and performance in long-context inference compared to hard LSH and other baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of hard LSH for token scoring in sparse attention, which limits scalability in large language models.

Method: Uses soft LSH for probabilistic, similarity-aware token aggregation, replacing hard bucket matches. Includes custom CUDA and Triton backends for implementation.

Result: Achieves up to 1.5x higher throughput than FlashAttention, matching or surpassing sparse attention baselines in benchmarks.

Conclusion: SOCKET provides a principled, efficient solution for sparse attention in long-context inference, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Exploiting sparsity during long-context inference is central to scaling large language models, as attention dominates the cost of autoregressive decoding. Sparse attention reduces this cost by restricting computation to a subset of tokens, but its effectiveness depends critically on efficient scoring and selection of relevant tokens at inference time. We revisit Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) as a sparsification primitive and introduce SOCKET, a SOft Collision Kernel EsTimator that replaces hard bucket matches with probabilistic, similarity-aware aggregation. Our key insight is that hard LSH produces discrete collision signals and is therefore poorly suited for ranking. In contrast, soft LSH aggregates graded collision evidence across hash tables, preserving the stability of relative ordering among the true top-$k$ tokens. This transformation elevates LSH from a candidate-generation heuristic to a principled and mathematically grounded scoring kernel for sparse attention. Leveraging this property, SOCKET enables efficient token selection without ad-hoc voting mechanism, and matches or surpasses established sparse attention baselines across multiple long-context benchmarks using diverse set of models. With a custom CUDA kernel for scoring keys and a Flash Decode Triton backend for sparse attention, SOCKET achieves up to 1.5$\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention, making it an effective tool for long-context inference.

*Jorge L. Ruiz Williams*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Attention sparsity is learned and topological, not architectural. The Condensate Theorem shows projecting attention onto a specific manifold achieves lossless output equivalence with full quadratic attention, validated across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the notion that quadratic attention complexity is inherent in language models by demonstrating it can be reduced without approximation.

Method: Empirical analysis identifies attention mass concentration on a topological manifold. A Condensate Manifold (Anchor + Window + Dynamic Top-k) is used for lossless projection.

Result: Achieves 100% output equivalence with full quadratic attention, validated across GPT-2, Pythia, Qwen2, TinyLlama, and Mistral. Hardware mapping yields significant speedups (159x at 131K tokens).

Conclusion: The quadratic bottleneck is implementation-dependent, not fundamental, enabling dramatic efficiency gains without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: We present the Condensate Theorem: attention sparsity is a learned topological property, not an architectural constraint. Through empirical analysis of trained language models, we find that attention mass concentrates on a distinct topological manifold -- and this manifold can be identified dynamically without checking every position. We prove a general result: for any query, projecting attention onto the Condensate Manifold (Anchor + Window + Dynamic Top-k) achieves 100% output equivalence with full $O(n^2)$ attention. This is not an approximation -- it is lossless parity. We validate this across GPT-2, Pythia, Qwen2, TinyLlama, and Mistral, demonstrating bit-exact token matching on 1,500+ generated tokens. By mapping this topology to hardware, our Topological Attention kernel achieves a 159x measured speedup at 131K tokens (3.94ms vs 628ms) and a projected >1,200x speedup at 1M tokens, reducing inference costs by >99.9% compared to Flash Attention. We conclude that the quadratic bottleneck is an artifact of naive implementation, not intelligence.

*Yiqi Su,Ray Lee,Jiaming Cui,Naren Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid models combining mechanistic and neural components improve epidemiological forecasting by addressing non-stationary dynamics, reducing errors significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Epidemiological forecasting faces challenges due to partial observability and shifting transmission dynamics; hybrid models aim to enhance accuracy.

Method: A controlled neural ODE coupled with an epidemiological model uses multi-scale infection structure (trend, seasonal, residual) as interpretable control signals.

Result: The approach reduces long-horizon RMSE by 15-35%, improves peak timing by 1-3 weeks, and lowers peak magnitude bias by up to 30%.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling non-stationarity in hybrid models significantly improves epidemiological forecasting performance.

Abstract: Epidemiological forecasting from surveillance data is a hard problem and hybridizing mechanistic compartmental models with neural models is a natural direction. The mechanistic structure helps keep trajectories epidemiologically plausible, while neural components can capture non-stationary, data-adaptive effects. In practice, however, many seemingly straightforward couplings fail under partial observability and continually shifting transmission dynamics driven by behavior, waning immunity, seasonality, and interventions. We catalog these failure modes and show that robust performance requires making non-stationarity explicit: we extract multi-scale structure from the observed infection series and use it as an interpretable control signal for a controlled neural ODE coupled to an epidemiological model. Concretely, we decompose infections into trend, seasonal, and residual components and use these signals to drive continuous-time latent dynamics while jointly forecasting and inferring time-varying transmission, recovery, and immunity-loss rates. Across seasonal and non-seasonal settings, including early outbreaks and multi-wave regimes, our approach reduces long-horizon RMSE by 15-35%, improves peak timing error by 1-3 weeks, and lowers peak magnitude bias by up to 30% relative to strong time-series, neural ODE, and hybrid baselines, without relying on auxiliary covariates.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight online adaptation framework for RL using Reservoir Computing, specifically Echo State Networks, to address non-stationary dynamics efficiently without extensive pretraining or high computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the performance degradation of RL policies in real-world non-stationary environments without relying on costly pretraining or privileged information.

Method: Integrates Echo State Networks (ESNs) with Recursive Least Squares (RLS) for rapid adaptation, avoiding backpropagation and pretraining.

Result: Outperforms Domain Randomization and adaptive baselines in handling abrupt environment changes like disturbances and friction variations, achieving stable adaptation quickly.

Conclusion: The framework is computationally efficient, stable, and practical for real-world robotic control and edge deployment, handling intra-episode changes without policy reset.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies trained in simulation often suffer from severe performance degradation when deployed in real-world environments due to non-stationary dynamics. While Domain Randomization (DR) and meta-RL have been proposed to address this issue, they typically rely on extensive pretraining, privileged information, or high computational cost, limiting their applicability to real-time and edge systems. In this paper, we propose a lightweight online adaptation framework for RL based on Reservoir Computing. Specifically, we integrate an Echo State Networks (ESNs) as an adaptation module that encodes recent observation histories into a latent context representation, and update its readout weights online using Recursive Least Squares (RLS). This design enables rapid adaptation without backpropagation, pretraining, or access to privileged information. We evaluate the proposed method on CartPole and HalfCheetah tasks with severe and abrupt environment changes, including periodic external disturbances and extreme friction variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms DR and representative adaptive baselines under out-of-distribution dynamics, achieving stable adaptation within a few control steps. Notably, the method successfully handles intra-episode environment changes without resetting the policy. Due to its computational efficiency and stability, the proposed framework provides a practical solution for online adaptation in non-stationary environments and is well suited for real-world robotic control and edge deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of trustworthy AI by resolving the conflict between OOD detection and machine unlearning through the TFER framework, which preserves model stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring AI safety requires robust OOD detection and flexible unlearning, but existing methods disrupt data structures, degrading anomaly detection.

Method: Introduces TFER, a Push-Pull mechanism inspired by the free energy principle, transforming unlearning into OOD sample generation via parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: TFER achieves precise unlearning, maintains discriminative performance, and provides structural stability against catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: TFER offers a promising solution for continual unlearning tasks by balancing OOD detection and class unlearning without costly retraining.

Abstract: Deploying trustworthy AI in open-world environments faces a dual challenge: the necessity for robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection to ensure system safety, and the demand for flexible machine unlearning to satisfy privacy compliance and model rectification. However, this objective encounters a fundamental geometric contradiction: current OOD detectors rely on a static and compact data manifold, whereas traditional classification-oriented unlearning methods disrupt this delicate structure, leading to a catastrophic loss of the model's capability to discriminate anomalies while erasing target classes. To resolve this dilemma, we first define the problem of boundary-preserving class unlearning and propose a pivotal conceptual shift: in the context of OOD detection, effective unlearning is mathematically equivalent to transforming the target class into OOD samples. Based on this, we propose the TFER (Total Free Energy Repulsion) framework. Inspired by the free energy principle, TFER constructs a novel Push-Pull game mechanism: it anchors retained classes within a low-energy ID manifold through a pull mechanism, while actively expelling forgotten classes to high-energy OOD regions using a free energy repulsion force. This approach is implemented via parameter-efficient fine-tuning, circumventing the prohibitive cost of full retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TFER achieves precise unlearning while maximally preserving the model's discriminative performance on remaining classes and external OOD data. More importantly, our study reveals that the unique Push-Pull equilibrium of TFER endows the model with inherent structural stability, allowing it to effectively resist catastrophic forgetting without complex additional constraints, thereby demonstrating exceptional potential in continual unlearning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores adversarial learning in zero-sum games under bandit feedback, introducing metrics like Pure-Strategy Maximin Regret. It proposes algorithms for uninformed and informed settings, achieving logarithmic regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by real-world scenarios where learners face unknown opponents and limited bandit feedback, aiming to overcome the unavoidable external regret barrier.

Method: The authors analyze the problem under two bandit feedback models (uninformed and informed) and propose algorithms like Tsallis-INF and Maximin-UCB for normal-form games, extending to bilinear games.

Result: For uninformed settings, Tsallis-INF achieves O(c log T) regret, while Maximin-UCB in informed settings achieves O(c' log T) regret, with c' potentially smaller than c. The results generalize to bilinear games.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that game-dependent logarithmic regret bounds are achievable in adversarial zero-sum games under bandit feedback, with informed settings offering potential advantages.

Abstract: Learning to play zero-sum games is a fundamental problem in game theory and machine learning. While significant progress has been made in minimizing external regret in the self-play settings or with full-information feedback, real-world applications often force learners to play against unknown, arbitrary opponents and restrict learners to bandit feedback where only the payoff of the realized action is observable. In such challenging settings, it is well-known that $Ω(\sqrt{T})$ external regret is unavoidable (where T is the number of rounds). To overcome this barrier, we investigate adversarial learning in zero-sum games under bandit feedback, aiming to minimize the deficit against the maximin pure strategy -- a metric we term Pure-Strategy Maximin Regret.
  We analyze this problem under two bandit feedback models: uninformed (only the realized reward is revealed) and informed (both the reward and the opponent's action are revealed). For uninformed bandit learning of normal-form games, we show that the Tsallis-INF algorithm achieves $O(c \log T)$ instance-dependent regret with a game-dependent parameter $c$. Crucially, we prove an information-theoretic lower bound showing that the dependence on c is necessary. To overcome this hardness, we turn to the informed setting and introduce Maximin-UCB, which obtains another regret bound of the form $O(c' \log T)$ for a different game-dependent parameter $c'$ that could potentially be much smaller than $c$. Finally, we generalize both results to bilinear games over an arbitrary, large action set, proposing Tsallis-FTRL-SPM and Maximin-LinUCB for the uninformed and informed setting respectively and establishing similar game-dependent logarithmic regret bounds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ERDF, a method leveraging label correlation and feature reuse within Deep Forest for Label Distribution Learning (LDL), outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Deep Forest (DF) methods for LDL lack effective ways to utilize label correlation, prompting the need for an enhanced approach.

Method: Proposes ERDF with two mechanisms: feature enhancement via label correlation and measure-aware feature reuse for stability.

Result: ERDF outperforms other algorithms across six evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: ERDF effectively enhances feature utilization and training stability in LDL, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) requires the learner to predict the degree of correlation between each sample and each label. To achieve this, a crucial task during learning is to leverage the correlation among labels. Deep Forest (DF) is a deep learning framework based on tree ensembles, whose training phase does not rely on backpropagation. DF performs in-model feature transform using the prediction of each layer and achieves competitive performance on many tasks. However, its exploration in the field of LDL is still in its infancy. The few existing methods that apply DF to the field of LDL do not have effective ways to utilize the correlation among labels. Therefore, we propose a method named Enhanced and Reused Feature Deep Forest (ERDF). It mainly contains two mechanisms: feature enhancement exploiting label correlation and measure-aware feature reuse. The first one is to utilize the correlation among labels to enhance the original features, enabling the samples to acquire more comprehensive information for the task of LDL. The second one performs a reuse operation on the features of samples that perform worse than the previous layer on the validation set, in order to ensure the stability of the training process. This kind of Enhance-Reuse pattern not only enables samples to enrich their features but also validates the effectiveness of their new features and conducts a reuse process to prevent the noise from spreading further. Experiments show that our method outperforms other comparison algorithms on six evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: LLM-SAA uses LLMs to generate distributions for decision-making, with practical utility in low-data scenarios, though traditional metrics like Wasserstein distance may mislead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess how LLM-generated distributions support downstream decisions, like pricing or inventory management, and evaluate their practical usefulness.

Method: Analyze LLM-SAA across three decision-making problems (assortment optimization, pricing, newsvendor) and compare decision outcomes with traditional metrics.

Result: LLM-generated distributions are useful, especially in low-data regimes, but decision-agnostic metrics can be misleading.

Conclusion: LLM-SAA shows promise for decision-making, but evaluation metrics should align with specific decision contexts.

Abstract: LLMs can generate a wealth of data, ranging from simulated personas imitating human valuations and preferences, to demand forecasts based on world knowledge. But how well do such LLM-generated distributions support downstream decision-making? For example, when pricing a new product, a firm could prompt an LLM to simulate how much consumers are willing to pay based on a product description, but how useful is the resulting distribution for optimizing the price? We refer to this approach as LLM-SAA, in which an LLM is used to construct an estimated distribution and the decision is then optimized under that distribution. In this paper, we study metrics to evaluate the quality of these LLM-generated distributions, based on the decisions they induce. Taking three canonical decision-making problems (assortment optimization, pricing, and newsvendor) as examples, we find that LLM-generated distributions are practically useful, especially in low-data regimes. We also show that decision-agnostic metrics such as Wasserstein distance can be misleading when evaluating these distributions for decision-making.

TL;DR: SpecGD and Muon optimizers show uniform singular value growth in LoRA fine-tuning of LLMs, contrasting with standard gradient flow. Theoretical analysis confirms equal-rate dynamics and global convergence under SpecGF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dynamics of spectral gradient descent (SpecGD) optimizers like Muon in LLM training are poorly understood, especially in LoRA settings where weight updates are low-rank. This study aims to clarify these dynamics.

Method: The paper analyzes spectral gradient flow (SpecGF) in a simplified LoRA-style matrix factorization setting, proving equal-rate dynamics and global convergence from bounded initializations.

Result: SpecGF shows uniform singular value growth, with smaller values reaching targets earlier than larger ones. Global convergence is proven under certain conditions, supported by experiments.

Conclusion: SpecGF's equal-rate dynamics and global convergence offer insights into LoRA fine-tuning, contrasting with standard gradient flow and highlighting its potential for LLM training.

Abstract: Spectral gradient descent (SpecGD) orthogonalizes the matrix parameter updates and has inspired practical optimizers such as Muon. They often perform well in large language model (LLM) training, but their dynamics remain poorly understood. In the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) setting, where weight updates are parameterized as a product of two low-rank factors, we find a distinctive spectral phenomenon under Muon in LoRA fine-tuning of LLMs: singular values of the LoRA product show near-uniform growth across the spectrum, despite orthogonalization being performed on the two factors separately. Motivated by this observation, we analyze spectral gradient flow (SpecGF)-a continuous-time analogue of SpecGD-in a simplified LoRA-style matrix factorization setting and prove "equal-rate" dynamics: all singular values grow at equal rates up to small deviations. Consequently, smaller singular values attain their target values earlier than larger ones, sharply contrasting with the largest-first stepwise learning observed in standard gradient flow. Moreover, we prove that SpecGF in our setting converges to global minima from almost all initializations, provided the factor norms remain bounded; with $\ell_2$ regularization, we obtain global convergence. Lastly, we corroborate our theory with experiments in the same setting.

TL;DR: A post-processing framework improves synthetic tabular data by balancing fidelity, utility, and privacy via mode patching and KNN filtering. Applied to neural models, it enhances distributional similarity and privacy metrics while maintaining utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing distributional fidelity, downstream utility, and privacy protection in synthetic tabular data sharing and analysis.

Method: Proposes a model-agnostic post-processing framework with mode patching (repairs underrepresented categories) and KNN filtering (enforces privacy by distance). Tested on neural models (feed-forward generator and VAE) across three datasets.

Result: Reduces categorical divergence by up to 36%, improves dependence preservation by 10-14%, and maintains downstream performance (~1% change). Privacy metrics improve without significantly affecting attribute inference attacks.

Conclusion: The framework provides practical improvements for synthetic data quality and privacy, complementing formal differential privacy methods, with actionable threshold recommendations.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data enables sharing and analysis of sensitive records, but its practical deployment requires balancing distributional fidelity, downstream utility, and privacy protection. We study a simple, model agnostic post processing framework that can be applied on top of any synthetic data generator to improve this trade off. First, a mode patching step repairs categories that are missing or severely underrepresented in the synthetic data, while largely preserving learned dependencies. Second, a k nearest neighbor filter replaces synthetic records that lie too close to real data points, enforcing a minimum distance between real and synthetic samples. We instantiate this framework for two neural generative models for tabular data, a feed forward generator and a variational autoencoder, and evaluate it on three public datasets covering credit card transactions, cardiovascular health, and census based income. We assess marginal and joint distributional similarity, the performance of models trained on synthetic data and evaluated on real data, and several empirical privacy indicators, including nearest neighbor distances and attribute inference attacks. With moderate thresholds between 0.2 and 0.35, the post processing reduces divergence between real and synthetic categorical distributions by up to 36 percent and improves a combined measure of pairwise dependence preservation by 10 to 14 percent, while keeping downstream predictive performance within about 1 percent of the unprocessed baseline. At the same time, distance based privacy indicators improve and the success rate of attribute inference attacks remains largely unchanged. These results provide practical guidance for selecting thresholds and applying post hoc repairs to improve the quality and empirical privacy of synthetic tabular data, while complementing approaches that provide formal differential privacy guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of distributed adversarial bandits, where agents must cooperate efficiently with limited local information, and improve upon existing regret bounds.

Method: Proposes an algorithm based on a black-box reduction to bandits with delayed feedback, leveraging gossip communication and volumetric spanners for linear bandits.

Result: Achieves minimax regret bound $	ildeΘ(\sqrt{(ρ^{-1/2}+K/N)T})$, improving previous results, and shows matching lower bounds for communication and bandit costs.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances communication and bandit costs, extends to linear bandits, and offers versatility in adversarial settings.

Abstract: We study distributed adversarial bandits, where $N$ agents cooperate to minimize the global average loss while observing only their own local losses. We show that the minimax regret for this problem is $\tildeΘ(\sqrt{(ρ^{-1/2}+K/N)T})$, where $T$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of actions, and $ρ$ is the spectral gap of the communication matrix. Our algorithm, based on a novel black-box reduction to bandits with delayed feedback, requires agents to communicate only through gossip. It achieves an upper bound that significantly improves over the previous best bound $\tilde{O}(ρ^{-1/3}(KT)^{2/3})$ of Yi and Vojnovic (2023). We complement this result with a matching lower bound, showing that the problem's difficulty decomposes into a communication cost $ρ^{-1/4}\sqrt{T}$ and a bandit cost $\sqrt{KT/N}$. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach by deriving first-order and best-of-both-worlds bounds in the distributed adversarial setting. Finally, we extend our framework to distributed linear bandits in $R^d$, obtaining a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{(ρ^{-1/2}+1/N)dT})$, achieved with only $O(d)$ communication cost per agent and per round via a volumetric spanner.

Motivation: EEG-based emotion recognition is challenging due to noisy, high-dimensional signals and subject variability, necessitating improved models for better accuracy and robustness.

Method: An enhanced hybrid model integrates convolutional feature extraction, bidirectional temporal modeling, self-attention mechanisms, and regularization to mitigate overfitting.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public EEG dataset, significantly outperforming baseline methods, with statistical validation and feature-level insights.

Conclusion: Hybrid architectures balance accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in EEG emotion recognition, advancing affective computing and intelligent systems.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition plays a critical role in affective computing and emerging decision-support systems, yet remains challenging due to high-dimensional, noisy, and subject-dependent signals. This study investigates whether hybrid deep learning architectures that integrate convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based components can improve emotion classification performance and robustness in EEG data. We propose an enhanced hybrid model that combines convolutional feature extraction, bidirectional temporal modeling, and self-attention mechanisms with regularization strategies to mitigate overfitting. Experiments conducted on a publicly available EEG dataset spanning three emotional states (neutral, positive, and negative) demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance, significantly outperforming classical machine learning and neural baselines. Statistical tests confirm the robustness of these performance gains under cross-validation. Feature-level analyses further reveal that covariance-based EEG features contribute most strongly to emotion discrimination, highlighting the importance of inter-channel relationships in affective modeling. These findings suggest that carefully designed hybrid architectures can effectively balance predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in EEG-based emotion recognition, with implications for applied affective computing and human-centered intelligent systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a global tokenization method for protein structures, addressing limitations of local tokenization and improving performance in generative and representation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing protein structure tokenizers that use local neighborhoods, which restrict their effectiveness in generative and representation tasks.

Method: Proposes a global tokenization approach where successive tokens add increasing detail to a global protein structure representation, mitigating issues like error accumulation.

Result: The global tokenization method outperforms local tokenizers in reconstruction, generative, and representation tasks, and enhances designability.

Conclusion: Global tokenization offers superior performance and flexibility in protein structure analysis, enabling advanced applications like zero-shot protein shrinking and affinity maturation.

Abstract: Tokenization is a promising path to multi-modal models capable of jointly understanding protein sequences, structure, and function. Existing protein structure tokenizers create tokens by pooling information from local neighborhoods, an approach that limits their performance on generative and representation tasks. In this work, we present a method for global tokenization of protein structures in which successive tokens contribute increasing levels of detail to a global representation. This change resolves several issues with generative models based on local protein tokenization: it mitigates error accumulation, provides embeddings without sequence-reduction operations, and allows task-specific adaptation of a tokenized sequence's information content. We validate our method on reconstruction, generative, and representation tasks and demonstrate that it matches or outperforms existing models based on local protein structure tokenizers. We show how adaptive tokens enable inference criteria based on information content, which boosts designability. We validate representations generated from our tokenizer on CATH classification tasks and demonstrate that non-linear probing on our tokenized sequences outperforms equivalent probing on representations from other tokenizers. Finally, we demonstrate how our method supports zero-shot protein shrinking and affinity maturation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study analyzes OSS contributor networks using graph neural networks and temporal analysis, identifying five distinct roles and showing the top 1% of contributors hold significant influence. Key metrics correlate with contributor actions, and Bridge roles are crucial for network cohesion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamics of OSS contributor networks, their influence distribution, and the roles that sustain innovation and community health.

Method: Advanced graph neural networks, temporal network analysis, GPU-accelerated PageRank, betweenness centrality, and custom LSTM models were applied to 25 years of data from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ecosystem.

Result: OSS networks show power-law influence distributions, five distinct contributor roles, correlations between actions and influence, and temporal trends in network metrics. Bridge contributors disproportionately impact cohesion.

Conclusion: The findings support strategic contributor retention policies and provide actionable insights for measuring and maintaining OSS community health.

Abstract: Open source software (OSS) projects rely on complex networks of contributors whose interactions drive innovation and sustainability. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of OSS contributor networks using advanced graph neural networks and temporal network analysis on data spanning 25 years from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ecosystem, encompassing sandbox, incubating, and graduated projects. Our analysis of thousands of contributors across hundreds of repositories reveals that OSS networks exhibit strong power-law distributions in influence, with the top 1\% of contributors controlling a substantial portion of network influence. Using GPU-accelerated PageRank, betweenness centrality, and custom LSTM models, we identify five distinct contributor roles: Core, Bridge, Connector, Regular, and Peripheral, each with unique network positions and structural importance. Statistical analysis reveals significant correlations between specific action types (commits, pull requests, issues) and contributor influence, with multiple regression models explaining substantial variance in influence metrics. Temporal analysis shows that network density, clustering coefficients, and modularity exhibit statistically significant temporal trends, with distinct regime changes coinciding with major project milestones. Structural integrity simulations show that Bridge contributors, despite representing a small fraction of the network, have a disproportionate impact on network cohesion when removed. Our findings provide empirical evidence for strategic contributor retention policies and offer actionable insights into community health metrics.

*Jasper A. Vrugt,Jonathan M. Frame,Ethan Bollman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a fully analytic framework for differentiable hydrologic modeling using exact parameter sensitivities to improve calibration speed and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the computational demands, truncation errors, and overhead of existing gradient-based methods in hydrologic model calibration.

Method: Augments ODE systems with sensitivity equations to jointly evolve model states and Jacobian matrices, providing analytic gradients for loss functions.

Result: Produces deterministic, interpretable gradients, eliminating numerical differentiation issues and autodiff overhead.

Conclusion: Enables faster, more stable, and transparent gradient-based calibration of hydrologic models without reliance on external autodiff libraries.

Abstract: Conceptual hydrologic models remain the cornerstone of rainfall-runoff modeling, yet their calibration is often slow and numerically fragile. Most gradient-based parameter estimation methods rely on finite-difference approximations or automatic differentiation frameworks (e.g., JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow), which are computationally demanding and introduce truncation errors, solver instabilities, and substantial overhead. These limitations are particularly acute for the ODE systems of conceptual watershed models. Here we introduce a fully analytic and computationally efficient framework for differentiable hydrologic modeling based on exact parameter sensitivities. By augmenting the governing ODE system with sensitivity equations, we jointly evolve the model states and the Jacobian matrix with respect to all parameters. This Jacobian then provides fully analytic gradient vectors for any differentiable loss function. These include classical objective functions such as the sum of absolute and squared residuals, widely used hydrologic performance metrics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta efficiencies, robust loss functions that down-weight extreme events, and hydrograph-based functionals such as flow-duration and recession curves. The analytic sensitivities eliminate the step-size dependence and noise inherent to numerical differentiation, while avoiding the instability of adjoint methods and the overhead of modern machine-learning autodiff toolchains. The resulting gradients are deterministic, physically interpretable, and straightforward to embed in gradient-based optimizers. Overall, this work enables rapid, stable, and transparent gradient-based calibration of conceptual hydrologic models, unlocking the full potential of differentiable modeling without reliance on external, opaque, or CPU-intensive automatic-differentiation libraries.

### [201] [Is Gradient Ascent Really Necessary? Memorize to Forget for Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06441)
*Zhuo Huang,Qizhou Wang,Ziming Hong,Shanshan Ye,Bo Han,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes model extrapolation as a stable alternative to gradient ascent for machine unlearning, avoiding catastrophic collapse while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability and performance degradation caused by gradient ascent in machine unlearning, ensuring ethical and safe AI by protecting sensitive data.

Method: Use model extrapolation: train the original model to memorize undesired data (memorization model), then extrapolate to obtain the forget model, avoiding gradient ascent.

Result: The method stabilizes unlearning, avoids catastrophic collapse, and maintains performance on retained data.

Conclusion: Model extrapolation is a simple, efficient, and effective solution for stable machine unlearning.

Abstract: For ethical and safe AI, machine unlearning rises as a critical topic aiming to protect sensitive, private, and copyrighted knowledge from misuse. To achieve this goal, it is common to conduct gradient ascent (GA) to reverse the training on undesired data. However, such a reversal is prone to catastrophic collapse, which leads to serious performance degradation in general tasks. As a solution, we propose model extrapolation as an alternative to GA, which reaches the counterpart direction in the hypothesis space from one model given another reference model. Therefore, we leverage the original model as the reference, further train it to memorize undesired data while keeping prediction consistency on the rest retained data, to obtain a memorization model. Counterfactual as it might sound, a forget model can be obtained via extrapolation from the memorization model to the reference model. Hence, we avoid directly acquiring the forget model using GA, but proceed with gradient descent for the memorization model, which successfully stabilizes the machine unlearning process. Our model extrapolation is simple and efficient to implement, and it can also effectively converge throughout training to achieve improved unlearning performance.

TL;DR: PiEvo is a framework that evolves scientific principles instead of static hypotheses, improving efficiency and discovery quality in LLM-based scientific agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based scientific agents are inefficient due to fixed priors and static hypothesis spaces, limiting novel discoveries and causing computational waste.

Method: PiEvo uses Bayesian optimization over an expanding principle space, integrating Gaussian Process-driven hypothesis selection and anomaly-driven augmentation.

Result: PiEvo achieves up to 93.15% solution quality (29.7%~31.1% improvement) and an 83.3% speedup in convergence, while maintaining robustness across domains.

Conclusion: PiEvo successfully addresses inefficiencies in LLM-based scientific discovery by dynamically evolving principles, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based scientific agents have accelerated scientific discovery, yet they often suffer from significant inefficiencies due to adherence to fixed initial priors. Existing approaches predominantly operate within a static hypothesis space, which restricts the discovery of novel phenomena, resulting in computational waste when baseline theories fail. To address this, we propose shifting the focus from searching hypotheses to evolving the underlying scientific principles. We present PiEvo, a principle-evolvable framework that treats scientific discovery as Bayesian optimization over an expanding principle space. By integrating Information-Directed Hypothesis Selection via Gaussian Process and an anomaly-driven augmentation mechanism, PiEvo enables agents to autonomously refine their theoretical worldview. Evaluation across four benchmarks demonstrates that PiEvo (1) achieves an average solution quality of up to 90.81%~93.15%, representing a 29.7%~31.1% improvement over the state-of-the-art, (2) attains an 83.3% speedup in convergence step via significantly reduced sample complexity by optimizing the compact principle space, and (3) maintains robust performance across diverse scientific domains and LLM backbones.

*Zhuo Huang,Runnan Chen,Bo Han,Gang Niu,Masashi Sugiyama,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BrokenBind introduces a flexible approach to bind modalities from different datasets, overcoming limitations of existing methods that rely on fixed datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal learning methods are limited to modalities within a given dataset, restricting generalization to unseen modalities and increasing dataset acquisition costs.

Method: BrokenBind leverages multiple datasets with shared and varying modalities, capturing relationships to generate pseudo embeddings for missing modalities.

Result: The framework enables universal modality binding, performs well in low-data scenarios, and outperforms established multi-modal baselines.

Conclusion: BrokenBind offers a scalable and flexible solution for multi-modal learning, freeing it from dataset constraints.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning combines various modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of real-world problems. A common strategy is to directly bind different modalities together in a specific joint embedding space. However, the capability of existing methods is restricted within the modalities presented in the given dataset, thus they are biased when generalizing to unpresented modalities in downstream tasks. As a result, due to such inflexibility, the viability of previous methods is seriously hindered by the cost of acquiring multi-modal datasets. In this paper, we introduce BrokenBind, which focuses on binding modalities that are presented from different datasets. To achieve this, BrokenBind simultaneously leverages multiple datasets containing the modalities of interest and one shared modality. Though the two datasets do not correspond to each other due to distribution mismatch, we can capture their relationship to generate pseudo embeddings to fill in the missing modalities of interest, enabling flexible and generalized multi-modal learning. Under our framework, any two modalities can be bound together, free from the dataset limitation, to achieve universal modality exploration. Further, to reveal the capability of our method, we study intensified scenarios where more than two datasets are needed for modality binding and show the effectiveness of BrokenBind in low-data regimes. Through extensive evaluation, we carefully justify the superiority of BrokenBind compared to well-known multi-modal baseline methods.

TL;DR: PCR resolves geometric conflict in GRPO gradients via Bayesian soft projection, improving training stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between reasoning plasticity and general capability retention in GRPO caused by geometric conflict in gradients.

Method: Introduce Probabilistic Conflict Resolution (PCR), a Bayesian framework modeling gradients as random variables and using uncertainty-aware soft projection.

Result: PCR smoothens training and enhances performance across various reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: PCR effectively resolves gradient conflicts in GRPO, optimizing training stability and task performance.

Abstract: Training stability remains a critical bottleneck for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often manifesting as a trade-off between reasoning plasticity and general capability retention. We identify a root cause as the geometric conflict between plasticity and stability gradients, which leads to destructive interference. Crucially, we argue that deterministic projection methods are suboptimal for GRPO as they overlook the intrinsic stochasticity of group-based gradient estimates. To address this, we propose Probabilistic Conflict Resolution (PCR), a Bayesian framework that models gradients as random variables. PCR dynamically arbitrates conflicts via an uncertainty-aware ``soft projection'' mechanism, optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCR significantly smooths the training trajectory and achieves superior performance in various reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the Window Dilemma, questioning the true nature of detected drifts in data streams and the practicality of drift verification. It suggests traditional batch learning may outperform drift-aware methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to challenge the effectiveness of Concept Drift Detectors by highlighting the Window Dilemma and the impracticality of drift verification in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors use an illustrative example and empirical comparisons of drift detectors against alternative adaptation strategies.

Result: Findings indicate that traditional batch learning techniques often perform better than drift-aware methods, questioning the utility of drift detectors in stream classification.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the Window Dilemma and verification challenges undermine the reliability of drift detectors, advocating for a reevaluation of their role in data stream analysis.

Abstract: Non-stationarity of an underlying data generating process that leads to distributional changes over time is a key characteristic of Data Streams. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as Concept Drift, has been intensively studied, and Concept Drift Detectors have been established as a class of methods for detecting such changes (drifts). For the most part, Drift Detectors compare regions (windows) of the data stream and detect drift if those windows are sufficiently dissimilar.
  In this work, we introduce the Window Dilemma, an observation that perceived drift is a product of windowing and not necessarily the underlying data generating process. Additionally, we highlight that drift detection is ill-posed, primarily because verification of drift events are implausible in practice. We demonstrate these contributions first by an illustrative example, followed by empirical comparisons of drift detectors against a variety of alternative adaptation strategies. Our main finding is that traditional batch learning techniques often perform better than their drift-aware counterparts further bringing into question the purpose of detectors in Stream Classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Optimal regret bounds for online bilevel optimization are established, with efficient algorithms proposed for standard and window-averaged settings, validated experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works lacked clarity on the optimality of regret bounds for OBO, prompting the need to establish and validate optimal bounds.

Method: Proposed algorithms minimize standard and window-averaged bilevel local regrets with efficient gradient evaluations and single-loop design.

Result: Achieved optimal regrets Ω(1+V_T) and Ω(T/W^2) with O(TlogT) inner-level evaluations and gradient-variation handling.

Conclusion: Theoretical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness and optimality of the proposed OBO algorithms.

Abstract: Online bilevel optimization (OBO) has emerged as a powerful framework for many machine learning problems. Prior works have developed several algorithms that minimize the standard bilevel local regret or the window-averaged bilevel local regret of the OBO problem, but the optimality of existing regret bounds remains unclear. In this work, we establish optimal regret bounds for both settings. For standard bilevel local regret, we propose an algorithm that achieves the optimal regret $Ω(1+V_T)$ with at most $O(T\log T)$ total inner-level gradient evaluations. We further develop a fully single-loop algorithm whose regret bound includes an additional gradient-variation terms. For the window-averaged bilevel local regret, we design an algorithm that captures sublinear environmental variation through a window-based analysis and achieves the optimal regret $Ω(T/W^2)$. Experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Group Causal Counterfactual Policy Optimization to improve LLMs' reasoning generalization by rewarding robust and effective reasoning patterns, not just correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward mechanisms for LLMs focus too much on final correctness, ignoring sound reasoning processes. This can lead to flawed logic being rewarded while valid reasoning is penalized.

Method: Proposes Group Causal Counterfactual Policy Optimization, which uses episodic causal counterfactual rewards to encourage robustness and effectiveness in reasoning patterns. Token-level advantages are derived from this reward to optimize the policy.

Result: The method demonstrates improved reasoning generalization across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach trains LLMs to favor process-valid and counterfactually robust reasoning, leading to better performance and generalization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks with advances in reasoning capabilities. However, existing reward mechanisms remain tightly coupled to final correctness and pay little attention to the underlying reasoning process: trajectories with sound reasoning but wrong answers receive low credit, while lucky guesses with flawed logic may be highly rewarded, affecting reasoning generalization. From a causal perspective, we interpret multi-candidate reasoning for a fixed question as a family of counterfactual experiments with theoretical supports. Building on this, we propose Group Causal Counterfactual Policy Optimization to explicitly train LLMs to learn generalizable reasoning patterns. It proposes an episodic causal counterfactual reward that jointly captures (i) robustness, encouraging the answer distribution induced by a reasoning step to remain stable under counterfactual perturbations; and (ii) effectiveness, enforcing sufficient variability so that the learned reasoning strategy can transfer across questions. We then construct token-level advantages from this reward and optimize the policy, encouraging LLMs to favor reasoning patterns that are process-valid and counterfactually robust. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate its advantages.

TL;DR: The paper addresses epistemic uncertainty in Process Reward Models (PRMs) during inference-time reasoning scaling, proposing Uncertainty-Aware Tree Search (UATS) to mitigate out-of-distribution errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the unreliability of PRMs in evaluating reasoning paths outside their training distribution, limiting the effectiveness of external search-guided LLMs.

Method: The authors propose UATS, which estimates uncertainty using Monte Carlo Dropout and dynamically allocates compute budget via a reinforcement learning-based controller.

Result: Experiments show that UATS effectively mitigates out-of-distribution errors, outperforming standard search methods.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that uncertainty-aware strategies like UATS can achieve sublinear regret scaling, improving LLM performance in complex problem-solving.

Abstract: Inference-time reasoning scaling has significantly advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving. A prevalent approach involves external search guided by Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, a fundamental limitation of this framework is the epistemic uncertainty of PRMs when evaluating reasoning paths that deviate from their training distribution. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of this challenge. We first provide empirical evidence that PRMs exhibit high uncertainty and unreliable scoring on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We then establish a theoretical framework proving that while standard search incurs linear regret accumulation, an uncertainty-aware strategy can achieve sublinear regret. Motivated by these findings, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Tree Search (UATS), a unified method that estimates uncertainty via Monte Carlo Dropout and dynamically allocates compute budget using a reinforcement learning-based controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the impact of OOD errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing effective multi-agent systems (MAS) is currently labor-intensive and hard to generalize, motivating the need for a more automated and adaptable solution.

Method: EvoMAS formulates MAS generation as structured configuration generation, using evolutionary techniques like feedback-conditioned mutation and crossover guided by execution traces.

Result: EvoMAS improves performance over human-designed MAS and prior methods, achieving +10.5 points on BBEH reasoning and +7.1 points on WorkBench, while ensuring higher executability and robustness.

Conclusion: EvoMAS demonstrates significant advancements in automating MAS generation, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for complex tasks.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) show strong promise for complex reasoning, planning, and tool-augmented tasks, but designing effective MAS architectures remains labor-intensive, brittle, and hard to generalize. Existing automatic MAS generation methods either rely on code generation, which often leads to executability and robustness failures, or impose rigid architectural templates that limit expressiveness and adaptability. We propose Evolutionary Generation of Multi-Agent Systems (EvoMAS), which formulates MAS generation as structured configuration generation. EvoMAS performs evolutionary generation in configuration space. Specifically, EvoMAS selects initial configurations from a pool, applies feedback-conditioned mutation and crossover guided by execution traces, and iteratively refines both the candidate pool and an experience memory. We evaluate EvoMAS on diverse benchmarks, including BBEH, SWE-Bench, and WorkBench, covering reasoning, software engineering, and tool-use tasks. EvoMAS consistently improves task performance over both human-designed MAS and prior automatic MAS generation methods, while producing generated systems with higher executability and runtime robustness. EvoMAS outperforms the agent evolution method EvoAgent by +10.5 points on BBEH reasoning and +7.1 points on WorkBench. With Claude-4.5-Sonnet, EvoMAS also reaches 79.1% on SWE-Bench-Verified, matching the top of the leaderboard.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations of deep knowledge tracing models, such as long training times and overfitting on short sequences, by leveraging TFMs for efficient, real-time knowledge tracing.

Method: Utilizes a two-way attention mechanism in TFMs, attending across time steps and interactions of other students, aligning testing sequences with relevant training sequences at inference time.

Result: Competitive predictive performance with up to 273x speedups, demonstrating scalability as more student interactions are observed.

Conclusion: TFMs offer a promising paradigm for efficient, real-time knowledge tracing without the need for traditional training steps.

Abstract: Deep knowledge tracing models have achieved significant breakthroughs in modeling student learning trajectories. However, these architectures require substantial training time and are prone to overfitting on datasets with short sequences. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm for knowledge tracing by leveraging tabular foundation models (TFMs). Unlike traditional methods that require offline training on a fixed training set, our approach performs real-time ''live'' knowledge tracing in an online way. The core of our method lies in a two-way attention mechanism: while attention knowledge tracing models only attend across earlier time steps, TFMs simultaneously attend across both time steps and interactions of other students in the training set. They align testing sequences with relevant training sequences at inference time, therefore skipping the training step entirely. We demonstrate, using several datasets of increasing size, that our method achieves competitive predictive performance with up to 273x speedups, in a setting where more student interactions are observed over time.

TL;DR: AdverISF is a self-supervised adversarial framework for isolating task-relevant features from noise in data-scarce domains like material science, outperforming existing methods without explicit separation labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard regularization and adversarial adaptation methods struggle with separating meaningful features from noise in experimental datasets, especially without explicit supervision.

Method: AdverISF uses a self-supervised adversarial mechanism to enforce statistical independence between task-relevant features and noise, alongside a multi-layer separation architecture to recover discarded features.

Result: AdverISF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in data-scarce scenarios and achieves superior generalization in real-world material design tasks.

Conclusion: AdverISF effectively isolates task-relevant features from noise without supervision, improving generalization in data-scarce domains.

Abstract: Generalizing from limited data is particularly critical for models in domains such as material science, where task-relevant features in experimental datasets are often heavily confounded by measurement noise and experimental artifacts. Standard regularization techniques fail to precisely separate meaningful features from noise, while existing adversarial adaptation methods are limited by their reliance on explicit separation labels. To address this challenge, we propose the Adversarial Information Separation Framework (AdverISF), which isolates task-relevant features from noise without requiring explicit supervision. AdverISF introduces a self-supervised adversarial mechanism to enforce statistical independence between task-relevant features and noise representations. It further employs a multi-layer separation architecture that progressively recycles noise information across feature hierarchies to recover features inadvertently discarded as noise, thereby enabling finer-grained feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdverISF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in data-scarce scenarios. In addition, evaluations on real-world material design tasks show that it achieves superior generalization performance.

TL;DR: DMA*-SH is a hypernetwork-based framework addressing zero-shot generalization challenges in contextual RL, specifically actuator inversion, achieving superior performance compared to alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of zero-shot generalization in contextual RL, particularly when contexts are latent and actuator inversion complicates learning.

Method: Uses a single hypernetwork trained via dynamics prediction to generate shared adapter weights across dynamics model, policy, and action-value function. Techniques like input/output normalization and random input masking stabilize context inference.

Result: Outperforms domain randomization by 111.8% and a standard context-aware baseline by 16.1% on the Actuator Inversion Benchmark (AIB).

Conclusion: DMA*-SH effectively tackles actuator inversion, demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization and improved learning efficiency.

Abstract: Zero-shot generalization in contextual reinforcement learning remains a core challenge, particularly when the context is latent and must be inferred from data. A canonical failure mode is actuator inversion, where identical actions produce opposite physical effects under a latent binary context. We propose DMA*-SH, a framework where a single hypernetwork, trained solely via dynamics prediction, generates a small set of adapter weights shared across the dynamics model, policy, and action-value function. This shared modulation imparts an inductive bias matched to actuator inversion, while input/output normalization and random input masking stabilize context inference, promoting directionally concentrated representations. We provide theoretical support via an expressivity separation result for hypernetwork modulation, and a variance decomposition with policy-gradient variance bounds that formalize how within-mode compression improves learning under actuator inversion. For evaluation, we introduce the Actuator Inversion Benchmark (AIB), a suite of environments designed to isolate discontinuous context-to-dynamics interactions. On AIB's held-out actuator-inversion tasks, DMA*-SH achieves zero-shot generalization, outperforming domain randomization by 111.8% and surpassing a standard context-aware baseline by 16.1%.

TL;DR: MERGE introduces a component-wise model merging method called MERGE, which dynamically combines modular experts for input-specific model assembly, improving efficiency and performance over monolithic merging approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods lack reusability and treat models as monolithic entities, ignoring the diverse mergeability of components like attention and MLP layers. MERGE aims to address these limitations.

Method: MERGE formulates component-wise merging as a bi-objective optimization problem, balancing performance and storage efficiency. It uses a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm to find Pareto-optimal configurations and a routing network to dynamically assemble models.

Result: MERGE outperforms baselines across various model scales, task types, and fine-tuning strategies, demonstrating effective generalization and efficiency.

Conclusion: MERGE provides a scalable, efficient, and reusable solution for fine-grained model merging, addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Model merging constructs versatile models by integrating task-specific models without requiring labeled data or expensive joint retraining. Although recent methods improve adaptability to heterogeneous tasks by generating customized merged models for each instance, they face two critical limitations. First, the instance-specific merged models lack reusability, restricting the exploitation of high-quality merging configurations and efficient batch inference. Second, these methods treat each task-specific model as a monolithic whole, overlooking the diverse mergeability of homologous components such as attention and multilayer perceptron layers, and the differing merging sensitivities across components. To address these limitations, we propose MERGE (\underline{M}odular \underline{E}xpert \underline{R}ecombination for fine-\underline{G}rained m\underline{E}rging), a method that enables component-wise model merging and input-aware, on-demand module recombination at inference. MERGE formulates component-wise merging as a bi-objective optimization problem that balances cross-task performance and storage efficiency, and develops a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm to efficiently identify Pareto-optimal merging configurations. These high-quality configurations underpin a reusable modular expert library, from which a lightweight routing network dynamically activates and recombines modular experts to assemble input-specific models and enable efficient inference under storage constraints. Extensive experiments across various model scales, task types, and fine-tuning strategies demonstrate that MERGE consistently outperforms strong baselines and generalizes effectively.

### [215] [Which Graph Shift Operator? A Spectral Answer to an Empirical Question](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06557)
*Yassine Abbahaddou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a principled metric to select the optimal Graph Shift Operator (GSO) for GNNs, avoiding empirical search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GSO selection lacks theoretical grounding, relying on trial-and-error.

Method: Introduces an alignment gain metric linking geometric distortion to generalization bounds via Lipschitz constant.

Result: Provides a computation-efficient criterion for GSO selection.

Conclusion: The metric enables optimal GSO choice pre-training, reducing empirical search.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have established themselves as the leading models for learning on graph-structured data, generally categorized into spatial and spectral approaches. Central to these architectures is the Graph Shift Operator (GSO), a matrix representation of the graph structure used to filter node signals. However, selecting the optimal GSO, whether fixed or learnable, remains largely empirical. In this paper, we introduce a novel alignment gain metric that quantifies the geometric distortion between the input signal and label subspaces. Crucially, our theoretical analysis connects this alignment directly to generalization bounds via a spectral proxy for the Lipschitz constant. This yields a principled, computation-efficient criterion to rank and select the optimal GSO for any prediction task prior to training, eliminating the need for extensive search.

*Giovanni Montanari,Côme Fiegel,Corentin Pla,Aadirupa Saha,Vianney Perchet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores online resource allocation with censored feedback, proving a regret lower bound and proposing algorithms RA-UCB and MG-UCB for known and unknown budgets, respectively, achieving near-optimal regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of allocating a budget across multiple arms under uncertain feedback, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards while balancing exploration and exploitation.

Method: Proposes RA-UCB for known budgets and MG-UCB for unknown budgets, both employing optimistic parameter estimation and confidence bounds to handle exploration-exploitation trade-offs.

Result: RA-UCB achieves regret of order O~(T^(1/2)) or O(poly-log T) with stronger assumptions, while MG-UCB matches these guarantees for unknown budgets.

Conclusion: The algorithms effectively tackle the problem's complexity, validated by experiments, and provide near-optimal regret bounds.

Abstract: We study the online resource allocation problem in which at each round, a budget $B$ must be allocated across $K$ arms under censored feedback. An arm yields a reward if and only if two conditions are satisfied: (i) the arm is activated according to an arm-specific Bernoulli random variable with unknown parameter, and (ii) the allocated budget exceeds a random threshold drawn from a parametric distribution with unknown parameter. Over $T$ rounds, the learner must jointly estimate the unknown parameters and allocate the budget so as to maximize cumulative reward facing the exploration--exploitation trade-off. We prove an information-theoretic regret lower bound $Ω(T^{1/3})$, demonstrating the intrinsic difficulty of the problem. We then propose RA-UCB, an optimistic algorithm that leverages non-trivial parameter estimation and confidence bounds. When the budget $B$ is known at the beginning of each round, RA-UCB achieves a regret of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$, and even $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}\text{-}\log T)$ under stronger assumptions. As for unknown, round dependent budget, we introduce MG-UCB, which allows within-round switching and infinitesimal allocations, and matches the regret guarantees of RA-UCB. We then validate our theoretical results through experiments on real-world datasets.

### [217] [Endogenous Resistance to Activation Steering in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06941)
*Alex McKenzie,Keenan Pepper,Stijn Servaes,Martin Leitgab,Murat Cubuktepe,Mike Vaiana,Diogo de Lucena,Judd Rosenblatt,Michael S. A. Graziano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large language models exhibit Endogenous Steering Resistance (ESR), recovering from misaligned activation steering. Llama-3.3-70B shows strong ESR, linked to specific latents, while smaller models show it less. ESR can be enhanced via prompting or training, raising implications for AI safety and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models resist task-misaligned activation steering and explore its implications for AI safety and controllability.

Method: Used sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to steer activations, identified ESR-linked latents, and tested interventions like zero-ablation, meta-prompts, and fine-tuning.

Result: Llama-3.3-70B exhibited significant ESR, with 26 SAE latents causally linked to it. Zero-ablation reduced multi-attempt rate by 25%, and meta-prompts increased it 4x. Fine-tuning induced ESR in smaller models.

Conclusion: ESR can protect against adversarial manipulation but may hinder beneficial interventions. Understanding and controlling ESR is key for transparent, controllable AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models can resist task-misaligned activation steering during inference, sometimes recovering mid-generation to produce improved responses even when steering remains active. We term this Endogenous Steering Resistance (ESR). Using sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to steer model activations, we find that Llama-3.3-70B shows substantial ESR, while smaller models from the Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families exhibit the phenomenon less frequently. We identify 26 SAE latents that activate differentially during off-topic content and are causally linked to ESR in Llama-3.3-70B. Zero-ablating these latents reduces the multi-attempt rate by 25%, providing causal evidence for dedicated internal consistency-checking circuits. We demonstrate that ESR can be deliberately enhanced through both prompting and training: meta-prompts instructing the model to self-monitor increase the multi-attempt rate by 4x for Llama-3.3-70B, and fine-tuning on self-correction examples successfully induces ESR-like behavior in smaller models. These findings have dual implications: ESR could protect against adversarial manipulation but might also interfere with beneficial safety interventions that rely on activation steering. Understanding and controlling these resistance mechanisms is important for developing transparent and controllable AI systems.

*Christof Duhme,Chris Lippe,Verena Hoerr,Xiaoyi Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transformer-based neural network is introduced for quantifying CEST MRI data, outperforming traditional gradient-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantifying CEST MRI data is complex due to multiple physiological variables, necessitating advanced methods for accurate parameter fitting.

Method: A self-supervised transformer-based neural network is used to fit parameters like metabolite concentrations and exchange rates from Bloch-McConnell equations.

Result: The neural network significantly outperforms classical gradient-based solvers in accuracy.

Conclusion: The transformer-based approach offers a superior solution for CEST MRI quantification, enhancing resolution and sensitivity.

Abstract: Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI is a non-invasive imaging modality for detecting metabolites. It offers higher resolution and sensitivity compared to conventional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). However, quantification of CEST data is challenging because the measured signal results from a complex interplay of many physiological variables. Here, we introduce a transformer-based neural network to fit parameters such as metabolite concentrations, exchange and relaxation rates of a physical model derived from Bloch-McConnell equations to in-vitro CEST spectra. We show that our self-supervised trained neural network clearly outperforms the solution of classical gradient-based solver.

TL;DR: Generative meta-models trained on neural activations improve interpretability and intervention fidelity without strong structural assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore an alternative to PCA and sparse autoencoders for analyzing neural activations, leveraging generative models for unbiased structure discovery.

Method: Training diffusion models on one billion residual stream activations to learn the distribution of internal states and applying them as priors for interventions.

Result: Diffusion loss correlates with compute and downstream utility; meta-models enhance fluency in interventions and isolate concepts into sparse neurons.

Conclusion: Generative meta-models provide a scalable, assumption-free approach to neural network interpretability.

Abstract: Existing approaches for analyzing neural network activations, such as PCA and sparse autoencoders, rely on strong structural assumptions. Generative models offer an alternative: they can uncover structure without such assumptions and act as priors that improve intervention fidelity. We explore this direction by training diffusion models on one billion residual stream activations, creating "meta-models" that learn the distribution of a network's internal states. We find that diffusion loss decreases smoothly with compute and reliably predicts downstream utility. In particular, applying the meta-model's learned prior to steering interventions improves fluency, with larger gains as loss decreases. Moreover, the meta-model's neurons increasingly isolate concepts into individual units, with sparse probing scores that scale as loss decreases. These results suggest generative meta-models offer a scalable path toward interpretability without restrictive structural assumptions. Project page: https://generative-latent-prior.github.io.

*Florian Eilers,Christof Duhme,Xiaoyi Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CVNNs' robustness to outliers is analyzed via adversarial attacks, focusing on phase-specific attacks. CVNNs show mixed robustness compared to RVNNs, with high susceptibility to phase changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure safe practical use of CVNNs by understanding their robustness against outliers, especially through adversarial attacks targeting phase information.

Method: Design Phase Attacks targeting phase information and adapt common adversarial attacks for complex-valued inputs.

Result: CVNNs are more robust than RVNNs in some scenarios but highly susceptible to phase changes, with Phase Attacks being more effective than regular attacks.

Conclusion: Phase information is a critical vulnerability in CVNNs, impacting robustness more than magnitude-based attacks.

Abstract: Complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) are rising in popularity for all kinds of applications. To safely use CVNNs in practice, analyzing their robustness against outliers is crucial. One well known technique to understand the behavior of deep neural networks is to investigate their behavior under adversarial attacks, which can be seen as worst case minimal perturbations. We design Phase Attacks, a kind of attack specifically targeting the phase information of complex-valued inputs. Additionally, we derive complex-valued versions of commonly used adversarial attacks. We show that in some scenarios CVNNs are more robust than RVNNs and that both are very susceptible to phase changes with the Phase Attacks decreasing the model performance more, than equally strong regular attacks, which can attack both phase and magnitude.

Conclusion: Thefindingsemphasizetheneedforprinciplednormselectioninadversarialattackdesignandevaluation,astheoptimal$p$dependsonthetask.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against deep neural networks are commonly constructed under $\ell_p$ norm constraints, most often using $p=1$, $p=2$ or $p=\infty$, and potentially regularized for specific demands such as sparsity or smoothness. These choices are typically made without a systematic investigation of how the norm parameter \( p \) influences the structural and perceptual properties of adversarial perturbations. In this work, we study how the choice of \( p \) affects sparsity and smoothness of adversarial attacks generated under \( \ell_p \) norm constraints for values of $p \in [1,2]$. To enable a quantitative analysis, we adopt two established sparsity measures from the literature and introduce three smoothness measures. In particular, we propose a general framework for deriving smoothness measures based on smoothing operations and additionally introduce a smoothness measure based on first-order Taylor approximations. Using these measures, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation across multiple real-world image datasets and a diverse set of model architectures, including both convolutional and transformer-based networks. We show that the choice of $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ is suboptimal in most cases and the optimal $p$ value is dependent on the specific task. In our experiments, using $\ell_p$ norms with $p\in [1.3, 1.5]$ yields the best trade-off between sparse and smooth attacks. These findings highlight the importance of principled norm selection when designing and evaluating adversarial attacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a noise-driven pre-training method for neural network initialization, improving convergence speed without extra data or architecture changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing initialization methods like Xavier and Kaiming are random and don't leverage optimization insights. The authors explore noise-based pre-training to structure parameters effectively.

Method: Pre-train networks to fit random noise, creating structured initial weights. Focuses on implicit neural representations (INRs) and Deep Image Prior (DIP)-style networks.

Result: Noise pre-training enhances convergence speed and stability, especially in capturing high-frequency components early. Effective despite noise lacking semantic information.

Conclusion: Noise-based pre-training is a lightweight, general alternative to traditional random initialization, optimizing deep networks more efficiently.

Abstract: Weight initialization plays a crucial role in the optimization behavior and convergence efficiency of neural networks. Most existing initialization methods, such as Xavier and Kaiming initializations, rely on random sampling and do not exploit information from the optimization process itself. We propose a simple, yet effective, initialization strategy based on self-supervised pre-training using random noise as the target. Instead of directly training the network from random weights, we first pre-train it to fit random noise, which leads to a structured and non-random parameter configuration. We show that this noise-driven pre-training significantly improves convergence speed in subsequent tasks, without requiring additional data or changes to the network architecture. The proposed method is particularly effective for implicit neural representations (INRs) and Deep Image Prior (DIP)-style networks, which are known to exhibit a strong low-frequency bias during optimization. After noise-based pre-training, the network is able to capture high-frequency components much earlier in training, leading to faster and more stable convergence. Although random noise contains no semantic information, it serves as an effective self-supervised signal (considering its white spectrum nature) for shaping the initialization of neural networks. Overall, this work demonstrates that noise-based pre-training offers a lightweight and general alternative to traditional random initialization, enabling more efficient optimization of deep neural networks.

*Chiara Lanza,Roberto Pereira,Marco Miozzo,Eduard Angelats,Paolo Dini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Isotropic regularization in continual learning doesn't improve accuracy and may degrade it, unlike its benefits in centralized training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if enforcing isotropy in continual learning can balance stability-plasticity and reduce catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Experiments with contrastive continual learning on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, testing isotropic regularization.

Result: Isotropic regularization fails to enhance and may harm model accuracy in continual learning.

Conclusion: Isotropy, useful in centralized learning, isn't suitable as an inductive bias for non-stationary continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: Centralized training is the standard paradigm in deep learning, enabling models to learn from a unified dataset in a single location. In such setup, isotropic feature distributions naturally arise as a mean to support well-structured and generalizable representations. In contrast, continual learning operates on streaming and non-stationary data, and trains models incrementally, inherently facing the well-known plasticity-stability dilemma. In such settings, learning dynamics tends to yield increasingly anisotropic feature space. This arises a fundamental question: should isotropy be enforced to achieve a better balance between stability and plasticity, and thereby mitigate catastrophic forgetting? In this paper, we investigate whether promoting feature-space isotropy can enhance representation quality in continual learning. Through experiments using contrastive continual learning techniques on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data, we find that isotropic regularization fails to improve, and can in fact degrade, model accuracy in continual settings. Our results highlight essential differences in feature geometry between centralized and continual learning, suggesting that isotropy, while beneficial in centralized setups, may not constitute an appropriate inductive bias for non-stationary learning scenarios.

TL;DR: DiTS is a novel diffusion transformer architecture for time series forecasting that models endogenous and exogenous variates as distinct modalities, using a dual-stream Transformer block to capture dependencies efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative time series models poorly address multi-dimensional properties and underutilize cross-variate dependencies, prompting the need for a better solution.

Method: DiTS uses a dual-stream Transformer block with Time Attention for temporal modeling and Variate Attention for cross-variate modeling, leveraging low-rank properties for efficiency.

Result: DiTS achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, outperforming traditional deterministic models, even without future exogenous variate observations.

Conclusion: DiTS offers superior generative forecasting capabilities by effectively modeling multi-dimensional time series data and cross-variate dependencies.

Abstract: While generative modeling on time series facilitates more capable and flexible probabilistic forecasting, existing generative time series models do not address the multi-dimensional properties of time series data well. The prevalent architecture of Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which relies on simplistic conditioning controls and a single-stream Transformer backbone, tends to underutilize cross-variate dependencies in covariate-aware forecasting. Inspired by Multimodal Diffusion Transformers that integrate textual guidance into video generation, we propose Diffusion Transformers for Time Series (DiTS), a general-purpose architecture that frames endogenous and exogenous variates as distinct modalities. To better capture both inter-variate and intra-variate dependencies, we design a dual-stream Transformer block tailored for time-series data, comprising a Time Attention module for autoregressive modeling along the temporal dimension and a Variate Attention module for cross-variate modeling. Unlike the common approach for images, which flattens 2D token grids into 1D sequences, our design leverages the low-rank property inherent in multivariate dependencies, thereby reducing computational costs. Experiments show that DiTS achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, regardless of the presence of future exogenous variate observations, demonstrating unique generative forecasting strengths over traditional deterministic deep forecasting models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Temporal resampling in offline reinforcement learning for healthcare degrades performance during live deployment, with standard metrics failing to detect issues. Three failure mechanisms are identified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate the impact of temporal manipulations (fixed time intervals) in offline reinforcement learning (ORL) for healthcare, as their effects on model safety and efficacy are unclear.

Method: The study uses a gridworld navigation task and the UVA/Padova clinical diabetes simulator to show how temporal resampling harms ORL performance. It identifies three failure mechanisms.

Result: Temporal resampling significantly reduces ORL performance during live deployment, and standard off-policy evaluation metrics often miss these drops.

Conclusion: The findings highlight risks in current healthcare ORL pipelines and stress the need for methods that address irregular clinical decision-making timing.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (ORL) has shown potential for improving decision-making in healthcare. However, contemporary research typically aggregates patient data into fixed time intervals, simplifying their mapping to standard ORL frameworks. The impact of these temporal manipulations on model safety and efficacy remains poorly understood. In this work, using both a gridworld navigation task and the UVA/Padova clinical diabetes simulator, we demonstrate that temporal resampling significantly degrades the performance of offline reinforcement learning algorithms during live deployment. We propose three mechanisms that drive this failure: (i) the generation of counterfactual trajectories, (ii) the distortion of temporal expectations, and (iii) the compounding of generalisation errors. Crucially, we find that standard off-policy evaluation metrics can fail to detect these drops in performance. Our findings reveal a fundamental risk in current healthcare ORL pipelines and emphasise the need for methods that explicitly handle the irregular timing of clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: This systematic review identifies approaches for creating synthetic test data without real-life raw data, finding partial solutions but highlighting gaps in evolving such data for high-privacy applications like e-Government services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need arises from applications requiring real-life-like test data while ensuring privacy, such as in international information exchange, medicine, and banking.

Method: The review followed systematic methodologies, including Kitchenham's, analyzing 1,013 publications and extracting data from 75 to identify 37 relevant approaches.

Result: No approach fully met the requirements, though nine were closest. Most methods require real-life data access, and synthetic data evolution remains understudied.

Conclusion: Further research is needed to develop synthetic test data evolution methods, especially as legal regulations evolve in Digital Government Solutions.

Abstract: Background: High-level system testing of applications that use data from e-Government services as input requires test data that is real-life-like but where the privacy of personal information is guaranteed. Applications with such strong requirement include information exchange between countries, medicine, banking, etc. This review aims to synthesize the current state-of-the-practice in this domain.
  Objectives: The objective of this Systematic Review is to identify existing approaches for creating and evolving synthetic test data without using real-life raw data.
  Methods: We followed well-known methodologies for conducting systematic literature reviews, including the ones from Kitchenham as well as guidelines for analysing the limitations of our review and its threats to validity.
  Results: A variety of methods and tools exist for creating privacy-preserving test data. Our search found 1,013 publications in IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and SCOPUS. We extracted data from 75 of those publications and identified 37 approaches that answer our research question partly. A common prerequisite for using these methods and tools is direct access to real-life data for data anonymization or synthetic test data generation. Nine existing synthetic test data generation approaches were identified that were closest to answering our research question. Nevertheless, further work would be needed to add the ability to evolve synthetic test data to the existing approaches.
  Conclusions: None of the publications really covered our requirements completely, only partially. Synthetic test data evolution is a field that has not received much attention from researchers but needs to be explored in Digital Government Solutions, especially since new legal regulations are being placed in force in many countries.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive-CaRe, a novel regularization strategy, balances predictive accuracy and causal robustness in medical outcome prediction by penalizing discrepancies between statistical and causal contributions of features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness in clinical outcome prediction, as traditional methods either focus on accuracy (supervised ML) or are overly conservative (causal learning).

Method: Proposes Adaptive-CaRe, a model-agnostic regularizer that penalizes differences between estimated statistical and causal contributions of input features.

Result: Effective balance achieved between robust predictors and competitive accuracy, validated on synthetic, benchmark, and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Adaptive-CaRe offers a practical solution for medical prediction, with future work exploring broader frameworks and models.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of outcomes is crucial for clinical decision-making and personalized patient care. Supervised machine learning algorithms, which are commonly used for outcome prediction in the medical domain, optimize for predictive accuracy, which can result in models latching onto spurious correlations instead of robust predictors. Causal structure learning methods on the other hand have the potential to provide robust predictors for the target, but can be too conservative because of algorithmic and data assumptions, resulting in loss of diagnostic precision. Therefore, we propose a novel model-agnostic regularization strategy, Adaptive-CaRe, for generalized outcome prediction in the medical domain. Adaptive-CaRe strikes a balance between both predictive value and causal robustness by incorporating a penalty that is proportional to the difference between the estimated statistical contribution and estimated causal contribution of the input features for model predictions. Our experiments on synthetic data establish the efficacy of the proposed Adaptive-CaRe regularizer in finding robust predictors for the target while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy. With experiments on a standard causal benchmark, we provide a blueprint for navigating the trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness by tweaking the regularization strength, $λ$. Validation using real-world dataset confirms that the results translate to practical, real-domain settings. Therefore, Adaptive-CaRe provides a simple yet effective solution to the long-standing trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness in the medical domain. Future work would involve studying alternate causal structure learning frameworks and complex classification models to provide deeper insights at a larger scale.

### [228] [Temperature Scaling Attack Disrupting Model Confidence in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06638)
*Kichang Lee,Jaeho Jin,JaeYeon Park,Songkuk Kim,JeongGil Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temperature Scaling Attack (TSA), which degrades confidence calibration in federated learning while maintaining accuracy, evading detection, and causing significant real-world impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior federated learning attacks focus on accuracy or backdoors, but the authors identify confidence calibration as a new attack surface, given its importance in mission-critical systems.

Method: TSA involves injecting temperature scaling with learning rate-temperature coupling during local training to distort confidence while appearing benign in accuracy-based monitoring.

Result: TSA increases calibration error significantly (e.g., 145% on CIFAR-100) with minimal accuracy impact (<2%), even bypassing robust aggregation and post-hoc defenses. Real-world case studies show severe consequences like missed critical cases or false alarms.

Conclusion: Confidence calibration integrity is a critical vulnerability in federated learning, requiring new defenses.

Abstract: Predictive confidence serves as a foundational control signal in mission-critical systems, directly governing risk-aware logic such as escalation, abstention, and conservative fallback. While prior federated learning attacks predominantly target accuracy or implant backdoors, we identify confidence calibration as a distinct attack objective. We present the Temperature Scaling Attack (TSA), a training-time attack that degrades calibration while preserving accuracy. By injecting temperature scaling with learning rate-temperature coupling during local training, malicious updates maintain benign-like optimization behavior, evading accuracy-based monitoring and similarity-based detection. We provide a convergence analysis under non-IID settings, showing that this coupling preserves standard convergence bounds while systematically distorting confidence. Across three benchmarks, TSA substantially shifts calibration (e.g., 145% error increase on CIFAR-100) with <2 accuracy change, and remains effective under robust aggregation and post-hoc calibration defenses. Case studies further show that confidence manipulation can cause up to 7.2x increases in missed critical cases (healthcare) or false alarms (autonomous driving), even when accuracy is unchanged. Overall, our results establish calibration integrity as a critical attack surface in federated learning.

### [229] [Pruning at Initialisation through the lens of Graphon Limit: Convergence, Expressivity, and Generalisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06675)
*Hoang Pham,The-Anh Ta,Long Tran-Thanh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper connects pruning at initialization (PaI) methods to graphon theory, establishing deterministic limits for sparse subnetworks and introducing a topological taxonomy for sparse networks. It proves theoretical results on approximation and generalization for sparse networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical mechanisms behind PaI methods are unclear, and existing analyses lack rigorous characterization of global sparsity patterns in large networks.

Method: Linking PaI masks to graphons, introducing a Factorised Saliency Model, and proving convergence to deterministic bipartite graphons under regularity conditions.

Result: Unstructured methods converge to homogeneous graphons, while data-driven methods converge to heterogeneous ones. Derived theoretical results include a Universal Approximation Theorem and a Graphon-NTK generalization bound.

Conclusion: The framework shifts sparse network analysis from combinatorial problems to continuous operators, advancing understanding of expressivity and generalization.

Abstract: Pruning at Initialisation methods discover sparse, trainable subnetworks before training, but their theoretical mechanisms remain elusive. Existing analyses are often limited to finite-width statistics, lacking a rigorous characterisation of the global sparsity patterns that emerge as networks grow large. In this work, we connect discrete pruning heuristics to graph limit theory via graphons, establishing the graphon limit of PaI masks. We introduce a Factorised Saliency Model that encompasses popular pruning criteria and prove that, under regularity conditions, the discrete masks generated by these algorithms converge to deterministic bipartite graphons. This limit framework establishes a novel topological taxonomy for sparse networks: while unstructured methods (e.g., Random, Magnitude) converge to homogeneous graphons representing uniform connectivity, data-driven methods (e.g., SNIP, GraSP) converge to heterogeneous graphons that encode implicit feature selection. Leveraging this continuous characterisation, we derive two fundamental theoretical results: (i) a Universal Approximation Theorem for sparse networks that depends only on the intrinsic dimension of active coordinate subspaces; and (ii) a Graphon-NTK generalisation bound demonstrating how the limit graphon modulates the kernel geometry to align with informative features. Our results transform the study of sparse neural networks from combinatorial graph problems into a rigorous framework of continuous operators, offering a new mechanism for analysing expressivity and generalisation in sparse neural networks.

*Victor Armegioiu*

TL;DR: Autoregressive PDE solvers drift over long rollouts due to unresolved fine scales. Memory-conditioned diffusion/flow-matching improves accuracy and stability for long-horizon rollouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the drift issue in autoregressive generative PDE solvers caused by unresolved fine scales and improve stability in coarse-to-fine regimes.

Method: Introduce memory-conditioned diffusion/flow-matching with a compact online state injected into denoising via latent features, utilizing Mori--Zwanzig projection formalism.

Result: Improved accuracy and stability in long-horizon rollouts, better fine-scale spectral and statistical fidelity in experiments.

Conclusion: Memory-conditioned methods enhance stability and accuracy in PDE solvers, addressing limitations of memoryless closures.

Abstract: Autoregressive generative PDE solvers can be accurate one step ahead yet drift over long rollouts, especially in coarse-to-fine regimes where each step must regenerate unresolved fine scales. This is the regime of diffusion and flow-matching generators: although their internal dynamics are Markovian, rollout stability is governed by per-step \emph{conditional law} errors. Using the Mori--Zwanzig projection formalism, we show that eliminating unresolved variables yields an exact resolved evolution with a Markov term, a memory term, and an orthogonal forcing, exposing a structural limitation of memoryless closures. Motivated by this, we introduce memory-conditioned diffusion/flow-matching with a compact online state injected into denoising via latent features. Via disintegration, memory induces a structured conditional tail prior for unresolved scales and reduces the transport needed to populate missing frequencies. We prove Wasserstein stability of the resulting conditional kernel. We then derive discrete Grönwall rollout bounds that separate memory approximation from conditional generation error. Experiments on compressible flows with shocks and multiscale mixing show improved accuracy and markedly more stable long-horizon rollouts, with better fine-scale spectral and statistical fidelity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NanoQuant is a post-training quantization method for LLMs, achieving efficient binary and sub-1-bit compression with low-rank binary factorization and ADMM optimization, enabling large models to run on consumer hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing weight-only quantization methods fail to efficiently compress models to binary or sub-1-bit levels without excessive data, compute, or storage costs.

Method: NanoQuant formulates quantization as low-rank binary factorization, using ADMM for precise initialization and block/model reconstruction for tuning.

Result: NanoQuant compresses LLMs (e.g., Llama2-70B by 25.8x in 13 hours on an H100) to sub-1-bit levels, enabling deployment on 8 GB GPUs with state-of-the-art accuracy.

Conclusion: NanoQuant sets a new benchmark for low-memory PTQ, making large-scale LLM deployment feasible on consumer hardware.

Abstract: Weight-only quantization has become a standard approach for efficiently serving large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods fail to efficiently compress models to binary (1-bit) levels, as they either require large amounts of data and compute or incur additional storage. In this work, we propose NanoQuant, the first post-training quantization (PTQ) method to compress LLMs to both binary and sub-1-bit levels. NanoQuant formulates quantization as a low-rank binary factorization problem, and compresses full-precision weights to low-rank binary matrices and scales. Specifically, it utilizes an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method to precisely initialize latent binary matrices and scales, and then tune the initialized parameters through a block and model reconstruction process. Consequently, NanoQuant establishes a new Pareto frontier in low-memory post-training quantization, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy even at sub-1-bit compression rates. NanoQuant makes large-scale deployment feasible on consumer hardware. For example, it compresses Llama2-70B by 25.8$\times$ in just 13 hours on a single H100, enabling a 70B model to operate on a consumer 8 GB GPU.

TL;DR: This paper explores extending equivariance in neural networks to infinite-dimensional groups using energy-based canonicalisation, achieving approximate equivariance without heavy data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome efficiency and data demands in deep learning by extending equivariance beyond compact or finite groups to infinite-dimensional ones.

Method: The method involves inducing diffeomorphism equivariance in pre-trained networks via energy-based canonicalisation, leveraging differentiable image registration techniques.

Result: Empirical results show the approach achieves approximate equivariance and generalises to unseen transformations without extensive retraining or augmentation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that energy-based canonicalisation effectively extends equivariance to infinite-dimensional groups, enhancing model generalisation.

Abstract: Incorporating group symmetries via equivariance into neural networks has emerged as a robust approach for overcoming the efficiency and data demands of modern deep learning. While most existing approaches, such as group convolutions and averaging-based methods, focus on compact, finite, or low-dimensional groups with linear actions, this work explores how equivariance can be extended to infinite-dimensional groups. We propose a strategy designed to induce diffeomorphism equivariance in pre-trained neural networks via energy-based canonicalisation. Formulating equivariance as an optimisation problem allows us to access the rich toolbox of already established differentiable image registration methods. Empirical results on segmentation and classification tasks confirm that our approach achieves approximate equivariance and generalises to unseen transformations without relying on extensive data augmentation or retraining.

TL;DR: The study explores how architectural and optimization choices in transformers influence grokking speed and behavior, revealing nuanced insights beyond lazy-to-rich transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand grokking in transformers by examining inductive biases from architecture and optimization, and how they affect learning dynamics.

Method: Analyzes the impact of Layer Normalization placement and optimization settings (e.g., readout scale, learning rate) on grokking, with attention to shortcut learning and feature evolution.

Result: Architectural choices like LN position significantly affect grokking speed, while optimization settings complicate interpretations of controls like readout scale. Features evolve continuously, and generalization correlates with feature compressibility.

Conclusion: Grokking in transformers is shaped by inductive biases and involves continuous feature evolution, with generalization linked to compressibility.

Abstract: We investigate grokking in transformers through the lens of inductive bias: dispositions arising from architecture or optimization that let the network prefer one solution over another. We first show that architectural choices such as the position of Layer Normalization (LN) strongly modulates grokking speed. This modulation is explained by isolating how LN on specific pathways shapes shortcut-learning and attention entropy. Subsequently, we study how different optimization settings modulate grokking, inducing distinct interpretations of previously proposed controls such as readout scale. Particularly, we find that using readout scale as a control for lazy training can be confounded by learning rate and weight decay in our setting. Accordingly, we show that features evolve continuously throughout training, suggesting grokking in transformers can be more nuanced than a lazy-to-rich transition of the learning regime. Finally, we show how generalization predictably emerges with feature compressibility in grokking, across different modulators of inductive bias. Our code is released at https://tinyurl.com/y52u3cad.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AEGPO improves GRPO by using attention entropy to prioritize high-value samples and critical moments, leading to faster convergence and better alignment in RLHF tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLHF methods like GRPO inefficiently treat all prompts and denoising steps uniformly, missing variations in sample learning value and dynamic exploration moments.

Method: AEGPO leverages attention entropy (ΔEntropy and Entropy(t)) as dual signals: ΔEntropy allocates rollout budgets globally, while Entropy(t) peaks guide local exploration.

Result: AEGPO outperforms GRPO variants in text-to-image tasks, showing faster convergence and superior alignment.

Conclusion: Attention entropy effectively identifies high-value samples and critical moments, enabling AEGPO to optimize RLHF more efficiently.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) shows promise for aligning diffusion and flow models, yet policy optimization methods such as GRPO suffer from inefficient and static sampling strategies. These methods treat all prompts and denoising steps uniformly, ignoring substantial variations in sample learning value as well as the dynamic nature of critical exploration moments.
  To address this issue, we conduct a detailed analysis of the internal attention dynamics during GRPO training and uncover a key insight: attention entropy can serve as a powerful dual-signal proxy. First, across different samples, the relative change in attention entropy (ΔEntropy), which reflects the divergence between the current policy and the base policy, acts as a robust indicator of sample learning value. Second, during the denoising process, the peaks of absolute attention entropy (Entropy(t)), which quantify attention dispersion, effectively identify critical timesteps where high-value exploration occurs.
  Building on this observation, we propose Adaptive Entropy-Guided Policy Optimization (AEGPO), a novel dual-signal, dual-level adaptive optimization strategy. At the global level, AEGPO uses ΔEntropy to dynamically allocate rollout budgets, prioritizing prompts with higher learning value. At the local level, it exploits the peaks of Entropy(t) to guide exploration selectively at critical high-dispersion timesteps rather than uniformly across all denoising steps.
  By focusing computation on the most informative samples and the most critical moments, AEGPO enables more efficient and effective policy optimization. Experiments on text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that AEGPO significantly accelerates convergence and achieves superior alignment performance compared to standard GRPO variants.

TL;DR: SaDiT accelerates protein backbone generation by combining SaProt Tokenization with a Diffusion Transformer, reducing complexity while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based protein design methods are computationally intensive; SaDiT aims to improve speed and efficiency.

Method: Integrates SaProt Tokenization for structural compression and introduces IPA Token Cache to optimize Invariant Point Attention layers.

Result: SaDiT outperforms RFDiffusion and Proteina in speed and structural viability, excelling in unconditional and conditional generation tasks.

Conclusion: SaDiT offers a faster, more efficient approach to protein backbone generation with superior designability.

Abstract: Generative models for de novo protein backbone design have achieved remarkable success in creating novel protein structures. However, these diffusion-based approaches remain computationally intensive and slower than desired for large-scale structural exploration. While recent efforts like Proteina have introduced flow-matching to improve sampling efficiency, the potential of tokenization for structural compression and acceleration remains largely unexplored in the protein domain. In this work, we present SaDiT, a novel framework that accelerates protein backbone generation by integrating SaProt Tokenization with a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. SaDiT leverages a discrete latent space to represent protein geometry, significantly reducing the complexity of the generation process while maintaining theoretical SE(3) equivalence. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce an IPA Token Cache mechanism that optimizes the Invariant Point Attention (IPA) layers by reusing computed token states during iterative sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that SaDiT outperforms state-of-the-art models, including RFDiffusion and Proteina, in both computational speed and structural viability. We evaluate our model across unconditional backbone generation and fold-class conditional generation tasks, where SaDiT shows superior ability to capture complex topological features with high designability.

TL;DR: The paper studies plasticity (rate of change) in vision transformers, finding high plasticity in attention and feedforward layers improves finetuning, challenging the idea that smoothness is always desirable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of transformer plasticity in transfer learning, as its impact remains unclear compared to smoothness.

Method: Theoretical analysis and experiments measuring plasticity (sensitivity to input perturbation) in vision transformer components.

Result: Attention modules and feedforward layers with high plasticity lead to better finetuning performance.

Conclusion: Plasticity, not smoothness, is key for effective adaptation in transformers, providing practical guidance for component prioritization.

Abstract: The smoothness of the transformer architecture has been extensively studied in the context of generalization, training stability, and adversarial robustness. However, its role in transfer learning remains poorly understood. In this paper, we analyze the ability of vision transformer components to adapt their outputs to changes in inputs, or, in other words, their plasticity. Defined as an average rate of change, it captures the sensitivity to input perturbation; in particular, a high plasticity implies low smoothness. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments that this perspective provides principled guidance in choosing the components to prioritize during adaptation. A key takeaway for practitioners is that the high plasticity of the attention modules and feedforward layers consistently leads to better finetuning performance. Our findings depart from the prevailing assumption that smoothness is desirable, offering a novel perspective on the functional properties of transformers.

TL;DR: RLVR methods suffer from bias due to group size limitations, missing rare-correct trajectories. A new difficulty-aware advantage scaling improves performance without extra cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address bias in RLVR from impractical large group sizes, which misses rare-correct trajectories and favors common solutions.

Method: Propose a difficulty-aware advantage scaling coefficient (inspired by Focal loss) to down-weight high-success prompts, integrating into RLVR algorithms like GRPO, DAPO, CISPO.

Result: Improves pass@256 scores (e.g., 64.1 → 70.3 for GRPO) while maintaining pass@1, without added computational cost.

Conclusion: Lightweight modification effectively enhances RLVR performance by better handling rare-correct trajectories.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is commonly based on group sampling to estimate advantages and stabilize policy updates. In practice, large group sizes are not feasible due to computational limits, which biases learning toward trajectories that are already likely. Smaller groups often miss rare-correct trajectories while still containing mixed rewards, concentrating probability on common solutions. We derive the probability that updates miss rare-correct modes as a function of group size, showing non-monotonic behavior, and characterize how updates redistribute mass within the correct set, revealing that unsampled-correct mass can shrink even as total correct mass grows. Motivated by this analysis, we propose a difficulty-aware advantage scaling coefficient, inspired by Focal loss, that down-weights updates on high-success prompts. The lightweight modification can be directly integrated into any group-relative RLVR algorithm such as GRPO, DAPO, and CISPO. On Qwen2.5-7B across in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, our method improves pass@256 from 64.1 $\rightarrow$ 70.3 (GRPO), 69.3 $\rightarrow$ 72.5 (DAPO), and 73.2 $\rightarrow$ 76.8 (CISPO), while preserving or improving pass@1, without increasing group size or computational cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for verifying properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) by replacing units with piecewise affine functions, optimizing abstraction for accuracy and computational feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of verifying properties of KANs, which are complex due to their nonlinear activation functions, the paper introduces a systematic approach to create accurate yet computationally tractable abstractions.

Method: The method replaces KAN units with piecewise affine functions, optimizing the number of pieces using dynamic programming and knapsack optimization to balance accuracy and computational cost. Verification is performed via Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP).

Result: Empirical results show the method's upfront analysis costs are offset by superior verification outcomes across multiple KAN benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances abstraction accuracy and computational feasibility, providing a reliable tool for verifying KAN properties.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for verifying properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a class of neural networks characterized by nonlinear, univariate activation functions typically implemented as piecewise polynomial splines or Gaussian processes. Our method creates mathematical ``abstractions'' by replacing each KAN unit with a piecewise affine (PWA) function, providing both local and global error estimates between the original network and its approximation. These abstractions enable property verification by encoding the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), determining whether outputs satisfy specified properties when inputs belong to a given set. A critical challenge lies in balancing the number of pieces in the PWA approximation: too many pieces add binary variables that make verification computationally intractable, while too few pieces create excessive error margins that yield uninformative bounds. Our key contribution is a systematic framework that exploits KAN structure to find optimal abstractions. By combining dynamic programming at the unit level with a knapsack optimization across the network, we minimize the total number of pieces while guaranteeing specified error bounds. This approach determines the optimal approximation strategy for each unit while maintaining overall accuracy requirements. Empirical evaluation across multiple KAN benchmarks demonstrates that the upfront analysis costs of our method are justified by superior verification results.

TL;DR: The paper explores interpretable representations with VAEs, introducing AIRs to provably disentangle latent dimensions by modeling their dependence on actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in achieving disentangled representations in VAEs, where latent dimensions correspond to distinct generative factors, linked to nonlinear independent component analysis.

Method: The authors propose action-induced representations (AIRs) to model representations based on experiments/actions, introducing VAIR, a variational AIR architecture.

Result: VAIR achieves provable disentanglement of degrees of freedom w.r.t. action dependence, outperforming standard VAEs.

Conclusion: VAIR successfully disentangles generative factors while capturing their action dependence, linking experiments to the factors they influence.

Abstract: Learning interpretable representations with variational autoencoders (VAEs) is a major goal of representation learning. The main challenge lies in obtaining disentangled representations, where each latent dimension corresponds to a distinct generative factor. This difficulty is fundamentally tied to the inability to perform nonlinear independent component analysis. Here, we introduce the framework of action-induced representations (AIRs) which models representations of physical systems given experiments (or actions) that can be performed on them. We show that, in this framework, we can provably disentangle degrees of freedom w.r.t. their action dependence. We further introduce a variational AIR architecture (VAIR) that can extract AIRs and therefore achieve provable disentanglement where standard VAEs fail. Beyond state representation, VAIR also captures the action dependence of the underlying generative factors, directly linking experiments to the degrees of freedom they influence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a maximum entropy variant of forward-backward algorithms for zero-shot RL, extending its applicability to general utilities beyond additive rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional RL methods, which are limited to additive rewards, by tackling general utility functions in offline, unlabeled data settings.

Method: Develops a maximum entropy forward-backward algorithm to recover stochastic policies from offline data, coupled with zero-order search over policy embeddings for direct optimization.

Result: Demonstrates successful extension of FB algorithms' properties to general RL problems, verified through didactic and high-dimensional experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method retains the benefits of FB algorithms while expanding their scope to handle more complex and general RL tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) have facilitated the extraction of diverse behaviors from unlabeled, offline data sources. In particular, forward-backward algorithms (FB) can retrieve a family of policies that can approximately solve any standard RL problem (with additive rewards, linear in the occupancy measure), given sufficient capacity. While retaining zero-shot properties, we tackle the greater problem class of RL with general utilities, in which the objective is an arbitrary differentiable function of the occupancy measure. This setting is strictly more expressive, capturing tasks such as distribution matching or pure exploration, which may not be reduced to additive rewards. We show that this additional complexity can be captured by a novel, maximum entropy (soft) variant of the forward-backward algorithm, which recovers a family of stochastic policies from offline data. When coupled with zero-order search over compact policy embeddings, this algorithm can sidestep iterative optimization schemes, and optimizes general utilities directly at test-time. Across both didactic and high-dimensional experiments, we demonstrate that our method retains favorable properties of FB algorithms, while also extending their range to more general RL problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AEGIS improves both robustness and retention in concept erasure for diffusion models, addressing limitations of prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept erasure methods struggle to balance robustness (resisting reactivation of erased concepts) and retention (preserving unrelated concepts), often improving one at the expense of the other.

Method: The paper proposes AEGIS, a retention-data-free framework leveraging gradient-informed synergy for adversarial erasure.

Result: AEGIS enhances both robustness and retention simultaneously, outperforming prior retention-oriented or robustness-focused approaches.

Conclusion: AEGIS provides a more effective and balanced solution for concept erasure in diffusion models, advancing practical utility.

Abstract: Concept erasure helps stop diffusion models (DMs) from generating harmful content; but current methods face robustness retention trade off. Robustness means the model fine-tuned by concept erasure methods resists reactivation of erased concepts, even under semantically related prompts. Retention means unrelated concepts are preserved so the model's overall utility stays intact. Both are critical for concept erasure in practice, yet addressing them simultaneously is challenging, as existing works typically improve one factor while sacrificing the other. Prior work typically strengthens one while degrading the other, e.g., mapping a single erased prompt to a fixed safe target leaves class level remnants exploitable by prompt attacks, whereas retention-oriented schemes underperform against adaptive adversaries. This paper introduces Adversarial Erasure with Gradient Informed Synergy (AEGIS), a retention-data-free framework that advances both robustness and retention.

Motivation: To address limited training data in automated scoring engines by generating realistic essays that preserve original writing quality.

Method: Three prompting approaches (predict-next, sentence, 25-examples) were tested on simulated student essays, evaluated by human raters for score agreement and realism.

Result: Predict-next prompting showed highest score agreement among raters, best preserved original essay quality (with sentence strategy), and produced most realistic text (with 25-examples).

Conclusion: Predict-next prompting is the most effective strategy for generating high-quality, realistic essays to augment training datasets.

Abstract: Data augmentation can mitigate limited training data in machine-learning automated scoring engines for constructed response items. This study seeks to determine how well three approaches to large language model prompting produce essays that preserve the writing quality of the original essays and produce realistic text for augmenting ASE training datasets. We created simulated versions of student essays, and human raters assigned scores to them and rated the realism of the generated text. The results of the study indicate that the predict next prompting strategy produces the highest level of agreement between human raters regarding simulated essay scores, predict next and sentence strategies best preserve the rated quality of the original essay in the simulated essays, and predict next and 25 examples strategies produce the most realistic text as judged by human raters.

Motivation: Despite empirical success, multicalibration gradient boosting's convergence properties are not well understood, prompting this theoretical investigation.

Method: The study focuses on regression with squared-error loss, analyzing convergence rates (O(1/√T)), adaptive variants, and rescaling schemes.

Result: Results show O(1/√T) decay for prediction updates, linear convergence under smoothness, and local quadratic convergence for adaptive variants.

Conclusion: Theoretical convergence guarantees align with empirical performance, highlighting conditions for fast convergence and strong multicalibration.

Abstract: Multicalibration gradient boosting has recently emerged as a scalable method that empirically produces approximately multicalibrated predictors and has been deployed at web scale. Despite this empirical success, its convergence properties are not well understood. In this paper, we bridge the gap by providing convergence guarantees for multicalibration gradient boosting in regression with squared-error loss. We show that the magnitude of successive prediction updates decays at $O(1/\sqrt{T})$, which implies the same convergence rate bound for the multicalibration error over rounds. Under additional smoothness assumptions on the weak learners, this rate improves to linear convergence. We further analyze adaptive variants, showing local quadratic convergence of the training loss, and we study rescaling schemes that preserve convergence. Experiments on real-world datasets support our theory and clarify the regimes in which the method achieves fast convergence and strong multicalibration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop robust classifiers capable of handling adversarially perturbed inputs and adversarially chosen clean data labels, extending beyond traditional PAC learning.

Method: Formulate the problem as online learning, define a new dimension for hypothesis classes, and generalize it for multiclass settings and unknown perturbation sets.

Result: The new dimension controls mistake bounds (realizable) and regret bounds (agnostic), resembling Littlestone dimension, with extensions to multiclass and unknown perturbations.

Conclusion: The introduced dimension simplifies robust classifier learning analysis, bridging gaps between PAC and online settings, and works under adversarial conditions.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning robust classifiers where the classifier will receive a perturbed input. Unlike robust PAC learning studied in prior work, here the clean data and its label are also adversarially chosen. We formulate this setting as an online learning problem and consider both the realizable and agnostic learnability of hypothesis classes. We define a new dimension of classes and show it controls the mistake bounds in the realizable setting and the regret bounds in the agnostic setting. In contrast to the dimension that characterizes learnability in the PAC setting, our dimension is rather simple and resembles the Littlestone dimension. We generalize our dimension to multiclass hypothesis classes and prove similar results in the realizable case. Finally, we study the case where the learner does not know the set of allowed perturbations for each point and only has some prior on them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for extending graph neural networks to hypergraphs are fragmented. A unified, systematic approach is needed to capture complex hypergraph structures.

Method: The categorical Weisfeiler-Lehman framework is introduced, formalizing lifting as a functorial mapping to graded posets. Two functors from hypergraphs are proposed: incidence and symmetric simplicial complex functors.

Result: The derived architectures (Hypergraph Isomorphism Networks) surpass existing methods in capturing hypergraph structures and match the expressive power of the Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test.

Conclusion: The framework provides a systematic and theoretically grounded approach to hypergraph neural networks, validated by real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: While lifting map has significantly enhanced the expressivity of graph neural networks, extending this paradigm to hypergraphs remains fragmented. To address this, we introduce the categorical Weisfeiler-Lehman framework, which formalizes lifting as a functorial mapping from an arbitrary data category to the unifying category of graded posets. When applied to hypergraphs, this perspective allows us to systematically derive Hypergraph Isomorphism Networks, a family of neural architectures where the message passing topology is strictly determined by the choice of functor. We introduce two distinct functors from the category of hypergraphs: an incidence functor and a symmetric simplicial complex functor. While the incidence architecture structurally mirrors standard bipartite schemes, our functorial derivation enforces a richer information flow over the resulting poset, capturing complex intersection geometries often missed by existing methods. We theoretically characterize the expressivity of these models, proving that both the incidence-based and symmetric simplicial approaches subsume the expressive power of the standard Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks validate these theoretical findings.

TL;DR: Activation steering methods face non-identifiability issues due to behaviorally equivalent interventions, but identifiability can be restored with structural assumptions like independence or sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the interpretability and reliability of activation steering methods in controlling large language models, questioning the assumption that steering directions are uniquely identifiable.

Method: The authors formalize steering as interventions on internal representations and prove non-identifiability under realistic conditions. They empirically validate this across models and traits.

Result: Steering vectors are non-identifiable due to equivalent intervention classes, but identifiability is achievable with assumptions like independence or multi-environment validation.

Conclusion: The study highlights interpretability limits in activation steering and underscores the need for structural assumptions to ensure reliable control in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Activation steering methods, such as persona vectors, are widely used to control large language model behavior and increasingly interpreted as revealing meaningful internal representations. This interpretation implicitly assumes steering directions are identifiable and uniquely recoverable from input-output behavior. We formalize steering as an intervention on internal representations and prove that, under realistic modeling and data conditions, steering vectors are fundamentally non-identifiable due to large equivalence classes of behaviorally indistinguishable interventions. Empirically, we validate this across multiple models and semantic traits, showing orthogonal perturbations achieve near-equivalent efficacy with negligible effect sizes. However, identifiability is recoverable under structural assumptions including statistical independence, sparsity constraints, multi-environment validation or cross-layer consistency. These findings reveal fundamental interpretability limits and clarify structural assumptions required for reliable safety-critical control.

### [247] [Displacement-Resistant Extensions of DPO with Nonconvex $f$-Divergences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06788)
*Idan Pipano,Shoham Sabach,Kavosh Asadi,Mohammad Ghavamzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The abstract introduces a generalization of DPO algorithms, identifying conditions under which the RLHF problem remains tractable without requiring convexity of f-divergence. It also proposes a new SquaredPO loss with stronger guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current DPO algorithms by broadening the conditions under which RLHF remains tractable and preventing probability displacement.

Method: Identifies DPO-inducing conditions for tractability and displacement-resistant conditions for stable outcomes, leading to the SquaredPO loss.

Result: The SquaredPO loss provides stronger theoretical guarantees and competitive practical performance compared to DPO.

Conclusion: The work advances RLHF alignment by relaxing constraints and introducing a more robust loss function.

Abstract: DPO and related algorithms align language models by directly optimizing the RLHF objective: find a policy that maximizes the Bradley-Terry reward while staying close to a reference policy through a KL divergence penalty. Previous work showed that this approach could be further generalized: the original problem remains tractable even if the KL divergence is replaced by a family of $f$-divergence with a convex generating function $f$. Our first contribution is to show that convexity of $f$ is not essential. Instead, we identify a more general condition, referred to as DPO-inducing, that precisely characterizes when the RLHF problem remains tractable. Our next contribution is to establish a second condition on $f$ that is necessary to prevent probability displacement, a known empirical phenomenon in which the probabilities of the winner and the loser responses approach zero. We refer to any $f$ that satisfies this condition as displacement-resistant. We finally focus on a specific DPO-inducing and displacement-resistant $f$, leading to our novel SquaredPO loss. Compared to DPO, this new loss offers stronger theoretical guarantees while performing competitively in practice.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for analyzing rare events in LLMs, addressing their significance and providing tools for generation, probability estimation, and error analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare events in LLMs are significant but hard to observe during development. The scale of LLM usage makes these events prominent in deployment, necessitating systematic analysis.

Method: An end-to-end framework is presented, covering theory, efficient generation strategies, probability estimation, and error analysis. Concrete examples illustrate the approach.

Result: The framework provides practical tools for analyzing rare events in LLMs, with potential extensions to other models and contexts.

Conclusion: The concepts and techniques are generalizable, offering valuable insights for understanding rare events in LLMs and beyond.

Abstract: Being probabilistic models, during inference large language models (LLMs) display rare events: behaviour that is far from typical but highly significant. By definition all rare events are hard to see, but the enormous scale of LLM usage means that events completely unobserved during development are likely to become prominent in deployment. Here we present an end-to-end framework for the systematic analysis of rare events in LLMs. We provide a practical implementation spanning theory, efficient generation strategies, probability estimation and error analysis, which we illustrate with concrete examples. We outline extensions and applications to other models and contexts, highlighting the generality of the concepts and techniques presented here.

TL;DR: FlowDA is a generative data assimilation framework using flow matching, outperforming traditional methods in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional variational data assimilation (DA) methods are computationally heavy, and existing ML-based DA methods suffer from sampling inefficiency and error accumulation.

Method: FlowDA uses flow matching, conditions on observations via SetConv embeddings, and fine-tunes the Aurora foundation model.

Result: FlowDA excels in performance across low observation rates (3.9% to 0.1%), handles observational noise well, and shows stability in long-horizon cycling DA.

Conclusion: FlowDA offers an efficient, scalable, and robust solution for data-driven DA.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is a fundamental component of modern weather prediction, yet it remains a major computational bottleneck in machine learning (ML)-based forecasting pipelines due to reliance on traditional variational methods. Recent generative ML-based DA methods offer a promising alternative but typically require many sampling steps and suffer from error accumulation under long-horizon auto-regressive rollouts with cycling assimilation. We propose FlowDA, a low-latency weather-scale generative DA framework based on flow matching. FlowDA conditions on observations through a SetConv-based embedding and fine-tunes the Aurora foundation model to deliver accurate, efficient, and robust analyses. Experiments across observation rates decreasing from $3.9\%$ to $0.1\%$ demonstrate superior performance of FlowDA over strong baselines with similar tunable-parameter size. FlowDA further shows robustness to observational noise and stable performance in long-horizon auto-regressive cycling DA. Overall, FlowDA points to an efficient and scalable direction for data-driven DA.

*Xinyu Zhao,Qingyun Sun,Jiayi Luo,Xingcheng Fu,Jianxin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GAD-MoRE introduces a mixture of Riemannian experts for zero-shot graph anomaly detection, addressing cross-domain generalization by leveraging multiple curvature spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot GAD methods ignore geometric differences across anomaly patterns, limiting cross-domain generalization.

Method: Proposes GAD-MoRE with specialized Riemannian expert networks, anomaly-aware feature alignment, and a memory-based dynamic router.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art generalist GAD baselines and surpasses few-shot fine-tuned competitors.

Conclusion: GAD-MoRE effectively captures geometry-dependent anomaly patterns, enhancing zero-shot generalization.

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify irregular patterns in graph data, and recent works have explored zero-shot generalist GAD to enable generalization to unseen graph datasets. However, existing zero-shot GAD methods largely ignore intrinsic geometric differences across diverse anomaly patterns, substantially limiting their cross-domain generalization. In this work, we reveal that anomaly detectability is highly dependent on the underlying geometric properties and that embedding graphs from different domains into a single static curvature space can distort the structural signatures of anomalies. To address the challenge that a single curvature space cannot capture geometry-dependent graph anomaly patterns, we propose GAD-MoRE, a novel framework for zero-shot Generalizable Graph Anomaly Detection with a Mixture of Riemannian Experts architecture. Specifically, to ensure that each anomaly pattern is modeled in the Riemannian space where it is most detectable, GAD-MoRE employs a set of specialized Riemannian expert networks, each operating in a distinct curvature space. To align raw node features with curvature-specific anomaly characteristics, we introduce an anomaly-aware multi-curvature feature alignment module that projects inputs into parallel Riemannian spaces, enabling the capture of diverse geometric characteristics. Finally, to facilitate better generalization beyond seen patterns, we design a memory-based dynamic router that adaptively assigns each input to the most compatible expert based on historical reconstruction performance on similar anomalies. Extensive experiments in the zero-shot setting demonstrate that GAD-MoRE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generalist GAD baselines, and even surpasses strong competitors that are few-shot fine-tuned with labeled data from the target domain.

*Hangting Ye,He Zhao. Wei Fan,Xiaozhuang Song,Dandan Guo,Yi Chang,Hongyuan Zha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CTAD is a model-agnostic framework that enhances tabular anomaly detection by calibrating scores using Optimal Transport distance, improving performance across diverse datasets without extra tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular anomaly detection is challenging due to data heterogeneity, with no single method performing consistently well across all scenarios.

Method: CTAD uses two complementary distributions (empirical and structural) and measures disruption via Optimal Transport distance to calibrate anomaly scores.

Result: CTAD significantly improves performance across 34 datasets and 7 detectors, including state-of-the-art methods, without additional tuning.

Conclusion: CTAD generalizes well across datasets and detectors, providing a robust solution for tabular anomaly detection.

Abstract: Tabular anomaly detection (TAD) remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of tabular data: features lack natural relationships, vary widely in distribution and scale, and exhibit diverse types. Consequently, each TAD method makes implicit assumptions about anomaly patterns that work well on some datasets but fail on others, and no method consistently outperforms across diverse scenarios. We present CTAD (Calibrating Tabular Anomaly Detection), a model-agnostic post-processing framework that enhances any existing TAD detector through sample-specific calibration. Our approach characterizes normal data via two complementary distributions, i.e., an empirical distribution from random sampling and a structural distribution from K-means centroids, and measures how adding a test sample disrupts their compatibility using Optimal Transport (OT) distance. Normal samples maintain low disruption while anomalies cause high disruption, providing a calibration signal to amplify detection. We prove that OT distance has a lower bound proportional to the test sample's distance from centroids, and establish that anomalies systematically receive higher calibration scores than normals in expectation, explaining why the method generalizes across datasets. Extensive experiments on 34 diverse tabular datasets with 7 representative detectors spanning all major TAD categories (density estimation, classification, reconstruction, and isolation-based methods) demonstrate that CTAD consistently improves performance with statistical significance. Remarkably, CTAD enhances even state-of-the-art deep learning methods and shows robust performance across diverse hyperparameter settings, requiring no additional tuning for practical deployment.

TL;DR: The paper explores Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) using simulation-based inference (SBI), introducing multiple EIG formulations and a novel estimator to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BOED seeks to maximize expected information gain (EIG), but existing methods are limited by intractable likelihoods and reliance on a single EIG bound.

Method: Leverages modern SBI tools (neural posterior, likelihood, ratio estimation) to formulate EIG estimators and introduces multi-start parallel gradient ascent for optimization.

Result: The proposed methods match or outperform state-of-the-art BOED approaches by up to 22% in benchmarks.

Conclusion: SBI-based BOED, with innovative EIG formulations and optimization techniques, significantly advances experimental design efficiency.

Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) seeks to maximize the expected information gain (EIG) of experiments. This requires a likelihood estimate, which in many settings is intractable. Simulation-based inference (SBI) provides powerful tools for this regime. However, existing work explicitly connecting SBI and BOED is restricted to a single contrastive EIG bound. We show that the EIG admits multiple formulations which can directly leverage modern SBI density estimators, encompassing neural posterior, likelihood, and ratio estimation. Building on this perspective, we define a novel EIG estimator using neural likelihood estimation. Further, we identify optimization as a key bottleneck of gradient based EIG maximization and show that a simple multi-start parallel gradient ascent procedure can substantially improve reliability and performance. With these innovations, our SBI-based BOED methods are able to match or outperform by up to $22\%$ existing state-of-the-art approaches across standard BOED benchmarks.

*Naoya Takeishi*

TL;DR: The paper proposes using flatness of loss minima in hybrid models (combining machine learning and scientific models) to prevent the machine learning component from overshadowing the scientific part.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid models risk ignoring scientific models due to the flexibility of machine learning, undermining their interpretability and purpose.

Method: The paper adapts sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) to hybrid modeling, focusing on flat loss minima for simpler models.

Result: Numerical experiments confirm the SAM-based method's effectiveness across various models and datasets.

Conclusion: Flatness-aware optimization in hybrid modeling ensures robustness and interpretability by balancing machine learning and scientific models.

Abstract: Hybrid modeling, the combination of machine learning models and scientific mathematical models, enables flexible and robust data-driven prediction with partial interpretability. However, effectively the scientific models may be ignored in prediction due to the flexibility of the machine learning model, making the idea of hybrid modeling pointless. Typically some regularization is applied to hybrid model learning to avoid such a failure case, but the formulation of the regularizer strongly depends on model architectures and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose to focus on the flatness of loss minima in learning hybrid models, aiming to make the model as simple as possible. We employ the idea of sharpness-aware minimization and adapt it to the hybrid modeling setting. Numerical experiments show that the SAM-based method works well across different choices of models and datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes discrete diffusion models' reverse processes using thermodynamic entropy production, introducing two novel sampling schedules (EDS and WDS) that outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in understanding the information-theoretic principles governing discrete diffusion models, focusing on their reverse processes.

Method: Proposes entropy production rate as a metric, derives a Wasserstein distance bound, and introduces two schedules (EDS and WDS) based on constant information gain and equal Wasserstein steps.

Result: Empirical results show the new schedules outperform state-of-the-art strategies across various domains (synthetic data, music, vision, language) at lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The study advances the understanding of discrete diffusion models and offers practical, efficient sampling schedules for generative tasks.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative modeling on sequence data; however, the information-theoretic principles governing their reverse processes remain significantly less understood than those of their continuous counterparts. In this work, we bridge this gap by analyzing the reverse process dynamics through the lens of thermodynamic entropy production. We propose the entropy production rate as a rigorous proxy for quantifying information generation, deriving as a byproduct a bound on the Wasserstein distance between intermediate states and the data distribution. Leveraging these insights, we introduce two novel sampling schedules that are uniformly spaced with respect to their corresponding physics-inspired metrics: the Entropic Discrete Schedule (EDS), which is defined by maintaining a constant rate of information gain, and the Wasserstein Discrete Schedule (WDS), which is defined by taking equal steps in terms of the Wasserstein distance. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed schedules significantly outperform state-of-the-art strategies across diverse application domains, including synthetic data, music notation, vision and language modeling, consistently achieving superior performance at a lower computational budget.

*Soumi Mahato,Lineesh M. C*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new robust, bounded, and smooth loss function (RoBoS-NN) is developed for neural networks to address issues with traditional loss functions in high-dimensional and outlier-sensitive datasets, showing superior performance in time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional loss functions often struggle with high-dimensional and outlier-sensitive datasets, leading to reduced performance and slower convergence. This work aims to address these limitations.

Method: The authors develop the RoBoS-NN loss function and theoretically analyze its robustness. They implement it in a neural network framework for time series forecasting and introduce $ℒ_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN, testing it on real-world datasets with outliers.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate that $ℒ_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN outperforms benchmark models in accuracy, especially in challenging scenarios with outliers.

Conclusion: The RoBoS-NN loss function effectively mitigates the drawbacks of traditional loss functions, enhancing robustness and performance in neural network-based time series forecasting.

Abstract: The loss function is crucial to machine learning, especially in supervised learning frameworks. It is a fundamental component that controls the behavior and general efficacy of learning algorithms. However, despite their widespread use, traditional loss functions have significant drawbacks when dealing with high-dimensional and outlier-sensitive datasets, which frequently results in reduced performance and slower convergence during training. In this work, we develop a robust, bounded, and smooth (RoBoS-NN) loss function to resolve the aforementioned hindrances. The generalization ability of the loss function has also been theoretically analyzed to rigorously justify its robustness. Moreover, we implement RoboS-NN loss in the framework of a neural network (NN) to forecast time series and present a new robust algorithm named $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN. To assess the potential of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN, we conduct experiments on multiple real-world datasets. In addition, we infuse outliers into data sets to evaluate the performance of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN in more challenging scenarios. Numerical results show that $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN outperforms the other benchmark models in terms of accuracy measures.

*Ziming Liu,Sophia Sanborn,Surya Ganguli,Andreas Tolias*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generic Transformers can learn world models of physics with minimal inductive biases: spatial smoothness, stability, and temporal locality, transitioning from curve-fitting to discovering Newtonian forces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if general-purpose AI can discover physical laws beyond prediction, bridging the gap between domain-specific priors and generic models.

Method: Introducing three inductive biases—spatial smoothness (continuous regression), stability (training with noisy contexts), and temporal locality (restricted attention window)—to enable Transformers to learn coherent world models.

Result: Transformers with these biases successfully learned Keplerian world models and Newtonian force representations, surpassing prior limitations.

Conclusion: Simple architectural choices can transform AI from mere curve-fitters into physicists, advancing automated scientific discovery.

Abstract: Can general-purpose AI architectures go beyond prediction to discover the physical laws governing the universe? True intelligence relies on "world models" -- causal abstractions that allow an agent to not only predict future states but understand the underlying governing dynamics. While previous "AI Physicist" approaches have successfully recovered such laws, they typically rely on strong, domain-specific priors that effectively "bake in" the physics. Conversely, Vafa et al. recently showed that generic Transformers fail to acquire these world models, achieving high predictive accuracy without capturing the underlying physical laws. We bridge this gap by systematically introducing three minimal inductive biases. We show that ensuring spatial smoothness (by formulating prediction as continuous regression) and stability (by training with noisy contexts to mitigate error accumulation) enables generic Transformers to surpass prior failures and learn a coherent Keplerian world model, successfully fitting ellipses to planetary trajectories. However, true physical insight requires a third bias: temporal locality. By restricting the attention window to the immediate past -- imposing the simple assumption that future states depend only on the local state rather than a complex history -- we force the model to abandon curve-fitting and discover Newtonian force representations. Our results demonstrate that simple architectural choices determine whether an AI becomes a curve-fitter or a physicist, marking a critical step toward automated scientific discovery.

*Zuyuan Zhang,Sizhe Tang,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel topological view of TD-based RL is introduced, showing TD errors as 1-cochains in state transition space and Markov dynamics as topological integrability. A Hodge-type decomposition of TD errors enables stable policy search (HFPS), improving RL performance in non-Markovian settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods lack theoretical depth for non-Markovian dynamics, which are common in real-world environments. The paper aims to bridge this gap with a topological perspective.

Method: A topological framework interprets TD errors as 1-cochains and Markov dynamics as integrability. A Bellman-de Rham projection decomposes TD errors, enabling HFPS to minimize non-integrable residuals for stable policy search.

Result: HFPS significantly enhances RL performance in non-Markovian settings, as demonstrated numerically.

Conclusion: The topological viewpoint provides theoretical insights and practical improvements for RL under non-Markovian dynamics, with HFPS showing promising results.

Abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics are commonly found in real-world environments due to long-range dependencies, partial observability, and memory effects. The Bellman equation that is the central pillar of Reinforcement learning (RL) becomes only approximately valid under Non-Markovian. Existing work often focus on practical algorithm designs and offer limited theoretical treatment to address key questions, such as what dynamics are indeed capturable by the Bellman framework and how to inspire new algorithm classes with optimal approximations. In this paper, we present a novel topological viewpoint on temporal-difference (TD) based RL. We show that TD errors can be viewed as 1-cochain in the topological space of state transitions, while Markov dynamics are then interpreted as topological integrability. This novel view enables us to obtain a Hodge-type decomposition of TD errors into an integrable component and a topological residual, through a Bellman-de Rham projection. We further propose HodgeFlow Policy Search (HFPS) by fitting a potential network to minimize the non-integrable projection residual in RL, achieving stability/sensitivity guarantees. In numerical evaluations, HFPS is shown to significantly improve RL performance under non-Markovian.

TL;DR: T-STAR is a transformer-based probabilistic framework for high-resolution bike-sharing demand forecasting, outperforming existing methods with robust accuracy and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable short-term demand forecasting is crucial for efficient micro-mobility service management and user-centered operations.

Method: T-STAR uses a two-stage hierarchical structure: coarse-grained hourly demand capture followed by high-frequency localized inputs integration via transformer models.

Result: The model excels in deterministic and probabilistic accuracy, shows robustness across stations and time, and transfers well to unseen areas without retraining.

Conclusion: T-STAR provides granular, reliable, and uncertainty-aware forecasts, enhancing multimodal trip planning and real-time micro-mobility operations.

Abstract: Reliable short-term demand forecasting is essential for managing shared micro-mobility services and ensuring responsive, user-centered operations. This study introduces T-STAR (Two-stage Spatial and Temporal Adaptive contextual Representation), a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework designed to forecast station-level bike-sharing demand at a 15-minute resolution. T-STAR addresses key challenges in high-resolution forecasting by disentangling consistent demand patterns from short-term fluctuations through a hierarchical two-stage structure. The first stage captures coarse-grained hourly demand patterns, while the second stage improves prediction accuracy by incorporating high-frequency, localized inputs, including recent fluctuations and real-time demand variations in connected metro services, to account for temporal shifts in short-term demand. Time series transformer models are employed in both stages to generate probabilistic predictions. Extensive experiments using Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare data demonstrate that T-STAR outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic accuracy. The model exhibits strong spatial and temporal robustness across stations and time periods. A zero-shot forecasting experiment further highlights T-STAR's ability to transfer to previously unseen service areas without retraining. These results underscore the framework's potential to deliver granular, reliable, and uncertainty-aware short-term demand forecasts, which enable seamless integration to support multimodal trip planning for travelers and enhance real-time operations in shared micro-mobility services.

*Zitao Song,Cedar Site Bai,Zhe Zhang,Brian Bullins,David F. Gleich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeVA bridges vector-based and matrix spectral optimization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in language modeling and image classification by reducing token usage by ~6.6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To link adaptive optimization methods like Adam with matrix-based spectral optimizers like Muon, addressing the challenge of feasible generalizations.

Method: Reformulates AdaGrad into variance adaptation and scale-invariant terms, creating DeVA to enable smooth transition between optimization approaches.

Result: DeVA consistently outperforms Muon and SOAP in experiments, with theoretical analysis showing improved blockwise smoothness and faster convergence.

Conclusion: DeVA successfully bridges vector and matrix optimization, offering practical and theoretical advantages.

Abstract: Adaptive methods like Adam have become the $\textit{de facto}$ standard for large-scale vector and Euclidean optimization due to their coordinate-wise adaptation with a second-order nature. More recently, matrix-based spectral optimizers like Muon (Jordan et al., 2024b) show the power of treating weight matrices as matrices rather than long vectors. Linking these is hard because many natural generalizations are not feasible to implement, and we also cannot simply move the Adam adaptation to the matrix spectrum. To address this, we reformulate the AdaGrad update and decompose it into a variance adaptation term and a scale-invariant term. This decoupling produces $\textbf{DeVA}$ ($\textbf{De}$coupled $\textbf{V}$ariance $\textbf{A}$daptation), a framework that bridges between vector-based variance adaptation and matrix spectral optimization, enabling a seamless transition from Adam to adaptive spectral descent. Extensive experiments across language modeling and image classification demonstrate that DeVA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Muon and SOAP (Vyas et al., 2024), reducing token usage by around 6.6\%. Theoretically, we show that the variance adaptation term effectively improves the blockwise smoothness, facilitating faster convergence.

TL;DR: CardioGraphFENet (CGFENet) is a graph-based surrogate model for rapid full-cycle estimation of left ventricular biomechanics, addressing computational intensity and convergence issues of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional finite-element analysis (FEA) is computationally intensive for simulating left ventricular mechanics, and existing graph-based surrogates lack full-cycle prediction. Physics-informed neural networks struggle with complex cardiac geometries.

Method: CGFENet integrates a global-local graph encoder for mesh features, a gated recurrent unit-based temporal encoder for cycle-coherent dynamics, and a cycle-consistent bidirectional formulation for loading and unloading.

Result: The model achieves high fidelity compared to FEA ground truths, producing physiologically plausible pressure-volume loops and reducing FEA supervision needs with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: CGFENet offers an efficient and accurate alternative to traditional FEA for predicting left ventricular biomechanics.

Abstract: Image-based patient-specific simulation of left ventricular (LV) mechanics is valuable for understanding cardiac function and supporting clinical intervention planning, but conventional finite-element analysis (FEA) is computationally intensive. Current graph-based surrogates do not have full-cycle prediction capabilities, and physics-informed neural networks often struggle to converge on complex cardiac geometries. We present CardioGraphFENet (CGFENet), a unified graph-based surrogate for rapid full-cycle estimation of LV myocardial biomechanics, supervised by a large FEA simulation dataset. The proposed model integrates (i) a global--local graph encoder to capture mesh features with weak-form-inspired global coupling, (ii) a gated recurrent unit-based temporal encoder conditioned on the target volume-time signal to model cycle-coherent dynamics, and (iii) a cycle-consistent bidirectional formulation for both loading and inverse unloading within a single framework. These strategies enable high fidelity with respect to traditional FEA ground truths and produce physiologically plausible pressure-volume loops that match FEA results when coupled with a lumped-parameter model. In particular, the cycle-consistency strategy enables a significant reduction in FEA supervision with only minimal loss in accuracy.

*Ameya Rathod,Sujay Belsare,Salvik Krishna Nautiyal,Dhruv Laad,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating time-series dynamics and multi-environment heterogeneity to uniquely recover causal graphs from observational data, addressing identifiability and statistical recovery limits under varying noise conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inherent ambiguity in recovering causal graphs from observational data, necessitating structural or distributional assumptions to make the problem solvable.

Method: The method combines time-series dynamics and multi-environment heterogeneity as complementary sources of heterogeneity, analyzing identifiability and statistical recovery under thin and heavy-tailed noise.

Result: Results show temporal structure can compensate for insufficient environmental diversity, achieving identifiability. Heavy-tailed noise preserves geometric identifiability but increases sample complexity.

Conclusion: The study shifts focus from identifiability to practical statistical recovery, providing theoretical bounds for causal graph recovery in non-stationary systems.

Abstract: Recovering a unique causal graph from observational data is an ill-posed problem because multiple generating mechanisms can lead to the same observational distribution. This problem becomes solvable only by exploiting specific structural or distributional assumptions. While recent work has separately utilized time-series dynamics or multi-environment heterogeneity to constrain this problem, we integrate both as complementary sources of heterogeneity. This integration yields unified necessary identifiability conditions and enables a rigorous analysis of the statistical limits of recovery under thin versus heavy-tailed noise. In particular, temporal structure is shown to effectively substitute for missing environmental diversity, possibly achieving identifiability even under insufficient heterogeneity. Extending this analysis to heavy-tailed (Student's t) distributions, we demonstrate that while geometric identifiability conditions remain invariant, the sample complexity diverges significantly from the Gaussian baseline. Explicit information-theoretic bounds quantify this cost of robustness, establishing the fundamental limits of covariance-based causal graph recovery methods in realistic non-stationary systems. This work shifts the focus from whether causal structure is identifiable to whether it is statistically recoverable in practice.

Conclusion: The results extend to applications like OCO with delayed feedback and time-varying memory, showcasing the algorithm's versatility.

Abstract: In this paper, we study dynamic regret in unconstrained online convex optimization (OCO) with movement costs. Specifically, we generalize the standard setting by allowing the movement cost coefficients $λ_t$ to vary arbitrarily over time. Our main contribution is a novel algorithm that establishes the first comparator-adaptive dynamic regret bound for this setting, guaranteeing $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{(1+P_T)(T+\sum_t λ_t)})$ regret, where $P_T$ is the path length of the comparator sequence over $T$ rounds. This recovers the optimal guarantees for both static and dynamic regret in standard OCO as a special case where $λ_t=0$ for all rounds. To demonstrate the versatility of our results, we consider two applications: OCO with delayed feedback and OCO with time-varying memory. We show that both problems can be translated into time-varying movement costs, establishing a novel reduction specifically for the delayed feedback setting that is of independent interest. A crucial observation is that the first-order dependence on movement costs in our regret bound plays a key role in enabling optimal comparator-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees in both settings.

TL;DR: The study presents a machine-learning-based closed-loop EEG-TMS system to identify mu-rhythm phases linked to corticospinal excitability, enabling personalized brain disorder treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TMS lacks personalization. The study aims to overcome this by using EEG-TMS to target individual mu-rhythm phases for tailored neuroplastic effects.

Method: EEG-TMS was applied to 25 participants, using reinforcement learning to identify excitability-linked mu-rhythm phases. Effects were analyzed via linear mixed models and Bayesian analysis.

Result: Reinforcement learning successfully identified excitability-linked phases, leading to long-term changes in functional connectivity in the sensorimotor network.

Conclusion: The study proves the feasibility of closed-loop EEG-TMS, advancing personalized brain disorder treatments.

Abstract: Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a powerful tool to investigate neurophysiology of the human brain and treat brain disorders. Traditionally, therapeutic TMS has been applied in a one-size-fits-all approach, disregarding inter- and intra-individual differences. Brain state-dependent EEG-TMS, such as coupling TMS with a pre-specified phase of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm, enables the induction of differential neuroplastic effects depending on the targeted phase. But this approach is still user-dependent as it requires defining an a-priori target phase. Objectives: To present a first realization of a machine-learning-based, closed-loop real-time EEG-TMS setup to identify user-independently the individual mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-corticospinal excitability states. Methods: We applied EEG-TMS to 25 participants targeting the supplementary motor area-primary motor cortex network and used a reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low corticospinal excitability. We employed linear mixed effects models and Bayesian analysis to determine effects of reinforced learning on corticospinal excitability indexed by motor evoked potential amplitude, and functional connectivity indexed by the imaginary part of resting-state EEG coherence. Results: Reinforcement learning effectively identified the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-excitability states, and their repetitive stimulation resulted in long-term increases vs. decreases in functional connectivity in the stimulated sensorimotor network. Conclusions: We demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of closed-loop EEG-TMS in humans, a critical step towards individualized treatment of brain disorders.

Abstract: The recent surge in Time Series Foundation Models has rapidly advanced the field, yet the heterogeneous training setups across studies make it difficult to attribute improvements to architectural innovations versus data engineering. In this work, we investigate the potential of a standard patch Transformer, demonstrating that this generic architecture achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance using a straightforward training protocol. We conduct a comprehensive ablation study that covers model scaling, data composition, and training techniques to isolate the essential ingredients for high performance. Our findings identify the key drivers of performance, while confirming that the generic architecture itself demonstrates excellent scalability. By strictly controlling these variables, we provide comprehensive empirical results on model scaling across multiple dimensions. We release our open-source model and detailed findings to establish a transparent, reproducible baseline for future research.

TL;DR: LEIA improves group robustness by targeting latent failure modes in a low-dimensional subspace without needing group labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing group-robust methods require prior knowledge of subgroups, which is often unavailable. LEIA addresses this limitation.

Method: LEIA identifies a low-dimensional error subspace and adjusts classifier logits via a low-rank adaptation.

Result: LEIA consistently enhances worst-group performance across various knowledge settings without modifying the backbone.

Conclusion: LEIA is a practical, parameter-efficient solution for improving robustness in real-world scenarios with unknown subgroups.

Abstract: Deep learning models trained to optimize average accuracy often exhibit systematic failures on particular subpopulations. In real world settings, the subpopulations most affected by such disparities are frequently unlabeled or unknown, thereby motivating the development of methods that are performant on sensitive subgroups without being pre-specified. However, existing group-robust methods typically assume prior knowledge of relevant subgroups, using group annotations for training or model selection. We propose Low-rank Error Informed Adaptation (LEIA), a simple two-stage method that improves group robustness by identifying a low-dimensional subspace in the representation space where model errors concentrate. LEIA restricts adaptation to this error-informed subspace via a low-rank adjustment to the classifier logits, directly targeting latent failure modes without modifying the backbone or requiring group labels. Using five real-world datasets, we analyze group robustness under three settings: (1) truly no knowledge of subgroup relevance, (2) partial knowledge of subgroup relevance, and (3) full knowledge of subgroup relevance. Across all settings, LEIA consistently improves worst-group performance while remaining fast, parameter-efficient, and robust to hyperparameter choice.

TL;DR: A study on off-policy reinforcement learning for continuous-time Markov diffusion processes using model-free algorithms with function approximation, leveraging ellipticity for efficient learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reinforcement learning for continuous-time Markov diffusion processes with discrete-time observations and actions, avoiding unrealistic assumptions on dynamics.

Method: Proposed the Sobolev-prox fitted q-learning algorithm, solving least-squares regression problems iteratively to learn value and advantage functions.

Result: Established oracle inequalities for estimation error, showing ellipticity simplifies reinforcement learning with function approximation to supervised learning levels.

Conclusion: Ellipticity is crucial for efficient reinforcement learning in Markov diffusion processes, reducing complexity to supervised learning benchmarks.

Abstract: We study off-policy reinforcement learning for controlling continuous-time Markov diffusion processes with discrete-time observations and actions. We consider model-free algorithms with function approximation that learn value and advantage functions directly from data, without unrealistic structural assumptions on the dynamics.
  Leveraging the ellipticity of the diffusions, we establish a new class of Hilbert-space positive definiteness and boundedness properties for the Bellman operators. Based on these properties, we propose the Sobolev-prox fitted $q$-learning algorithm, which learns value and advantage functions by iteratively solving least-squares regression problems. We derive oracle inequalities for the estimation error, governed by (i) the best approximation error of the function classes, (ii) their localized complexity, (iii) exponentially decaying optimization error, and (iv) numerical discretization error. These results identify ellipticity as a key structural property that renders reinforcement learning with function approximation for Markov diffusions no harder than supervised learning.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Speculative decoding can significantly accelerate LLM serving, yet most deployments today disentangle speculator training from serving, treating speculator training as a standalone offline modeling problem. We show that this decoupled formulation introduces substantial deployment and adaptation lag: (1) high time-to-serve, since a speculator must be trained offline for a considerable period before deployment; (2) delayed utility feedback, since the true end-to-end decoding speedup is only known after training and cannot be inferred reliably from acceptance rate alone due to model-architecture and system-level overheads; and (3) domain-drift degradation, as the target model is repurposed to new domains and the speculator becomes stale and less effective.
  To address these issues, we present Aurora, a unified training-serving system that closes the loop by continuously learning a speculator directly from live inference traces. Aurora reframes online speculator learning as an asynchronous reinforcement-learning problem: accepted tokens provide positive feedback, while rejected speculator proposals provide implicit negative feedback that we exploit to improve sample efficiency. Our design integrates an SGLang-based inference server with an asynchronous training server, enabling hot-swapped speculator updates without service interruption. Crucially, Aurora supports day-0 deployment: a speculator can be served immediately and rapidly adapted to live traffic, improving system performance while providing immediate utility feedback. Across experiments, Aurora achieves a 1.5x day-0 speedup on recently released frontier models (e.g., MiniMax M2.1 229B and Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B). Aurora also adapts effectively to distribution shifts in user traffic, delivering an additional 1.25x speedup over a well-trained but static speculator on widely used models (e.g., Qwen3 and Llama3).

TL;DR: EOFlows is a normalizing-flow framework that orders latent dimensions by explained entropy, enabling adaptive injective flows for compact core representations and flexible inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning semantically meaningful and stable unsupervised representations.

Method: Introduces EOFlows, leveraging entropy ordering, Independent Mechanism Analysis, Principal Component Flows, and Manifold Entropic Metrics, combined with likelihood-based training, Jacobian regularization, and noise augmentation.

Result: Achieves semantically interpretable features on CelebA, enabling high compression and strong denoising.

Conclusion: EOFlows provide a scalable and flexible solution for unsupervised representation learning.

Abstract: Learning unsupervised representations that are both semantically meaningful and stable across runs remains a central challenge in modern representation learning. We introduce entropy-ordered flows (EOFlows), a normalizing-flow framework that orders latent dimensions by their explained entropy, analogously to PCA's explained variance. This ordering enables adaptive injective flows: after training, one may retain only the top C latent variables to form a compact core representation while the remaining variables capture fine-grained detail and noise, with C chosen flexibly at inference time rather than fixed during training. EOFlows build on insights from Independent Mechanism Analysis, Principal Component Flows and Manifold Entropic Metrics. We combine likelihood-based training with local Jacobian regularization and noise augmentation into a method that scales well to high-dimensional data such as images. Experiments on the CelebA dataset show that our method uncovers a rich set of semantically interpretable features, allowing for high compression and strong denoising.

Result: The optimized EBM achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.983, outperforming baseline EBM and other models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

Conclusion: Interpretable machine learning combined with data-driven optimization enhances trustworthy fraud analytics in financial systems.

Abstract: Addressing class imbalance is a central challenge in credit card fraud detection, as it directly impacts predictive reliability in real-world financial systems. To overcome this, the study proposes an enhanced workflow based on the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)-a transparent, state-of-the-art implementation of the GA2M algorithm-optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and preprocessing refinement. Rather than relying on conventional sampling techniques that may introduce bias or cause information loss, the optimized EBM achieves an effective balance between accuracy and interpretability, enabling precise detection of fraudulent transactions while providing actionable insights into feature importance and interaction effects. Furthermore, the Taguchi method is employed to optimize both the sequence of data scalers and model hyperparameters, ensuring robust, reproducible, and systematically validated performance improvements. Experimental evaluation on benchmark credit card data yields an ROC-AUC of 0.983, surpassing prior EBM baselines (0.975) and outperforming Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree models. These results highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning and data-driven optimization for advancing trustworthy fraud analytics in financial systems.
