<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving broad generality and strong task performance in GUI agents for automating digital interactions.

Method: Introduces three technical advances: Mid-Training with 10B tokens, Online Reinforcement Learning, and Model Merging to unify domain-specific models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks (ScreenSpot-Pro: 69.6%, VenusBench-GD: 75.0%, AndroidWorld: 77.6%) and robust real-world navigation.

Conclusion: UI-Venus-1.5 significantly outperforms baselines and demonstrates practical effectiveness in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: GUI agents have emerged as a powerful paradigm for automating interactions in digital environments, yet achieving both broad generality and consistently strong task performance remains challenging.In this report, we present UI-Venus-1.5, a unified, end-to-end GUI Agent designed for robust real-world applications.The proposed model family comprises two dense variants (2B and 8B) and one mixture-of-experts variant (30B-A3B) to meet various downstream application scenarios.Compared to our previous version, UI-Venus-1.5 introduces three key technical advances: (1) a comprehensive Mid-Training stage leveraging 10 billion tokens across 30+ datasets to establish foundational GUI semantics; (2) Online Reinforcement Learning with full-trajectory rollouts, aligning training objectives with long-horizon, dynamic navigation in large-scale environments; and (3) a single unified GUI Agent constructed via Model Merging, which synthesizes domain-specific models (grounding, web, and mobile) into one cohesive checkpoint. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UI-Venus-1.5 establishes new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot-Pro (69.6%), VenusBench-GD (75.0%), and AndroidWorld (77.6%), significantly outperforming previous strong baselines. In addition, UI-Venus-1.5 demonstrates robust navigation capabilities across a variety of Chinese mobile apps, effectively executing user instructions in real-world scenarios.

*Ange Lou,Yamin Li,Qi Chang,Nan Xi,Luyuan Xie,Zichao Li,Tianyu Luan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IR-SIS is an adaptive surgical image segmentation system using natural language inputs and clinician feedback to refine results iteratively, achieving cutting-edge performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations in existing methods like predefined categories, lack of adaptive refinement, and minimal clinician interaction.

Method: Combines SAM3 for initial segmentation, Vision-Language Model for instrument detection/quality assessment, and agentic workflow for refinement strategies. Supports clinician feedback via natural language.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain and out-of-distribution data, with further improvements from clinician interaction.

Conclusion: Introduces the first language-based surgical segmentation framework with adaptive refinement and clinician-in-the-loop capabilities.

Abstract: Surgical image segmentation is essential for robot-assisted surgery and intraoperative guidance. However, existing methods are constrained to predefined categories, produce one-shot predictions without adaptive refinement, and lack mechanisms for clinician interaction. We propose IR-SIS, an iterative refinement system for surgical image segmentation that accepts natural language descriptions. IR-SIS leverages a fine-tuned SAM3 for initial segmentation, employs a Vision-Language Model to detect instruments and assess segmentation quality, and applies an agentic workflow that adaptively selects refinement strategies. The system supports clinician-in-the-loop interaction through natural language feedback. We also construct a multi-granularity language-annotated dataset from EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-distribution data, with clinician interaction providing additional improvements. Our work establishes the first language-based surgical segmentation framework with adaptive self-refinement capabilities.

### [3] [Agent Banana: High-Fidelity Image Editing with Agentic Thinking and Tooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09084)
*Ruijie Ye,Jiayi Zhang,Zhuoxin Liu,Zihao Zhu,Siyuan Yang,Li Li,Tianfu Fu,Franck Dernoncourt,Yue Zhao,Jiacheng Zhu,Ryan Rossi,Wenhao Chai,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Agent Banana is a hierarchical agentic planner-executor framework addressing challenges in instruction-based image editing, such as over-editing, multi-turn edits, and evaluation misalignment with real workflows. It introduces Context Folding and Image Layer Decomposition for high-fidelity editing and performs well on a new 4K benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies persistent issues in professional image editing workflows, including over-editing, lack of multi-turn capability, and misaligned evaluations, and aims to solve these with a reliable, high-fidelity framework.

Method: Agent Banana uses a hierarchical agentic planner-executor framework with Context Folding for stable long-horizon control and Image Layer Decomposition for localized, high-resolution edits. A new benchmark, HDD-Bench, is introduced for evaluation.

Result: Agent Banana achieves top performance in multi-turn consistency and background fidelity (e.g., IC 0.871, SSIM-OM 0.84, LPIPS-OM 0.12) on HDD-Bench and performs well on single-turn benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study advances reliable, professional-grade agentic image editing, demonstrating strong performance and alignment with real-world workflow needs.

Abstract: We study instruction-based image editing under professional workflows and identify three persistent challenges: (i) editors often over-edit, modifying content beyond the user's intent; (ii) existing models are largely single-turn, while multi-turn edits can alter object faithfulness; and (iii) evaluation at around 1K resolution is misaligned with real workflows that often operate on ultra high-definition images (e.g., 4K). We propose Agent Banana, a hierarchical agentic planner-executor framework for high-fidelity, object-aware, deliberative editing. Agent Banana introduces two key mechanisms: (1) Context Folding, which compresses long interaction histories into structured memory for stable long-horizon control; and (2) Image Layer Decomposition, which performs localized layer-based edits to preserve non-target regions while enabling native-resolution outputs. To support rigorous evaluation, we build HDD-Bench, a high-definition, dialogue-based benchmark featuring verifiable stepwise targets and native 4K images (11.8M pixels) for diagnosing long-horizon failures. On HDD-Bench, Agent Banana achieves the best multi-turn consistency and background fidelity (e.g., IC 0.871, SSIM-OM 0.84, LPIPS-OM 0.12) while remaining competitive on instruction following, and also attains strong performance on standard single-turn editing benchmarks. We hope this work advances reliable, professional-grade agentic image editing and its integration into real workflows.

### [4] [SemanticMoments: Training-Free Motion Similarity via Third Moment Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09146)
*Saar Huberman,Kfir Goldberg,Or Patashnik,Sagie Benaim,Ron Mokady*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reveals bias in existing video retrieval models favoring static appearance over motion dynamics and proposes SemanticMoments, a training-free method using temporal statistics for better motion understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video retrieval often neglects motion dynamics due to biases in training data, while traditional motion inputs lack semantic grounding.

Method: Introduces SimMotion benchmarks and SemanticMoments, a method computing temporal statistics over features from pre-trained semantic models.

Result: SemanticMoments outperforms existing RGB, flow, and text-supervised methods on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Semantic temporal statistics offer a scalable and perceptually grounded solution for motion-centric video retrieval.

Abstract: Retrieving videos based on semantic motion is a fundamental, yet unsolved, problem. Existing video representation approaches overly rely on static appearance and scene context rather than motion dynamics, a bias inherited from their training data and objectives. Conversely, traditional motion-centric inputs like optical flow lack the semantic grounding needed to understand high-level motion. To demonstrate this inherent bias, we introduce the SimMotion benchmarks, combining controlled synthetic data with a new human-annotated real-world dataset. We show that existing models perform poorly on these benchmarks, often failing to disentangle motion from appearance. To address this gap, we propose SemanticMoments, a simple, training-free method that computes temporal statistics (specifically, higher-order moments) over features from pre-trained semantic models. Across our benchmarks, SemanticMoments consistently outperforms existing RGB, flow, and text-supervised methods. This demonstrates that temporal statistics in a semantic feature space provide a scalable and perceptually grounded foundation for motion-centric video understanding.

### [5] [A Hybrid Deterministic Framework for Named Entity Extraction in Broadcast News Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09154)
*Andrea Filiberto Lucas,Dylan Seychell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for automatically detecting and extracting personal names from news videos is presented, achieving robust performance and traceability compared to generative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing volume of video news content requires transparent and reliable methods for extracting on-screen information, especially due to the impracticality of manual indexing.

Method: The work introduces a curated annotated corpus and an interpretable, modular extraction pipeline designed for deterministic and auditable conditions.

Result: The pipeline achieves 95.8% mAP@0.5 for localization, balanced precision (79.9%) and recall (74.4%), and avoids hallucination, while generative methods lack transparency despite slightly higher accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline provides a rigorous, interpretable baseline for hybrid multimodal information extraction in modern news media, addressing practical challenges like readability.

Abstract: The growing volume of video-based news content has heightened the need for transparent and reliable methods to extract on-screen information. Yet the variability of graphical layouts, typographic conventions, and platform-specific design patterns renders manual indexing impractical. This work presents a comprehensive framework for automatically detecting and extracting personal names from broadcast and social-media-native news videos. It introduces a curated and balanced corpus of annotated frames capturing the diversity of contemporary news graphics and proposes an interpretable, modular extraction pipeline designed to operate under deterministic and auditable conditions.
  The pipeline is evaluated against a contrasting class of generative multimodal methods, revealing a clear trade-off between deterministic auditability and stochastic inference. The underlying detector achieves 95.8% mAP@0.5, demonstrating operationally robust performance for graphical element localisation. While generative systems achieve marginally higher raw accuracy (F1: 84.18% vs 77.08%), they lack the transparent data lineage required for journalistic and analytical contexts. The proposed pipeline delivers balanced precision (79.9%) and recall (74.4%), avoids hallucination, and provides full traceability across each processing stage. Complementary user findings indicate that 59% of respondents report difficulty reading on-screen names in fast-paced broadcasts, underscoring the practical relevance of the task. The results establish a methodologically rigorous and interpretable baseline for hybrid multimodal information extraction in modern news media.

### [6] [Decoding Future Risk: Deep Learning Analysis of Tubular Adenoma Whole-Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09155)
*Ahmed Rahu,Brian Shula,Brandon Combs,Aqsa Sultana,Surendra P. Singh,Vijayan K. Asari,Derrick Forchetti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Machine learning, specifically CNNs, is explored to identify subtle histological features in low-grade tubular adenomas that predict CRC risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite screening efforts, some low-grade adenoma patients still develop CRC, highlighting the need for better risk stratification.

Method: CNNs are used to analyze WSIs of low-grade tubular adenomas for predictive histological features.

Result: Study aims to determine if CNNs can detect features predicting long-term CRC risk.

Conclusion: This approach could improve tailored surveillance and prevention strategies for low-risk patients.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant cause of cancer-related mortality, despite the widespread implementation of prophylactic initiatives aimed at detecting and removing precancerous polyps. Although screening effectively reduces incidence, a notable portion of patients initially diagnosed with low-grade adenomatous polyps will still develop CRC later in life, even without the presence of known high-risk syndromes. Identifying which low-risk patients are at higher risk of progression is a critical unmet need for tailored surveillance and preventative therapeutic strategies. Traditional histological assessment of adenomas, while fundamental, may not fully capture subtle architectural or cytological features indicative of malignant potential. Advancements in digital pathology and machine learning provide an opportunity to analyze whole-slide images (WSIs) comprehensively and objectively. This study investigates whether machine learning algorithms, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can detect subtle histological features in WSIs of low-grade tubular adenomas that are predictive of a patient's long-term risk of developing colorectal cancer.

### [7] [All-in-One Conditioning for Text-to-Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09165)
*Hirunima Jayasekara,Chuong Huynh,Yixuan Ren,Christabel Acquaye,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot, scene graph-based approach called ASQL Conditioner to improve text-to-image synthesis by enhancing semantic fidelity and structural coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with maintaining semantic fidelity and structural coherence for complex prompts involving multiple objects and relationships.

Method: Introduces an Attribute-Size-Quantity-Location (ASQL) Conditioner for generating soft visual guidance during inference, leveraging scene graph structures.

Result: The method enables lightweight, coherent, and diverse image synthesis while maintaining alignment with textual inputs.

Conclusion: The ASQL Conditioner enhances compositional abilities in text-to-image models without rigid constraints, improving flexibility and diversity.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation and visual representation of complex prompts involving multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relationships is a critical challenge in text-to-image synthesis. Despite recent advancements in generating photorealistic outputs, current models often struggle with maintaining semantic fidelity and structural coherence when processing intricate textual inputs. We propose a novel approach that grounds text-to-image synthesis within the framework of scene graph structures, aiming to enhance the compositional abilities of existing models. Eventhough, prior approaches have attempted to address this by using pre-defined layout maps derived from prompts, such rigid constraints often limit compositional flexibility and diversity. In contrast, we introduce a zero-shot, scene graph-based conditioning mechanism that generates soft visual guidance during inference. At the core of our method is the Attribute-Size-Quantity-Location (ASQL) Conditioner, which produces visual conditions via a lightweight language model and guides diffusion-based generation through inference-time optimization. This enables the model to maintain text-image alignment while supporting lightweight, coherent, and diverse image synthesis.

### [8] [Wearable environmental sensing to forecast how legged systems will interact with upcoming terrain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09209)
*Michael D. Murray,James Tung,Richard W. Nuckols*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores using a lightweight CNN-RNN model to forecast foot center-of-pressure (COP) and time-of-impact (TOI) from RGB-D camera data prior to foot-strike, showing feasibility for assistive systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ability to predict foot contact dynamics in changing environments is underexplored but critical for improving anticipatory control in assistive systems.

Method: Eight subjects wore an RGB-D camera and instrumented insoles while stepping onto stairs. A CNN-RNN was trained to forecast COP and TOI within a 250ms window before foot-strike.

Result: COP MAE ranged from 23.72mm to 29.42mm, and TOI MAE ranged from 17.73ms to 21.14ms, depending on the forecast horizon. Faster toe-swing improved COP prediction, while anterior foot-strikes reduced COP accuracy.

Conclusion: Forecasting COP and TOI from visual data is feasible with a lightweight model running at 60 FPS, offering potential for anticipatory control in assistive systems.

Abstract: Computer-vision (CV) has been used for environmental classification during gait and is often used to inform control in assistive systems; however, the ability to predict how the foot will contact a changing environment is underexplored. We evaluated the feasibility of forecasting the anterior-posterior (AP) foot center-of-pressure (COP) and time-of-impact (TOI) prior to foot-strike on a level-ground to stair-ascent transition. Eight subjects wore an RGB-D camera on their right shank and instrumented insoles while performing the task of stepping onto the stairs. We trained a CNN-RNN to forecast the COP and TOI continuously within a 250ms window prior to foot-strike, termed the forecast horizon (FH). The COP mean-absolute-error (MAE) at 150, 100, and 50ms FH was 29.42mm, 26.82, and 23.72mm respectively. The TOI MAE was 21.14, 20.08, and 17.73ms for 150, 100, and 50ms respectively. While torso velocity had no effect on the error in either task, faster toe-swing speeds prior to foot-strike were found to improve the prediction accuracy in the COP case, however, was insignificant in the TOI case. Further, more anterior foot-strikes were found to reduce COP prediction accuracy but did not affect the TOI prediction accuracy. We also found that our lightweight model was capable at running at 60 FPS on either a consumer grade laptop or an edge computing device. This study demonstrates that forecasting COP and TOI from visual data was feasible using a lightweight model, which may have important implications for anticipatory control in assistive systems.

### [9] [VLM-UQBench: A Benchmark for Modality-Specific and Cross-Modality Uncertainties in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09214)
*Chenyu Wang,Tianle Chen,H. M. Sabbir Ahmad,Kayhan Batmanghelich,Wenchao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLM-UQBench, a benchmark for evaluating uncertainty quantification (UQ) in vision-language models (VLMs), highlighting challenges like modality-specific uncertainty and weak risk signals despite existing UQ methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure VLMs behave safely and reliably by localizing uncertainty to its source (image, text, or misalignment) and addressing gaps in current UQ practices.

Method: Develops VLM-UQBench with 600 real-world samples from VizWiz, perturbations, and proposes metrics to evaluate UQ methods across VLMs and datasets.

Result: Existing UQ methods show modality-specific specialization, weak risk signals for hallucinations, and fail to detect subtle ambiguity.

Conclusion: Highlights a gap between current UQ practices and the fine-grained, modality-aware uncertainty needed for reliable VLM deployment.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is vital for ensuring that vision-language models (VLMs) behave safely and reliably. A central challenge is to localize uncertainty to its source, determining whether it arises from the image, the text, or misalignment between the two. We introduce VLM-UQBench, a benchmark for modality-specific and cross-modal data uncertainty in VLMs, It consists of 600 real-world samples drawn from the VizWiz dataset, curated into clean, image-, text-, and cross-modal uncertainty subsets, and a scalable perturbation pipeline with 8 visual, 5 textual, and 3 cross-modal perturbations. We further propose two simple metrics that quantify the sensitivity of UQ scores to these perturbations and their correlation with hallucinations, and use them to evaluate a range of UQ methods across four VLMs and three datasets. Empirically, we find that: (i) existing UQ methods exhibit strong modality-specific specialization and substantial dependence on the underlying VLM, (ii) modality-specific uncertainty frequently co-occurs with hallucinations while current UQ scores provide only weak and inconsistent risk signals, and (iii) although UQ methods can rival reasoning-based chain-of-thought baselines on overt, group-level ambiguity, they largely fail to detect the subtle, instance-level ambiguity introduced by our perturbation pipeline. These results highlight a significant gap between current UQ practices and the fine-grained, modality-aware uncertainty required for reliable VLM deployment.

*Nikita Starodubcev,Daniil Pakhomov,Zongze Wu,Ilya Drobyshevskiy,Yuchen Liu,Zhonghao Wang,Yuqian Zhou,Zhe Lin,Dmitry Baranchuk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Modulation-based text conditioning in diffusion transformers isn't necessary for performance, but pooled embeddings can guide controllable shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if modulation-based text conditioning is necessary and whether it offers performance advantages.

Method: Analysis of pooled embedding usage, proposing a training-free guidance approach for controllable shifts.

Result: Pooled embedding contributes little conventionally but enables significant gains as guidance.

Conclusion: Attention alone suffices for prompt propagation, but pooled embeddings enhance controllability.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers typically incorporate textual information via attention layers and a modulation mechanism using a pooled text embedding. Nevertheless, recent approaches discard modulation-based text conditioning and rely exclusively on attention. In this paper, we address whether modulation-based text conditioning is necessary and whether it can provide any performance advantage. Our analysis shows that, in its conventional usage, the pooled embedding contributes little to overall performance, suggesting that attention alone is generally sufficient for faithfully propagating prompt information. However, we reveal that the pooled embedding can provide significant gains when used from a different perspective-serving as guidance and enabling controllable shifts toward more desirable properties. This approach is training-free, simple to implement, incurs negligible runtime overhead, and can be applied to various diffusion models, bringing improvements across diverse tasks, including text-to-image/video generation and image editing.

*Pranav Kulkarni,Junfeng Guo,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-Mark is a sample-specific watermarking method for chest X-rays using a conditional U-Net, ensuring robustness and diagnostic quality preservation while detecting unauthorized use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unauthorized use of medical imaging datasets raises ethical and copyright concerns, requiring robust ownership verification methods tailored to dynamic, high-resolution scans.

Method: X-Mark employs a conditional U-Net to generate unique perturbations in salient regions, with a multi-component training objective ensuring efficacy and robustness. Laplacian regularization achieves scale-invariance.

Result: Tests on CheXpert show 100% WSR, 12% reduction in false positives, and resistance to adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: X-Mark effectively protects medical imaging datasets while maintaining diagnostic quality and resisting adversarial attempts.

Abstract: High-quality medical imaging datasets are essential for training deep learning models, but their unauthorized use raises serious copyright and ethical concerns. Medical imaging presents a unique challenge for existing dataset ownership verification methods designed for natural images, as static watermark patterns generated in fixed-scale images scale poorly dynamic and high-resolution scans with limited visual diversity and subtle anatomical structures, while preserving diagnostic quality. In this paper, we propose X-Mark, a sample-specific clean-label watermarking method for chest x-ray copyright protection. Specifically, X-Mark uses a conditional U-Net to generate unique perturbations within salient regions of each sample. We design a multi-component training objective to ensure watermark efficacy, robustness against dynamic scaling processes while preserving diagnostic quality and visual-distinguishability. We incorporate Laplacian regularization into our training objective to penalize high-frequency perturbations and achieve watermark scale-invariance. Ownership verification is performed in a black-box setting to detect characteristic behaviors in suspicious models. Extensive experiments on CheXpert verify the effectiveness of X-Mark, achieving WSR of 100% and reducing probability of false positives in Ind-M scenario by 12%, while demonstrating resistance to potential adaptive attacks.

### [12] [A Deep Multi-Modal Method for Patient Wound Healing Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09315)
*Subba Reddy Oota,Vijay Rowtula,Shahid Mohammed,Jeffrey Galitz,Minghsun Liu,Manish Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep multi-modal method to predict patient hospitalization risk using wound variables and images, aiming for early detection and reduced clinician diagnosis time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High wound care costs due to hospitalizations, often caused by delayed treatment or patient non-compliance, drive the need for early risk prediction.

Method: A transfer learning-based wound assessment solution predicts wound variables and healing trajectories from images.

Result: The model aids in early detection of wound complexities and reduces clinician diagnosis time.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves wound care by predicting hospitalization risk, enhancing early intervention and efficiency.

Abstract: Hospitalization of patients is one of the major factors for high wound care costs. Most patients do not acquire a wound which needs immediate hospitalization. However, due to factors such as delay in treatment, patient's non-compliance or existing co-morbid conditions, an injury can deteriorate and ultimately lead to patient hospitalization. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-modal method to predict the patient's risk of hospitalization. Our goal is to predict the risk confidently by collectively using the wound variables and wound images of the patient. Existing works in this domain have mainly focused on healing trajectories based on distinct wound types. We developed a transfer learning-based wound assessment solution, which can predict both wound variables from wound images and their healing trajectories, which is our primary contribution. We argue that the development of a novel model can help in early detection of the complexities in the wound, which might affect the healing process and also reduce the time spent by a clinician to diagnose the wound.

### [13] [Deep Modeling and Interpretation for Bladder Cancer Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09324)
*Ahmad Chaddad,Yihang Wu,Xianrui Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates deep models (CNNs and ViTs) for bladder cancer classification, focusing on their accuracy, calibration, and interpretability. ConvNext shows limited generalization, while ViTs outperform in calibration and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep models like ViTs and CNNs excel in natural datasets but may underperform in medical imaging, where abnormalities are small. This study investigates their suitability for bladder cancer classification.

Method: The study evaluates 13 models (4 CNNs, 8 ViTs) via classification, calibration analysis, and GradCAM++ for interpretability. Experiments are conducted on a multicenter bladder cancer dataset.

Result: ConvNext series generalize poorly (~60% accuracy), while ViTs show better calibration. Test time augmentation improves interpretability, but no model fits all cases.

Conclusion: ConvNext works best for in-distribution samples, while ViTs excel in interpreting out-of-distribution samples. No universal solution exists for interpretable models.

Abstract: Deep models based on vision transformer (ViT) and convolutional neural network (CNN) have demonstrated remarkable performance on natural datasets. However, these models may not be similar in medical imaging, where abnormal regions cover only a small portion of the image. This challenge motivates this study to investigate the latest deep models for bladder cancer classification tasks. We propose the following to evaluate these deep models: 1) standard classification using 13 models (four CNNs and eight transormer-based models), 2) calibration analysis to examine if these models are well calibrated for bladder cancer classification, and 3) we use GradCAM++ to evaluate the interpretability of these models for clinical diagnosis. We simulate $\sim 300$ experiments on a publicly multicenter bladder cancer dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that the ConvNext series indicate limited generalization ability to classify bladder cancer images (e.g., $\sim 60\%$ accuracy). In addition, ViTs show better calibration effects compared to ConvNext and swin transformer series. We also involve test time augmentation to improve the models interpretability. Finally, no model provides a one-size-fits-all solution for a feasible interpretable model. ConvNext series are suitable for in-distribution samples, while ViT and its variants are suitable for interpreting out-of-distribution samples.

*Michail S. Alexiou,Nikolaos G. Bourbakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kyrtos methodology for automatic recognition and analysis of chart curves in technical documents, using clustering and graph-based approaches, with high accuracy demonstrated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Understanding of Technical Documents (DUTD) is valuable due to accumulated knowledge, requiring holistic analysis of modalities like charts.

Method: Uses clustering for curve recognition, parses line-segments for behavioral features, converts to attributed graphs and NL text, then SPN graphs.

Result: Kyrtos shows high accuracy in structural similarity between input curves and its approximations.

Conclusion: Kyrtos effectively analyzes chart curves, aiding technical document understanding and conversion into functional representations.

Abstract: Deep Understanding of Technical Documents (DUTD) has become a very attractive field with great potential due to large amounts of accumulated documents and the valuable knowledge contained in them. In addition, the holistic understanding of technical documents depends on the accurate analysis of its particular modalities, such as graphics, tables, diagrams, text, etc. and their associations. In this paper, we introduce the Kyrtos methodology for the automatic recognition and analysis of charts with curves in graphics images of technical documents. The recognition processing part adopts a clustering based approach to recognize middle-points that delimit the line-segments that construct the illustrated curves. The analysis processing part parses the extracted line-segments of curves to capture behavioral features such as direction, trend and etc. These associations assist the conversion of recognized segments' relations into attributed graphs, for the preservation of the curves' structural characteristics. The graph relations are also are expressed into natural language (NL) text sentences, enriching the document's text and facilitating their conversion into Stochastic Petri-net (SPN) graphs, which depict the internal functionality represented in the chart image. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate the accuracy of Kyrtos' recognition and analysis methods by measuring the structural similarity between input chart curves and the approximations generated by Kyrtos for charts with multiple functions.

### [15] [Fully Differentiable Bidirectional Dual-Task Synergistic Learning for Semi-Supervised 3D Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09378)
*Jun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a DBiSL framework to enhance semi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation by enabling bidirectional cross-task collaboration, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High annotation costs and need for clinical expertise limit labeled data in medical image analysis, motivating semi-supervised learning solutions like pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization.

Method: The DBiSL framework integrates supervised learning, consistency regularization, pseudo-supervised learning, and uncertainty estimation, enabling bidirectional task collaboration.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show state-of-the-art performance, validating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: DBiSL advances SSL by unifying key components and enabling bidirectional collaboration, offering a foundation for dual-task SSL and broader multitask learning applications.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning relaxes the need of large pixel-wise labeled datasets for image segmentation by leveraging unlabeled data. The scarcity of high-quality labeled data remains a major challenge in medical image analysis due to the high annotation costs and the need for specialized clinical expertise. Semi-supervised learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing this bottleneck, with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization emerging as two predominant paradigms. Dual-task collaborative learning, an emerging consistency-aware paradigm, seeks to derive supplementary supervision by establishing prediction consistency between related tasks. However, current methodologies are limited to unidirectional interaction mechanisms (typically regression-to-segmentation), as segmentation results can only be transformed into regression outputs in an offline manner, thereby failing to fully exploit the potential benefits of online bidirectional cross-task collaboration. Thus, we propose a fully Differentiable Bidirectional Synergistic Learning (DBiSL) framework, which seamlessly integrates and enhances four critical SSL components: supervised learning, consistency regularization, pseudo-supervised learning, and uncertainty estimation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate our method's state-of-the-art performance. Beyond technical contributions, this work provides new insights into unified SSL framework design and establishes a new architectural foundation for dual-task-driven SSL, while offering a generic multitask learning framework applicable to broader computer vision applications. The code will be released on github upon acceptance.

### [16] [Single-Slice-to-3D Reconstruction in Medical Imaging and Natural Objects: A Comparative Benchmark with SAM 3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09407)
*Yan Luo,Advaith Ravishankar,Serena Liu,Yutong Yang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates five state-of-the-art image-to-3D models for medical data reconstruction, finding depth ambiguity limits single-slice accuracy but highlighting SAM3D's superior topological similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if geometric priors from natural image-trained models transfer to medical data for 3D reconstruction from single 2D slices.

Method: Benchmarked five models (SAM3D, Hunyuan3D-2.1, Direct3D, Hi3DGen, TripoSG) across six medical and two natural datasets using voxel and point cloud metrics.

Result: Voxel overlap was moderate for all models, indicating depth reconstruction issues, but SAM3D outperformed others in topological similarity.

Conclusion: Single-slice reconstruction faces depth ambiguity; multi-view approaches are needed for reliable medical 3D inference.

Abstract: A 3D understanding of anatomy is central to diagnosis and treatment planning, yet volumetric imaging remains costly with long wait times. Image-to-3D foundations models can solve this issue by reconstructing 3D data from 2D modalites. Current foundation models are trained on natural image distributions to reconstruct naturalistic objects from a single image by leveraging geometric priors across pixels. However, it is unclear whether these learned geometric priors transfer to medical data. In this study, we present a controlled zero-shot benchmark of single slice medical image-to-3D reconstruction across five state-of-the-art image-to-3D models: SAM3D, Hunyuan3D-2.1, Direct3D, Hi3DGen, and TripoSG. These are evaluated across six medical datasets spanning anatomical and pathological structures and two natrual datasets, using voxel based metrics and point cloud distance metrics. Across medical datasets, voxel based overlap remains moderate for all models, consistent with a depth reconstruction failure mode when inferring volume from a single slice. In contrast, global distance metrics show more separation between methods: SAM3D achieves the strongest overall topological similarity to ground truth medical 3D data, while alternative models are more prone to over-simplication of reconstruction. Our results quantify the limits of single-slice medical reconstruction and highlight depth ambiguity caused by the planar nature of 2D medical data, motivating multi-view image-to-3D reconstruction to enable reliable medical 3D inference.

*Zhikai Li,Jiatong Li,Xuewen Liu,Wangbo Zhao,Pan Du,Kaicheng Zhou,Qingyi Gu,Yang You,Zhen Dong,Kurt Keutzer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: K-Sort Eval is a VLM-based evaluation framework that integrates posterior correction and dynamic matching to provide scalable, reliable, and efficient human-aligned evaluations for generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human preference evaluation methods are costly and time-consuming, while using VLMs introduces hallucinations and biases, limiting reliability and scalability.

Method: The framework leverages a high-quality dataset from human votes, performs (K+1)-wise comparisons, and uses posterior correction and dynamic matching to enhance alignment and efficiency.

Result: K-Sort Eval achieves results consistent with human evaluations (K-Sort Arena) with fewer than 90 model runs, proving its efficiency and reliability.

Conclusion: K-Sort Eval successfully addresses scalability and alignment issues in evaluating generative models, offering a practical and reliable alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: The rapid development of visual generative models raises the need for more scalable and human-aligned evaluation methods. While the crowdsourced Arena platforms offer human preference assessments by collecting human votes, they are costly and time-consuming, inherently limiting their scalability. Leveraging vision-language model (VLMs) as substitutes for manual judgments presents a promising solution. However, the inherent hallucinations and biases of VLMs hinder alignment with human preferences, thus compromising evaluation reliability. Additionally, the static evaluation approach lead to low efficiency. In this paper, we propose K-Sort Eval, a reliable and efficient VLM-based evaluation framework that integrates posterior correction and dynamic matching. Specifically, we curate a high-quality dataset from thousands of human votes in K-Sort Arena, with each instance containing the outputs and rankings of K models. When evaluating a new model, it undergoes (K+1)-wise free-for-all comparisons with existing models, and the VLM provide the rankings. To enhance alignment and reliability, we propose a posterior correction method, which adaptively corrects the posterior probability in Bayesian updating based on the consistency between the VLM prediction and human supervision. Moreover, we propose a dynamic matching strategy, which balances uncertainty and diversity to maximize the expected benefit of each comparison, thus ensuring more efficient evaluation. Extensive experiments show that K-Sort Eval delivers evaluation results consistent with K-Sort Arena, typically requiring fewer than 90 model runs, demonstrating both its efficiency and reliability.

### [18] [LARV: Data-Free Layer-wise Adaptive Rescaling Veneer for Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09413)
*Xinyu Wang,Ke Deng,Fei Dou,Jinbo Bi,Jin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LARV introduces a layer-wise adaptive rescaling method for task-vector merging, improving performance by addressing layer heterogeneity in vision transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing merging methods treat all layers uniformly, ignoring layer-wise heterogeneity in vision transformers, which limits performance.

Method: LARV assigns per-layer scales to task vectors before aggregation, using a deterministic schedule to suppress shallow-layer interference and amplify deeper-layer alignment.

Result: LARV consistently improves merging performance across various settings, with notable gains in accuracy on Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: LARV transforms model merging into a robust, layer-aware process, enhancing performance without requiring retraining or modifying existing mergers.

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single multi-task model without access to training data. Existing task-vector merging methods such as TIES, TSV-M, and Iso-C/CTS differ in their aggregation rules but treat all layers nearly uniformly. This assumption overlooks the strong layer-wise heterogeneity in large vision transformers, where shallow layers are sensitive to interference while deeper layers encode stable task-specific features. We introduce LARV, a training-free, data-free, merger-agnostic Layer-wise Adaptive Rescaling Veneer that plugs into any task-vector merger and assigns a per-layer scale to each task vector before aggregation, and show it consistently boosts diverse merging rules. LARV adaptively suppresses shallow-layer interference and amplifies deeper-layer alignment using a simple deterministic schedule, requiring no retraining or modification to existing mergers. To our knowledge, this is the first work to perform layer-aware scaling for task-vector merging. LARV computes simple data-free layer proxies and turns them into scales through a lightweight rule; we study several instantiations within one framework (e.g., tiered two/three-level scaling with fixed values, or continuous mappings) and show that tiered choices offer the best robustness, while continuous mappings remain an ablation. LARV is orthogonal to the base merger and adds negligible cost. On FusionBench with Vision Transformers, LARV consistently improves all task-vector baselines across 8/14/20-task settings; for example, Iso-C + LARV reaches 85.9% on ViT-B/32, 89.2% on ViT-B/16, and 92.6% on ViT-L/14. Layerwise analysis and corruption tests further indicate that LARV suppresses shallow-layer interference while modestly amplifying deeper, task-stable features, turning model merging into a robust, layer-aware procedure rather than a uniform one.

*Joe-Mei Feng,Hsin-Hsiung Kao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for stability and concentration in nonlinear inverse problems with block-structured parameters is developed, yielding error bounds intrinsic to the forward operator, exemplified by Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified analysis of stability and statistical concentration in high-dimensional nonlinear inverse problems, particularly relevant in modern imaging and differentiable rendering.

Method: Operator-theoretic approach combining blockwise Lipschitz geometry, local identifiability, and sub-Gaussian noise assumptions to derive deterministic stability inequalities and nonasymptotic concentration estimates.

Result: Established intrinsic error bounds independent of reconstruction algorithms, with a demonstrated tradeoff between stability and resolution in Gaussian Splatting.

Conclusion: The framework characterizes fundamental operator-level limits for nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting resolution-dependent constraints.

Abstract: We develop an operator-theoretic framework for stability and statistical concentration in nonlinear inverse problems with block-structured parameters. Under a unified set of assumptions combining blockwise Lipschitz geometry, local identifiability, and sub-Gaussian noise, we establish deterministic stability inequalities, global Lipschitz bounds for least-squares misfit functionals, and nonasymptotic concentration estimates. These results yield high-probability parameter error bounds that are intrinsic to the forward operator and independent of any specific reconstruction algorithm. As a concrete instantiation, we verify that the Gaussian Splatting rendering operator satisfies the proposed assumptions and derive explicit constants governing its Lipschitz continuity and resolution-dependent observability. This leads to a fundamental stability--resolution tradeoff, showing that estimation error is inherently constrained by the ratio between image resolution and model complexity. Overall, the analysis characterizes operator-level limits for a broad class of high-dimensional nonlinear inverse problems arising in modern imaging and differentiable rendering.

### [20] [Bridging the Modality Gap in Roadside LiDAR: A Training-Free Vision-Language Model Framework for Vehicle Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09425)
*Yiqiao Li,Bo Shang,Jie Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework bridges the gap between sparse 3D LiDAR point clouds and dense 2D imagery for fine-grained truck classification using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without parameter fine-tuning, achieving competitive accuracy with minimal examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR-based methods for fine-grained truck classification rely on supervised deep learning, which is labor-intensive and lacks scalability. VLMs offer few-shot generalization but face a modality gap with roadside LiDAR.

Method: The proposed framework adapts VLMs without fine-tuning by transforming sparse LiDAR scans into depth-encoded 2D visual proxies through noise removal, registration, rectification, morphological operations, and smoothing.

Result: The approach achieves competitive classification accuracy with 16-30 examples per class and a 75% correct classification rate for specific drayage categories, outperforming data-intensive supervised baselines.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable and practical solution for ITS applications, reducing manual labeling demands and demonstrating efficacy as a Cold Start strategy for lightweight supervised models.

Abstract: Fine-grained truck classification is critical for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), yet current LiDAR-based methods face scalability challenges due to their reliance on supervised deep learning and labor-intensive manual annotation. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising few-shot generalization, but their application to roadside LiDAR is limited by a modality gap between sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D imagery. We propose a framework that bridges this gap by adapting off-the-shelf VLMs for fine-grained truck classification without parameter fine-tuning. Our new depth-aware image generation pipeline applies noise removal, spatial and temporal registration, orientation rectification, morphological operations, and anisotropic smoothing to transform sparse, occluded LiDAR scans into depth-encoded 2D visual proxies. Validated on a real-world dataset of 20 vehicle classes, our approach achieves competitive classification accuracy with as few as 16-30 examples per class, offering a scalable alternative to data-intensive supervised baselines. We further observe a "Semantic Anchor" effect: text-based guidance regularizes performance in ultra-low-shot regimes $k < 4$, but degrades accuracy in more-shot settings due to semantic mismatch. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this framework as a Cold Start strategy, using VLM-generated labels to bootstrap lightweight supervised models. Notably, the few-shot VLM-based model achieves over correct classification rate of 75 percent for specific drayage categories (20ft, 40ft, and 53ft containers) entirely without the costly training or fine-tuning, significantly reducing the intensive demands of initial manual labeling, thus achieving a method of practical use in ITS applications.

*Yang Zhao,Shizhao Sun,Meisheng Zhang,Yingdong Shi,Xubo Yang,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneReVis introduces a self-reflection framework to mitigate spatial hallucinations in 3D scene synthesis by using iterative multi-modal feedback, supported by a new dataset and a two-stage training method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current one-pass 3D scene synthesis methods lack deliberative reasoning, leading to spatial hallucinations like collisions.

Method: SceneReVis employs an iterative "diagnose-and-act" loop with multi-modal feedback to resolve conflicts. It uses SceneChain-12k dataset and a two-stage training approach combining Supervised Fine-Tuning and Agentic Reinforcement Learning.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity generation and goal-oriented optimization, with strong generalization to long-tail domains.

Conclusion: SceneReVis effectively addresses spatial conflicts in 3D scene synthesis, advancing the field with its reflective framework and robust training pipeline.

Abstract: Current one-pass 3D scene synthesis methods often suffer from spatial hallucinations, such as collisions, due to a lack of deliberative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce SceneReVis, a vision-grounded self-reflection framework that employs an iterative ``diagnose-and-act'' loop to explicitly intercept and resolve spatial conflicts using multi-modal feedback. To support this step-wise paradigm, we construct SceneChain-12k, a large-scale dataset of causal construction trajectories derived through a novel reverse engineering pipeline. We further propose a two-stage training recipe that transitions from Supervised Fine-Tuning to Agentic Reinforcement Learning, evolving the model into an active spatial planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneReVis achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity generation and goal-oriented optimization, with robust generalization to long-tail domains.

*Xu Ma,Yitian Zhang,Qihua Dong,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-T2I is a large-scale, high-quality open dataset for text-to-image fine-tuning, addressing limitations in existing datasets by combining synthetic and curated real images. It improves model performance across various metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between open research models and enterprise-grade models by providing a high-quality, diverse, and openly licensed dataset for text-to-image fine-tuning.

Method: Fine-T2I combines synthetic images from modern models with curated real images, rigorously filtering for quality across text-image alignment, visual fidelity, and prompt quality. It spans multiple tasks, prompt categories, styles, and templates.

Result: The dataset contains over 6 million text-image pairs (~2 TB), improving generation quality and instruction adherence across diverse pretrained models, validated by human evaluation, visual comparison, and automatic metrics.

Conclusion: Fine-T2I successfully addresses the data bottleneck in text-to-image fine-tuning, offering a scalable, high-quality, and open solution for the research community.

Abstract: High-quality and open datasets remain a major bottleneck for text-to-image (T2I) fine-tuning. Despite rapid progress in model architectures and training pipelines, most publicly available fine-tuning datasets suffer from low resolution, poor text-image alignment, or limited diversity, resulting in a clear performance gap between open research models and enterprise-grade models. In this work, we present Fine-T2I, a large-scale, high-quality, and fully open dataset for T2I fine-tuning. Fine-T2I spans 10 task combinations, 32 prompt categories, 11 visual styles, and 5 prompt templates, and combines synthetic images generated by strong modern models with carefully curated real images from professional photographers. All samples are rigorously filtered for text-image alignment, visual fidelity, and prompt quality, with over 95% of initial candidates removed. The final dataset contains over 6 million text-image pairs, around 2 TB on disk, approaching the scale of pretraining datasets while maintaining fine-tuning-level quality. Across a diverse set of pretrained diffusion and autoregressive models, fine-tuning on Fine-T2I consistently improves both generation quality and instruction adherence, as validated by human evaluation, visual comparison, and automatic metrics. We release Fine-T2I under an open license to help close the data gap in T2I fine-tuning in the open community.

### [23] [Look-Ahead and Look-Back Flows: Training-Free Image Generation with Trajectory Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09449)
*Yan Luo,Henry Huang,Todd Y. Zhou,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two training-free latent-trajectory adjustment methods, Look-Ahead and Look-Back, to improve image generation by reducing error accumulation in diffusion models, outperforming state-of-the-art models on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address error propagation caused by modifying velocity fields in diffusion models, the paper aims to refine the generative path directly in latent space using past and future trajectory information.

Method: Proposes two training-free latent-trajectory adjustment approaches: Look-Ahead (averaging current and next-step latents with curvature-gated weight) and Look-Back (exponential moving average smoothing).

Result: The methods outperform state-of-the-art models on datasets like COCO17, CUB-200, and Flickr30K.

Conclusion: Training-free trajectory smoothing effectively reduces error accumulation and enhances image generation in diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent advances have reformulated diffusion models as deterministic ordinary differential equations (ODEs) through the framework of flow matching, providing a unified formulation for the noise-to-data generative process. Various training-free flow matching approaches have been developed to improve image generation through flow velocity field adjustment, eliminating the need for costly retraining. However, Modifying the velocity field $v$ introduces errors that propagate through the full generation path, whereas adjustments to the latent trajectory $z$ are naturally corrected by the pretrained velocity network, reducing error accumulation. In this paper, we propose two complementary training-free latent-trajectory adjustment approaches based on future and past velocity $v$ and latent trajectory $z$ information that refine the generative path directly in latent space. We propose two training-free trajectory smoothing schemes: \emph{Look-Ahead}, which averages the current and next-step latents using a curvature-gated weight, and \emph{Look-Back}, which smoothes latents using an exponential moving average with decay. We demonstrate through extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluation metrics that the proposed training-free trajectory smoothing models substantially outperform various state-of-the-art models across multiple datasets including COCO17, CUB-200, and Flickr30K.

*James Burgess,Rameen Abdal,Dan Stoddart,Sergey Tulyakov,Serena Yeung-Levy,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtifactLens detects synthetic image artifacts using pretrained VLMs with minimal labeled data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern image generators produce realistic images with subtle artifacts. Detecting these is crucial for benchmarking and improving generators, but current methods require extensive labeled data.

Method: ArtifactLens leverages pretrained VLMs with multi-component scaffolding, including in-context learning and text instruction optimization, requiring only a few hundred examples per artifact category.

Result: ArtifactLens achieves state-of-the-art performance on five human artifact benchmarks and generalizes to other artifact types and AIGC detection.

Conclusion: Pretrained VLMs can effectively detect synthetic artifacts with minimal labeled data, offering a scalable solution for evolving generators and new artifact types.

Abstract: Modern image generators produce strikingly realistic images, where only artifacts like distorted hands or warped objects reveal their synthetic origin. Detecting these artifacts is essential: without detection, we cannot benchmark generators or train reward models to improve them. Current detectors fine-tune VLMs on tens of thousands of labeled images, but this is expensive to repeat whenever generators evolve or new artifact types emerge. We show that pretrained VLMs already encode the knowledge needed to detect artifacts - with the right scaffolding, this capability can be unlocked using only a few hundred labeled examples per artifact category. Our system, ArtifactLens, achieves state-of-the-art on five human artifact benchmarks (the first evaluation across multiple datasets) while requiring orders of magnitude less labeled data. The scaffolding consists of a multi-component architecture with in-context learning and text instruction optimization, with novel improvements to each. Our methods generalize to other artifact types - object morphology, animal anatomy, and entity interactions - and to the distinct task of AIGC detection.

*Chuanhai Zang,Jiabao Hu,XW Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FD-DB addresses synthetic-to-real domain shift via frequency-decoupled dual-branch processing, balancing photorealism and structural stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift between synthetic and real data degrades performance in vision tasks; existing methods struggle to balance photorealism and structural stability.

Method: FD-DB uses dual branches: interpretable editing for low-frequency changes and residual generation for high-frequency details, fused under explicit frequency constraints.

Result: Improves appearance consistency and boosts semantic segmentation performance on YCB-V while preserving geometric structures.

Conclusion: FD-DB effectively bridges synthetic-to-real gaps by decoupling appearance transfer into interpretable and residual components.

Abstract: Synthetic data provide low-cost, accurately annotated samples for geometry-sensitive vision tasks, but appearance and imaging differences between synthetic and real domains cause severe domain shift and degrade downstream performance. Unpaired synthetic-to-real translation can reduce this gap without paired supervision, yet existing methods often face a trade-off between photorealism and structural stability: unconstrained generation may introduce deformation or spurious textures, while overly rigid constraints limit adaptation to real-domain statistics. We propose FD-DB, a frequency-decoupled dual-branch model that separates appearance transfer into low-frequency interpretable editing and high-frequency residual compensation. The interpretable branch predicts physically meaningful editing parameters (white balance, exposure, contrast, saturation, blur, and grain) to build a stable low-frequency appearance base with strong content preservation. The free branch complements fine details through residual generation, and a gated fusion mechanism combines the two branches under explicit frequency constraints to limit low-frequency drift. We further adopt a two-stage training schedule that first stabilizes the editing branch and then releases the residual branch to improve optimization stability. Experiments on the YCB-V dataset show that FD-DB improves real-domain appearance consistency and significantly boosts downstream semantic segmentation performance while preserving geometric and semantic structures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes WeakSupCon, a weakly supervised contrastive learning framework for digital histopathology WSIs to improve MIL performance without instance-level labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital histopathology image analysis struggles with limited training labels due to the high cost of manual annotation. Weakly supervised MIL is practical but neglects feature representation learning during pretraining.

Method: Introduces WeakSupCon, leveraging bag-level labels for contrastive learning to separate patches with different labels in feature space, avoiding instance-level pseudo-labeling.

Result: WeakSupCon outperforms self-supervised contrastive learning methods in downstream MIL tasks across three datasets.

Conclusion: WeakSupCon effectively enhances feature representation learning with bag-level labels, improving MIL performance in histopathology image analysis.

Abstract: Digital histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) provide gigapixel-scale high-resolution images that are highly useful for disease diagnosis. However, digital histopathology image analysis faces significant challenges due to the limited training labels, since manually annotating specific regions or small patches cropped from large WSIs requires substantial time and effort. Weakly supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a practical and efficient solution by requiring only bag-level (slide-level) labels, while each bag typically contains multiple instances (patches). Most MIL methods directly use frozen image patch features generated by various image encoders as inputs and primarily focus on feature aggregation. However, feature representation learning for encoder pretraining in MIL settings has largely been neglected.
  In our work, we propose a novel feature representation learning framework called weakly supervised contrastive learning (WeakSupCon) that incorporates bag-level label information during training. Our method does not rely on instance-level pseudo-labeling, yet it effectively separates patches with different labels in the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that the image features generated by our WeakSupCon method lead to improved downstream MIL performance compared to self-supervised contrastive learning approaches in three datasets.

TL;DR: Align-TI is a knowledge distillation framework focusing on dynamic token interactions in MLLMs, outperforming vanilla KD and larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KD methods neglect dynamic token interactions crucial for multimodal understanding and generation.

Method: Align-TI uses IVA for aligning visual information extraction and TPA for sequential token transitions.

Result: Align-TI achieves 2.6% improvement over Vanilla KD and outperforms LLaVA-1.5-7B by 7.0%.

Conclusion: Align-TI sets a new SOTA for training parameter-efficient MLLMs by capturing dynamic token interactions.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal capabilities, yet their substantial size poses significant deployment challenges. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution for compressing these models, but existing methods primarily rely on static next-token alignment, neglecting the dynamic token interactions, which embed essential capabilities for multimodal understanding and generation. To this end, we introduce Align-TI, a novel KD framework designed from the perspective of Token Interactions. Our approach is motivated by the insight that MLLMs rely on two primary interactions: vision-instruction token interactions to extract relevant visual information, and intra-response token interactions for coherent generation. Accordingly, Align-TI introduces two components: IVA enables the student model to imitate the teacher's instruction-relevant visual information extract capability by aligning on salient visual regions. TPA captures the teacher's dynamic generative logic by aligning the sequential token-to-token transition probabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate Align-TI's superiority. Notably, our approach achieves $2.6\%$ relative improvement over Vanilla KD, and our distilled Align-TI-2B even outperforms LLaVA-1.5-7B (a much larger MLLM) by $7.0\%$, establishing a new state-of-the-art distillation framework for training parameter-efficient MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lchen1019/Align-TI.

TL;DR: The FedSurg Challenge benchmarked federated learning methods for surgical video classification, focusing on generalization and adaptation tasks. ViViT-based approaches performed best, but challenges like class imbalance and hyperparameter tuning persist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess federated learning's generalization and adaptation capabilities in surgical video classification without sharing patient data.

Method: Participants used the Appendix300 dataset to classify inflammation stages, employing foundation models, metric learning, and FL aggregation schemes. Tasks included generalization and adaptation evaluation.

Result: Limited generalization performance but improved adaptation after fine-tuning. ViViT-based solutions outperformed others, though issues like class imbalance and hyperparameter tuning remained.

Conclusion: The challenge sets a benchmark for FL in surgical AI, emphasizing trade-offs between personalization and robustness, and highlighting the need for better architecture and preprocessing strategies.

Abstract: Purpose: The FedSurg challenge was designed to benchmark the state of the art in federated learning for surgical video classification. Its goal was to assess how well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt through local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development without sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to classify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the multi-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks: generalization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after fine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear probing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes (FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and Expected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and statistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across centers was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after fine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission achieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted limitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties in hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal modeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies. Conclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for evaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight the trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and underscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss design. This benchmarking offers a reference point for future development of imbalance-aware, adaptive, and robust FL methods in clinical surgical AI.

### [29] [OSI: One-step Inversion Excels in Extracting Diffusion Watermarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09494)
*Yuwei Chen,Zhenliang He,Jia Tang,Meina Kan,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OSI introduces a faster, more accurate one-step method for extracting Gaussian Shading watermarks by reformulating the problem as learnable sign classification, eliminating the need for precise noise regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current watermark extraction methods require computationally expensive multi-step diffusion inversion. OSI aims to simplify this process for efficiency and accuracy.

Method: OSI reformulates watermark extraction as a sign classification problem, initializes from a diffusion backbone, and finetunes on synthesized noise-image pairs for one-step extraction.

Result: OSI is 20x faster, achieves higher accuracy, and doubles payload capacity compared to multi-step inversion, showing consistent improvements across various setups.

Conclusion: OSI provides a practical, efficient solution for watermark extraction in diffusion models, demonstrating significant performance gains over existing methods.

Abstract: Watermarking is an important mechanism for provenance and copyright protection of diffusion-generated images. Training-free methods, exemplified by Gaussian Shading, embed watermarks into the initial noise of diffusion models with negligible impact on the quality of generated images. However, extracting this type of watermark typically requires multi-step diffusion inversion to obtain precise initial noise, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose One-step Inversion (OSI), a significantly faster and more accurate method for extracting Gaussian Shading style watermarks. OSI reformulates watermark extraction as a learnable sign classification problem, which eliminates the need for precise regression of the initial noise. Then, we initialize the OSI model from the diffusion backbone and finetune it on synthesized noise-image pairs with a sign classification objective. In this manner, the OSI model is able to accomplish the watermark extraction efficiently in only one step. Our OSI substantially outperforms the multi-step diffusion inversion method: it is 20x faster, achieves higher extraction accuracy, and doubles the watermark payload capacity.

### [30] [Equilibrium contrastive learning for imbalanced image classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09506)
*Sumin Roh,Harim Kim,Ho Yun Lee,Il Yong Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ECL is a supervised contrastive learning framework addressing limitations in existing methods by promoting geometric equilibrium between class features, means, and classifiers, achieving better performance on imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods struggle with imbalanced datasets, particularly due to misalignment between class means/prototypes and classifiers and unbalanced prototype contributions.

Method: ECL promotes geometric equilibrium in representations and aligns classifier weights with class prototypes, balancing contributions uniformly.

Result: ECL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-10-LT, ImageNet-LT, ISIC 2019, and LCCT datasets.

Conclusion: ECL effectively addresses geometric imbalances in supervised contrastive learning, improving performance on imbalanced datasets.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) is a predominant technique in image classification, but they showed limited performance with an imbalanced dataset. Recently, several supervised CL methods have been proposed to promote an ideal regular simplex geometric configuration in the representation space-characterized by intra-class feature collapse and uniform inter-class mean spacing, especially for imbalanced datasets. In particular, existing prototype-based methods include class prototypes, as additional samples to consider all classes. However, the existing CL methods suffer from two limitations. First, they do not consider the alignment between the class means/prototypes and classifiers, which could lead to poor generalization. Second, existing prototype-based methods treat prototypes as only one additional sample per class, making their influence depend on the number of class instances in a batch and causing unbalanced contributions across classes. To address these limitations, we propose Equilibrium Contrastive Learning (ECL), a supervised CL framework designed to promote geometric equilibrium, where class features, means, and classifiers are harmoniously balanced under data imbalance. The proposed ECL framework uses two main components. First, ECL promotes the representation geometric equilibrium (i.e., a regular simplex geometry characterized by collapsed class samples and uniformly distributed class means), while balancing the contributions of class-average features and class prototypes. Second, ECL establishes a classifier-class center geometric equilibrium by aligning classifier weights and class prototypes. We ran experiments with three long-tailed datasets, the CIFAR-10(0)-LT, ImageNet-LT, and the two imbalanced medical datasets, the ISIC 2019 and our constructed LCCT dataset. Results show that ECL outperforms existing SOTA supervised CL methods designed for imbalanced classification.

### [31] [Robust Depth Super-Resolution via Adaptive Diffusion Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09510)
*Kun Wang,Yun Zhu,Pan Zhou,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaDS is a framework for depth super-resolution that adaptively recovers high-resolution depth maps from degraded inputs using Gaussian smoothing and diffusion models, showing superior generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth super-resolution methods often fail under severe or unknown degradation, leading to artifacts. AdaDS aims to overcome this by leveraging Gaussian smoothing and diffusion models for robust recovery.

Method: AdaDS uses Gaussian smoothing to reduce distributional discrepancies between degraded inputs and high-quality counterparts. It adaptively selects a timestep in the reverse diffusion trajectory and injects tailored noise to align samples with the target posterior distribution.

Result: Experiments show AdaDS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and resilience to diverse degradation patterns.

Conclusion: AdaDS provides a robust and generalizable solution for depth super-resolution, leveraging diffusion models and adaptive noise injection to handle severe degradation effectively.

Abstract: We propose AdaDS, a generalizable framework for depth super-resolution that robustly recovers high-resolution depth maps from arbitrarily degraded low-resolution inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that directly regress depth values and often exhibit artifacts under severe or unknown degradation, AdaDS capitalizes on the contraction property of Gaussian smoothing: as noise accumulates in the forward process, distributional discrepancies between degraded inputs and their pristine high-quality counterparts diminish, ultimately converging to isotropic Gaussian prior. Leveraging this, AdaDS adaptively selects a starting timestep in the reverse diffusion trajectory based on estimated refinement uncertainty, and subsequently injects tailored noise to position the intermediate sample within the high-probability region of the target posterior distribution. This strategy ensures inherent robustness, enabling generative prior of a pre-trained diffusion model to dominate recovery even when upstream estimations are imperfect. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate AdaDS's superior zero-shot generalization and resilience to diverse degradation patterns compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Mas Nurul Achmadiah,Afaroj Ahamad,Chi-Chia Sun,Wen-Kai Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-driven IoT application using the frame difference method for fast-object detection, highlighting its efficiency and energy-saving benefits over end-to-end methods on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the need for energy-efficient and accurate fast-object detection in IoT systems, which traditional end-to-end methods struggle with due to inefficiency and high latency.

Method: The frame difference method is implemented on three edge devices (AMD AlveoT M U50, Jetson Orin Nano, Hailo-8T M AI Accelerator) using four models (including MobileNet and YOLOX) to detect objects like birds, cars, trains, and airplanes.

Result: MobileNet showed high accuracy and energy efficiency, while YOLOX performed poorly. The proposed method improved accuracy by 28.314%, efficiency by 3.6 times, and reduced latency by 39.305% compared to end-to-end methods. Faster objects (trains, airplanes) had lower accuracy.

Conclusion: The lightweight frame difference method is ideal for IoT systems requiring fast and accurate object detection, outperforming end-to-end methods in efficiency and latency reduction.

Abstract: This paper presents an Internet of Things (IoT) application that utilizes an AI classifier for fast-object detection using the frame difference method. This method, with its shorter duration, is the most efficient and suitable for fast-object detection in IoT systems, which require energy-efficient applications compared to end-to-end methods. We have implemented this technique on three edge devices: AMD AlveoT M U50, Jetson Orin Nano, and Hailo-8T M AI Accelerator, and four models with artificial neural networks and transformer models. We examined various classes, including birds, cars, trains, and airplanes. Using the frame difference method, the MobileNet model consistently has high accuracy, low latency, and is highly energy-efficient. YOLOX consistently shows the lowest accuracy, lowest latency, and lowest efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has improved the average accuracy gain by 28.314%, the average efficiency gain by 3.6 times, and the average latency reduction by 39.305% compared to the end-to-end method. Of all these classes, the faster objects are trains and airplanes. Experiments show that the accuracy percentage for trains and airplanes is lower than other categories. So, in tasks that require fast detection and accurate results, end-to-end methods can be a disaster because they cannot handle fast object detection. To improve computational efficiency, we designed our proposed method as a lightweight detection algorithm. It is well suited for applications in IoT systems, especially those that require fast-moving object detection and higher accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses the evolution of behavior analysis in computer vision, transitioning from hand-crafted features to deep learning, and introduces a Universal Action Space (UAS) for analyzing human and mammalian behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavior analysis in computer vision has historically relied on limited hand-crafted features. The shift to deep learning with ImageNet inspired leveraging large-scale datasets for robust action recognition and behavior analysis.

Method: The authors build a Universal Action Space (UAS) using labeled human-action datasets, then apply it to analyze mammalian and chimpanzee behavior.

Result: The UAS framework enables effective categorization and analysis of behavior datasets beyond human actions.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the success of deep learning in behavior analysis and demonstrates the applicability of UAS for diverse species.

Abstract: Analyzing animal and human behavior has long been a challenging task in computer vision. Early approaches from the 1970s to the 1990s relied on hand-crafted edge detection, segmentation, and low-level features such as color, shape, and texture to locate objects and infer their identities-an inherently ill-posed problem. Behavior analysis in this era typically proceeded by tracking identified objects over time and modeling their trajectories using sparse feature points, which further limited robustness and generalization. A major shift occurred with the introduction of ImageNet by Deng and Li in 2010, which enabled large-scale visual recognition through deep neural networks and effectively served as a comprehensive visual dictionary. This development allowed object recognition to move beyond complex low-level processing toward learned high-level representations. In this work, we follow this paradigm to build a large-scale Universal Action Space (UAS) using existing labeled human-action datasets. We then use this UAS as the foundation for analyzing and categorizing mammalian and chimpanzee behavior datasets. The source code is released on GitHub at https://github.com/franktpmvu/Universal-Action-Space.

*Jingyi Wang,Fei Li,Rujie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free attentional intervention algorithm to reduce hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by enhancing attention to task-relevant tokens using visual-textual similarities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs suffer from insufficient visual attention, causing hallucinations. Adjusting visual attention broadly includes irrelevant tokens, which is inefficient.

Method: Proposes a training-free algorithm to reweight attention based on visual-textual similarity submatrices and injects visual attention values into beam search decoding.

Result: Significantly reduces hallucinations in LVLMs while maintaining accuracy and coherence.

Conclusion: The method effectively improves visual attention specificity without additional training, enhancing model performance.

Abstract: Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit insufficient visual attention, leading to hallucinations. To alleviate this problem, some previous studies adjust and amplify visual attention. These methods present a limitation that boosting attention for all visual tokens inevitably increases attention to task irrelevant tokens. To tackle this challenge, we propose a training free attentional intervention algorithm to enhance the attention of task-relevant tokens based on the argument that task-relevant tokens generally demonstrate high visual-textual similarities. Specifically, the vision-text cross-attention submatrices, which represent visual-textual correlations, are extracted to construct the reweighting matrices to reallocate attention. Besides, to enhance the contribution of visual tokens, we inject visual attention values into the beam search decoding to identify solutions with higher visual attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method significantly reduces hallucinations across mainstream LVLMs, while preserving the accuracy and coherence of generated content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal models lack application in cervical cytology due to scarce high-quality datasets.

Method: Developed a three-stage pipeline to synthesize a large dataset using MLLMs and expert knowledge, then fine-tuned Qwen3-VL-4B.

Result: Singpath-VL excels in morphological perception and diagnostic classification.

Conclusion: The model and synthetic dataset will be open-sourced to advance cytopathology research.

Abstract: We present Singpath-VL, a vision-language large model, to fill the vacancy of AI assistant in cervical cytology. Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly propelled the field of computational pathology. However, their application in cytopathology, particularly cervical cytology, remains underexplored, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. To bridge this gap, we first develop a novel three-stage pipeline to synthesize a million-scale image-description dataset. The pipeline leverages multiple general-purpose MLLMs as weak annotators, refines their outputs through consensus fusion and expert knowledge injection, and produces high-fidelity descriptions of cell morphology. Using this dataset, we then fine-tune the Qwen3-VL-4B model via a multi-stage strategy to create a specialized cytopathology MLLM. The resulting model, named Singpath-VL, demonstrates superior performance in fine-grained morphological perception and cell-level diagnostic classification. To advance the field, we will open-source a portion of the synthetic dataset and benchmark.

*Han Zhou,Yuxuan Gao,Yinchao Du,Xuezhe Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HLGFA is an unsupervised industrial anomaly detection framework that uses high-low resolution guided feature alignment to detect anomalies by modeling cross-resolution feature consistency, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial anomaly detection often lacks defect samples, requiring reliable methods that don't rely on pixel-level reconstruction.

Method: HLGFA extracts multi-level features from dual-resolution inputs using a shared frozen backbone, decomposes high-resolution features into structure and detail priors, and refines low-resolution features via conditional modulation and gated residual correction.

Result: HLGFA achieves 97.9% pixel-level AUROC and 97.5% image-level AUROC on the MVTec AD dataset, surpassing other methods.

Conclusion: HLGFA effectively detects anomalies by focusing on cross-resolution feature alignment and suppresses noise-induced responses, making it highly suitable for industrial inspection.

Abstract: Unsupervised industrial anomaly detection (UAD) is essential for modern manufacturing inspection, where defect samples are scarce and reliable detection is required. In this paper, we propose HLGFA, a high-low resolution guided feature alignment framework that learns normality by modeling cross-resolution feature consistency between high-resolution and low-resolution representations of normal samples, instead of relying on pixel-level reconstruction. Dual-resolution inputs are processed by a shared frozen backbone to extract multi-level features, and high-resolution representations are decomposed into structure and detail priors to guide the refinement of low-resolution features through conditional modulation and gated residual correction. During inference, anomalies are naturally identified as regions where cross-resolution alignment breaks down. In addition, a noise-aware data augmentation strategy is introduced to suppress nuisance-induced responses commonly observed in industrial environments. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HLGFA, achieving 97.9% pixel-level AUROC and 97.5% image-level AUROC on the MVTec AD dataset, outperforming representative reconstruction-based and feature-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with hallucinations in high-stakes fields like healthcare, where generated text may contradict visual input. The goal is to improve token sequence accuracy.

Method: The proposed SchröMind framework reduces hallucinations by mapping hallucinatory to truthful activations with minimal transport cost via lightweight training, preserving original model capabilities.

Result: Experiments on POPE and MME benchmarks show SchröMind achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: SchröMind effectively mitigates hallucinations in MLLMs, enhancing reliability for critical applications like healthcare while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success across various domains. However, their use in high-stakes fields like healthcare remains limited due to persistent hallucinations, where generated text contradicts or ignores visual input. We contend that MLLMs can comprehend images but struggle to produce accurate token sequences. Minor perturbations can shift attention from truthful to untruthful states, and the autoregressive nature of text generation often prevents error correction. To address this, we propose SchröMind-a novel framework reducing hallucinations via solving the Schrödinger bridge problem. It establishes a token-level mapping between hallucinatory and truthful activations with minimal transport cost through lightweight training, while preserving the model's original capabilities. Extensive experiments on the POPE and MME benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Schrödinger, which achieves state-of-the-art performance while introducing only minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Automated change detection in remote sensing imagery is critical for urban management, environmental monitoring, and disaster assessment. While deep learning models have advanced this field, they often struggle with challenges like low sensitivity to small objects and high computational costs. This paper presents SCA-Net, an enhanced architecture built upon the Change-Agent framework for precise building and road change detection in bi-temporal images. Our model incorporates several key innovations: a novel Difference Pyramid Block for multi-scale change analysis, an Adaptive Multi-scale Processing module combining shape-aware and high-resolution enhancement blocks, and multi-level attention mechanisms (PPM and CSAGate) for joint contextual and detail processing. Furthermore, a dynamic composite loss function and a four-phase training strategy are introduced to stabilize training and accelerate convergence. Comprehensive evaluations on the LEVIR-CD and LEVIR-MCI datasets demonstrate SCA-Net's superior performance over Change-Agent and other state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves a significant 2.64% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on LEVIR-MCI and a remarkable 57.9% increase in IoU for small buildings, while reducing the training time by 61%. This work provides an efficient, accurate, and robust solution for practical change detection applications.

TL;DR: DR.Experts is a prior-driven BIQA framework addressing the misalignment between existing models and human perception by incorporating distortion priors. It outperforms current methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BIQA models fail to capture subtle distortion cues and align with human judgments due to unreliable distortion priors.

Method: DR.Experts uses a degradation-aware vision-language model for distortion priors, refines them via Distortion-Saliency Differential Module, and fuses features with Dynamic Distortion Weighting Module.

Result: DR.Experts outperforms current methods on five BIQA benchmarks, showing superior generalization and data efficiency.

Conclusion: Incorporating reliable distortion priors improves BIQA performance and better aligns with human perception.

Abstract: Blind Image Quality Assessment, aiming to replicate human perception of visual quality without reference, plays a key role in vision tasks, yet existing models often fail to effectively capture subtle distortion cues, leading to a misalignment with human subjective judgments. We identify that the root cause of this limitation lies in the lack of reliable distortion priors, as methods typically learn shallow relationships between unified image features and quality scores, resulting in their insensitive nature to distortions and thus limiting their performance. To address this, we introduce DR.Experts, a novel prior-driven BIQA framework designed to explicitly incorporate distortion priors, enabling a reliable quality assessment. DR.Experts begins by leveraging a degradation-aware vision-language model to obtain distortion-specific priors, which are further refined and enhanced by the proposed Distortion-Saliency Differential Module through distinguishing them from semantic attentions, thereby ensuring the genuine representations of distortions. The refined priors, along with semantics and bridging representation, are then fused by a proposed mixture-of-experts style module named the Dynamic Distortion Weighting Module. This mechanism weights each distortion-specific feature as per its perceptual impact, ensuring that the final quality prediction aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging BIQA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DR.Experts over current methods and showcase its excellence in terms of generalization and data efficiency.

TL;DR: RAD is a retrieval-augmented framework for monocular metric depth estimation that improves accuracy for underrepresented classes by leveraging retrieved RGB-D samples as geometric proxies, showing significant error reductions on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate depth estimation for underrepresented classes in complex scenes is challenging, motivating the need for a method that approximates multi-view stereo benefits without requiring multiple views.

Method: The proposed RAD framework uses an uncertainty-aware retrieval mechanism to identify low-confidence regions and retrieve semantically similar RGB-D samples. A dual-stream network processes these samples alongside the input, fusing them via a matched cross-attention module for reliable geometric transfer.

Result: RAD reduces relative absolute error by 29.2% on NYU Depth v2, 13.3% on KITTI, and 7.2% on Cityscapes for underrepresented classes while maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: RAD demonstrates a significant improvement in depth estimation for underrepresented classes, validating the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented approaches in complex scenes.

Abstract: Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) is essential for physically intelligent systems, yet accurate depth estimation for underrepresented classes in complex scenes remains a persistent challenge. To address this, we propose RAD, a retrieval-augmented framework that approximates the benefits of multi-view stereo by utilizing retrieved neighbors as structural geometric proxies. Our method first employs an uncertainty-aware retrieval mechanism to identify low-confidence regions in the input and retrieve RGB-D context samples containing semantically similar content. We then process both the input and retrieved context via a dual-stream network and fuse them using a matched cross-attention module, which transfers geometric information only at reliable point correspondences. Evaluations on NYU Depth v2, KITTI, and Cityscapes demonstrate that RAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on underrepresented classes, reducing relative absolute error by 29.2% on NYU Depth v2, 13.3% on KITTI, and 7.2% on Cityscapes, while maintaining competitive performance on standard in-domain benchmarks.

TL;DR: AUHead introduces a two-stage method for disentangling fine-grained emotion control (Action Units) from audio to generate realistic talking-head videos, outperforming existing techniques in emotional realism and lip sync.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack fine-grained emotion control in talking-head video generation, limiting nuanced emotional expressions.

Method: AUHead uses a two-stage approach: 1) AU generation from audio via spatial-temporal tokenization and chain-of-thought mechanisms, and 2) AU-driven controllable diffusion modeling with cross-attention modules and disentanglement guidance.

Result: The method excels in emotional realism, lip synchronization, and visual coherence, surpassing existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: AUHead advances controllable talking-head video generation by effectively capturing and synthesizing subtle emotional cues.

Abstract: Realistic talking-head video generation is critical for virtual avatars, film production, and interactive systems. Current methods struggle with nuanced emotional expressions due to the lack of fine-grained emotion control. To address this issue, we introduce a novel two-stage method (AUHead) to disentangle fine-grained emotion control, i.e. , Action Units (AUs), from audio and achieve controllable generation. In the first stage, we explore the AU generation abilities of large audio-language models (ALMs), by spatial-temporal AU tokenization and an "emotion-then-AU" chain-of-thought mechanism. It aims to disentangle AUs from raw speech, effectively capturing subtle emotional cues. In the second stage, we propose an AU-driven controllable diffusion model that synthesizes realistic talking-head videos conditioned on AU sequences. Specifically, we first map the AU sequences into the structured 2D facial representation to enhance spatial fidelity, and then model the AU-vision interaction within cross-attention modules. To achieve flexible AU-quality trade-off control, we introduce an AU disentanglement guidance strategy during inference, further refining the emotional expressiveness and identity consistency of the generated videos. Results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance in emotional realism, accurate lip synchronization, and visual coherence, significantly surpassing existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address LVLM hallucinations caused by misaligned attention and strong LLM priors by refining attention activation distributions.

Method: Uses Gaussian mixture models to capture attention distributions, and entropic optimal transport to map components dynamically. Adjusts intervention strength during inference.

Result: Outperforms previous methods across benchmarks, effectively mitigating hallucinations without additional computation.

Conclusion: Scalpel is a model-agnostic, efficient solution for reducing LVLM hallucinations.

Abstract: Rapid progress in large vision-language models (LVLMs) has achieved unprecedented performance in vision-language tasks. However, due to the strong prior of large language models (LLMs) and misaligned attention across modalities, LVLMs often generate outputs inconsistent with visual content - termed hallucination. To address this, we propose \textbf{Scalpel}, a method that reduces hallucination by refining attention activation distributions toward more credible regions. Scalpel predicts trusted attention directions for each head in Transformer layers during inference and adjusts activations accordingly. It employs a Gaussian mixture model to capture multi-peak distributions of attention in trust and hallucination manifolds, and uses entropic optimal transport (equivalent to Schrödinger bridge problem) to map Gaussian components precisely. During mitigation, Scalpel dynamically adjusts intervention strength and direction based on component membership and mapping relationships between hallucination and trust activations. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and benchmarks demonstrate that Scalpel effectively mitigates hallucinations, outperforming previous methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, Scalpel is model- and data-agnostic, requiring no additional computation, only a single decoding step.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spectral clustering methods primarily use single-modal data, missing opportunities to utilize rich multi-modal information. The paper aims to bridge this gap by integrating vision-language pre-training.

Method: The authors introduce Neural Tangent Kernel Spectral Clustering, which couples visual proximity and semantic overlap using positive nouns from pre-trained models. A regularized affinity diffusion mechanism ensembles affinity matrices from different prompts.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on 16 diverse benchmarks, showing significant improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-modal spectral clustering approach enhances clustering accuracy by leveraging cross-modal alignment, demonstrating superior performance across various datasets.

Abstract: Spectral clustering is known as a powerful technique in unsupervised data analysis. The vast majority of approaches to spectral clustering are driven by a single modality, leaving the rich information in multi-modal representations untapped. Inspired by the recent success of vision-language pre-training, this paper enriches the landscape of spectral clustering from a single-modal to a multi-modal regime. Particularly, we propose Neural Tangent Kernel Spectral Clustering that leverages cross-modal alignment in pre-trained vision-language models. By anchoring the neural tangent kernel with positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images of interest, we arrive at formulating the affinity between images as a coupling of their visual proximity and semantic overlap. We show that this formulation amplifies within-cluster connections while suppressing spurious ones across clusters, hence encouraging block-diagonal structures. In addition, we present a regularized affinity diffusion mechanism that adaptively ensembles affinity matrices induced by different prompts. Extensive experiments on \textbf{16} benchmarks -- including classical, large-scale, fine-grained and domain-shifted datasets -- manifest that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin.

To address these gaps, we propose MieDB-100k, a large-scale, high-quality and diverse dataset for text-guided medical image editing. It categorizes editing tasks into perspectives of Perception, Modification and Transformation, considering both understanding and generation abilities. We construct MieDB-100k via a data curation pipeline leveraging both modality-specific expert models and rule-based data synthetic methods, followed by rigorous manual inspection to ensure clinical fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that model trained with MieDB-100k consistently outperform both open-source and proprietary models while exhibiting strong generalization ability. We anticipate that this dataset will serve as a cornerstone for future advancements in specialized medical image editing.

Abstract: Egocentric interactive world models are essential for augmented reality and embodied AI, where visual generation must respond to user input with low latency, geometric consistency, and long-term stability. We study egocentric interaction generation from a single scene image under free-space hand gestures, aiming to synthesize photorealistic videos in which hands enter the scene, interact with objects, and induce plausible world dynamics under head motion. This setting introduces fundamental challenges, including distribution shift between free-space gestures and contact-heavy training data, ambiguity between hand motion and camera motion in monocular views, and the need for arbitrary-length video generation. We present Hand2World, a unified autoregressive framework that addresses these challenges through occlusion-invariant hand conditioning based on projected 3D hand meshes, allowing visibility and occlusion to be inferred from scene context rather than encoded in the control signal. To stabilize egocentric viewpoint changes, we inject explicit camera geometry via per-pixel Plücker-ray embeddings, disentangling camera motion from hand motion and preventing background drift. We further develop a fully automated monocular annotation pipeline and distill a bidirectional diffusion model into a causal generator, enabling arbitrary-length synthesis. Experiments on three egocentric interaction benchmarks show substantial improvements in perceptual quality and 3D consistency while supporting camera control and long-horizon interactive generation.

TL;DR: Tele-Omni is a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that handles text, images, and reference videos via structured instructions, achieving flexible control and high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation methods are task-specific and limited by textual inputs or specialized pipelines, hindering scalability and multimodal adaptability.

Method: Tele-Omni integrates pretrained multimodal large language models for instruction parsing and diffusion-based generators for video synthesis. It uses a task-aware data pipeline to unify inputs.

Result: Tele-Omni supports diverse tasks like text-to-video, image-to-video, and video editing, with strong coherence and consistency.

Conclusion: By decoupling instruction parsing and synthesis, Tele-Omni offers scalable, multimodal video generation and editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have substantially improved visual fidelity and temporal coherence. However, most existing approaches remain task-specific and rely primarily on textual instructions, limiting their ability to handle multimodal inputs, contextual references, and diverse video generation and editing scenarios within a unified framework. Moreover, many video editing methods depend on carefully engineered pipelines tailored to individual operations, which hinders scalability and composability. In this paper, we propose Tele-Omni, a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that follows multimodal instructions, including text, images, and reference videos, within a single model. Tele-Omni leverages pretrained multimodal large language models to parse heterogeneous instructions and infer structured generation or editing intents, while diffusion-based generators perform high-quality video synthesis conditioned on these structured signals. To enable joint training across heterogeneous video tasks, we introduce a task-aware data processing pipeline that unifies multimodal inputs into a structured instruction format while preserving task-specific constraints. Tele-Omni supports a wide range of video-centric tasks, including text-to-video generation, image-to-video generation, first-last-frame video generation, in-context video generation, and in-context video editing. By decoupling instruction parsing from video synthesis and combining it with task-aware data design, Tele-Omni achieves flexible multimodal control while maintaining strong temporal coherence and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Tele-Omni achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks.

*Yue Li,Xin Yi,Dongsheng Shi,Yongyi Cui,Gerard de Melo,Linlin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AGMark is a new watermarking framework for LVLMs that dynamically adjusts token protection based on attention weights and context, improving visual fidelity and detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current watermarking methods disrupt visual grounding or rely on static estimations, leading to irrelevant tokens. AGMark addresses these issues by adapting to dynamic visual dependencies.

Method: AGMark uses attention weights and context-aware cues to dynamically identify critical tokens, then adjusts protection proportion based on token entropy and weight density.

Result: AGMark improves generation quality and visual semantic fidelity, achieving high detection accuracy (≥99.36% AUC) and attack resilience (≥88.61% AUC).

Conclusion: AGMark sets a new standard for reliable multi-modal watermarking by balancing visual fidelity and protection without compromising efficiency.

Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a pivotal solution for content traceability and intellectual property protection in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, vision-agnostic watermarks may introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases. Additionally, current vision-specific watermarks rely on a static, one-time estimation of vision critical weights and ignore the weight distribution density when determining the proportion of protected tokens. This design fails to account for dynamic changes in visual dependence during generation and may introduce low-quality tokens in the long tail. To address these challenges, we propose Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking (AGMark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. At each decoding step, AGMark first dynamically identifies semantic-critical evidence based on attention weights for visual relevance, together with context-aware coherence cues, resulting in a more adaptive and well-calibrated evidence-weight distribution. It then determines the proportion of semantic-critical tokens by jointly considering uncertainty awareness (token entropy) and evidence calibration (weight density), thereby enabling adaptive vocabulary partitioning to avoid irrelevant tokens. Empirical results confirm that AGMark outperforms conventional methods, observably improving generation quality and yielding particularly strong gains in visual semantic fidelity in the later stages of generation. The framework maintains highly competitive detection accuracy (at least 99.36\% AUC) and robust attack resilience (at least 88.61\% AUC) without sacrificing inference efficiency, effectively establishing a new standard for reliability-preserving multi-modal watermarking.

*Yueming Sun,Long Yang,Jianbo Jiao,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LELA is a training-free LLM-based framework for detecting and localizing hateful content in videos by leveraging multi-modal decomposition and prompting, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video hate detection methods require large-scale human annotations or lack temporal precision, prompting the need for a scalable, training-free solution.

Method: LELA decomposes videos into five modalities, uses multi-stage prompting for hateful scoring, and introduces composition matching for cross-modal reasoning.

Result: LELA outperforms all training-free baselines on HateMM and MultiHateClip benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: LELA establishes a scalable and interpretable foundation for hate video localization without requiring training.

Abstract: The proliferation of hateful content in online videos poses severe threats to individual well-being and societal harmony. However, existing solutions for video hate detection either rely heavily on large-scale human annotations or lack fine-grained temporal precision. In this work, we propose LELA, the first training-free Large Language Model (LLM) based framework for hate video localization. Distinct from state-of-the-art models that depend on supervised pipelines, LELA leverages LLMs and modality-specific captioning to detect and temporally localize hateful content in a training-free manner. Our method decomposes a video into five modalities, including image, speech, OCR, music, and video context, and uses a multi-stage prompting scheme to compute fine-grained hateful scores for each frame. We further introduce a composition matching mechanism to enhance cross-modal reasoning. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, HateMM and MultiHateClip, demonstrate that LELA outperforms all existing training-free baselines by a large margin. We also provide extensive ablations and qualitative visualizations, establishing LELA as a strong foundation for scalable and interpretable hate video localization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VIDA, a video-based 3D affordance dataset, and VideoAfford, a model that enhances 3D affordance grounding using multimodal LLMs and dynamic interaction priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of dynamic interaction context in previous 3D affordance grounding methods, which relied on static cues like language and images.

Method: Proposes VideoAfford, a model that integrates multimodal large language models with affordance segmentation capabilities, uses a latent action encoder for dynamic priors, and employs a spatial-aware loss function.

Result: VideoAfford outperforms existing methods and shows strong open-world generalization with affordance reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: The work advances 3D affordance grounding by leveraging dynamic interaction context from videos and provides a publicly released dataset and code for further research.

Abstract: 3D affordance grounding aims to highlight the actionable regions on 3D objects, which is crucial for robotic manipulation. Previous research primarily focused on learning affordance knowledge from static cues such as language and images, which struggle to provide sufficient dynamic interaction context that can reveal temporal and causal cues. To alleviate this predicament, we collect a comprehensive video-based 3D affordance dataset, \textit{VIDA}, which contains 38K human-object-interaction videos covering 16 affordance types, 38 object categories, and 22K point clouds. Based on \textit{VIDA}, we propose a strong baseline: VideoAfford, which activates multimodal large language models with additional affordance segmentation capabilities, enabling both world knowledge reasoning and fine-grained affordance grounding within a unified framework. To enhance action understanding capability, we leverage a latent action encoder to extract dynamic interaction priors from HOI videos. Moreover, we introduce a \textit{spatial-aware} loss function to enable VideoAfford to obtain comprehensive 3D spatial knowledge. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms well-established methods and exhibits strong open-world generalization with affordance reasoning abilities. All datasets and code will be publicly released to advance research in this area.

*Siyu Chen,Ting Han,Haoling Huang,Chaolei Wang,Chengzheng Fu,Duxin Zhu,Guorong Cai,Jinhe Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Time2General is a Domain Generalized Video Semantic Segmentation (DGVSS) framework addressing domain and temporal-sampling shifts to ensure temporally consistent predictions without target labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving cross-domain accuracy and temporal consistency in video semantic segmentation under domain shift and varying sampling rates.

Method: Uses Spatio-Temporal Memory Decoder for multi-frame context aggregation and Masked Temporal Consistency Loss to regularize temporal discrepancies.

Result: Achieves better cross-domain accuracy and temporal stability than prior methods, running at up to 18 FPS.

Conclusion: Time2General effectively tackles flicker and domain shifts, enhancing robustness and consistency in unseen domains.

Abstract: Domain Generalized Video Semantic Segmentation (DGVSS) is trained on a single labeled driving domain and is directly deployed on unseen domains without target labels and test-time adaptation while maintaining temporally consistent predictions over video streams. In practice, both domain shift and temporal-sampling shift break correspondence-based propagation and fixed-stride temporal aggregation, causing severe frame-to-frame flicker even in label-stable regions. We propose Time2General, a DGVSS framework built on Stability Queries. Time2General introduces a Spatio-Temporal Memory Decoder that aggregates multi-frame context into a clip-level spatio-temporal memory and decodes temporally consistent per-frame masks without explicit correspondence propagation. To further suppress flicker and improve robustness to varying sampling rates, the Masked Temporal Consistency Loss is proposed to regularize temporal prediction discrepancies across different strides, and randomize training strides to expose the model to diverse temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on multiple driving benchmarks show that Time2General achieves a substantial improvement in cross-domain accuracy and temporal stability over prior DGSS and VSS baselines while running at up to 18 FPS. Code will be released after the review process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TreeCUA proposes tree-structured verifiable evolution and multi-agent collaboration to efficiently scale GUI automation, improving trajectory quality and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work lacks focus on GUI planning, which is more complex than GUI grounding. Tree-structured exploration can reduce data costs and enhance scalability.

Method: Multi-agent collaboration explores and verifies actions, summarizes trajectories, and evaluates quality. Tree-based topology stores duplicates, and adaptive exploration balances depth (difficulty) and breadth (diversity).

Result: TreeCUA and TreeCUA-DPO show significant improvements, with strong generalization in OOD studies.

Conclusion: Tree-structured approaches enhance GUI automation scalability and quality, demonstrating robust performance and generalization.

Abstract: Effectively scaling GUI automation is essential for computer-use agents (CUAs); however, existing work primarily focuses on scaling GUI grounding rather than the more crucial GUI planning, which requires more sophisticated data collection. In reality, the exploration process of a CUA across apps/desktops/web pages typically follows a tree structure, with earlier functional entry points often being explored more frequently. Thus, organizing large-scale trajectories into tree structures can reduce data cost and streamline the data scaling of GUI planning. In this work, we propose TreeCUA to efficiently scale GUI automation with tree-structured verifiable evolution. We propose a multi-agent collaborative framework to explore the environment, verify actions, summarize trajectories, and evaluate quality to generate high-quality and scalable GUI trajectories. To improve efficiency, we devise a novel tree-based topology to store and replay duplicate exploration nodes, and design an adaptive exploration algorithm to balance the depth (\emph{i.e.}, trajectory difficulty) and breadth (\emph{i.e.}, trajectory diversity). Moreover, we develop world knowledge guidance and global memory backtracking to avoid low-quality generation. Finally, we naturally extend and propose the TreeCUA-DPO method from abundant tree node information, improving GUI planning capability by referring to the branch information of adjacent trajectories. Experimental results show that TreeCUA and TreeCUA-DPO offer significant improvements, and out-of-domain (OOD) studies further demonstrate strong generalization.

TL;DR: The study presents a multi-task deep learning framework for liver segmentation (LiSeg) and fibrosis staging (LiFS) using multiparametric MRI, addressing challenges like limited annotated data and domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver fibrosis is clinically challenging, requiring precise segmentation and staging, especially with limited annotated data and multi-modal complexities.

Method: A semi-supervised learning model integrates segmentation and registration for LiSeg, while LiFS uses a patch-based method for fibrosis stage visualization.

Result: Tested on ID and OOD cases with multi-channel MRIs, the framework effectively handles multimodality data, limited labels, and domain shifts.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses key challenges in liver fibrosis analysis, with code made freely available.

Abstract: Liver fibrosis poses a substantial challenge in clinical practice, emphasizing the necessity for precise liver segmentation and accurate disease staging. Based on the CARE Liver 2025 Track 4 Challenge, this study introduces a multi-task deep learning framework developed for liver segmentation (LiSeg) and liver fibrosis staging (LiFS) using multiparametric MRI. The LiSeg phase addresses the challenge of limited annotated images and the complexities of multi-parametric MRI data by employing a semi-supervised learning model that integrates image segmentation and registration. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, the model overcomes the difficulties introduced by domain shifts and variations across modalities. In the LiFS phase, we employed a patchbased method which allows the visualization of liver fibrosis stages based on the classification outputs. Our approach effectively handles multimodality imaging data, limited labels, and domain shifts. The proposed method has been tested by the challenge organizer on an independent test set that includes in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) cases using three-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI) and seven-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI, GED1-GED4).

*Sandesh Hegde,Jaison Saji Chacko,Debarshi Banerjee,Uma Mahesh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decoupled reason-then-segment pipeline for fine-grained referring image segmentation, using a vision-language model (VLM) and a promptable segmenter (SAM 2), achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve fine-grained referring image segmentation by decoupling reasoning and segmentation tasks, leveraging VLMs and promptable segmenters without needing supervised reasoning-chain annotations.

Method: Uses a vision-language model (Qwen3-VL) to reason about scenes and emit structured spatial prompts, which are converted into masks by a frozen SAM 2. The framework (GenSeg-R1) is finetuned using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). A variant (GenSeg-R1-G) optimizes mask quality with an in-the-loop reward.

Result: GenSeg-R1-8B achieves 0.7127 cIoU and 0.7382 mIoU on RefCOCOg, outperforming baselines by +15.3 and +21.9 points. GenSeg-R1-G achieves 76.69% mIoU on GRefCOCO and 68.40% mIoU on ReasonSeg, surpassing other models.

Conclusion: The decoupled pipeline significantly improves performance in referring image segmentation, with variants showing robustness in handling no-target prompts and direct mask quality optimization.

Abstract: We study fine-grained referring image segmentation via a decoupled reason-then-segment pipeline. A vision-language model (VLM) receives an image and a natural-language query, reasons about the scene, and emits structured spatial prompts: a bounding box plus two interior keypoints for every referred instance. A frozen promptable segmenter (SAM 2) converts these prompts into high-quality masks.
  Within our GenSeg-R1 framework we finetune Qwen3-VL models (4B and 8B parameters) using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), requiring no supervised reasoning-chain annotations. On RefCOCOg validation our best model (GenSeg-R1-8B) achieves 0.7127 cIoU and 0.7382 mIoU, substantially outperforming the corresponding Qwen3-VL Instruct baselines (+15.3 and +21.9 points, respectively) and surpassing Seg-Zero-7B [3] by +3.3 cIoU under identical evaluation.
  We further introduce GenSeg-R1-G, a variant trained on GRefCOCO [9] with a SAM 2 in-the-loop reward that directly optimizes mask quality. On GRefCOCO validation GenSeg-R1-G achieves 76.69% target mIoU with 82.40% accuracy on negative (no-target) prompts, substantially outperforming Seg-R1-7B and Seg-Zero-7B, which lack no-target detection capability. On ReasonSeg test, GenSeg-R1-4B reaches 68.40% mIoU, surpassing Seg-Zero-7B by +7.0 and Seg-R1-7B by +10.7 points.

TL;DR: Stroke3D introduces a novel framework generating rigged 3D meshes from user-drawn 2D strokes and text prompts, using a two-stage pipeline for controllable skeleton generation and enhanced mesh synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with generating animatable geometry and lack fine-grained control over skeleton creation.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Controllable Skeleton Generation using Sk-VAE and Sk-DiT, 2) Enhanced Mesh Synthesis via TextuRig and SKA-DPO.

Result: Produces plausible skeletons and high-quality meshes, enabling intuitive workflow for animatable 3D content.

Conclusion: Stroke3D pioneers generating rigged meshes from user inputs, addressing limitations of existing techniques.

Abstract: Rigged 3D assets are fundamental to 3D deformation and animation. However, existing 3D generation methods face challenges in generating animatable geometry, while rigging techniques lack fine-grained structural control over skeleton creation. To address these limitations, we introduce Stroke3D, a novel framework that directly generates rigged meshes from user inputs: 2D drawn strokes and a descriptive text prompt. Our approach pioneers a two-stage pipeline that separates the generation into: 1) Controllable Skeleton Generation, we employ the Skeletal Graph VAE (Sk-VAE) to encode the skeleton's graph structure into a latent space, where the Skeletal Graph DiT (Sk-DiT) generates a skeletal embedding. The generation process is conditioned on both the text for semantics and the 2D strokes for explicit structural control, with the VAE's decoder reconstructing the final high-quality 3D skeleton; and 2) Enhanced Mesh Synthesis via TextuRig and SKA-DPO, where we then synthesize a textured mesh conditioned on the generated skeleton. For this stage, we first enhance an existing skeleton-to-mesh model by augmenting its training data with TextuRig: a dataset of textured and rigged meshes with captions, curated from Objaverse-XL. Additionally, we employ a preference optimization strategy, SKA-DPO, guided by a skeleton-mesh alignment score, to further improve geometric fidelity. Together, our framework enables a more intuitive workflow for creating ready to animate 3D content. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to generate rigged 3D meshes conditioned on user-drawn 2D strokes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Stroke3D produces plausible skeletons and high-quality meshes.

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks lightweight SNNs converted from compact CNNs, showing higher energy efficiency than CNNs. SqueezeNet's SNN variant excels, and pruning further improves accuracy and reduces parameters and energy use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore lightweight SNNs as energy-efficient alternatives to CNNs for edge intelligence, addressing a gap in prior research.

Method: Convert compact CNNs (ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, MixNet) to SNNs using LIF neurons and surrogate gradient descent. Evaluate accuracy, F1-score, and efficiency metrics. Apply pruning to optimize SqueezeNet's SNN variant.

Result: SNNs achieve up to 15.7x higher energy efficiency than CNNs. The pruned SNN-SqueezeNet-P improves accuracy by 6%, reduces parameters by 19%, and cuts energy use by 88.1% compared to its unpruned version.

Conclusion: Lightweight SNNs are practical, low-power alternatives for edge deployment, demonstrating competitive accuracy and significantly better energy efficiency than CNNs.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly studied as energy-efficient alternatives to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly for edge intelligence. However, prior work has largely emphasized large-scale models, leaving the design and evaluation of lightweight CNN-to-SNN pipelines underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic benchmark of lightweight SNNs obtained by converting compact CNN architectures into spiking networks, where activations are modeled with Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and trained using surrogate gradient descent under a unified setup. We construct spiking variants of ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and MixNet, and evaluate them on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, measuring accuracy, F1-score, parameter count, computational complexity, and energy consumption. Our results show that SNNs can achieve up to 15.7x higher energy efficiency than their CNN counterparts while retaining competitive accuracy. Among these, the SNN variant of SqueezeNet consistently outperforms other lightweight SNNs. To further optimize this model, we apply a structured pruning strategy that removes entire redundant modules, yielding a pruned architecture, SNN-SqueezeNet-P. This pruned model improves CIFAR-10 accuracy by 6% and reduces parameters by 19% compared to the original SNN-SqueezeNet. Crucially, it narrows the gap with CNN-SqueezeNet, achieving nearly the same accuracy (only 1% lower) but with an 88.1% reduction in energy consumption due to sparse spike-driven computations. Together, these findings establish lightweight SNNs as practical, low-power alternatives for edge deployment, highlighting a viable path toward deploying high-performance, low-power intelligence on the edge.

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combines deep generative models and variational functionals to detect craquelure in paintings, addressing challenges posed by complex scenery and crack-like artistic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate non-invasive analysis of artworks to support conservation efforts, particularly automated crack detection amidst complex visual elements.

Method: Models crack detection as an inverse problem, using a deep generative model for crack-free artwork and a Mumford-Shah-type functional for crack localization.

Result: Produces a pixel-level map of cracks, aiding in degradation assessment and restoration guidance.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid method effectively addresses the challenges of crack detection in paintings, offering practical conservation benefits.

Abstract: Recent advances in imaging technologies, deep learning and numerical performance have enabled non-invasive detailed analysis of artworks, supporting their documentation and conservation. In particular, automated detection of craquelure in digitized paintings is crucial for assessing degradation and guiding restoration, yet remains challenging due to the possibly complex scenery and the visual similarity between cracks and crack-like artistic features such as brush strokes or hair. We propose a hybrid approach that models crack detection as an inverse problem, decomposing an observed image into a crack-free painting and a crack component. A deep generative model is employed as powerful prior for the underlying artwork, while crack structures are captured using a Mumford--Shah-type variational functional together with a crack prior. Joint optimization yields a pixel-level map of crack localizations in the painting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving precise control over facial movements in 3D Gaussian Splatting for talking heads is challenging due to lip-sync inaccuracies and facial jitter, leading to uncanny valley effects.

Method: Proposes FG-3DGS, using frequency-aware disentanglement (MLP for low-frequency regions, dedicated network for high-frequency) and post-rendering alignment for accurate lip sync.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in producing high-fidelity, lip-synced talking head videos, validated on widely used datasets.

Conclusion: FG-3DGS effectively enhances fine-grained facial control and lip synchronization, addressing key challenges in audio-driven talking head generation.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation is a core component of digital avatars, and 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown strong performance in real-time rendering of high-fidelity talking heads. However, achieving precise control over fine-grained facial movements remains a significant challenge, particularly due to lip-synchronization inaccuracies and facial jitter, both of which can contribute to the uncanny valley effect. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-Grained 3D Gaussian Splatting (FG-3DGS), a novel framework that enables temporally consistent and high-fidelity talking head generation. Our method introduces a frequency-aware disentanglement strategy to explicitly model facial regions based on their motion characteristics. Low-frequency regions, such as the cheeks, nose, and forehead, are jointly modeled using a standard MLP, while high-frequency regions, including the eyes and mouth, are captured separately using a dedicated network guided by facial area masks. The predicted motion dynamics, represented as Gaussian deltas, are applied to the static Gaussians to generate the final head frames, which are rendered via a rasterizer using frame-specific camera parameters. Additionally, a high-frequency-refined post-rendering alignment mechanism, learned from large-scale audio-video pairs by a pretrained model, is incorporated to enhance per-frame generation and achieve more accurate lip synchronization. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets for talking head generation demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches in producing high-fidelity, lip-synced talking head videos.

*Kawtar Zaher,Ilyass Moummad,Olivier Buisson,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a discrete communication framework for SSL, replacing continuous feature alignment with binary message prediction for structured representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSL methods lack control over how information is structured across representation dimensions, motivating the need for a discrete communication approach.

Method: A teacher-student network transmits semantic information via a binary channel, using binary cross-entropy and coding-rate regularization to enforce discrete agreement and structured representations.

Result: Experiments show improvements over continuous baselines in classification, retrieval, and domain adaptation tasks, with binary codes forming reusable semantic language.

Conclusion: Discrete communication enhances SSL by promoting structured and informative representations, validated across various tasks and domain shifts.

Abstract: Most self-supervised learning (SSL) methods learn continuous visual representations by aligning different views of the same input, offering limited control over how information is structured across representation dimensions. In this work, we frame visual self-supervised learning as a discrete communication process between a teacher and a student network, where semantic information is transmitted through a fixed-capacity binary channel. Rather than aligning continuous features, the student predicts multi-label binary messages produced by the teacher. Discrete agreement is enforced through an element-wise binary cross-entropy objective, while a coding-rate regularization term encourages effective utilization of the constrained channel, promoting structured representations. We further show that periodically reinitializing the projection head strengthens this effect by encouraging embeddings that remain predictive across multiple discrete encodings. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over continuous agreement baselines on image classification, retrieval, and dense visual prediction tasks, as well as under domain shift through self-supervised adaptation. Beyond backbone representations, we analyze the learned binary codes and show that they form a compact and informative discrete language, capturing semantic factors reusable across classes.

### [60] [Where Do Images Come From? Analyzing Captions to Geographically Profile Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09775)
*Abhipsa Basu,Yugam Bahl,Kirti Bhagat,Preethi Seshadri,R. Venkatesh Babu,Danish Pruthi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text-to-image models exhibit geographical bias, with training data overrepresenting wealthy countries (e.g., US, UK, Canada) and underrepresenting South America and Africa. GDP correlates strongly with representation. Non-English datasets skew toward native-speaking countries. Higher representation doesn't ensure diversity, and model-generated images lack real-world coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the geographical bias in text-to-image models by analyzing the origins of training data and assessing its impact on representation.

Method: Researchers mapped image-caption pairs to countries using location data extracted from captions via LLMs. They analyzed English captions from three datasets (Re-LAION, DataComp1B, Conceptual Captions) and non-English subsets.

Result: 48% of samples came from the US, UK, and Canada; South America and Africa accounted for 1.8% and 3.8%, respectively. GDP strongly correlated with representation (ρ=0.82). Non-English datasets skewed toward native-speaking countries.

Conclusion: Training data biases lead to limited geographical diversity in model outputs, highlighting a need for more inclusive datasets.

Abstract: Recent studies show that text-to-image models often fail to generate geographically representative images, raising concerns about the representativeness of their training data and motivating the question: which parts of the world do these training examples come from? We geographically profile large-scale multimodal datasets by mapping image-caption pairs to countries based on location information extracted from captions using LLMs. Studying English captions from three widely used datasets (Re-LAION, DataComp1B, and Conceptual Captions) across $20$ common entities (e.g., house, flag), we find that the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada account for $48.0\%$ of samples, while South American and African countries are severely under-represented with only $1.8\%$ and $3.8\%$ of images, respectively. We observe a strong correlation between a country's GDP and its representation in the data ($ρ= 0.82$). Examining non-English subsets for $4$ languages from the Re-LAION dataset, we find that representation skews heavily toward countries where these languages are predominantly spoken. Additionally, we find that higher representation does not necessarily translate to greater visual or semantic diversity. Finally, analyzing country-specific images generated by Stable Diffusion v1.3 trained on Re-LAION, we show that while generations appear realistic, they are severely limited in their coverage compared to real-world images.

*Tong Zhang,Honglin Lin,Zhou Liu,Chong Chen,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SciFlow-Bench is a structure-first benchmark for evaluating scientific diagram generation, focusing on structural correctness rather than visual similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern text-to-image models often produce structurally incorrect diagrams, and existing benchmarks lack sensitivity to structural accuracy.

Method: SciFlow-Bench evaluates models as black-box image generators using a closed-loop, round-trip protocol that inverse-parses generated images into structured graphs for comparison. A hierarchical multi-agent system coordinates planning, perception, and reasoning.

Result: Experiments reveal that preserving structural correctness is a significant challenge, especially for diagrams with complex topology.

Conclusion: Structure-aware evaluation is crucial for scientific diagram generation, highlighting the gap in current models and benchmarks.

Abstract: Scientific diagrams convey explicit structural information, yet modern text-to-image models often produce visually plausible but structurally incorrect results. Existing benchmarks either rely on image-centric or subjective metrics insensitive to structure, or evaluate intermediate symbolic representations rather than final rendered images, leaving pixel-based diagram generation underexplored. We introduce SciFlow-Bench, a structure-first benchmark for evaluating scientific diagram generation directly from pixel-level outputs. Built from real scientific PDFs, SciFlow-Bench pairs each source framework figure with a canonical ground-truth graph and evaluates models as black-box image generators under a closed-loop, round-trip protocol that inverse-parses generated diagram images back into structured graphs for comparison. This design enforces evaluation by structural recoverability rather than visual similarity alone, and is enabled by a hierarchical multi-agent system that coordinates planning, perception, and structural reasoning. Experiments show that preserving structural correctness remains a fundamental challenge, particularly for diagrams with complex topology, underscoring the need for structure-aware evaluation.

*Hojun Song,Heejung Choi,Aro Kim,Chae-yeong Song,Gahyeon Kim,Soo Ye Kim,Jaehyup Lee,Sang-hyo Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompSplat improves novel view synthesis by addressing compression and pose issues in long videos, enhancing rendering quality and accuracy under heavy compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world videos with long sequences and compression artifacts degrade NVS quality, necessitating a solution to mitigate inconsistencies and errors.

Method: Proposes CompSplat, a framework using compression-aware frame weighting and adaptive pruning to improve robustness and geometric consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and pose accuracy, especially under severe compression.

Conclusion: CompSplat effectively addresses compression and pose challenges in long video sequences, setting a new benchmark for NVS quality.

Abstract: High-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) from real-world videos is crucial for applications such as cultural heritage preservation, digital twins, and immersive media. However, real-world videos typically contain long sequences with irregular camera trajectories and unknown poses, leading to pose drift, feature misalignment, and geometric distortion during reconstruction. Moreover, lossy compression amplifies these issues by introducing inconsistencies that gradually degrade geometry and rendering quality. While recent studies have addressed either long-sequence NVS or unposed reconstruction, compression-aware approaches still focus on specific artifacts or limited scenarios, leaving diverse compression patterns in long videos insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose CompSplat, a compression-aware training framework that explicitly models frame-wise compression characteristics to mitigate inter-frame inconsistency and accumulated geometric errors. CompSplat incorporates compression-aware frame weighting and an adaptive pruning strategy to enhance robustness and geometric consistency, particularly under heavy compression. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Tanks and Temples, Free, and Hike, demonstrate that CompSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and pose accuracy, significantly surpassing most recent state-of-the-art NVS approaches under severe compression conditions.

*Zhaoxu Li,Chenqi Kong,Peijun Bao,Song Xia,Yi Tu,Yi Yu,Xinghao Jiang,Xudong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates instability in LVLMs leading to hallucinations, identifies key patterns, and proposes SAKED, a training-free method to mitigate hallucinations by leveraging stable internal knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LVLMs pose reliability risks; the study explores how internal instability causes these errors, inspired by human uncertainty.

Method: Analyzes LVLMs' hallucination patterns (attention heads, layers, decoding tokens) and introduces SAKED with a Knowledge Stability Score (KSS) to guide faithful token generation.

Result: SAKED effectively mitigates hallucinations across models, tasks, and benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: SAKED is a scalable, training-free solution for reducing LVLM hallucinations, enhancing reliability without architectural changes.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) pose significant security and reliability risks in real-world applications. Inspired by the observation that humans are more error-prone when uncertain or hesitant, we investigate how instability in a model 's internal knowledge contributes to LVLM hallucinations. We conduct extensive empirical analyses from three perspectives, namely attention heads, model layers, and decoding tokens, and identify three key hallucination patterns: (i) visual activation drift across attention heads, (ii) pronounced knowledge fluctuations across layers, and (iii) visual focus distraction between neighboring output tokens. Building on these findings, we propose Stability-Aware Knowledge-Enhanced Decoding (SAKED), which introduces a layer-wise Knowledge Stability Score (KSS) to quantify knowledge stability throughout the model. By contrasting the most stability-aware and stability-agnostic layers, SAKED suppresses decoding noise and dynamically leverages the most reliable internal knowledge for faithful token generation. Moreover, SAKED is training-free and can be seamlessly integrated into different architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAKED achieves state-of-the-art performance for hallucination mitigation on various models, tasks, and benchmarks.

*Yijie Lin,Guofeng Ding,Haochen Zhou,Haobin Li,Mouxing Yang,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARK is a multimodal retrieval benchmark focusing on knowledge domains and reasoning skills, evaluating 23 retrievers and identifying gaps in knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack emphasis on professional knowledge and complex reasoning, prompting the creation of ARK to address these gaps.

Method: ARK analyzes retrieval through knowledge domains (5 domains, 17 subtypes) and reasoning skills (6 categories), using unimodal and multimodal queries with hard negatives. It covers 16 visual data types.

Result: Evaluation of 23 retrievers revealed gaps in knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive tasks, with visual and spatial reasoning being major bottlenecks. Simple enhancements like re-ranking improved performance, but significant challenges remain.

Conclusion: ARK highlights the need for better multimodal retrieval systems capable of handling knowledge-rich and reasoning-intensive tasks, suggesting further research to bridge these gaps.

Abstract: Existing multimodal retrieval benchmarks largely emphasize semantic matching on daily-life images and offer limited diagnostics of professional knowledge and complex reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce ARK, a benchmark designed to analyze multimodal retrieval from two complementary perspectives: (i) knowledge domains (five domains with 17 subtypes), which characterize the content and expertise retrieval relies on, and (ii) reasoning skills (six categories), which characterize the type of inference over multimodal evidence required to identify the correct candidate. Specifically, ARK evaluates retrieval with both unimodal and multimodal queries and candidates, covering 16 heterogeneous visual data types. To avoid shortcut matching during evaluation, most queries are paired with targeted hard negatives that require multi-step reasoning. We evaluate 23 representative text-based and multimodal retrievers on ARK and observe a pronounced gap between knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive retrieval, with fine-grained visual and spatial reasoning emerging as persistent bottlenecks. We further show that simple enhancements such as re-ranking and rewriting yield consistent improvements, but substantial headroom remains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kelix is a fully discrete autoregressive model that bridges the understanding gap between discrete and continuous visual representations in multimodal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models often rely on hybrid interfaces (discrete text tokens and continuous ViT features), which limits self-supervised learning and introduces biases toward understanding over generation.

Method: Kelix uses discrete visual tokenization to enable fully autoregressive multimodal modeling, unifying comprehension and generation under self-supervision.

Result: Kelix demonstrates improved understanding capabilities compared to existing discrete vision tokens, closing the gap with continuous-feature models.

Conclusion: Kelix advances unified multimodal modeling by effectively balancing understanding and generation through discrete representations.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) scale well by expressing diverse tasks as sequences of discrete natural-language tokens and training with next-token prediction, which unifies comprehension and generation under self-supervision. Extending this paradigm to multimodal data requires a shared, discrete representation across modalities. However, most vision-language models (VLMs) still rely on a hybrid interface: discrete text tokens paired with continuous Vision Transformer (ViT) features. Because supervision is largely text-driven, these models are often biased toward understanding and cannot fully leverage large-scale self-supervised learning on non-text data. Recent work has explored discrete visual tokenization to enable fully autoregressive multimodal modeling, showing promising progress toward unified understanding and generation. Yet existing discrete vision tokens frequently lose information due to limited code capacity, resulting in noticeably weaker understanding than continuous-feature VLMs. We present Kelix, a fully discrete autoregressive unified model that closes the understanding gap between discrete and continuous visual representations.

TL;DR: Reason-IAD is a dynamic latent reasoning framework for industrial anomaly detection, incorporating category-specific knowledge and entropy-driven reasoning to improve accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with fine-grained defect patterns in industrial anomaly detection, limiting accuracy and interpretability.

Method: Reason-IAD uses a retrieval-augmented knowledge module for context-aware reasoning and an entropy-driven latent reasoning mechanism for confident predictions. It also dynamically injects informative image patches.

Result: Reason-IAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in industrial anomaly detection.

Conclusion: Reason-IAD provides an effective and interpretable solution for industrial anomaly detection by integrating domain-specific knowledge and dynamic reasoning.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection demands precise reasoning over fine-grained defect patterns. However, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), pretrained on general-domain data, often struggle to capture category-specific anomalies, thereby limiting both detection accuracy and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose Reason-IAD, a knowledge-guided dynamic latent reasoning framework for explainable industrial anomaly detection. Reason-IAD comprises two core components. First, a retrieval-augmented knowledge module incorporates category-specific textual descriptions into the model input, enabling context-aware reasoning over domain-specific defects. Second, an entropy-driven latent reasoning mechanism conducts iterative exploration within a compact latent space using optimizable latent think tokens, guided by an entropy-based reward that encourages confident and stable predictions. Furthermore, a dynamic visual injection strategy selectively incorporates the most informative image patches into the latent sequence, directing the reasoning process toward regions critical for anomaly detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Reason-IAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/chenpeng052/Reason-IAD.

TL;DR: Code2World introduces a vision-language coder for simulating GUI states via renderable code, addressing data scarcity with AndroidCode and enhancing VLMs for code prediction, achieving top UI prediction performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text- and pixel-based methods lack both high visual fidelity and fine-grained structural controllability in GUI interactions.

Method: Code2World uses HTML-based code generation, constructs AndroidCode for data, and applies Render-Aware Reinforcement Learning to VLMs.

Result: Outperforms competitors like GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro-Image in UI prediction and boosts navigation success rates by +9.5%.

Conclusion: Code2World provides a flexible solution for high-fidelity GUI state prediction and improves downstream task performance.

Abstract: Autonomous GUI agents interact with environments by perceiving interfaces and executing actions. As a virtual sandbox, the GUI World model empowers agents with human-like foresight by enabling action-conditioned prediction. However, existing text- and pixel-based approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve high visual fidelity and fine-grained structural controllability. To this end, we propose Code2World, a vision-language coder that simulates the next visual state via renderable code generation. Specifically, to address the data scarcity problem, we construct AndroidCode by translating GUI trajectories into high-fidelity HTML and refining synthesized code through a visual-feedback revision mechanism, yielding a corpus of over 80K high-quality screen-action pairs. To adapt existing VLMs into code prediction, we first perform SFT as a cold start for format layout following, then further apply Render-Aware Reinforcement Learning which uses rendered outcome as the reward signal by enforcing visual semantic fidelity and action consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Code2World-8B achieves the top-performing next UI prediction, rivaling the competitive GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro-Image. Notably, Code2World significantly enhances downstream navigation success rates in a flexible manner, boosting Gemini-2.5-Flash by +9.5% on AndroidWorld navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative video compression methods lack efficient temporal correlation exploitation, leading to flicker and degraded coherence at ultra-low bitrates.

Method: Free-GVC encodes video segments into a compact latent space using GOP-level processing, with an Adaptive Quality Control module and Inter-GOP Alignment module to enhance consistency and coherence.

Result: Free-GVC achieves a 93.29% BD-Rate reduction over DCVC-RT and demonstrates superior perceptual quality and temporal coherence in user studies.

Conclusion: Free-GVC presents an effective solution for generative video compression at ultra-low bitrates, addressing flicker and coherence issues while maintaining perceptual quality.

Abstract: Building on recent advances in video generation, generative video compression has emerged as a new paradigm for achieving visually pleasing reconstructions. However, existing methods exhibit limited exploitation of temporal correlations, causing noticeable flicker and degraded temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates. In this paper, we propose Free-GVC, a training-free generative video compression framework that reformulates video coding as latent trajectory compression guided by a video diffusion prior. Our method operates at the group-of-pictures (GOP) level, encoding video segments into a compact latent space and progressively compressing them along the diffusion trajectory. To ensure perceptually consistent reconstruction across GOPs, we introduce an Adaptive Quality Control module that dynamically constructs an online rate-perception surrogate model to predict the optimal diffusion step for each GOP. In addition, an Inter-GOP Alignment module establishes frame overlap and performs latent fusion between adjacent groups, thereby mitigating flicker and enhancing temporal coherence. Experiments show that Free-GVC achieves an average of 93.29% BD-Rate reduction in DISTS over the latest neural codec DCVC-RT, and a user study further confirms its superior perceptual quality and temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an embodied 4D world model for robotic manipulation that predicts complete 4D scene dynamics from single-view RGBD input, ensuring geometric consistency and enabling action optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robotic manipulation models are limited to either image-based forecasting or partial 3D reasoning, lacking the ability to predict complete 4D scene dynamics.

Method: The novel embodied 4D world model features cross-view and cross-modality fusion for consistent RGBD generation, and employs test-time action optimization and residual inverse dynamics for accurate action execution.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show strong performance in 4D scene generation and downstream manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The model successfully bridges the gap in predicting complete 4D dynamics and offers practical insights for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: World-model-based imagine-then-act becomes a promising paradigm for robotic manipulation, yet existing approaches typically support either purely image-based forecasting or reasoning over partial 3D geometry, limiting their ability to predict complete 4D scene dynamics. This work proposes a novel embodied 4D world model that enables geometrically consistent, arbitrary-view RGBD generation: given only a single-view RGBD observation as input, the model imagines the remaining viewpoints, which can then be back-projected and fused to assemble a more complete 3D structure across time. To efficiently learn the multi-view, cross-modality generation, we explicitly design cross-view and cross-modality feature fusion that jointly encourage consistency between RGB and depth and enforce geometric alignment across views. Beyond prediction, converting generated futures into actions is often handled by inverse dynamics, which is ill-posed because multiple actions can explain the same transition. We address this with a test-time action optimization strategy that backpropagates through the generative model to infer a trajectory-level latent best matching the predicted future, and a residual inverse dynamics model that turns this trajectory prior into accurate executable actions. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate strong performance on both 4D scene generation and downstream manipulation, and ablations provide practical insights into the key design choices.

TL;DR: AdaTSQ is a new post-training quantization framework designed to improve efficiency and quality in Diffusion Transformers by addressing their unique temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational cost and memory footprint of Diffusion Transformers hinder their deployment on edge devices, necessitating optimized quantization methods.

Method: AdaTSQ introduces a timestep-dynamic bit-width allocation strategy and Fisher-guided temporal calibration mechanism.

Result: Experiments show AdaTSQ outperforms state-of-the-art methods like SVDQuant and ViDiT-Q.

Conclusion: AdaTSQ advances the efficiency and quality of Diffusion Transformers through innovative quantization techniques.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art backbone for high-fidelity image and video generation. However, their massive computational cost and memory footprint hinder deployment on edge devices. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), directly applying existing methods to DiTs yields suboptimal results due to the neglect of the unique temporal dynamics inherent in diffusion processes. In this paper, we propose AdaTSQ, a novel PTQ framework that pushes the Pareto frontier of efficiency and quality by exploiting the temporal sensitivity of DiTs. First, we propose a Pareto-aware timestep-dynamic bit-width allocation strategy. We model the quantization policy search as a constrained pathfinding problem. We utilize a beam search algorithm guided by end-to-end reconstruction error to dynamically assign layer-wise bit-widths across different timesteps. Second, we propose a Fisher-guided temporal calibration mechanism. It leverages temporal Fisher information to prioritize calibration data from highly sensitive timesteps, seamlessly integrating with Hessian-based weight optimization. Extensive experiments on four advanced DiTs (e.g., Flux-Dev, Flux-Schnell, Z-Image, and Wan2.1) demonstrate that AdaTSQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like SVDQuant and ViDiT-Q. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Qiushao-E/AdaTSQ.

TL;DR: SARS, a modular pipeline, enhances 3DMMs by incorporating semantic features (age, gender, landmarks) into 3D human reconstruction from single images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous 3DMMs focused only on global face structure, neglecting semantic features like age and facial landmarks. SARS aims to address this gap.

Method: SARS combines identity and expression blendshapes with a face mesh, tuning parameters for shape, texture, illumination, and camera to create detailed 3D models.

Result: The system accurately reconstructs full-body 3D models from single images, integrating semantic features.

Conclusion: SARS improves 3DMMs by capturing semantic facial features, offering a more comprehensive reconstruction solution.

Abstract: Morphable Models (3DMMs) are a type of morphable model that takes 2D images as inputs and recreates the structure and physical appearance of 3D objects, especially human faces and bodies. 3DMM combines identity and expression blendshapes with a basic face mesh to create a detailed 3D model. The variability in the 3D Morphable models can be controlled by tuning diverse parameters. They are high-level image descriptors, such as shape, texture, illumination, and camera parameters. Previous research in 3D human reconstruction concentrated solely on global face structure or geometry, ignoring face semantic features such as age, gender, and facial landmarks characterizing facial boundaries, curves, dips, and wrinkles. In order to accommodate changes in these high-level facial characteristics, this work introduces a shape and appearance-aware 3D reconstruction system (named SARS by us), a c modular pipeline that extracts body and face information from a single image to properly rebuild the 3D model of the human full body.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotated datasets hinder deep learning model development for laparoscopic skill assessment, which is crucial for surgical training.

Method: The LASANA dataset provides 1270 stereo video recordings of laparoscopic tasks, annotated with skill ratings and error labels. Predefined splits and baseline deep learning results are included for benchmarking.

Result: The dataset reflects natural skill variation among participants and offers standardized splits for future research comparisons.

Conclusion: LASANA enables better benchmarking and development of deep learning models for laparoscopic skill assessment, supporting surgical training.

Abstract: Laparoscopic surgery is a complex surgical technique that requires extensive training. Recent advances in deep learning have shown promise in supporting this training by enabling automatic video-based assessment of surgical skills. However, the development and evaluation of deep learning models is currently hindered by the limited size of available annotated datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Laparoscopic Skill Analysis and Assessment (LASANA) dataset, comprising 1270 stereo video recordings of four basic laparoscopic training tasks. Each recording is annotated with a structured skill rating, aggregated from three independent raters, as well as binary labels indicating the presence or absence of task-specific errors. The majority of recordings originate from a laparoscopic training course, thereby reflecting a natural variation in the skill of participants. To facilitate benchmarking of both existing and novel approaches for video-based skill assessment and error recognition, we provide predefined data splits for each task. Furthermore, we present baseline results from a deep learning model as a reference point for future comparisons.

TL;DR: RoSE reformulates monocular normal estimation as shading sequence estimation using image-to-video models, achieving state-of-the-art results by addressing 3D misalignment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for monocular normal estimation suffer from 3D misalignment, where predicted normal maps fail to align with geometric details due to subtle color variations representing geometry.

Method: RoSE introduces a new paradigm treating normal estimation as shading sequence estimation. It uses image-to-video generative models to predict shading sequences, which are then converted to normal maps via ordinary least-squares. Training leverages the synthetic MultiShade dataset.

Result: RoSE outperforms existing methods on real-world benchmarks for monocular normal estimation.

Conclusion: The shading sequence estimation paradigm effectively addresses 3D misalignment, improving accuracy in monocular normal estimation.

Abstract: Monocular normal estimation aims to estimate the normal map from a single RGB image of an object under arbitrary lights. Existing methods rely on deep models to directly predict normal maps. However, they often suffer from 3D misalignment: while the estimated normal maps may appear to have a correct appearance, the reconstructed surfaces often fail to align with the geometric details. We argue that this misalignment stems from the current paradigm: the model struggles to distinguish and reconstruct varying geometry represented in normal maps, as the differences in underlying geometry are reflected only through relatively subtle color variations. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm that reformulates normal estimation as shading sequence estimation, where shading sequences are more sensitive to various geometric information. Building on this paradigm, we present RoSE, a method that leverages image-to-video generative models to predict shading sequences. The predicted shading sequences are then converted into normal maps by solving a simple ordinary least-squares problem. To enhance robustness and better handle complex objects, RoSE is trained on a synthetic dataset, MultiShade, with diverse shapes, materials, and light conditions. Experiments demonstrate that RoSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmark datasets for object-based monocular normal estimation.

TL;DR: GeoFormer is an open-source Swin Transformer framework for estimating building height and footprint using Sentinel-1/2 imagery and DEM data, achieving high accuracy across diverse cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban data like building height and footprint are crucial for climate modeling and urban planning but are scarce due to proprietary sensors or poor cross-city generalization.

Method: Uses GeoFormer, a Swin Transformer framework, with Sentinel-1/2 imagery and DEM data, and employs geo-blocked splitting for spatial independence.

Result: Achieves BH RMSE of 3.19 m and BF RMSE of 0.05, outperforming CNN baselines by 7.5% and 15.3%, respectively, and maintains strong cross-continent performance.

Conclusion: DEM is essential for height estimation, optical reflectance outperforms SAR, and multi-source fusion provides the best accuracy. All resources are publicly released.

Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional urban data are critical for climate modelling, disaster risk assessment, and urban planning, yet remain scarce due to reliance on proprietary sensors or poor cross-city generalisation. We propose GeoFormer, an open-source Swin Transformer framework that jointly estimates building height (BH) and footprint (BF) on a 100 m grid using only Sentinel-1/2 imagery and open DEM data. A geo-blocked splitting strategy ensures strict spatial independence between training and test sets. Evaluated over 54 diverse cities, GeoFormer achieves a BH RMSE of 3.19 m and a BF RMSE of 0.05, improving 7.5% and 15.3% over the strongest CNN baseline, while maintaining under 3.5 m BH RMSE in cross-continent transfer. Ablation studies confirm that DEM is indispensable for height estimation and that optical reflectance dominates over SAR, though multi-source fusion yields the best overall accuracy.

### [75] [Unbalanced optimal transport for robust longitudinal lesion evolution with registration-aware and appearance-guided priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09933)
*Melika Qahqaie,Dominik Neumann,Tobias Heimann,Andreas Maier,Veronika A. Zimmer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a registration-aware matcher using unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) to improve lesion correspondence in longitudinal CT scans, outperforming geometric-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing treatment response in cancer patients requires evaluating lesion evolution, but establishing reliable lesion correspondence over time is challenging due to lesions appearing, disappearing, merging, or splitting.

Method: Uses an unbalanced optimal transport (UOT)-based matcher that integrates size-normalized geometry, local registration trust, and optional appearance consistency. It sparsifies the transport plan to handle lesion dynamics without retraining or heuristic rules.

Result: Achieves higher edge-detection precision and recall, improved lesion-state recall, and superior lesion-graph component F1 scores compared to distance-only baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed UOT-based matcher effectively handles lesion correspondence challenges in longitudinal CT scans, offering a robust solution for tracking lesion evolution.

Abstract: Evaluating lesion evolution in longitudinal CT scans of can cer patients is essential for assessing treatment response, yet establishing reliable lesion correspondence across time remains challenging. Standard bipartite matchers, which rely on geometric proximity, struggle when lesions appear, disappear, merge, or split. We propose a registration-aware matcher based on unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) that accommodates unequal lesion mass and adapts priors to patient-level tumor-load changes. Our transport cost blends (i) size-normalized geometry, (ii) local registration trust from the deformation-field Jacobian, and (iii) optional patch-level appearance consistency. The resulting transport plan is sparsified by relative pruning, yielding one-to-one matches as well as new, disappearing, merging, and splitting lesions without retraining or heuristic rules. On longitudinal CT data, our approach achieves consistently higher edge-detection precision and recall, improved lesion-state recall, and superior lesion-graph component F1 scores versus distance-only baselines.

*Yikun Liu,Yuan Liu,Shangzhe Di,Haicheng Wang,Zhongyin Zhao,Le Tian,Xiao Zhou,Jie Zhou,Jiangchao Yao,Yanfeng Wang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores whether vision encoders in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as versatile vision backbones for classic vision tasks. It identifies deficiencies in dense feature representation and proposes VersaViT, a collaborative post-training framework, to enhance performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to assess and improve the capability of vision encoders in MLLMs to handle dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation, which require detailed pixel-level understanding.

Method: The authors propose VersaViT, a multi-task framework featuring lightweight task heads and multi-granularity supervision to optimize the vision backbone through collaborative post-training.

Result: Experiments show VersaViT effectively bridges the gap between MLLMs' high-level semantic alignment and dense prediction tasks, creating a versatile vision backbone.

Conclusion: VersaViT successfully enhances the vision encoders in MLLMs, making them adaptable for both language-mediated reasoning and pixel-level tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable success in visual-language understanding, demonstrating superior high-level semantic alignment within their vision encoders. An important question thus arises: Can these encoders serve as versatile vision backbones, capable of reliably performing classic vision-centric tasks as well? To address the question, we make the following contributions: (i) we identify that the vision encoders within MLLMs exhibit deficiencies in their dense feature representations, as evidenced by their suboptimal performance on dense prediction tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation, depth estimation); (ii) we propose VersaViT, a well-rounded vision transformer that instantiates a novel multi-task framework for collaborative post-training. This framework facilitates the optimization of the vision backbone via lightweight task heads with multi-granularity supervision; (iii) extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, yielding a versatile vision backbone suited for both language-mediated reasoning and pixel-level understanding.

*Franziska Krauß,Matthias Ege,Zoltan Lovasz,Albrecht Bartz-Schmidt,Igor Tsaur,Oliver Sawodny,Carina Veil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hybrid Attention-Convolution (HAC) architecture for improving urinary bladder cancer surveillance by segmenting blood vessels in endoscopic images, addressing challenges like sparse labels, artifacts, and deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urinary bladder cancer surveillance lacks stable landmarks. Blood vessels can serve as a 'vascular fingerprint,' but existing methods fail to handle domain-specific complexities like imperfect data and mucosal folds.

Method: The HAC combines Transformers for global vessel topology with CNNs for fine details. It uses optimized ground truth data and physics-aware pretraining to address data scarcity.

Result: The method achieves high accuracy (0.94), precision (0.61), and clDice (0.66) on the BlaVeS dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art models and reducing false positives from mucosal folds.

Conclusion: HAC provides reliable segmentation for clinical navigation in bladder cancer surveillance, addressing key challenges in the domain.

Abstract: Urinary bladder cancer surveillance requires tracking tumor sites across repeated interventions, yet the deformable and hollow bladder lacks stable landmarks for orientation. While blood vessels visible during endoscopy offer a patient-specific "vascular fingerprint" for navigation, automated segmentation is challenged by imperfect endoscopic data, including sparse labels, artifacts like bubbles or variable lighting, continuous deformation, and mucosal folds that mimic vessels. State-of-the-art vessel segmentation methods often fail to address these domain-specific complexities. We introduce a Hybrid Attention-Convolution (HAC) architecture that combines Transformers to capture global vessel topology prior with a CNN that learns a residual refinement map to precisely recover thin-vessel details. To prioritize structural connectivity, the Transformer is trained on optimized ground truth data that exclude short and terminal branches. Furthermore, to address data scarcity, we employ a physics-aware pretraining, that is a self-supervised strategy using clinically grounded augmentations on unlabeled data. Evaluated on the BlaVeS dataset, consisting of endoscopic video frames, our approach achieves high accuracy (0.94) and superior precision (0.61) and clDice (0.66) compared to state-of-the-art medical segmentation models. Crucially, our method successfully suppresses false positives from mucosal folds that dynamically appear and vanish as the bladder fills and empties during surgery. Hence, HAC provides the reliable structural stability required for clinical navigation.

### [78] [Learning to Detect Baked Goods with Limited Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09979)
*Thomas H. Schmitt,Maximilian Bundscherer,Tobias Bocklet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated monitoring of leftover bakery products using object detection models improves efficiency despite challenges like diverse baked goods and scarce annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing production in bakeries by automating leftover product monitoring, given the short shelf life of baked goods.

Method: Uses object detection models (OWLv2, Grounding DINO, YOLOv11) with limited supervision, combining weakly supervised training and pseudo-label propagation.

Result: Achieves mAP of 0.91 with image-level supervision and improves performance by 19.3% with pseudo-labels.

Conclusion: The proposed workflows surpass fully-supervised baselines under non-ideal conditions, offering scalable solutions for specialized industries.

Abstract: Monitoring leftover products provides valuable insights that can be used to optimize future production. This is especially important for German bakeries because freshly baked goods have a very short shelf life. Automating this process can reduce labor costs, improve accuracy, and streamline operations. We propose automating this process using an object detection model to identify baked goods from images. However, the large diversity of German baked goods makes fully supervised training prohibitively expensive and limits scalability. Although open-vocabulary detectors (e.g., OWLv2, Grounding DINO) offer lexibility, we demonstrate that they are insufficient for our task. While motivated by bakeries, our work addresses the broader challenges of deploying computer vision in industries, where tasks are specialized and annotated datasets are scarce. We compile dataset splits with varying supervision levels, covering 19 classes of baked goods. We propose two training workflows to train an object detection model with limited supervision. First, we combine OWLv2 and Grounding DINO localization with image-level supervision to train the model in a weakly supervised manner. Second, we improve viewpoint robustness by fine-tuning on video frames annotated using Segment Anything 2 as a pseudo-label propagation model. Using these workflows, we train YOLOv11 for our detection task due to its favorable speed accuracy tradeoff. Relying solely on image-level supervision, the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91. Finetuning with pseudo-labels raises model performance by 19.3% under non-ideal deployment conditions. Combining these workflows trains a model that surpasses our fully-supervised baseline model under non-ideal deployment conditions, despite relying only on image-level supervision.

*Calvin Yeung,Ali Zakeri,Zhuowen Zou,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for semantic decomposition using coupled inference in diffusion models, outperforming resonator networks in synthetic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective recognition, reasoning, and editing rely on compositional representations and their decomposition. Resonator networks, similar to Hopfield networks, have been used for this, but recent parallels between Hopfield networks and diffusion models inspire a new approach.

Method: The framework frames semantic decomposition as an inverse problem, coupling diffusion processes with a reconstruction-driven guidance term. It also introduces an iterative sampling scheme to enhance performance.

Result: The proposed method outperforms resonator networks in synthetic semantic decomposition tasks.

Conclusion: The coupled inference framework offers a robust alternative to resonator networks for semantic decomposition, with potential broader implications for compositional representations.

Abstract: Many visual scenes can be described as compositions of latent factors. Effective recognition, reasoning, and editing often require not only forming such compositional representations, but also solving the decomposition problem. One popular choice for constructing these representations is through the binding operation. Resonator networks, which can be understood as coupled Hopfield networks, were proposed as a way to perform decomposition on such bound representations. Recent works have shown notable similarities between Hopfield networks and diffusion models. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a framework for semantic decomposition using coupled inference in diffusion models. Our method frames semantic decomposition as an inverse problem and couples the diffusion processes using a reconstruction-driven guidance term that encourages the composition of factor estimates to match the bound vector. We also introduce a novel iterative sampling scheme that improves the performance of our model. Finally, we show that attention-based resonator networks are a special case of our framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our coupled inference framework outperforms resonator networks across a range of synthetic semantic decomposition tasks.

*Oskar Thaeter,Christian Grashei,Anette Haas,Elisa Schmoeckel,Han Li,Peter J. Schüffler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper compares two methods for automated stain classification in digital pathology, finding that a lightweight thumbnail-based approach is scalable and robust for quality control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathologists rely on various stains for diagnosis, and accurate metadata is crucial for quality control and computational pathology datasets. The study aims to compare automated classification methods for these stains.

Method: The paper evaluates two approaches: a Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) pipeline and a proposed lightweight thumbnail-based method. Both are tested on 14 common special stains and H&E slides.

Result: MIL performed best on internal data (macro F1: 0.941 for 16 classes), while the thumbnail method excelled on external TCGA data (weighted F1: 0.843 vs. 0.807 for MIL). The thumbnail approach also significantly improved processing speed (5.635 slides/s vs. 0.018 for MIL).

Conclusion: The thumbnail-based classification is a scalable and efficient solution for routine quality control in digital pathology workflows.

Abstract: Stains are essential in histopathology to visualize specific tissue characteristics, with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) serving as the clinical standard. However, pathologists frequently
  utilize a variety of special stains for the diagnosis of specific morphologies. Maintaining accurate metadata for these slides is critical for quality control in clinical archives and for
  the integrity of computational pathology datasets. In this work, we compare two approaches for automated classification of stains using whole slide images, covering the 14 most commonly
  used special stains in our institute alongside standard and frozen-section H&E. We evaluate a Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) pipeline and a proposed lightweight thumbnail-based approach.
  On internal test data, MIL achieved the highest performance (macro F1: 0.941 for 16 classes; 0.969 for 14 merged classes), while the thumbnail approach remained competitive (0.897 and
  0.953, respectively). On external TCGA data, the thumbnail model generalized best (weighted F1: 0.843 vs. 0.807 for MIL). The thumbnail approach also increased throughput by two orders of
  magnitude (5.635 vs. 0.018 slides/s for MIL with all patches). We conclude that thumbnail-based classification provides a scalable and robust solution for routine visual quality control
  in digital pathology workflows.

*Florian Hahlbohm,Linus Franke,Martin Eisemann,Marcus Magnor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Faster-GS, a consolidated and optimized version of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), achieving faster training without compromising visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent methods in 3DGS often confuse implementation improvements with algorithmic changes or sacrifice performance for fidelity, making fair comparisons difficult. This work aims to unify effective strategies and address understudied aspects of the framework.

Method: The authors consolidate prior 3DGS strategies, add novel optimizations, and investigate numerical stability, Gaussian truncation, and gradient approximation. They benchmark the resulting system, Faster-GS, against comprehensive tests.

Result: Faster-GS achieves up to 5× faster training while preserving visual quality. It also extends optimizations to 4D Gaussian reconstruction for non-rigid scenes.

Conclusion: Faster-GS offers a cost-effective, efficient baseline for 3DGS optimization and demonstrates scalability to 4D reconstruction.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have focused on accelerating optimization while preserving reconstruction quality. However, many proposed methods entangle implementation-level improvements with fundamental algorithmic modifications or trade performance for fidelity, leading to a fragmented research landscape that complicates fair comparison. In this work, we consolidate and evaluate the most effective and broadly applicable strategies from prior 3DGS research and augment them with several novel optimizations. We further investigate underexplored aspects of the framework, including numerical stability, Gaussian truncation, and gradient approximation. The resulting system, Faster-GS, provides a rigorously optimized algorithm that we evaluate across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Faster-GS achieves up to 5$\times$ faster training while maintaining visual quality, establishing a new cost-effective and resource efficient baseline for 3DGS optimization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizations can be applied to 4D Gaussian reconstruction, leading to efficient non-rigid scene optimization.

*Tobias Ladner,Yasser Shoukry,Matthias Althoff*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a certified 3D pose estimation method using camera images and target geometry, ensuring safety in cyber-physical systems by leveraging formal verification techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical tasks in cyber-physical systems require precise pose estimation, but existing methods (e.g., lidar, GPS) may lack formal guarantees or trustworthiness.

Method: Uses camera images and known target geometry, applying reachability analysis and formal neural network verification to compute and bound the pose.

Result: Demonstrates efficient and accurate localization in synthetic and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The approach provides a reliable, formally verified solution for safety-critical pose estimation in 3D.

Abstract: Agents in cyber-physical systems are increasingly entrusted with safety-critical tasks. Ensuring safety of these agents often requires localizing the pose for subsequent actions. Pose estimates can, e.g., be obtained from various combinations of lidar sensors, cameras, and external services such as GPS. Crucially, in safety-critical domains, a rough estimate is insufficient to formally determine safety, i.e., guaranteeing safety even in the worst-case scenario, and external services might additionally not be trustworthy. We address this problem by presenting a certified pose estimation in 3D solely from a camera image and a well-known target geometry. This is realized by formally bounding the pose, which is computed by leveraging recent results from reachability analysis and formal neural network verification. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach efficiently and accurately localizes agents in both synthetic and real-world experiments.

*Changjiang Jiang,Xinkuan Sha,Fengchang Yu,Jingjing Liu,Jian Liu,Mingqi Fang,Chenfeng Zhang,Wei Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fake-HR1 is a hybrid-reasoning model that adaptively decides when to use reasoning for detecting synthetic images, improving efficiency and performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce resource overhead and redundancy caused by lengthy reasoning in synthetic image detection while maintaining high accuracy.

Method: A two-stage framework: Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) for initialization and online reinforcement learning with Hybrid-Reasoning Grouped Policy Optimization (HGRPO) to learn adaptive reasoning.

Result: Fake-HR1 outperforms existing LLMs in reasoning and detection, enhancing efficiency without compromising performance.

Conclusion: Adaptive reasoning improves synthetic image detection, balancing resource usage and accuracy effectively.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the detection process can enhance a model's ability to detect synthetic images. However, excessively lengthy reasoning incurs substantial resource overhead, including token consumption and latency, which is particularly redundant when handling obviously generated forgeries. To address this issue, we propose Fake-HR1, a large-scale hybrid-reasoning model that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to adaptively determine whether reasoning is necessary based on the characteristics of the generative detection task. To achieve this, we design a two-stage training framework: we first perform Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) for cold-start initialization, followed by online reinforcement learning with Hybrid-Reasoning Grouped Policy Optimization (HGRPO) to implicitly learn when to select an appropriate reasoning mode. Experimental results show that Fake-HR1 adaptively performs reasoning across different types of queries, surpassing existing LLMs in both reasoning ability and generative detection performance, while significantly improving response efficiency.

*Gaurang Sharma,Harri Polonen,Juha Pajula,Jutta Suksi,Jussi Tohka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study shows that skull-stripped T1-weighted MRI scans can be linked to individuals using standard preprocessing and image similarity, posing privacy risks despite current regulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy risks in sharing MRI data, as even skull-stripped brain scans contain unique signatures that can re-identify individuals across databases.

Method: The researchers used standard preprocessing and image similarity computation to link skull-stripped T1-weighted MRI scans across different conditions.

Result: Nearly perfect linkage accuracy was achieved across various time intervals, scanner types, resolutions, and protocols, highlighting re-identification risks.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for updated policies to better protect privacy in medical data sharing.

Abstract: Head Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely collected and shared for research under strict regulatory frameworks. These frameworks require removing potential identifiers before sharing. But, even after skull stripping, the brain parenchyma contains unique signatures that can match other MRIs from the same participants across databases, posing a privacy risk if additional data features are available. Current regulatory frameworks often mandate evaluating such risks based on the assessment of a certain level of reasonableness. Prior studies have already suggested that a brain MRI could enable participant linkage, but they have relied on training-based or computationally intensive methods.
  Here, we demonstrate that linking an individual's skull-stripped T1-weighted MRI, which may lead to re-identification if other identifiers are available, is possible using standard preprocessing followed by image similarity computation. Nearly perfect linkage accuracy was achieved in matching data samples across various time intervals, scanner types, spatial resolutions, and acquisition protocols, despite potential cognitive decline, simulating MRI matching across databases. These results aim to contribute meaningfully to the development of thoughtful, forward-looking policies in medical data sharing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conformal prediction algorithm for instance segmentation to provide uncertainty quantification and adaptive confidence sets, outperforming existing baselines with provable guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instance segmentation models lack principled uncertainty quantification, leading to uncalibrated outputs and no guarantees on prediction accuracy relative to ground truth.

Method: The authors propose a conformal prediction algorithm that generates adaptive confidence sets for instance segmentation, ensuring provable guarantees for prediction accuracy (e.g., high IoU with ground truth).

Result: Empirical results show the algorithm's prediction sets adapt to query difficulty, achieve target coverage, and outperform baselines like Learn Then Test and Conformal Risk Control.

Conclusion: The introduced algorithm enhances instance segmentation with uncertainty quantification and reliable confidence sets, validated across diverse applications like agriculture and cell segmentation.

Abstract: Current instance segmentation models achieve high performance on average predictions, but lack principled uncertainty quantification: their outputs are not calibrated, and there is no guarantee that a predicted mask is close to the ground truth. To address this limitation, we introduce a conformal prediction algorithm to generate adaptive confidence sets for instance segmentation. Given an image and a pixel coordinate query, our algorithm generates a confidence set of instance predictions for that pixel, with a provable guarantee for the probability that at least one of the predictions has high Intersection-Over-Union (IoU) with the true object instance mask. We apply our algorithm to instance segmentation examples in agricultural field delineation, cell segmentation, and vehicle detection. Empirically, we find that our prediction sets vary in size based on query difficulty and attain the target coverage, outperforming existing baselines such as Learn Then Test, Conformal Risk Control, and morphological dilation-based methods. We provide versions of the algorithm with asymptotic and finite sample guarantees.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Spatio-Temporal Attention (STA) mechanism for video semantic segmentation, improving accuracy and stability by leveraging temporal consistency across frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models process video frames independently, missing temporal consistency benefits for accuracy in dynamic scenes.

Method: Extends transformer attention blocks with STA to incorporate multi-frame context, maintaining efficiency and requiring minimal architectural changes.

Result: STA improves temporal consistency by 9.20% and mean intersection over union by up to 1.76% on Cityscapes and BDD100k datasets.

Conclusion: STA is an effective architectural enhancement for video-based semantic segmentation, applicable across diverse transformer models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks, especially transformer-based architectures, have achieved remarkable success in semantic segmentation for environmental perception. However, existing models process video frames independently, thus failing to leverage temporal consistency, which could significantly improve both accuracy and stability in dynamic scenes. In this work, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention (STA) mechanism that extends transformer attention blocks to incorporate multi-frame context, enabling robust temporal feature representations for video semantic segmentation. Our approach modifies standard self-attention to process spatio-temporal feature sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and requiring minimal changes to existing architectures. STA demonstrates broad applicability across diverse transformer architectures and remains effective across both lightweight and larger-scale models. A comprehensive evaluation on the Cityscapes and BDD100k datasets shows substantial improvements of 9.20 percentage points in temporal consistency metrics and up to 1.76 percentage points in mean intersection over union compared to single-frame baselines. These results demonstrate STA as an effective architectural enhancement for video-based semantic segmentation applications.

*Soumyaroop Nandi,Prem Natarajan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Forensim is an attention-based state-space framework for image forgery detection that jointly localizes manipulated and source regions, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forgery detection methods focus only on manipulated areas, which can mislead interpretation. Forensim addresses this by jointly localizing source and target regions.

Method: Forensim uses a visual state-space model with normalized attention maps and a region-based block attention module for precise localization and end-to-end training.

Result: Forensim achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and introduces CMFD-Anything, a new dataset for copy-move forgery detection.

Conclusion: Forensim provides a unified solution for detecting spliced and copy-move forgeries with improved accuracy and context understanding.

Abstract: We introduce Forensim, an attention-based state-space framework for image forgery detection that jointly localizes both manipulated (target) and source regions. Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on artifact cues to detect spliced or forged areas, Forensim is designed to capture duplication patterns crucial for understanding context. In scenarios such as protest imagery, detecting only the forged region, for example a duplicated act of violence inserted into a peaceful crowd, can mislead interpretation, highlighting the need for joint source-target localization. Forensim outputs three-class masks (pristine, source, target) and supports detection of both splicing and copy-move forgeries within a unified architecture. We propose a visual state-space model that leverages normalized attention maps to identify internal similarities, paired with a region-based block attention module to distinguish manipulated regions. This design enables end-to-end training and precise localization. Forensim achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. We also release CMFD-Anything, a new dataset addressing limitations of existing copy-move forgery datasets.

TL;DR: 4RC is a unified feed-forward framework for dense 4D reconstruction from monocular videos, using a novel encode-once, query-anywhere approach with a transformer backbone and conditional decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods decouple motion from geometry or produce limited 4D attributes, while 4RC aims to jointly capture dense scene geometry and motion dynamics.

Method: 4RC introduces a transformer backbone to encode videos into a spatio-temporal latent space, enabling efficient querying of 3D geometry and motion at any timestamp via a conditional decoder. It minimally factorizes per-view 4D attributes into base geometry and time-dependent motion.

Result: 4RC outperforms prior and concurrent methods across various 4D reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: 4RC provides a holistic and efficient solution for dense 4D reconstruction, advancing beyond existing decoupled or limited approaches.

Abstract: We present 4RC, a unified feed-forward framework for 4D reconstruction from monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches that typically decouple motion from geometry or produce limited 4D attributes such as sparse trajectories or two-view scene flow, 4RC learns a holistic 4D representation that jointly captures dense scene geometry and motion dynamics. At its core, 4RC introduces a novel encode-once, query-anywhere and anytime paradigm: a transformer backbone encodes the entire video into a compact spatio-temporal latent space, from which a conditional decoder can efficiently query 3D geometry and motion for any query frame at any target timestamp. To facilitate learning, we represent per-view 4D attributes in a minimally factorized form by decomposing them into base geometry and time-dependent relative motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4RC outperforms prior and concurrent methods across a wide range of 4D reconstruction tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Separable Causal Diffusion (SCD) decouples temporal reasoning from denoising, improving efficiency without compromising quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current causal diffusion models inefficiently entangle temporal reasoning with iterative denoising.

Method: Probing autoregressive video diffusers reveals redundancies; SCD uses a causal transformer encoder for temporal reasoning and a lightweight diffusion decoder for rendering.

Result: SCD enhances throughput and latency while maintaining or exceeding baseline generation quality.

Conclusion: SCD offers a more efficient alternative to traditional causal diffusion models.

Abstract: Causality -- referring to temporal, uni-directional cause-effect relationships between components -- underlies many complex generative processes, including videos, language, and robot trajectories. Current causal diffusion models entangle temporal reasoning with iterative denoising, applying causal attention across all layers, at every denoising step, and over the entire context. In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and primarily perform intra-frame rendering. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Separable Causal Diffusion (SCD), a new architecture that explicitly decouples once-per-frame temporal reasoning, via a causal transformer encoder, from multi-step frame-wise rendering, via a lightweight diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on both pretraining and post-training tasks across synthetic and real benchmarks show that SCD significantly improves throughput and per-frame latency while matching or surpassing the generation quality of strong causal diffusion baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enable intelligent agents to learn transferable knowledge from unlabeled video data and apply it effectively in new environments.

Method: VideoWorld 2 uses a pretrained video diffusion model for visual appearance and dLDM to focus on task-related dynamics, modeling latent codes autoregressively for task policies and long-horizon reasoning.

Result: The model achieves significant improvements in task success rates (70%) and produces coherent long execution videos, demonstrating better performance in robotics tasks compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: VideoWorld 2 shows promising potential for learning transferable world knowledge directly from raw videos, contributing to advancements in AI and robotics.

Abstract: Learning transferable knowledge from unlabeled video data and applying it in new environments is a fundamental capability of intelligent agents. This work presents VideoWorld 2, which extends VideoWorld and offers the first investigation into learning transferable knowledge directly from raw real-world videos. At its core, VideoWorld 2 introduces a dynamic-enhanced Latent Dynamics Model (dLDM) that decouples action dynamics from visual appearance: a pretrained video diffusion model handles visual appearance modeling, enabling the dLDM to learn latent codes that focus on compact and meaningful task-related dynamics. These latent codes are then modeled autoregressively to learn task policies and support long-horizon reasoning. We evaluate VideoWorld 2 on challenging real-world handcraft making tasks, where prior video generation and latent-dynamics models struggle to operate reliably. Remarkably, VideoWorld 2 achieves up to 70% improvement in task success rate and produces coherent long execution videos. In robotics, we show that VideoWorld 2 can acquire effective manipulation knowledge from the Open-X dataset, which substantially improves task performance on CALVIN.

*Yuxin Jiang,Yuchao Gu,Ivor W. Tsang,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SeqΔ-REPA, a method to align latent actions across contexts by leveraging observable semantic effects, improving action transfer and adaptation efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling action-controllable world models is challenging due to scarce action labels and poor transferability of learned latent actions across contexts.

Method: The authors propose SeqΔ-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective, and Olaf-World, a pipeline pretraining action-conditioned video world models from passive video.

Result: Experiments show the method learns a more structured latent action space, enabling better zero-shot action transfer and data-efficient adaptation.

Conclusion: SeqΔ-REPA and Olaf-World address the limitations of latent action learning by aligning actions to observable semantic effects, improving scalability and adaptability.

Abstract: Scaling action-controllable world models is limited by the scarcity of action labels. While latent action learning promises to extract control interfaces from unlabeled video, learned latents often fail to transfer across contexts: they entangle scene-specific cues and lack a shared coordinate system. This occurs because standard objectives operate only within each clip, providing no mechanism to align action semantics across contexts. Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference. We introduce Seq$Δ$-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from a frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-World, a pipeline that pretrains action-conditioned video world models from large-scale passive video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method learns a more structured latent action space, leading to stronger zero-shot action transfer and more data-efficient adaptation to new control interfaces than state-of-the-art baselines.

*Mingyang Wu,Ashirbad Mishra,Soumik Dey,Shuo Xing,Naveen Ravipati,Hansi Wu,Binbin Li,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Image-to-Video generation (I2V) by introducing ConsIDVid, a dataset for multi-view consistency, and ConsID-Gen, a view-assisted framework for improved identity fidelity and temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing I2V pipelines struggle with appearance drift and geometric distortion due to sparse single-view observations and weak cross-modal alignment. The paper aims to solve these issues.

Method: The authors curate ConsIDVid, a large-scale dataset, and propose ConsID-Gen, which uses auxiliary views and a dual-stream encoder to fuse semantic and structural cues for better generation.

Result: ConsID-Gen outperforms leading models (e.g., Wan2.1, HunyuanVideo) in metrics for identity fidelity and temporal coherence on ConsIDVid-Bench.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and framework significantly improve I2V generation, preserving object identity and coherence under challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Image-to-Video generation (I2V) animates a static image into a temporally coherent video sequence following textual instructions, yet preserving fine-grained object identity under changing viewpoints remains a persistent challenge. Unlike text-to-video models, existing I2V pipelines often suffer from appearance drift and geometric distortion, artifacts we attribute to the sparsity of single-view 2D observations and weak cross-modal alignment. Here we address this problem from both data and model perspectives. First, we curate ConsIDVid, a large-scale object-centric dataset built with a scalable pipeline for high-quality, temporally aligned videos, and establish ConsIDVid-Bench, where we present a novel benchmarking and evaluation framework for multi-view consistency using metrics sensitive to subtle geometric and appearance deviations. We further propose ConsID-Gen, a view-assisted I2V generation framework that augments the first frame with unposed auxiliary views and fuses semantic and structural cues via a dual-stream visual-geometric encoder as well as a text-visual connector, yielding unified conditioning for a Diffusion Transformer backbone. Experiments across ConsIDVid-Bench demonstrate that ConsID-Gen consistently outperforms in multiple metrics, with the best overall performance surpassing leading video generation models like Wan2.1 and HunyuanVideo, delivering superior identity fidelity and temporal coherence under challenging real-world scenarios. We will release our model and dataset at https://myangwu.github.io/ConsID-Gen.

### [93] [Quantum Multiple Rotation Averaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10115)
*Shuteng Wang,Natacha Kuete Meli,Michael Möller,Vladislav Golyanik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IQARS (Iterative Quantum Annealing for Rotation Synchronization) is a novel quantum-based algorithm for Multiple Rotation Averaging (MRA), outperforming classical methods like Shonan by ~12% in accuracy on D-Wave annealers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical methods for MRA (e.g., L1-IRLS and Shonan) struggle with local minima and inaccurate manifold geometry preservation in high-noise scenarios. IQARS aims to address these limitations using quantum annealing.

Method: IQARS reformulates MRA as iterative quadratic non-convex sub-problems executable on quantum annealers, leveraging quantum tunneling and parallelism for efficient exploration.

Result: IQARS achieves ~12% higher accuracy than Shonan on D-Wave annealers, despite current hardware limitations in problem scale and performance.

Conclusion: IQARS demonstrates the potential of quantum annealing for MRA, offering improved accuracy over classical methods, though scalability remains limited by current quantum hardware.

Abstract: Multiple rotation averaging (MRA) is a fundamental optimization problem in 3D vision and robotics that aims to recover globally consistent absolute rotations from noisy relative measurements. Established classical methods, such as L1-IRLS and Shonan, face limitations including local minima susceptibility and reliance on convex relaxations that fail to preserve the exact manifold geometry, leading to reduced accuracy in high-noise scenarios. We introduce IQARS (Iterative Quantum Annealing for Rotation Synchronization), the first algorithm that reformulates MRA as a sequence of local quadratic non-convex sub-problems executable on quantum annealers after binarization, to leverage inherent hardware advantages. IQARS removes convex relaxation dependence and better preserves non-Euclidean rotation manifold geometry while leveraging quantum tunneling and parallelism for efficient solution space exploration. We evaluate IQARS's performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. While current annealers remain in their nascent phase and only support solving problems of limited scale with constrained performance, we observed that IQARS on D-Wave annealers can already achieve ca. 12% higher accuracy than Shonan, i.e., the best-performing classical method evaluated empirically.

TL;DR: SAGE is an agentic framework that generates scalable, realistic, and simulation-ready 3D environments for embodied AI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high cost and unsafety of real-world data collection, SAGE aims to create scalable and physically valid environments for training embodied agents.

Method: SAGE combines generators for layout and object composition with critics evaluating semantic plausibility, visual realism, and physical stability. It iteratively refines scenes through adaptive tool selection.

Result: Generated environments are realistic, diverse, and deployable in simulators. Policies trained on SAGE data show scaling trends and generalize to unseen objects and layouts.

Conclusion: SAGE demonstrates the potential of simulation-driven scaling for embodied AI, offering a practical solution for environment generation.

Abstract: Real-world data collection for embodied agents remains costly and unsafe, calling for scalable, realistic, and simulator-ready 3D environments. However, existing scene-generation systems often rely on rule-based or task-specific pipelines, yielding artifacts and physically invalid scenes. We present SAGE, an agentic framework that, given a user-specified embodied task (e.g., "pick up a bowl and place it on the table"), understands the intent and automatically generates simulation-ready environments at scale. The agent couples multiple generators for layout and object composition with critics that evaluate semantic plausibility, visual realism, and physical stability. Through iterative reasoning and adaptive tool selection, it self-refines the scenes until meeting user intent and physical validity. The resulting environments are realistic, diverse, and directly deployable in modern simulators for policy training. Policies trained purely on this data exhibit clear scaling trends and generalize to unseen objects and layouts, demonstrating the promise of simulation-driven scaling for embodied AI.

*Jaeyoon Choi,Nia Nixon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'inclusion analytics,' a discourse-based framework for measuring inclusion dynamically in collaborative problem-solving (CPS) along three dimensions: participation equity, affective climate, and epistemic equity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing inclusion in AI and education rely on coarse descriptors or self-reports, missing real-time dynamics. This paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors propose scalable, interaction-level measures for inclusion, tested using simulated conversations and empirical data from human-AI teaming experiments.

Result: The framework reveals patterns of participation, relational dynamics, and idea uptake that aggregate evaluations miss.

Conclusion: This work advances process-oriented approaches to measuring inclusion in human-AI collaborative learning.

Abstract: Inclusion, equity, and access are widely valued in AI and education, yet are often assessed through coarse sample descriptors or post-hoc self-reports that miss how inclusion is shaped moment by moment in collaborative problem solving (CPS). In this proof-of-concept paper, we introduce inclusion analytics, a discourse-based framework for examining inclusion as a dynamic, interactional process in CPS. We conceptualize inclusion along three complementary dimensions -- participation equity, affective climate, and epistemic equity -- and demonstrate how these constructs can be made analytically visible using scalable, interaction-level measures. Using both simulated conversations and empirical data from human-AI teaming experiments, we illustrate how inclusion analytics can surface patterns of participation, relational dynamics, and idea uptake that remain invisible to aggregate or post-hoc evaluations. This work represents an initial step toward process-oriented approaches to measuring inclusion in human-AI collaborative learning environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a topic continuity model for LLMs to maintain conversation coherence, outperforming traditional methods with interpretability and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of abrupt topic shifts in LLM-powered chatbots leads to poor user experiences and resource inefficiency.

Method: The model expands NLU into quantifiable terms using Naive Bayes, enhanced by attention mechanisms and logarithmic nonlinearity.

Result: The model handles any conversation length linearly and excels in detecting topic continuity, especially in complex dialogues.

Conclusion: The proposed model ensures responsible, interpretable LLM use, outperforming traditional approaches.

Abstract: Utilizing Large Language Models (LLM) as chatbots in diverse business scenarios often presents the challenge of maintaining topic continuity. Abrupt shifts in topics can lead to poor user experiences and inefficient utilization of computational resources. In this paper, we present a topic continuity model aimed at assessing whether a response aligns with the initial conversation topic. Our model is built upon the expansion of the corresponding natural language understanding (NLU) model into quantifiable terms using a Naive Bayes approach. Subsequently, we have introduced an attention mechanism and logarithmic nonlinearity to enhance its capability to capture topic continuity. This approach allows us to convert the NLU model into an interpretable analytical formula. In contrast to many NLU models constrained by token limits, our proposed model can seamlessly handle conversations of any length with linear time complexity. Furthermore, the attention mechanism significantly improves the model's ability to identify topic continuity in complex conversations. According to our experiments, our model consistently outperforms traditional methods, particularly in handling lengthy and intricate conversations. This unique capability offers us an opportunity to ensure the responsible and interpretable use of LLMs.

*Siyuan Huang,Ziyu Wang,Chao Pan,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FM SO.P improves SOP understanding by using progressive task mixtures and an automatic multi-agent evaluation system, achieving competitive results with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language models struggle with SOP understanding and cross-domain generalization due to unclear differentiation of required reasoning capabilities.

Method: Progressive task mixtures build capabilities in stages: concept disambiguation, action sequence understanding, and scenario-aware graph reasoning. An automatic multi-agent evaluation system adapts to domains.

Result: FM SO.P achieves 48.3% pass rate with a 32B model and 34.3% with a 7B model, matching a larger baseline model.

Conclusion: FM SO.P effectively addresses SOP challenges through staged capability building and adaptive evaluation, offering efficient performance.

Abstract: Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are critical for enterprise operations, yet existing language models struggle with SOP understanding and cross-domain generalization. Current methods fail because joint training cannot differentiate between reasoning capabilities that SOP requires: terminology precision, sequential ordering, and constraint reasoning. We propose FM SO.P, solving these challenges through two novelties. First, we introduce progressive task mixtures that build capabilities by stages across three task types with cumulative data: concept disambiguation for terminology precision, action sequence understanding for procedural correctness, and scenario-aware graph reasoning for conditional logic. Second, we propose an automatic multi-agent evaluation system consisting of three agents that adaptively generate rubrics, stratified test sets, and rubric scoring, adapting to domains (e.g., temporal constraints for DMV, regulatory compliance for banking). Evaluated on SOPBench across seven domains (Bank, DMV, Healthcare, Market, University, Library, Hotel), FM SO.P achieves 48.3\% pass rate with our 32B model and 34.3\% with our opensource 7B model, matching Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct baseline (34.4\%) with 10x fewer parameters.

*Jianfeng Zhu,Karin G. Coifman,Ruoming Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large-scale analysis of Reddit posts reveals five experiential dimensions of AI-related psychological risk, with self-regulation and fear being prominent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI-related psychological risks emerge and are regulated by users in real-world contexts.

Method: Used multi-agent, LLM-assisted thematic analysis on Reddit posts from AI-focused communities, supplemented with BERT-based emotion labeling.

Result: Identified 14 thematic categories synthesized into five experiential dimensions, with self-regulation difficulties and fear being most prevalent.

Conclusion: Provides empirical evidence on AI safety perceptions from user experiences, aiding future research and governance.

Abstract: Generative AI systems are increasingly embedded in everyday life, yet empirical understanding of how psychological risk associated with AI use emerges, is experienced, and is regulated by users remains limited. We present a large-scale computational thematic analysis of posts collected between 2023 and 2025 from two Reddit communities, r/AIDangers and r/ChatbotAddiction, explicitly focused on AI-related harm and distress. Using a multi-agent, LLM-assisted thematic analysis grounded in Braun and Clarke's reflexive framework, we identify 14 recurring thematic categories and synthesize them into five higher-order experiential dimensions. To further characterize affective patterns, we apply emotion labeling using a BERT-based classifier and visualize emotional profiles across dimensions. Our findings reveal five empirically derived experiential dimensions of AI-related psychological risk grounded in real-world user discourse, with self-regulation difficulties emerging as the most prevalent and fear concentrated in concerns related to autonomy, control, and technical risk. These results provide early empirical evidence from lived user experience of how AI safety is perceived and emotionally experienced outside laboratory or speculative contexts, offering a foundation for future AI safety research, evaluation, and responsible governance.

### [100] [Digital Linguistic Bias in Spanish: Evidence from Lexical Variation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09346)
*Yoshifumi Kawasaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates how well Large Language Models (LLMs) capture regional Spanish lexical variations, revealing systematic differences in their representation of dialects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand LLMs' dialectal knowledge of Spanish, a language with significant regional variation, and assess potential biases.

Method: Using expert-curated lexical data, the study employs Yes-No and multiple-choice questions to probe LLMs' knowledge across 21 Spanish-speaking countries.

Result: LLMs recognize lexical variations from certain regions (e.g., Spain, Mexico) more accurately than others (e.g., Chile). Data volume alone doesn't explain performance differences.

Conclusion: The work enhances understanding of dialectal representation in LLMs and highlights factors beyond data quantity influencing linguistic bias.

Abstract: This study examines the extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) capture geographic lexical variation in Spanish, a language that exhibits substantial regional variation. Treating LLMs as virtual informants, we probe their dialectal knowledge using two survey-style question formats: Yes-No questions and multiple-choice questions. To this end, we exploited a large-scale, expert-curated database of Spanish lexical variation. Our evaluation covers more than 900 lexical items across 21 Spanish-speaking countries and is conducted at both the country and dialectal area levels. Across both evaluation formats, the results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs represent Spanish language varieties. Lexical variation associated with Spain, Equatorial Guinea, Mexico & Central America, and the La Plata River is recognized more accurately by the models, while the Chilean variety proves particularly difficult for the models to distinguish. Importantly, differences in the volume of country-level digital resources do not account for these performance patterns, suggesting that factors beyond data quantity shape dialectal representation in LLMs. By providing a fine-grained, large-scale evaluation of geographic lexical variation, this work advances empirical understanding of dialectal knowledge in LLMs and contributes new evidence to discussions of Digital Linguistic Bias in Spanish.

*Jianyu Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unsupervised cross-lingual POS tagging framework using monolingual corpora and UNMT, achieving results comparable to parallel-corpus-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of parallel corpora for low-resource languages in POS tagging.

Method: Leverages UNMT to create pseudo-parallel sentences, then uses word alignment for POS tag projection and introduces multi-source projection for calibration.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to baseline with parallel corpora, surpassing it in some cases; multi-source projection improves accuracy by 1.3%.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for low-resource languages without parallel corpora, with multi-source projection enhancing performance.

Abstract: Due to the scarcity of part-of-speech annotated data, existing studies on low-resource languages typically adopt unsupervised approaches for POS tagging. Among these, POS tag projection with word alignment method transfers POS tags from a high-resource source language to a low-resource target language based on parallel corpora, making it particularly suitable for low-resource language settings. However, this approach relies heavily on parallel corpora, which are often unavailable for many low-resource languages. To overcome this limitation, we propose a fully unsupervised cross-lingual part-of-speech(POS) tagging framework that relies solely on monolingual corpora by leveraging unsupervised neural machine translation(UNMT) system. This UNMT system first translates sentences from a high-resource language into a low-resource one, thereby constructing pseudo-parallel sentence pairs. Then, we train a POS tagger for the target language following the standard projection procedure based on word alignments. Moreover, we propose a multi-source projection technique to calibrate the projected POS tags on the target side, enhancing to train a more effective POS tagger. We evaluate our framework on 28 language pairs, covering four source languages (English, German, Spanish and French) and seven target languages (Afrikaans, Basque, Finnis, Indonesian, Lithuanian, Portuguese and Turkish). Experimental results show that our method can achieve performance comparable to the baseline cross-lingual POS tagger with parallel sentence pairs, and even exceeds it for certain target languages. Furthermore, our proposed multi-source projection technique further boosts performance, yielding an average improvement of 1.3% over previous methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgentSkiller is an automated framework for generating high-quality, multi-turn interaction data to improve large language model agents, showing significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for data collection in large language model agents are limited by privacy constraints or lack diversity, hindering generalist intelligence.

Method: AgentSkiller uses a DAG-based architecture, domain ontology, Person-Centric Entity Graph, and cross-domain fusion to simulate complex tasks, ensuring determinism and recoverability.

Result: The framework produced ~11K interaction samples, and models trained on this data showed significant improvements in function calling, especially for larger models.

Conclusion: AgentSkiller effectively addresses the data scarcity issue for scaling large language model capabilities, demonstrating practical improvements in agent performance.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents demonstrate potential in solving real-world problems via tools, yet generalist intelligence is bottlenecked by scarce high-quality, long-horizon data. Existing methods collect privacy-constrained API logs or generate scripted interactions lacking diversity, which struggle to produce data requisite for scaling capabilities. We propose AgentSkiller, a fully automated framework synthesizing multi-turn interaction data across realistic, semantically linked domains. It employs a DAG-based architecture with explicit state transitions to ensure determinism and recoverability. The pipeline builds a domain ontology and Person-Centric Entity Graph, defines tool interfaces via Service Blueprints for Model Context Protocol servers, and populates environments with consistent databases and strict Domain Policies. A cross-domain fusion mechanism links services to simulate complex tasks. Finally, the pipeline creates user tasks by verifying solution paths, filtering via execution-based validation, and generating queries using a Persona-based Simulator for automated rollout. This produces reliable environments with clear state changes. To demonstrate effectiveness, we synthesized $\approx$ 11K interaction samples; experimental results indicate that models trained on this dataset achieve significant improvements on function calling over baselines, particularly in larger parameter regimes.

Abstract: In this work, we present AfriNLLB, a series of lightweight models for efficient translation from and into African languages. AfriNLLB supports 15 language pairs (30 translation directions), including Swahili, Hausa, Yoruba, Amharic, Somali, Zulu, Lingala, Afrikaans, Wolof, and Egyptian Arabic, as well as other African Union official languages such as Arabic (MSA), French, Portuguese, and Spanish. Our training data covers bidirectional translation between English and 13 languages, and between French and two languages (Lingala and Wolof).
  AfriNLLB models are based on NLLB-200 600M, which we compress using iterative layer pruning and quantization. We fine-tune the pruned models on parallel corpora we curated for African languages, employing knowledge distillation from a larger teacher model. Our work aims at enabling efficient deployment of translation models for African languages in resource-constrained settings.
  Our evaluation results demonstrate that AfriNLLB models achieve performance comparable to the baseline while being significantly faster. We release two versions of the AfriNLLB models, a Transformers version that allows further fine-tuning and a CTranslate2 version for efficient inference. Moreover, we release all the training data that we used for fine-tuning the baseline and pruned models to facilitate further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiasScope is a framework for discovering potential biases in LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, validated on JudgeBench and leading to JudgeBench-Pro, a more challenging benchmark revealing high error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of automated exploration of unknown biases in LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, enhancing robustness and reliability.

Method: Proposes BiasScope, an LLM-driven framework for systematic bias discovery across model families and scales.

Result: BiasScope generates JudgeBench-Pro, where even powerful LLMs show >50% error rates, highlighting evaluation robustness issues.

Conclusion: The framework advances bias discovery from manual to automated, emphasizing the need for stronger evaluation robustness.

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has been widely adopted across various research and practical applications, yet the robustness and reliability of its evaluation remain a critical issue. A core challenge it faces is bias, which has primarily been studied in terms of known biases and their impact on evaluation outcomes, while automated and systematic exploration of potential unknown biases is still lacking. Nevertheless, such exploration is crucial for enhancing the robustness and reliability of evaluations. To bridge this gap, we propose BiasScope, a LLM-driven framework for automatically and at scale discovering potential biases that may arise during model evaluation. BiasScope can uncover potential biases across different model families and scales, with its generality and effectiveness validated on the JudgeBench dataset. It overcomes the limitations of existing approaches, transforming bias discovery from a passive process relying on manual effort and predefined bias lists into an active and comprehensive automated exploration. Moreover, based on BiasScope, we propose JudgeBench-Pro, an extended version of JudgeBench and a more challenging benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLM-as-a-judge. Strikingly, even powerful LLMs as evaluators show error rates above 50\% on JudgeBench-Pro, underscoring the urgent need to strengthen evaluation robustness and to mitigate potential biases further.

### [105] [Contractual Deepfakes: Can Large Language Models Generate Contracts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09384)
*Eliza Mik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs generate text but lack understanding, context, and reasoning, making them unsuitable for drafting contracts despite claims to the contrary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the idea that LLMs can effectively draft contracts, highlighting their limitations.

Method: Analyzing the differences between LLM-generated text and legally sound contract drafting.

Result: LLMs produce generic, inconsistent, or unsuitable contracts, not legally viable documents.

Conclusion: LLMs do not pose a threat to the legal industry due to their inability to reason or understand legal nuances.

Abstract: Notwithstanding their unprecedented ability to generate text, LLMs do not understand the meaning of words, have no sense of context and cannot reason. Their output constitutes an approximation of statistically dominant word patterns. And yet, the drafting of contracts is often presented as a typical legal task that could be facilitated by this technology. This paper seeks to put an end to such unreasonable ideas. Predicting words differs from using language in the circumstances of specific transactions and reconstituting common contractual phrases differs from reasoning about the law. LLMs seem to be able to generate generic and superficially plausible contractual documents. In the cold light of day, such documents may turn out to be useless assemblages of inconsistent provisions or contracts that are enforceable but unsuitable for a given transaction. This paper casts a shadow on the simplistic assumption that LLMs threaten the continued viability of the legal industry.

*Jianyu Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to extend multilingual pre-trained language models (mPLMs) to low-resource languages by expanding vocabulary and using bilingual dictionaries for initialization, improving performance in POS tagging and NER tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in extending mPLMs to previously unsupported low-resource languages, the authors focus on vocabulary expansion and representation initialization.

Method: The method involves expanding the model's vocabulary using a target language corpus, screening biased subsets, initializing expanded vocabulary with bilingual dictionaries, and continued pre-training.

Result: The method outperforms the baseline (random initialization) by 0.54% in POS tagging and 2.60% in NER tasks, showing robustness and no degradation in source language performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively extends mPLMs to low-resource languages, improving performance without compromising the source language's capabilities.

Abstract: Multilingual pre-trained language models(mPLMs) offer significant benefits for many low-resource languages. To further expand the range of languages these models can support, many works focus on continued pre-training of these models. However, few works address how to extend mPLMs to low-resource languages that were previously unsupported. To tackle this issue, we expand the model's vocabulary using a target language corpus. We then screen out a subset from the model's original vocabulary, which is biased towards representing the source language(e.g. English), and utilize bilingual dictionaries to initialize the representations of the expanded vocabulary. Subsequently, we continue to pre-train the mPLMs using the target language corpus, based on the representations of these expanded vocabulary. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline, which uses randomly initialized expanded vocabulary for continued pre-training, in POS tagging and NER tasks, achieving improvements by 0.54% and 2.60%, respectively. Furthermore, our method demonstrates high robustness in selecting the training corpora, and the models' performance on the source language does not degrade after continued pre-training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether LLMs exhibit human-like moral biases influenced by irrelevant situational factors, using a dataset of 60 'moral distractors' to test LLM responses in moral benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if LLMs, like humans, are susceptible to morally irrelevant situational factors, challenging assumptions of stable moral preferences in LLMs.

Method: Curated a multimodal dataset of 60 'moral distractors' (emotionally charged but morally irrelevant stimuli) and injected them into existing moral benchmarks to observe shifts in LLM moral judgments.

Result: Moral distractors shifted LLM moral judgments by over 30%, even in low-ambiguity scenarios, indicating significant situational bias.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of contextual moral evaluations and more nuanced cognitive moral modeling for LLMs.

Abstract: With the rapid development and uptake of large language models (LLMs) across high-stakes settings, it is increasingly important to ensure that LLMs behave in ways that align with human values. Existing moral benchmarks prompt LLMs with value statements, moral scenarios, or psychological questionnaires, with the implicit underlying assumption that LLMs report somewhat stable moral preferences. However, moral psychology research has shown that human moral judgements are sensitive to morally irrelevant situational factors, such as smelling cinnamon rolls or the level of ambient noise, thereby challenging moral theories that assume the stability of human moral judgements. Here, we draw inspiration from this "situationist" view of moral psychology to evaluate whether LLMs exhibit similar cognitive moral biases to humans. We curate a novel multimodal dataset of 60 "moral distractors" from existing psychological datasets of emotionally-valenced images and narratives which have no moral relevance to the situation presented. After injecting these distractors into existing moral benchmarks to measure their effects on LLM responses, we find that moral distractors can shift the moral judgements of LLMs by over 30% even in low-ambiguity scenarios, highlighting the need for more contextual moral evaluations and more nuanced cognitive moral modeling of LLMs.

*Taewoong Yoon,Geunyeong Jeong,Geon Park,Sihyeong Yeom,Harksoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACTSC reduces inference costs in Self-Consistency by using internal neuron activations for difficulty estimation, avoiding extra model calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DSC add computational overhead by requiring pre-sampling for difficulty estimation. ACTSC aims to eliminate this overhead.

Method: ACTSC uses feed-forward network neuron activations to estimate problem difficulty dynamically, adjusting the number of samples for Self-Consistency without extra model calls.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks show ACTSC maintains accuracy while reducing inference costs compared to DSC and SC.

Conclusion: ACTSC is a lightweight, efficient alternative to DSC for difficulty-aware Self-Consistency, reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Self-Consistency (SC) is an effective decoding strategy that improves the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by generating multiple chain-of-thought reasoning paths and selecting the final answer via majority voting. However, it suffers from substantial inference costs because it requires a large number of samples. To mitigate this issue, Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency (DSC) was proposed to reduce unnecessary token usage for easy problems by adjusting the number of samples according to problem difficulty. However, DSC requires additional model calls and pre-sampling to estimate difficulty, and this process is repeated when applying to each dataset, leading to significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose Activation-Informed Difficulty-Aware Self-Consistency (ACTSC) to address these limitations. ACTSC leverages internal difficulty signals reflected in the feed-forward network neuron activations to construct a lightweight difficulty estimation probe, without any additional token generation or model calls. The probe dynamically adjusts the number of samples for SC and can be applied to new datasets without requiring pre-sampling for difficulty estimation. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on five benchmarks. Experimental results show that ACTSC effectively reduces inference costs while maintaining accuracy relative to existing methods.

### [109] [Evaluating Social Bias in RAG Systems: When External Context Helps and Reasoning Hurts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09442)
*Shweta Parihar,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates social biases in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, finding that RAG reduces bias by incorporating external context, but Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting increases bias despite improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fairness concerns due to social biases in LLMs, especially in RAG architectures, which retrieve external knowledge.

Method: Extensive experiments across retrieval corpora, LLMs, and bias datasets (13+ bias types), integrating CoT prompting into RAG.

Result: RAG reduces bias by diversifying contextual grounding, while CoT increases bias despite enhancing accuracy.

Conclusion: Bias-aware reasoning frameworks are needed to balance accuracy and fairness in RAG and CoT applications.

Abstract: Social biases inherent in large language models (LLMs) raise significant fairness concerns. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, which retrieve external knowledge sources to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs, remain susceptible to the same bias-related challenges. This work focuses on evaluating and understanding the social bias implications of RAG. Through extensive experiments across various retrieval corpora, LLMs, and bias evaluation datasets, encompassing more than 13 different bias types, we surprisingly observe a reduction in bias in RAG. This suggests that the inclusion of external context can help counteract stereotype-driven predictions, potentially improving fairness by diversifying the contextual grounding of the model's outputs. To better understand this phenomenon, we then explore the model's reasoning process by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting into RAG while assessing the faithfulness of the model's CoT. Our experiments reveal that the model's bias inclinations shift between stereotype and anti-stereotype responses as more contextual information is incorporated from the retrieved documents. Interestingly, we find that while CoT enhances accuracy, contrary to the bias reduction observed with RAG, it increases overall bias across datasets, highlighting the need for bias-aware reasoning frameworks that can mitigate this trade-off.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Conceptual Cultural Index (CCI) to measure cultural specificity in sentences, validated on 400 sentences with promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) lack systematic evaluation of cultural specificity at the sentence level.

Method: Proposes CCI, comparing generality estimates within a target culture vs. others, validated on 200 culture-specific and 200 general sentences.

Result: CCI outperforms direct LLM scoring, showing higher scores for culture-specific sentences and improving AUC by over 10 points.

Conclusion: CCI provides an interpretable and operational method for assessing cultural specificity in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multicultural settings; however, systematic evaluation of cultural specificity at the sentence level remains underexplored. We propose the Conceptual Cultural Index (CCI), which estimates cultural specificity at the sentence level. CCI is defined as the difference between the generality estimate within the target culture and the average generality estimate across other cultures. This formulation enables users to operationally control the scope of culture via comparison settings and provides interpretability, since the score derives from the underlying generality estimates. We validate CCI on 400 sentences (200 culture-specific and 200 general), and the resulting score distribution exhibits the anticipated pattern: higher for culture-specific sentences and lower for general ones. For binary separability, CCI outperforms direct LLM scoring, yielding more than a 10-point improvement in AUC for models specialized to the target culture.

Result: Achieved 0.94 F1 and 0.97 precision for Trigger Detection, and 0.91 F1 for Argument Detection.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively addresses toxic substance detection in clinical NLP, demonstrating strong performance.

Abstract: Extracting drug use information from unstructured Electronic Health Records remains a major challenge in clinical Natural Language Processing. While Large Language Models demonstrate advancements, their use in clinical NLP is limited by concerns over trust, control, and efficiency. To address this, we present NOWJ submission to the ToxHabits Shared Task at BioCreative IX. This task targets the detection of toxic substance use and contextual attributes in Spanish clinical texts, a domain-specific, low-resource setting. We propose a multi-output ensemble system tackling both Subtask 1 - ToxNER and Subtask 2 - ToxUse. Our system integrates BETO with a CRF layer for sequence labeling, employs diverse training strategies, and uses sentence filtering to boost precision.

TL;DR: CoCoA decoder mitigates hallucinations in LLMs by analyzing internal layer instability, improving factual correctness without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of LLMs generating incorrect but fluent text (hallucinations), leveraging internal layer signals for factual accuracy.

Method: Proposes CoCoA decoder with metrics for representational instability in middle layers and CoCoA-SIG variant for dynamic penalty modulation.

Result: CoCoA significantly enhances factual correctness across tasks like QA, summarization, and code generation in various LLM families.

Conclusion: CoCoA is a training-free, broadly applicable solution for improving LLM trustworthiness at inference time.

Abstract: Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent yet factually incorrect text-a phenomenon known as hallucinations, undermining their reliability and utility in downstream tasks. We hypothesize that a generated text span's factuality is correlated with its representational instability across the model's internal layers. Based on this, we propose the CoCoA (Confusion and Consistency Aware) decoder, a novel, training-free decoding algorithm that mitigates hallucinations at inference time by listening to these signals in the middle layers. We propose two metrics to quantify this instability in the middle layers, and use it to penalize outputs that exhibit high internal confusion, thereby steering the model towards more internally consistent and factually grounded outputs. We further propose a self-information gated variant, CoCoA-SIG, that dynamically modulates this penalty to selectively target high-surprise, unstable generations. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including question-answering, summarization and code generation demonstrate that CoCoA significantly improves factual correctness across multiple model families (e.g., Llama-3, Qwen-2.5, Mistral). By leveraging model-intrinsic signals, CoCoA offers an effective and broadly applicable method for enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs at inference time, without requiring any model retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) generate text by iteratively filling masked tokens, requiring two coupled decisions at each step: which positions to unmask (where-to-unmask) and which tokens to place (what-to-unmask). While standard MDLM training directly optimizes token prediction (what-to-unmask), inference-time unmasking orders (where-to-unmask) are typically determined by heuristic confidence measures or trained through reinforcement learning with costly on-policy rollouts. To address this, we introduce Gt-Margin, a position-wise score derived from ground-truth tokens, defined as the probability margin between the correct token and its strongest alternative. Gt-Margin yields an oracle unmasking order that prioritizes easier positions first under each partially masked state. We demonstrate that leveraging this oracle unmasking order significantly enhances final generation quality, particularly on logical reasoning benchmarks. Building on this insight, we train a supervised unmasking planner via learning-to-rank to imitate the oracle ordering from masked contexts. The resulting planner integrates into standard MDLM sampling to select where-to-unmask, improving reasoning accuracy without modifying the token prediction model.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EcoGym, a benchmark for evaluating long-horizon planning in LLM-based agents across diverse economic environments, revealing suboptimal performance in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation frameworks for autonomous agents lack generalizability and grounding in persistent economic dynamics, limiting their effectiveness for long-term planning.

Method: EcoGym offers three environments (Vending, Freelance, Operation) with standardized decision-making processes and metrics like net worth and income, tested over 1000+ steps.

Result: Experiments with eleven leading LLMs show no single model excels across all scenarios, highlighting weaknesses in strategic coherence and execution efficiency.

Conclusion: EcoGym serves as an open, extensible testbed for evaluating long-horizon agent performance and exploring trade-offs in economic settings.

Abstract: Long-horizon planning is widely recognized as a core capability of autonomous LLM-based agents; however, current evaluation frameworks suffer from being largely episodic, domain-specific, or insufficiently grounded in persistent economic dynamics. We introduce EcoGym, a generalizable benchmark for continuous plan-and-execute decision making in interactive economies. EcoGym comprises three diverse environments: Vending, Freelance, and Operation, implemented in a unified decision-making process with standardized interfaces, and budgeted actions over an effectively unbounded horizon (1000+ steps if 365 day-loops for evaluation). The evaluation of EcoGym is based on business-relevant outcomes (e.g., net worth, income, and DAU), targeting long-term strategic coherence and robustness under partial observability and stochasticity. Experiments across eleven leading LLMs expose a systematic tension: no single model dominates across all three scenarios. Critically, we find that models exhibit significant suboptimality in either high-level strategies or efficient actions executions. EcoGym is released as an open, extensible testbed for transparent long-horizon agent evaluation and for studying controllability-utility trade-offs in realistic economic settings.

TL;DR: SAKE is a training-free method to combat Knowledge Integration Decay (KID) in LLMs by anchoring retrieved knowledge at the start and end of reasoning, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the overlooked bottleneck of KID in LLMs, where models fail to integrate retrieved evidence effectively as reasoning chains grow longer.

Method: The authors propose SAKE, which anchors retrieved knowledge at both the beginning and end of the reasoning process to maintain its relevance and integrity.

Result: SAKE significantly reduces KID and enhances performance on multi-hop QA and complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: SAKE provides a lightweight, effective solution for improving knowledge integration in LLMs without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks by employing search-augmented reasoning to incorporate external knowledge into long chains of thought. However, we identify a critical yet underexplored bottleneck in this paradigm, termed Knowledge Integration Decay (KID). Specifically, we observe that as the length of reasoning generated before search grows, models increasingly fail to integrate retrieved evidence into subsequent reasoning steps, limiting performance even when relevant information is available. To address this, we propose Self-Anchored Knowledge Encoding (SAKE), a training-free inference-time strategy designed to stabilize knowledge utilization. By anchoring retrieved knowledge at both the beginning and end of the reasoning process, SAKE prevents it from being overshadowed by prior context, thereby preserving its semantic integrity. Extensive experiments on multi-hop QA and complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SAKE significantly mitigates KID and improves performance, offering a lightweight yet effective solution for knowledge integration in agentic LLMs.

TL;DR: MoSLoRA and UniARM address multi-objective alignment issues in LLMs by mitigating feature entanglement and enabling precise preference control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-objective alignment suffer from neglecting interactions or causing feature entanglement, leading to misaligned outputs.

Method: Proposes MoSLoRA for ARM training (shared features with preference modulation) and UniARM framework (jointly modeling preferences in a single parameter space).

Result: Enables precise control over preference trade-offs and eliminates the need for independent parameters per objective.

Conclusion: MoSLoRA and UniARM improve multi-objective alignment by addressing feature entanglement and enhancing preference modeling.

Abstract: Multi-objective alignment aims to align LLM responses with multiple human preference objectives. Among existing methods, guiding the generation of frozen LLMs through autoregressive reward models (ARMs) to accomplish multi-objective test-time alignment is a low-cost solution. However, these methods typically rely on independent parameters for each preference objective, either by training ARMs independently across preference dimensions, which neglects interactions among preference features, or by training a single ARM with separate feature extraction modules for each preference, which can cause feature entanglement. Both strategies can result in misalignment between generated outputs and user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Preference-Modulated \& Shared Low-Rank Adaptation (MoSLoRA) for ARM training, which first extracts shared features via a preference-agnostic module and then applies affine transformations to shared features via a preference modulation module conditioned on mixed preference vectors. This design mitigates feature entanglement and enables precise control over preference trade-offs during inference. Building on this, we introduce the Unified Autoregressive Reward Model (UniARM), a novel framework for multi-objective test-time alignment. UniARM jointly models all preference dimensions in a single parameter space, eliminating the need for independent parameters for each preference objective. es on larger-scale LLMs, enhancing its practical usability.

TL;DR: This paper systematically compares retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods for multi-turn conversational QA, finding that simpler methods outperform advanced ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of systematic comparison of RAG methods in multi-turn conversational QA, where dialogue history and shifting user intent complicate retrieval, motivates this study.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive empirical study of RAG methods using eight conversational QA datasets, evaluating retrieval quality and answer generation.

Result: Simple methods like reranking and hybrid BM25 outperform advanced RAG techniques, which can even degrade performance below baseline.

Conclusion: Effective conversational RAG depends on aligning retrieval strategy with dataset structure rather than method complexity.

Abstract: Conversational question answering increasingly relies on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language models (LLMs) in external knowledge. Yet, most existing studies evaluate RAG methods in isolation and primarily focus on single-turn settings. This paper addresses the lack of a systematic comparison of RAG methods for multi-turn conversational QA, where dialogue history, coreference, and shifting user intent substantially complicate retrieval. We present a comprehensive empirical study of vanilla and advanced RAG methods across eight diverse conversational QA datasets spanning multiple domains. Using a unified experimental setup, we evaluate retrieval quality and answer generation using generator and retrieval metrics, and analyze how performance evolves across conversation turns. Our results show that robust yet straightforward methods, such as reranking, hybrid BM25, and HyDE, consistently outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, several advanced techniques fail to yield gains and can even degrade performance below the No-RAG baseline. We further demonstrate that dataset characteristics and dialogue length strongly influence retrieval effectiveness, explaining why no single RAG strategy dominates across settings. Overall, our findings indicate that effective conversational RAG depends less on method complexity than on alignment between the retrieval strategy and the dataset structure. We publish the code used.\footnote{\href{https://github.com/Klejda-A/exp-rag.git}{GitHub Repository}}

Motivation: Existing BDLMs struggle with test-time scaling and balancing decoding speed-effectiveness in long Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Method: Proposes BACD for adaptive decoding and TCCF for block-wise generation, with Progressive Block Size Extension for large blocks.

Result: BACD and TCCF applied to TDAR-8B achieve 2.26x speedup and +11.2 points on AIME24 over baselines.

Conclusion: The framework unlocks BDLMs' potential for test-time scaling in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in block diffusion language models have demonstrated competitive performance and strong scalability on reasoning tasks. However, existing BDLMs have limited exploration under the test-time scaling setting and face more severe decoding challenges in long Chain-of-Thought reasoning, particularly in balancing the decoding speed and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a unified framework for test-time scaling in BDLMs that introduces adaptivity in both decoding and block-wise generation. At the decoding level, we propose Bounded Adaptive Confidence Decoding (BACD), a difficulty-aware sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts denoising based on model confidence, accelerating inference while controlling error accumulation. Beyond step-wise adaptivity, we introduce Think Coarse, Critic Fine (TCCF), a test-time scaling paradigm that allocates large block sizes to exploratory reasoning and smaller block sizes to refinement, achieving an effective efficiency-effectiveness balance. To enable efficient and effective decoding with a large block size, we adopt Progressive Block Size Extension, which mitigates performance degradation when scaling block sizes. Extensive experiments show that applying BACD and TCCF to TDAR-8B yields significant improvements over strong baselines such as TraDo-8B (2.26x speedup, +11.2 points on AIME24). These results mark an important step toward unlocking the potential of BDLMs for test-time scaling in complex reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like unreliable retrieval and lack of domain-adapted models in multilingual legal settings.

Method: Constructing LEMUR corpus from EUR-Lex PDFs, fine-tuning multilingual embedding models using contrastive objectives.

Result: Legal-domain fine-tuning improves Top-k retrieval accuracy, with significant gains for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning enhances language-independent legal representations, benefiting retrieval across languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to access legal information. Yet, their deployment in multilingual legal settings is constrained by unreliable retrieval and the lack of domain-adapted, open-embedding models. In particular, existing multilingual legal corpora are not designed for semantic retrieval, and PDF-based legislative sources introduce substantial noise due to imperfect text extraction. To address these challenges, we introduce LEMUR, a large-scale multilingual corpus of EU environmental legislation constructed from 24,953 official EUR-Lex PDF documents covering 25 languages. We quantify the fidelity of PDF-to-text conversion by measuring lexical consistency against authoritative HTML versions using the Lexical Content Score (LCS). Building on LEMUR, we fine-tune three state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models using contrastive objectives in both monolingual and bilingual settings, reflecting realistic legal-retrieval scenarios. Experiments across low- and high-resource languages demonstrate that legal-domain fine-tuning consistently improves Top-k retrieval accuracy relative to strong baselines, with particularly pronounced gains for low-resource languages. Cross-lingual evaluations show that these improvements transfer to unseen languages, indicating that fine-tuning primarily enhances language-independent, content-level legal representations rather than language-specific cues.

TL;DR: BG-MCTS is a budget-aware tree-search algorithm for LLMs that optimizes exploration and refinement to avoid late-stage over-branching, outperforming budget-agnostic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tree-search policies ignore budget constraints, leading to inefficiencies like over-branching or premature termination. BG-MCTS aims to address this by dynamically adjusting its search strategy.

Method: BG-MCTS aligns its search policy with the remaining token budget, starting with broad exploration and shifting to refinement and completion as the budget depletes.

Result: BG-MCTS outperforms budget-agnostic baselines on MATH500 and AIME24/25 datasets with open-weight LLMs across varying budgets.

Conclusion: Budget-aware tree-search decoding, as implemented in BG-MCTS, improves efficiency and performance in real-world LLM deployments with fixed token budgets.

Abstract: Tree-search decoding is an effective form of test-time scaling for large language models (LLMs), but real-world deployment imposes a fixed per-query token budget that varies across settings. Existing tree-search policies are largely budget-agnostic, treating the budget as a termination condition, which can lead to late-stage over-branching or premature termination. We propose {Budget-Guided MCTS} (BG-MCTS), a tree-search decoding algorithm that aligns its search policy with the remaining token budget: it starts with broad exploration, then prioritizes refinement and answer completion as the budget depletes while reducing late-stage branching from shallow nodes. BG-MCTS consistently outperforms budget-agnostic tree-search baselines across different budgets on MATH500 and AIME24/25 with open-weight LLMs.

TL;DR: Context-CDA, a context-augmented counterfactual data augmentation method, mitigates social bias in fine-tuned language models without harming language modeling performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between reducing social bias and maintaining language modeling capability in fine-tuned models, as existing methods like CDA may produce poor-quality or simplistic counterfactuals.

Method: Proposes Context-CDA, which uses large LMs to enhance counterfactual data diversity and contextual relevance, followed by uncertainty-based filtering to improve corpus quality.

Result: Effective mitigation of gender bias without compromising language modeling performance, demonstrated on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Context-CDA balances bias mitigation and model performance, offering insights into social biases through distribution shifts in token probabilities.

Abstract: A challenge in mitigating social bias in fine-tuned language models (LMs) is the potential reduction in language modeling capability, which can harm downstream performance. Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA), a widely used method for fine-tuning, highlights this issue by generating synthetic data that may align poorly with real-world distributions or creating overly simplistic counterfactuals that ignore the social context of altered sensitive attributes (e.g., gender) in the pretraining corpus. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective context-augmented CDA method, Context-CDA, which uses large LMs to enhance the diversity and contextual relevance of the debiasing corpus. By minimizing discrepancies between the debiasing corpus and pretraining data through augmented context, this approach ensures better alignment, enhancing language modeling capability. We then employ uncertainty-based filtering to exclude generated counterfactuals considered low-quality by the target smaller LMs (i.e., LMs to be debiased), further improving the fine-tuning corpus quality.

*Daisuke Nohara,Taishi Nakamura,Rio Yokota*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how reinforcement learning affects reasoning in large language models, focusing on balancing output length for efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the optimal output length for balancing computational efficiency and reasoning performance in RL-trained models.

Method: Comparison of length control methods on Qwen3-1.7B Base and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B models.

Result: Length penalties hinder reasoning, while tuned length control improves efficiency for models with strong prior reasoning. Two failure modes identified: long outputs increase dispersion, and short outputs lead to under-thinking.

Conclusion: Properly tuned length control is crucial for optimizing efficiency and reasoning performance in RL-trained models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning substantially improves reasoning in large language models, but it also tends to lengthen chain of thought outputs and increase computational cost during both training and inference. Though length control methods have been proposed, it remains unclear what the optimal output length is for balancing efficiency and performance. In this work, we compare several length control methods on two models, Qwen3-1.7B Base and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Our results indicate that length penalties may hinder reasoning acquisition, while properly tuned length control can improve efficiency for models with strong prior reasoning. By extending prior work to RL trained policies, we identify two failure modes, 1) long outputs increase dispersion, and 2) short outputs lead to under-thinking.

TL;DR: ELPO improves LLM agent performance by localizing irrecoverable errors and optimizing credit assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses sparse rewards and weak credit assignment in outcome-only reinforcement learning for TIR.

Method: Uses binary-search rollout trees, hierarchical advantage attribution, and adaptive clipping.

Result: Outperforms baselines in math, science QA, and code execution benchmarks.

Conclusion: ELPO enhances efficiency and accuracy in long-horizon TIR tasks.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) enables LLM agents to solve tasks through planning, tool use, and iterative revision, but outcome-only reinforcement learning in this setting suffers from sparse, delayed rewards and weak step-level credit assignment. In long-horizon TIR trajectories, an early irrecoverable mistake can determine success or failure, making it crucial to localize the first irrecoverable step and leverage it for fine-grained credit assignment. We propose Error-Localized Policy Optimization (ELPO), which localizes the first irrecoverable step via binary-search rollout trees under a fixed rollout budget, converts the resulting tree into stable learning signals through hierarchical advantage attribution, and applies error-localized adaptive clipping to strengthen corrective updates on the critical step and its suffix. Across TIR benchmarks in math, science QA, and code execution, ELPO consistently outperforms strong Agentic RL baselines under comparable sampling budgets, with additional gains in Pass@K and Major@K scaling, rollout ranking quality, and tool-call efficiency. Our code will be publicly released soon.

Result: The toolkit enables controlled comparisons and reproducible alignment experiments by isolating backend-specific logic behind a single factory boundary.

Conclusion: AlignTune effectively standardizes and simplifies alignment workflows, addressing key obstacles in alignment research for LLMs.

Abstract: Post-training alignment is central to deploying large language models (LLMs), yet practical workflows remain split across backend-specific tools and ad-hoc glue code, making experiments hard to reproduce. We identify backend interference, reward fragmentation, and irreproducible pipelines as key obstacles in alignment research. We introduce AlignTune, a modular toolkit exposing a unified interface for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RLHF-style optimization with interchangeable TRL and Unsloth backends. AlignTune standardizes configuration, provides an extensible reward layer (rule-based and learned), and integrates evaluation over standard benchmarks and custom tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in reliability, scalability, and efficiency of TableQA tasks in resource-constrained or privacy-sensitive environments.

Method: Introduces MATA, leveraging multiple reasoning paths and tools built with small language models, while minimizing expensive LLM calls.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency on benchmarks with varying difficulty, using ten different LLMs.

Conclusion: Careful orchestration of reasoning pathways enables scalable and reliable TableQA with minimal reliance on expensive LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved table understanding tasks such as Table Question Answering (TableQA), yet challenges remain in ensuring reliability, scalability, and efficiency, especially in resource-constrained or privacy-sensitive environments. In this paper, we introduce MATA, a multi-agent TableQA framework that leverages multiple complementary reasoning paths and a set of tools built with small language models. MATA generates candidate answers through diverse reasoning styles for a given table and question, then refines or selects the optimal answer with the help of these tools. Furthermore, it incorporates an algorithm designed to minimize expensive LLM agent calls, enhancing overall efficiency. MATA maintains strong performance with small, open-source models and adapts easily across various LLM types. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks of varying difficulty with ten different LLMs demonstrate that MATA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and highly efficient reasoning while avoiding excessive LLM inference. Our results highlight that careful orchestration of multiple reasoning pathways yields scalable and reliable TableQA. The code is available at https://github.com/AIDAS-Lab/MATA.

*Joseph Attieh,Timothee Mickus,Anne-Laure Ligozat,Aurélie Névéol,Jörg Tiedemann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates KD methods in machine translation by balancing translation quality and computational cost, expressed as carbon footprint, to guide method selection under constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on KD in machine translation often neglect computational complexity, limiting practical decision-making under compute constraints.

Method: Representative KD methods are assessed using translation quality and carbon footprint (via MLCA tool), covering teacher training, distillation, and inference phases.

Result: Key findings: distillation overhead is dominant at small scales, inference at large scales, and word-level distillation offers better trade-offs.

Conclusion: The study provides a reproducible protocol for selecting KD methods based on quality and compute constraints.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a tool to compress a larger system (teacher) into a smaller one (student). In machine translation, studies typically report only the translation quality of the student and omit the computational complexity of performing KD, making it difficult to select among the many available KD choices under compute-induced constraints. In this study, we evaluate representative KD methods by considering both translation quality and computational cost. We express computational cost as a carbon footprint using the machine learning life cycle assessment (MLCA) tool. This assessment accounts for runtime operational emissions and amortized hardware production costs throughout the KD model life cycle (teacher training, distillation, and inference). We find that (i) distillation overhead dominates the total footprint at small deployment volumes, (ii) inference dominates at scale, making KD beneficial only beyond a task-dependent usage threshold, and (iii) word-level distillation typically offers more favorable footprint-quality trade-offs than sequence-level distillation. Our protocol provides reproducible guidance for selecting KD methods under explicit quality and compute-induced constraints.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving dialectal performance in multilingual LLMs using LoRA fine-tuning, adapter merging, and dialect-aware MBR decoding, showing success in Arabic dialects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialect variations are underrepresented in LLMs due to limited data and linguistic variation, prompting the need for specialized adaptation methods.

Method: The approach involves Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on dialectal data, adapter merging, and dialect-aware MBR decoding to enhance dialectal fidelity.

Result: Experiments on Syrian, Moroccan, and Saudi Arabic dialects demonstrate improved dialectal fidelity without compromising semantic accuracy.

Conclusion: The combination of LoRA, adapter merging, and MBR offers a compact and effective framework for robust dialectal generation in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly multilingual, supporting hundreds of languages, especially high resource ones. Unfortunately, Dialect variations are still underrepresented due to limited data and linguistic variation. In this work, we adapt a pre-trained LLM to improve dialectal performance. Specifically, we use Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on monolingual and English Dialect parallel data, adapter merging and dialect-aware MBR decoding to improve dialectal fidelity generation and translation. Experiments on Syrian, Moroccan, and Saudi Arabic show that merging and MBR improve dialectal fidelity while preserving semantic accuracy. This combination provides a compact and effective framework for robust dialectal Arabic generation.

*Yiming Shu,Pei Liu,Tiange Zhang,Ruiyang Gao,Jun Ma,Chen Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TraceMem is a cognitive-inspired framework for LLMs to sustain long-term interactions by structuring narrative memory schemata from conversational traces, outperforming baselines in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with sustaining long-term interactions due to limited context windows and disjointed memory systems. TraceMem aims to address this by constructing coherent narrative memories.

Method: TraceMem uses a three-stage pipeline: (1) Short-term Memory Processing for topic segmentation, (2) Synaptic Memory Consolidation to distill episodic memories, and (3) Systems Memory Consolidation for hierarchical clustering into narrative threads.

Result: TraceMem achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LoCoMo benchmark, excelling in multi-hop and temporal reasoning by leveraging coherent narrative structures.

Conclusion: TraceMem demonstrates the importance of structured narrative memory in LLMs for deep comprehension and long-term interaction, with potential future advancements discussed.

Abstract: Sustaining long-term interactions remains a bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), as their limited context windows struggle to manage dialogue histories that extend over time. Existing memory systems often treat interactions as disjointed snippets, failing to capture the underlying narrative coherence of the dialogue stream. We propose TraceMem, a cognitively-inspired framework that weaves structured, narrative memory schemata from user conversational traces through a three-stage pipeline: (1) Short-term Memory Processing, which employs a deductive topic segmentation approach to demarcate episode boundaries and extract semantic representation; (2) Synaptic Memory Consolidation, a process that summarizes episodes into episodic memories before distilling them alongside semantics into user-specific traces; and (3) Systems Memory Consolidation, which utilizes two-stage hierarchical clustering to organize these traces into coherent, time-evolving narrative threads under unifying themes. These threads are encapsulated into structured user memory cards, forming narrative memory schemata. For memory utilization, we provide an agentic search mechanism to enhance reasoning process. Evaluation on the LoCoMo benchmark shows that TraceMem achieves state-of-the-art performance with a brain-inspired architecture. Analysis shows that by constructing coherent narratives, it surpasses baselines in multi-hop and temporal reasoning, underscoring its essential role in deep narrative comprehension. Additionally, we provide an open discussion on memory systems, offering our perspectives and future outlook on the field.

### [131] [Unsupervised Layer-Wise Dynamic Test Time Adaptation for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09719)
*Longhuan Xu,Cunjian Chen,Feng Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for LLMs to adapt unsupervised per prompt, avoiding instability issues of fixed learning rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised TTA is appealing but unstable due to overfitting and drift; dynamic adaptation is needed.

Method: Layer-wise dynamic TTA modulates learning rates per layer and step via a hypernetwork, updating only LoRA parameters.

Result: Experiments show improved stability and performance across datasets and LLMs.

Conclusion: Dynamic TTA effectively addresses instability while enhancing prompt-specific adaptation.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) for large language models (LLMs) updates model parameters at inference time using signals available at deployment. This paper focuses on a common yet under-explored regime: unsupervised, sample-specific TTA, where the model adapts independently for each prompt using only the prompt itself, without gold answers or external supervision. Although appealing, naive unsupervised TTA with a fixed, handcrafted learning rate can be unstable: updates may overfit to prompt-specific statistics, drift from the desired answer distribution, and ultimately degrade generation quality. This failure mode is not surprising, as in this case TTA must adapt to a single prompt within only a few gradient steps, unlike standard training that averages updates over large datasets and long optimization horizons. Therefore, we propose layer-wise dynamic test-time adaptation, a framework which explicitly modulates TTA strength as a function of prompt representation, LLM structure and adaptation step. In our setting, TTA updates only LoRA parameters, and a lightweight hypernetwork predicts per-layer, per-step learning-rate multipliers, enabling fine-grained control. Experiments across various datasets and LLMs consistently show that our method substantially strengthens TTA by learning effective scaling patterns over adaptation steps and transformer layer projections, improving stability while delivering better performance.

TL;DR: AI accelerates scientific workflows by aiding in synthesis and maintaining consistency, but expert oversight remains crucial for rigor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess AI's role in collaborative scientific tasks where repeated evaluation is impossible and consensus-based ground truth is key.

Method: A Gemini-based AI environment was tested with 13 climate scientists on the topic of AMOC stability, synthesizing 79 papers through 104 revisions.

Result: AI contributed significantly to content retention, logical consistency, and workflow speed, but experts added critical rigor.

Conclusion: AI enhances efficiency in scientific synthesis but requires expert oversight to meet rigorous standards.

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of AI co-scientists focuses on tasks characterized by repeatable verification, where agents explore search spaces in 'guess and check' loops. This paradigm does not extend to problems where repeated evaluation is impossible and ground truth is established by the consensus synthesis of theory and existing evidence. We evaluate a Gemini-based AI environment designed to support collaborative scientific assessment, integrated into a standard scientific workflow. In collaboration with a diverse group of 13 scientists working in the field of climate science, we tested the system on a complex topic: the stability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Our results show that AI can accelerate the scientific workflow. The group produced a comprehensive synthesis of 79 papers through 104 revision cycles in just over 46 person-hours. AI contribution was significant: most AI-generated content was retained in the report. AI also helped maintain logical consistency and presentation quality. However, expert additions were crucial to ensure its acceptability: less than half of the report was produced by AI. Furthermore, substantial oversight was required to expand and elevate the content to rigorous scientific standards.

TL;DR: A multilingual corpus of 657 New Testament translations with annotated metadata enables flexible, multilevel analysis of translation histories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing corpora lack depth in capturing rich biblical translation histories due to prioritizing linguistic breadth.

Method: Aggregated 657 translations from 12 online biblical libraries and one corpus, manually annotating metadata for canonicalization.

Result: The corpus includes 352 unique translations across five languages, enabling micro- and macro-level studies.

Conclusion: This resource sets a new benchmark for quantitative translation history research.

Abstract: Many European languages possess rich biblical translation histories, yet existing corpora - in prioritizing linguistic breadth - often fail to capture this depth. To address this gap, we introduce a multilingual corpus of 657 New Testament translations, of which 352 are unique, with unprecedented depth in five languages: English (208 unique versions from 396 total), French (41 from 78), Italian (18 from 33), Polish (30 from 48), and Spanish (55 from 102). Aggregated from 12 online biblical libraries and one preexisting corpus, each translation is manually annotated with metadata that maps the text to a standardized identifier for the work, its specific edition, and its year of revision. This canonicalization empowers researchers to define "uniqueness" for their own needs: they can perform micro-level analyses on translation families, such as the KJV lineage, or conduct macro-level studies by deduplicating closely related texts. By providing the first resource designed for such flexible, multilevel analysis, our corpus establishes a new benchmark for the quantitative study of translation history.

TL;DR: Proposes mapping contextualized embeddings to a neurobiological feature space to enhance interpretability of Lexical Semantic Change (LSC), outperforming previous methods and uncovering novel LSC types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LSC studies focus on performance but lack interpretability, limiting insights into how word meanings evolve.

Method: Maps semantic space of contextualized embeddings to a neurobiological feature space with primitive word features.

Result: Superior performance in LSC estimation and discovery of overlooked LSC types, with high interpretability.

Conclusion: The method improves interpretability and performance, revealing new LSC insights.

Abstract: Lexical Semantic Change (LSC) is the phenomenon in which the meaning of a word change over time. Most studies on LSC focus on improving the performance of estimating the degree of LSC, however, it is often difficult to interpret how the meaning of a word change. Enhancing the interpretability of LSC is a significant challenge as it could lead to novel insights in this field. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method to map the semantic space of contextualized embeddings of words obtained by a pre-trained language model to a neurobiological feature space. In the neurobiological feature space, each dimension corresponds to a primitive feature of words, and its value represents the intensity of that feature. This enables humans to interpret LSC systematically. When employed for the estimation of the degree of LSC, our method demonstrates superior performance in comparison to the majority of the previous methods. In addition, given the high interpretability of the proposed method, several analyses on LSC are carried out. The results demonstrate that our method not only discovers interesting types of LSC that have been overlooked in previous studies but also effectively searches for words with specific types of LSC.

TL;DR: A standardized benchmark for Bambara ASR evaluation reveals current models perform poorly, with top WER at 46.76% and CER at 13.00%, indicating challenges for underrepresented languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a benchmark for evaluating ASR systems in Bambara, highlighting gaps in performance despite model scaling and multilingual pre-training.

Method: Used one hour of professionally recorded Malian constitutional text under optimal conditions to evaluate 37 models, including Bambara-trained and commercial systems.

Result: Top-performing model achieved 46.76% WER and 13.00% CER, with several multilingual models exceeding 100% WER, indicating poor performance.

Conclusion: Current ASR models fall short for Bambara, emphasizing the need for specialized approaches beyond multilingual pre-training. The benchmark aims to foster future research.

Abstract: This paper introduces the first standardized benchmark for evaluating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in the Bambara language, utilizing one hour of professionally recorded Malian constitutional text. Designed as a controlled reference set under near-optimal acoustic and linguistic conditions, the benchmark was used to evaluate 37 models, ranging from Bambara-trained systems to large-scale commercial models. Our findings reveal that current ASR performance remains significantly below deployment standards in a narrow formal domain; the top-performing system in terms of Word Error Rate (WER) achieved 46.76\% and the best Character Error Rate (CER) of 13.00\% was set by another model, while several prominent multilingual models exceeded 100\% WER. These results suggest that multilingual pre-training and model scaling alone are insufficient for underrepresented languages. Furthermore, because this dataset represents a best-case scenario of the most simplified and formal form of spoken Bambara, these figures are yet to be tested against practical, real-world settings. We provide the benchmark and an accompanying public leaderboard to facilitate transparent evaluation and future research in Bambara speech technology.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate token efficiency in large language models, breaking it down into factors like completion, correctness, and verbosity, revealing gaps between accuracy and efficiency rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of large language models focus only on final accuracy, missing insights into how tokens are utilized or wasted during reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors propose a trace-optional framework decomposing token efficiency into interpretable factors, including completion, conditional correctness, and verbosity, with additional measures when traces are available.

Result: Evaluation of 25 models shows accuracy and token-efficiency rankings diverge, with efficiency gaps often driven by conditional correctness and significant variations in verbalization overhead.

Conclusion: The framework identifies distinct bottleneck profiles, suggesting tailored interventions to improve token efficiency in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models trained for reasoning trade off inference tokens against accuracy, yet standard evaluations report only final accuracy, obscuring where tokens are spent or wasted. We introduce a trace-optional framework that decomposes token efficiency into interpretable factors: completion under a fixed token budget (avoiding truncation), conditional correctness given completion, and verbosity (token usage). When benchmark metadata provides per-instance workload proxies, we further factor verbosity into two components: mean verbalization overhead (tokens per work unit) and a coupling coefficient capturing how overhead scales with task workload. When reasoning traces are available, we add deterministic trace-quality measures (grounding, repetition, prompt copying) to separate degenerate looping from verbose-but-engaged reasoning, avoiding human labeling and LLM judges. Evaluating 25 models on CogniLoad, we find that accuracy and token-efficiency rankings diverge (Spearman $ρ=0.63$), efficiency gaps are often driven by conditional correctness, and verbalization overhead varies by about 9 times (only weakly related to model scale). Our decomposition reveals distinct bottleneck profiles that suggest different efficiency interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the unique challenges of scientometric question answering, such as named-entity recognition and multi-faceted data retrieval.

Method: Uses LLMs for task decomposition, planning, and reasoning, alongside retrieval-augmented generation and a proprietary database.

Result: Evaluated with experts and LLMs-as-judges, providing insights into LLM efficacy for niche tasks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates LLMs' potential in scientometric QA, with results and resources shared openly.

Abstract: This paper introduces AnalyticsGPT, an intuitive and efficient large language model (LLM)-powered workflow for scientometric question answering. This underrepresented downstream task addresses the subcategory of meta-scientific questions concerning the "science of science." When compared to traditional scientific question answering based on papers, the task poses unique challenges in the planning phase. Namely, the need for named-entity recognition of academic entities within questions and multi-faceted data retrieval involving scientometric indices, e.g. impact factors. Beyond their exceptional capacity for treating traditional natural language processing tasks, LLMs have shown great potential in more complex applications, such as task decomposition and planning and reasoning. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs to scientometric question answering, and describe an end-to-end system implementing a sequential workflow with retrieval-augmented generation and agentic concepts. We also address the secondary task of effectively synthesizing the data into presentable and well-structured high-level analyses. As a database for retrieval-augmented generation, we leverage a proprietary research performance assessment platform. For evaluation, we consult experienced subject matter experts and leverage LLMs-as-judges. In doing so, we provide valuable insights on the efficacy of LLMs towards a niche downstream task.

TL;DR: GloSA-sum introduces topological data analysis (TDA) for efficient, structure-aware text summarization, balancing accuracy and efficiency by preserving semantic cores and logical dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for long-document processing highlights the limitations of existing summarization methods, which often disrupt coherence and incur high resource costs. GloSA-sum addresses these gaps by leveraging TDA.

Method: GloSA-sum constructs a semantic-weighted graph using sentence embeddings and employs persistent homology to identify core semantics and logical structures. It uses a topology-guided iterative strategy with lightweight proxy metrics and integrates hierarchical summarization for long-text processing.

Result: Experiments show GloSA-sum reduces redundancy while maintaining semantic and logical integrity, achieving a balance between accuracy and efficiency. It also enhances downstream LLM tasks by retaining essential reasoning chains.

Conclusion: GloSA-sum is a novel summarization approach that efficiently preserves global structure and logical dependencies, offering a scalable solution for long-text processing.

Abstract: Text summarization is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), and the information explosion has made long-document processing increasingly demanding, making summarization essential. Existing research mainly focuses on model improvements and sentence-level pruning, but often overlooks global structure, leading to disrupted coherence and weakened downstream performance. Some studies employ large language models (LLMs), which achieve higher accuracy but incur substantial resource and time costs. To address these issues, we introduce GloSA-sum, the first summarization approach that achieves global structure awareness via topological data analysis (TDA). GloSA-sum summarizes text efficiently while preserving semantic cores and logical dependencies. Specifically, we construct a semantic-weighted graph from sentence embeddings, where persistent homology identifies core semantics and logical structures, preserved in a ``protection pool'' as the backbone for summarization. We design a topology-guided iterative strategy, where lightweight proxy metrics approximate sentence importance to avoid repeated high-cost computations, thus preserving structural integrity while improving efficiency. To further enhance long-text processing, we propose a hierarchical strategy that integrates segment-level and global summarization. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that GloSA-sum reduces redundancy while preserving semantic and logical integrity, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency, and further benefits LLM downstream tasks by shortening contexts while retaining essential reasoning chains.

*Abdulmuizz Khalak,Abderrahmane Issam,Gerasimos Spanakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines cross-lingual transfer in Arabic LMs, focusing on MSA and dialects, finding disproportionate transfer influenced by geographic proximity and negative interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic LMs are primarily trained on MSA but must handle diverse dialects, raising concerns about transfer effectiveness due to dialect variations.

Method: Probing on 3 NLP tasks and representational similarity analysis to evaluate cross-lingual transfer across Arabic dialects.

Result: Transfer is possible but uneven, linked to geographic proximity, and negative interference occurs in models trained for all dialects.

Conclusion: Findings challenge the assumed similarity of Arabic dialects and highlight concerns for effective cross-lingual transfer in Arabic LMs.

Abstract: Arabic Language Models (LMs) are pretrained predominately on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and are expected to transfer to its dialects. While MSA as the standard written variety is commonly used in formal settings, people speak and write online in various dialects that are spread across the Arab region. This poses limitations for Arabic LMs, since its dialects vary in their similarity to MSA. In this work we study cross-lingual transfer of Arabic models using probing on 3 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks, and representational similarity. Our results indicate that transfer is possible but disproportionate across dialects, which we find to be partially explained by their geographic proximity. Furthermore, we find evidence for negative interference in models trained to support all Arabic dialects. This questions their degree of similarity, and raises concerns for cross-lingual transfer in Arabic models.

*Bakhtawar Ahtisham,Kirk Vanacore,Zhuqian Zhou,Jinsook Lee,Rene F. Kizilcec*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLM-generated reasoning to predict the correctness of their own labels in educational dialogue analysis, achieving strong performance with a Random Forest classifier and identifying linguistic markers of correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reliability in automated labeling of educational dialogue by detecting when LLMs are incorrect, leveraging their own reasoning.

Method: Analyzed 30,300 teacher utterances labeled by LLMs, encoded reasoning using TF-IDF, and evaluated five classifiers. Also examined linguistic markers via LIWC.

Result: Random Forest achieved F1=0.83 (Recall=0.854). Correct reasoning showed causal language, while incorrect relied on hedging. Specialist detectors improved performance.

Conclusion: Reasoning-based error detection is scalable and practical for quality control in automated educational dialogue analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to automatically label and analyze educational dialogue at scale, yet current pipelines lack reliable ways to detect when models are wrong. We investigate whether reasoning generated by LLMs can be used to predict the correctness of a model's own predictions. We analyze 30,300 teacher utterances from classroom dialogue, each labeled by multiple state-of-the-art LLMs with an instructional move construct and an accompanying reasoning. Using human-verified ground-truth labels, we frame the task as predicting whether a model's assigned label for a given utterance is correct. We encode LLM reasoning using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and evaluate five supervised classifiers. A Random Forest classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.83 (Recall = 0.854), successfully identifying most incorrect predictions and outperforming baselines. Training specialist detectors for specific instructional move constructs further improves performance on difficult constructs, indicating that error detection benefits from construct-specific linguistic cues. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework, we examine four linguistic markers of correctness: Causation, Differentiation, Tentativeness, and Insight. Correct predictions exhibit grounded causal language (e.g., because, therefore), while incorrect reasoning is substantially more likely to rely on epistemic hedging (e.g., might, could) and performative metacognition (e.g., think, realize). Syntactic complexity does not distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning, and longer reasoning is not more reliable. These findings demonstrate that reasoning-based error detection offers a practical and scalable approach to quality control in automated educational dialogue analysis.

*Yayun Zhang,Guanyi Chen,Fahime Same,Saad Mahamood,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how Mandarin Chinese speakers quantify objects in naturalistic settings, examining factors like numerosity, animacy, and modality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how speakers decide whether and how to quantify in everyday language use, given the lack of research on naturalistic production.

Method: Picture-based elicited description task where speakers freely described scenes with multiple objects, analyzed across spoken and written modalities.

Result: Quantification likelihood and precision decrease with higher numerosity, while animacy and modality influence strategy choice.

Conclusion: The study offers insights into quantification behavior under unconstrained conditions and provides a dataset for future research.

Abstract: Quantification is a fundamental component of everyday language use, yet little is known about how speakers decide whether and how to quantify in naturalistic production. We investigate quantification in Mandarin Chinese using a picture-based elicited description task in which speakers freely described scenes containing multiple objects, without explicit instructions to count or quantify. Across both spoken and written modalities, we examine three aspects of quantification: whether speakers choose to quantify at all, how precise their quantification is, and which quantificational strategies they adopt. Results show that object numerosity, animacy, and production modality systematically shape quantificational behaviour. In particular, increasing numerosity reduces both the likelihood and the precision of quantification, while animate referents and modality selectively modulate strategy choice. This study demonstrates how quantification can be examined under unconstrained production conditions and provides a naturalistic dataset for further analyses of quantity expression in language production.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a corpus of Sinhala figures of speech (FoS) to address NMT challenges in low-resource languages. It includes cultural and cross-lingual annotations and evaluates LLM performance, revealing limitations in idiomatic translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the limitations of NMT and LLMs in handling low-resource language FoS, particularly Sinhala, due to lack of data.

Method: Created a dataset of 2,344 Sinhala FoS with annotations, classified cultural origins, identified cross-lingual equivalents, and developed a binary classifier (92% accuracy). Evaluated LLMs on the dataset.

Result: LLMs struggle with idiomatic meanings. The dataset serves as a benchmark for future low-resource NLP and culturally aware MT research.

Conclusion: The dataset fills a gap in low-resource NLP, highlighting LLM shortcomings in handling FoS and providing a foundation for further research.

Abstract: Figures of Speech (FoS) consist of multi-word phrases that are deeply intertwined with culture. While Neural Machine Translation (NMT) performs relatively well with the figurative expressions of high-resource languages, it often faces challenges when dealing with low-resource languages like Sinhala due to limited available data. To address this limitation, we introduce a corpus of 2,344 Sinhala figures of speech with cultural and cross-lingual annotations. We examine this dataset to classify the cultural origins of the figures of speech and to identify their cross-lingual equivalents. Additionally, we have developed a binary classifier to differentiate between two types of FOS in the dataset, achieving an accuracy rate of approximately 92%. We also evaluate the performance of existing LLMs on this dataset. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in the current capabilities of LLMs, as these models often struggle to accurately convey idiomatic meanings. By making this dataset publicly available, we offer a crucial benchmark for future research in low-resource NLP and culturally aware machine translation.

*Chung-En Sun,Ge Yan,Zimo Wang,Tsui-Wei Weng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Steer2Edit is a training-free framework that transforms steering vectors into component-level edits for improved attribute-utility trade-offs in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing steering methods apply fixed, global modifications, leading to unfavorable trade-offs by ignoring heterogeneous model components.

Method: Steer2Edit redistributes behavioral influence selectively across attention heads and MLP neurons via rank-1 weight editing.

Result: Improves safety by 17.2%, truthfulness by 9.8%, and reduces reasoning length by 12.2% without compromising performance.

Conclusion: Steer2Edit bridges representation steering and weight editing with interpretable, training-free parameter updates.

Abstract: Steering methods influence Large Language Model behavior by identifying semantic directions in hidden representations, but are typically realized through inference-time activation interventions that apply a fixed, global modification to the model's internal states. While effective, such interventions often induce unfavorable attribute-utility trade-offs under strong control, as they ignore the fact that many behaviors are governed by a small and heterogeneous subset of model components. We propose Steer2Edit, a theoretically grounded, training-free framework that transforms steering vectors from inference-time control signals into diagnostic signals for component-level rank-1 weight editing. Instead of uniformly injecting a steering direction during generation, Steer2Edit selectively redistributes behavioral influence across individual attention heads and MLP neurons, yielding interpretable edits that preserve the standard forward pass and remain compatible with optimized parallel inference. Across safety alignment, hallucination mitigation, and reasoning efficiency, Steer2Edit consistently achieves more favorable attribute-utility trade-offs: at matched downstream performance, it improves safety by up to 17.2%, increases truthfulness by 9.8%, and reduces reasoning length by 12.2% on average. Overall, Steer2Edit provides a principled bridge between representation steering and weight editing by translating steering signals into interpretable, training-free parameter updates.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of achieving continuous self-improvement, complete isolation, and safety alignment in multi-agent systems built from LLMs, terming it the 'self-evolution trilemma.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of self-evolving AI societies and identify fundamental limits, particularly concerning safety alignment, in fully closed-loop systems.

Method: The study employs an information-theoretic framework to formalize safety and analyzes theoretical and empirical evidence from open-ended and closed self-evolving agent systems.

Result: The findings show that isolated self-evolution leads to irreversible safety degradation due to statistical blind spots, aligning with theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The work underscores the need for external oversight or new safety mechanisms, shifting focus from symptom-driven fixes to understanding intrinsic dynamical risks in self-evolving AI societies.

Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent systems built from large language models (LLMs) offers a promising paradigm for scalable collective intelligence and self-evolution. Ideally, such systems would achieve continuous self-improvement in a fully closed loop while maintaining robust safety alignment--a combination we term the self-evolution trilemma. However, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that an agent society satisfying continuous self-evolution, complete isolation, and safety invariance is impossible. Drawing on an information-theoretic framework, we formalize safety as the divergence degree from anthropic value distributions. We theoretically demonstrate that isolated self-evolution induces statistical blind spots, leading to the irreversible degradation of the system's safety alignment. Empirical and qualitative results from an open-ended agent community (Moltbook) and two closed self-evolving systems reveal phenomena that align with our theoretical prediction of inevitable safety erosion. We further propose several solution directions to alleviate the identified safety concern. Our work establishes a fundamental limit on the self-evolving AI societies and shifts the discourse from symptom-driven safety patches to a principled understanding of intrinsic dynamical risks, highlighting the need for external oversight or novel safety-preserving mechanisms.

*William Lugoloobi,Thomas Foster,William Bankes,Chris Russell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs' internal representations to predict their own likelihood of success on tasks, enabling more efficient inference by routing queries intelligently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of running LLMs with extended reasoning motivates the need to identify which inputs truly require additional compute, leveraging internal signals for efficiency.

Method: Linear probes trained on pre-generation activations predict model-specific success on math and coding tasks, outperforming surface features. The study uses E2H-AMC to compare human and model difficulty perceptions.

Result: Models encode a distinct notion of difficulty, differing from human intuitions, especially with extended reasoning. Routing queries based on these signals reduces inference costs by up to 70% while outperforming individual models.

Conclusion: Internal representations offer practical efficiency gains, even when diverging from human difficulty assessments, showcasing potential for cost-effective LLM deployment.

Abstract: Running LLMs with extended reasoning on every problem is expensive, but determining which inputs actually require additional compute remains challenging. We investigate whether their own likelihood of success is recoverable from their internal representations before generation, and if this signal can guide more efficient inference. We train linear probes on pre-generation activations to predict policy-specific success on math and coding tasks, substantially outperforming surface features such as question length and TF-IDF. Using E2H-AMC, which provides both human and model performance on identical problems, we show that models encode a model-specific notion of difficulty that is distinct from human difficulty, and that this distinction increases with extended reasoning. Leveraging these probes, we demonstrate that routing queries across a pool of models can exceed the best-performing model whilst reducing inference cost by up to 70\% on MATH, showing that internal representations enable practical efficiency gains even when they diverge from human intuitions about difficulty.

TL;DR: ATTNPO leverages attention signals to reduce redundant reasoning steps in large models, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models often overthink, generating unnecessary steps without performance gains, and existing methods fail to effectively shorten reasoning or maintain accuracy.

Method: Proposes ATTNPO, a framework using attention heads to distinguish and penalize redundant reasoning steps while preserving essential ones.

Result: Reduces reasoning length and improves performance across 9 benchmarks.

Conclusion: ATTNPO effectively mitigates overthinking by leveraging intrinsic attention signals for step-level credit assignment.

Abstract: Large reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning and verifiable rewards (RLVR) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet often overthink, generating redundant reasoning without performance gains. Existing trajectory-level length penalties often fail to effectively shorten reasoning length and degrade accuracy, as they uniformly treat all reasoning steps and lack fine-grained signals to distinguish redundancy from necessity. Meanwhile, process-supervised methods are typically resource-intensive and suffer from inaccurate credit assignment. To address these issues, we propose ATTNPO, a low-overhead process-supervised RL framework that leverages the model's intrinsic attention signals for step-level credit assignment. We first identify a set of special attention heads that naturally focus on essential steps while suppressing redundant ones. By leveraging the attention scores of these heads, We then employ two sub-strategies to mitigate overthinking by discouraging redundant steps while preserving accuracy by reducing penalties on essential steps. Experimental results show that ATTNPO substantially reduces reasoning length while significantly improving performance across 9 benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCRC models lack reasoning explanations, so the authors aim to enhance them with explanation capabilities.

Method: Proposes ViMultiChoice, a method for Vietnamese MCRC that combines answer prediction and explanation generation.

Result: ViMultiChoice achieves SotA performance on ViMMRC 2.0 and a new dataset, showing joint training improves accuracy.

Conclusion: Jointly training answer prediction and explanation generation enhances Vietnamese MCRC model performance.

Abstract: Multiple-choice Reading Comprehension (MCRC) models aim to select the correct answer from a set of candidate options for a given question. However, they typically lack the ability to explain the reasoning behind their choices. In this paper, we introduce a novel Vietnamese dataset designed to train and evaluate MCRC models with explanation generation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose ViMultiChoice, a new method specifically designed for modeling Vietnamese reading comprehension that jointly predicts the correct answer and generates a corresponding explanation. Experimental results demonstrate that ViMultiChoice outperforms existing MCRC baselines, achieving state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on both the ViMMRC 2.0 benchmark and the newly introduced dataset. Additionally, we show that jointly training option decision and explanation generation leads to significant improvements in multiple-choice accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Neural models trained on developmentally plausible text show generalization without innate syntax, though less efficiently than children, challenging the Poverty of the Stimulus Hypothesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the Poverty of the Stimulus Hypothesis (PoSH) by evaluating whether neural models can generalize syntactic rules without innate constraints.

Method: Training Transformer models on 10--50M words of child-like text and introducing cognitively motivated inductive biases.

Result: Models generalized syntactic phenomena without direct evidence but were less efficient and weaker than children. Biases improved syntax but not PoSH tasks.

Conclusion: Human-like generalization doesn't solely require innate syntax, but better data efficiency might need untested biases.

Abstract: How can children acquire native-level syntax from limited input? According to the Poverty of the Stimulus Hypothesis (PoSH), the linguistic input children receive is insufficient to explain certain generalizations that are robustly learned; innate linguistic constraints, many have argued, are thus necessary to explain language learning. Neural language models, which lack such language-specific constraints in their design, offer a computational test of this longstanding (but controversial) claim. We introduce \poshbench, a training-and-evaluation suite targeting question formation, islands to movement, and other English phenomena at the center of the PoSH arguments. Training Transformer models on 10--50M words of developmentally plausible text, we find indications of generalization on all phenomena even without direct positive evidence -- yet neural models remain less data-efficient and their generalizations are weaker than those of children. We further enhance our models with three recently proposed cognitively motivated inductive biases. We find these biases improve general syntactic competence but not \poshbench performance. Our findings challenge the claim that innate syntax is the only possible route to generalization, while suggesting that human-like data efficiency requires inductive biases beyond those tested here.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploit Vietnamese's high grapheme-phoneme transparency for ASR, aiming for better generalization and reduced training bias.

Method: Proposes ViSpeechFormer, a phoneme-based approach explicitly modeling phonemic representations for Vietnamese ASR.

Result: Achieves strong performance on Vietnamese ASR datasets, better generalization to out-of-vocabulary words, and reduced training bias.

Conclusion: ViSpeechFormer's phoneme-based approach is effective for Vietnamese ASR and potentially other phonetic orthography languages.

Abstract: Vietnamese has a phonetic orthography, where each grapheme corresponds to at most one phoneme and vice versa. Exploiting this high grapheme-phoneme transparency, we propose ViSpeechFormer (\textbf{Vi}etnamese \textbf{Speech} Trans\textbf{Former}), a phoneme-based approach for Vietnamese Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Vietnamese ASR framework that explicitly models phonemic representations. Experiments on two publicly available Vietnamese ASR datasets show that ViSpeechFormer achieves strong performance, generalizes better to out-of-vocabulary words, and is less affected by training bias. This phoneme-based paradigm is also promising for other languages with phonetic orthographies. The code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing LLM outputs in domain-specific settings, emphasizing specificity and relevance, supported by a curated dataset and human evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks for LLMs in high-stakes domains lack granularity and fail to assess domain-sensitive decision-critical details.

Method: Introduces a multi-dimensional, reference-free evaluation framework assessing specificity, robustness, relevance, and context utilization, validated with a curated dataset and human evaluation.

Result: Findings show no single metric captures answer quality adequately, highlighting the need for multi-metric evaluations in high-stakes applications.

Conclusion: A structured, multi-metric approach is essential for evaluating LLMs in domain-specific, high-stakes scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support question answering and decision-making in high-stakes, domain-specific settings such as natural hazard response and infrastructure planning, where effective answers must convey fine-grained, decision-critical details. However, existing evaluation frameworks for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and open-ended question answering primarily rely on surface-level similarity, factual consistency, or semantic relevance, and often fail to assess whether responses provide the specific information required for domain-sensitive decisions. To address this gap, we propose a multi-dimensional, reference-free evaluation framework that assesses LLM outputs along four complementary dimensions: specificity, robustness to paraphrasing and semantic perturbations, answer relevance, and context utilization. We introduce a curated dataset of 1,412 domain-specific question-answer pairs spanning 40 professional roles and seven natural hazard types to support systematic evaluation. We further conduct human evaluation to assess inter-annotator agreement and alignment between model outputs and human judgments, which highlights the inherent subjectivity of open-ended, domain-specific evaluation. Our results show that no single metric sufficiently captures answer quality in isolation and demonstrate the need for structured, multi-metric evaluation frameworks when deploying LLMs in high-stakes applications.

TL;DR: DRIFT introduces a dual-model architecture to decouple knowledge extraction from reasoning, improving LLM performance on long-context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of integrating dynamic knowledge into LLMs without entangling factual data and reasoning patterns.

Method: Uses a lightweight knowledge model to dynamically compress document chunks into implicit fact tokens, projecting them into the reasoning model's embedding space.

Result: Outperforms baselines in long-context tasks, demonstrating scalable and efficient context window extension.

Conclusion: DRIFT offers a promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities and context handling.

Abstract: The integration of extensive, dynamic knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge due to the inherent entanglement of factual data and reasoning patterns. Existing solutions, ranging from non-parametric Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to parametric knowledge editing, are often constrained in practice by finite context windows, retriever noise, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose DRIFT, a novel dual-model architecture designed to explicitly decouple knowledge extraction from the reasoning process. Unlike static prompt compression, DRIFT employs a lightweight knowledge model to dynamically compress document chunks into implicit fact tokens conditioned on the query. These dense representations are projected into the reasoning model's embedding space, replacing raw, redundant text while maintaining inference accuracy. Extensive experiments show that DRIFT significantly improves performance on long-context tasks, outperforming strong baselines among comparably sized models. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient paradigm for extending the effective context window and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lancelot-Xie/DRIFT.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model for multi-modal claim verification combining textual and visual evidence, featuring evidence retrieval, verification, and explanation generation, validated on a new AI domain dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current claim verification methods often lack multi-modal reasoning or explainability, leading to inaccurate results. This work aims to integrate both textual and visual evidence while providing transparent explanations.

Method: The model uses a two-layer multi-modal graph for evidence retrieval, token- and evidence-level fusion for verification, and Fusion-in-Decoder for explanation generation. A new dataset, AIChartClaim, is introduced for evaluation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the model's effectiveness in multi-modal claim verification and explainability.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses limitations in existing methods by integrating multi-modal reasoning and explainability, validated by a new scientific dataset.

Abstract: Verifying the truthfulness of claims usually requires joint multi-modal reasoning over both textual and visual evidence, such as analyzing both textual caption and chart image for claim verification. In addition, to make the reasoning process transparent, a textual explanation is necessary to justify the verification result. However, most claim verification works mainly focus on the reasoning over textual evidence only or ignore the explainability, resulting in inaccurate and unconvincing verification. To address this problem, we propose a novel model that jointly achieves evidence retrieval, multi-modal claim verification, and explanation generation. For evidence retrieval, we construct a two-layer multi-modal graph for claims and evidence, where we design image-to-text and text-to-image reasoning for multi-modal retrieval. For claim verification, we propose token- and evidence-level fusion to integrate claim and evidence embeddings for multi-modal verification. For explanation generation, we introduce multi-modal Fusion-in-Decoder for explainability. Finally, since almost all the datasets are in general domain, we create a scientific dataset, AIChartClaim, in AI domain to complement claim verification community. Experiments show the strength of our model.

Motivation: Current AI systems struggle with interpreting complex multimodal knowledge in scientific research, necessitating a benchmark and framework to address these challenges.

Method: AnaBench is a large-scale benchmark with 63,178 instances. Anagent, a multi-agent framework, uses four specialized agents (Planner, Expert, Solver, Critic) and modular training strategies for enhanced analysis.

Result: Anagent achieves up to 13.43% improvements in training-free settings and 42.12% with finetuning, demonstrating the importance of task-oriented reasoning and context-aware problem-solving.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for specialized AI frameworks like Anagent to tackle the complexities of scientific table & figure analysis, with significant performance gains.

Abstract: In scientific research, analysis requires accurately interpreting complex multimodal knowledge, integrating evidence from different sources, and drawing inferences grounded in domain-specific knowledge. However, current artificial intelligence (AI) systems struggle to consistently demonstrate such capabilities. The complexity and variability of scientific tables and figures, combined with heterogeneous structures and long-context requirements, pose fundamental obstacles to scientific table \& figure analysis. To quantify these challenges, we introduce AnaBench, a large-scale benchmark featuring $63,178$ instances from nine scientific domains, systematically categorized along seven complexity dimensions. To tackle these challenges, we propose Anagent, a multi-agent framework for enhanced scientific table \& figure analysis through four specialized agents: Planner decomposes tasks into actionable subtasks, Expert retrieves task-specific information through targeted tool execution, Solver synthesizes information to generate coherent analysis, and Critic performs iterative refinement through five-dimensional quality assessment. We further develop modular training strategies that leverage supervised finetuning and specialized reinforcement learning to optimize individual capabilities while maintaining effective collaboration. Comprehensive evaluation across 170 subdomains demonstrates that Anagent achieves substantial improvements, up to $\uparrow 13.43\%$ in training-free settings and $\uparrow 42.12\%$ with finetuning, while revealing that task-oriented reasoning and context-aware problem-solving are essential for high-quality scientific table \& figure analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing language models' grasp of quantum computing concepts, which existing benchmarks overlook.

Method: Created Quantum-Audit with 2,700 questions (expert-written, LLM-extracted, open-ended, and false-premise) to test 26 models.

Result: Top models outperformed human experts (74%) with 84% accuracy but dipped on expert-written questions (12-point drop) and false premises (below 66%).

Conclusion: Models excel in quantum computing but falter on nuanced or misleading questions, highlighting gaps in advanced topic comprehension and critical reasoning.

Abstract: Language models have become practical tools for quantum computing education and research, from summarizing technical papers to explaining theoretical concepts and answering questions about recent developments in the field. While existing benchmarks evaluate quantum code generation and circuit design, their understanding of quantum computing concepts has not been systematically measured. Quantum-Audit addresses this gap with 2,700 questions covering core quantum computing topics. We evaluate 26 models from leading organizations. Our benchmark comprises 1,000 expert-written questions, 1,000 questions extracted from research papers using LLMs and validated by experts, plus an additional 700 questions including 350 open-ended questions and 350 questions with false premises to test whether models can correct erroneous assumptions. Human participants scored between 23% and 86%, with experts averaging 74%. Top-performing models exceeded the expert average, with Claude Opus 4.5 reaching 84% accuracy, though top models showed an average 12-point accuracy drop on expert-written questions compared to LLM-generated ones. Performance declined further on advanced topics, dropping to 73% on security questions. Additionally, models frequently accepted and reinforced false premises embedded in questions instead of identifying them, with accuracy below 66% on these critical reasoning tasks.

*Ruixiang Wang,Yuyang Hong,Shiming Xiang,Chunhong Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel serialized token paradigm to overcome the information bottleneck in graph-level representations, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for graph-level representations fail to fully utilize self-attention's strength, degenerating into a weighted sum of node signals.

Method: A graph serialization method aggregates node signals into serialized graph tokens with positional encoding, followed by stacked self-attention layers.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on graph-level benchmarks, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: The serialized token paradigm effectively captures global signals and complex interactions, improving graph representation.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated success in graph learning, particularly for node-level tasks. However, existing methods encounter an information bottleneck when generating graph-level representations. The prevalent single token paradigm fails to fully leverage the inherent strength of self-attention in encoding token sequences, and degenerates into a weighted sum of node signals. To address this issue, we design a novel serialized token paradigm to encapsulate global signals more effectively. Specifically, a graph serialization method is proposed to aggregate node signals into serialized graph tokens, with positional encoding being automatically involved. Then, stacked self-attention layers are applied to encode this token sequence and capture its internal dependencies.

TL;DR: Spectral Disentanglement and Enhancement (SDE) improves multimodal contrastive learning by addressing spectral imbalance and entanglement in feature dimensions, enhancing robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal contrastive learning methods treat feature dimensions uniformly and ignore intrinsic spectral structure, leading to collapsed embeddings and poor generalization.

Method: SDE uses singular value decomposition to partition features into strong signals, weak signals, and noise, applies spectral enhancement, and introduces a dual-domain contrastive loss for optimized alignment in feature and spectral spaces.

Result: SDE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale benchmarks, improving representation robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: SDE offers a seamless and effective solution for enhancing multimodal representation learning by integrating spectral regularization.

Abstract: Large-scale multimodal contrastive learning has recently achieved impressive success in learning rich and transferable representations, yet it remains fundamentally limited by the uniform treatment of feature dimensions and the neglect of the intrinsic spectral structure of the learned features. Empirical evidence indicates that high-dimensional embeddings tend to collapse into narrow cones, concentrating task-relevant semantics in a small subspace, while the majority of dimensions remain occupied by noise and spurious correlations. Such spectral imbalance and entanglement undermine model generalization. We propose Spectral Disentanglement and Enhancement (SDE), a novel framework that bridges the gap between the geometry of the embedded spaces and their spectral properties. Our approach leverages singular value decomposition to adaptively partition feature dimensions into strong signals that capture task-critical semantics, weak signals that reflect ancillary correlations, and noise representing irrelevant perturbations. A curriculum-based spectral enhancement strategy is then applied, selectively amplifying informative components with theoretical guarantees on training stability. Building upon the enhanced features, we further introduce a dual-domain contrastive loss that jointly optimizes alignment in both the feature and spectral spaces, effectively integrating spectral regularization into the training process and encouraging richer, more robust representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SDE consistently improves representation robustness and generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. SDE integrates seamlessly with existing contrastive pipelines, offering an effective solution for multimodal representation learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Palimpsa, a self-attention model using Bayesian metaplasticity, outperforms baselines by addressing interference in gated linear attention models and expanding memory capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind Palimpsa is to solve the stability-plasticity dilemma in In-Context Learning (ICL) for transformers, especially addressing fixed capacity and interference issues in gated linear attention models.

Method: Palimpsa employs Bayesian metaplasticity, linking the plasticity of attention states to importance states grounded by a prior distribution, and shows that gated linear attention models are special cases of this framework.

Result: Experiments demonstrate Palimpsa's superiority over baselines on Multi-Query Associative Recall (MQAR) and Commonsense Reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Palimpsa effectively transforms non-metaplastic models into metaplastic ones, significantly enhancing memory capacity and performance.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) in transformers acts as an online associative memory and is believed to underpin their high performance on complex sequence processing tasks. However, in gated linear attention models, this memory has a fixed capacity and is prone to interference, especially for long sequences. We propose Palimpsa, a self-attention model that views ICL as a continual learning problem that must address a stability-plasticity dilemma. Palimpsa uses Bayesian metaplasticity, where the plasticity of each attention state is tied to an importance state grounded by a prior distribution that captures accumulated knowledge. We demonstrate that various gated linear attention models emerge as specific architecture choices and posterior approximations, and that Mamba2 is a special case of Palimpsa where forgetting dominates. This theoretical link enables the transformation of any non-metaplastic model into a metaplastic one, significantly expanding its memory capacity. Our experiments show that Palimpsa consistently outperforms baselines on the Multi-Query Associative Recall (MQAR) benchmark and on Commonsense Reasoning tasks.

Result: PatientTPP outperformed BMI in stratifying patients by future cardiovascular-related healthcare costs and efficiently identified higher-risk patients.

Conclusion: PatientTPP provides an interpretable, general-purpose foundation for patient risk modeling, with direct applications in obesity-related care and cost targeting.

Abstract: Accurate risk stratification in patients with overweight or obesity is critical for guiding preventive care and allocating high-cost therapies such as GLP-1 receptor agonists. We present PatientTPP, a neural temporal point process (TPP) model trained on over 500,000 real-world clinical trajectories to learn patient representations from sequences of diagnoses, labs, and medications. We extend existing TPP modeling approaches to include static and numeric features and incorporate clinical knowledge for event encoding. PatientTPP representations support downstream prediction tasks, including classification of obesity-associated outcomes in low-risk individuals, even for events not explicitly modeled during training. In health economic evaluation, PatientTPP outperformed body mass index in stratifying patients by future cardiovascular-related healthcare costs, identifying higher-risk patients more efficiently. By modeling both the type and timing of clinical events, PatientTPP offers an interpretable, general-purpose foundation for patient risk modeling with direct applications to obesity-related care and cost targeting.

TL;DR: RecursiveVLM improves Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) by reusing parameters through recursive refinement, achieving better performance without increasing model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs underutilize their vast parameters during training and inference. Recursive refinement leverages existing parameters to enhance multimodal representations.

Method: Introduces RecursiveVLM with a Recursive Connector for feature alignment across recursion steps and a Monotonic Recursion Loss ensuring performance improves with each step.

Result: Experiments show gains of +3% over standard Transformers and +7% over vanilla recursive baselines, proving strategic looping enhances efficiency and adaptability.

Conclusion: Recursive refinement is a promising approach to make LMMs more efficient and adaptable to varying computational resources.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision-language tasks, yet their vast parameter counts are often underutilized during both training and inference. In this work, we embrace the idea of looping back to move forward: reusing model parameters through recursive refinement to extract stronger multimodal representations without increasing model size. We propose RecursiveVLM, a recursive Transformer architecture tailored for LMMs. Two key innovations enable effective looping: (i) a Recursive Connector that aligns features across recursion steps by fusing intermediate-layer hidden states and applying modality-specific projections, respecting the distinct statistical structures of vision and language tokens; (ii) a Monotonic Recursion Loss that supervises every step and guarantees performance improves monotonically with recursion depth. This design transforms recursion into an on-demand refinement mechanism: delivering strong results with few loops on resource-constrained devices and progressively improving outputs when more computation resources are available. Experiments show consistent gains of +3% over standard Transformers and +7% over vanilla recursive baselines, demonstrating that strategic looping is a powerful path toward efficient, deployment-adaptive LMMs.

Conclusion: Identifies open challenges and future directions for optimizing LLM training and inference paradigms.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs), a wide range of methods have been developed to distribute computation and memory across hardware devices for efficient training and inference. While existing surveys provide descriptive overviews of these techniques, systematic analysis of their benefits and trade offs and how such insights can inform principled methodology for designing optimal distributed systems remain limited. This paper offers a comprehensive review of collective operations and distributed parallel strategies, complemented by mathematical formulations to deepen theoretical understanding. We further examine hybrid parallelization designs, emphasizing communication computation overlap across different stages of model deployment, including both training and inference. Recent advances in automated search for optimal hybrid parallelization strategies using cost models are also discussed. Moreover, we present case studies with mainstream architecture categories to reveal empirical insights to guide researchers and practitioners in parallelism strategy selection. Finally, we highlight open challenges and limitations of current LLM training paradigms and outline promising directions for the next generation of large scale model development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transfer-learning methods struggle with radically heterogeneous systems, especially under data scarcity or noise. The study aims to bridge this gap by identifying domain-invariant structural principles.

Method: The framework uses Importance Inversion Transfer (IIT) to prioritize structural invariants over discriminative features, unifying network science and explainable AI.

Result: In anomaly detection, models guided by X-CDTL achieve a 56% relative improvement in decision stability under extreme noise compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: X-CDTL demonstrates a shared organizational signature across heterogeneous domains, advancing cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer by focusing on explicit structural laws.

Abstract: The capacity to transfer knowledge across scientific domains relies on shared organizational principles. However, existing transfer-learning methodologies often fail to bridge radically heterogeneous systems, particularly under severe data scarcity or stochastic noise. This study formalizes Explainable Cross-Domain Transfer Learning (X-CDTL), a framework unifying network science and explainable artificial intelligence to identify structural invariants that generalize across biological, linguistic, molecular, and social networks. By introducing the Importance Inversion Transfer (IIT) mechanism, the framework prioritizes domain-invariant structural anchors over idiosyncratic, highly discriminative features. In anomaly detection tasks, models guided by these principles achieve significant performance gains - exhibiting a 56\% relative improvement in decision stability under extreme noise - over traditional baselines. These results provide evidence for a shared organizational signature across heterogeneous domains, establishing a principled paradigm for cross-disciplinary knowledge propagation. By shifting from opaque latent representations to explicit structural laws, this work advances machine learning as a robust engine for scientific discovery.

TL;DR: SpinCastML is a machine learning and Inverse Monte Carlo software for inverse electrospinning design, predicting fiber diameter distributions and enabling reproducible, data-driven nanofiber manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks lack inverse design capabilities and integration of polymer-solvent constraints or prediction of full fiber distributions, necessitating a data-driven solution.

Method: SpinCastML uses a curated dataset, structured sampling methods, high-performance learners, and chemistry-aware constraints to predict fiber distributions and employs Inverse Monte Carlo for accurate distribution modeling.

Result: Achieves high performance (R2 > 0.92) with Cubist model and Sobol D sampling, and IMC captures distributions with R2 > 0.90 and <1% error. Supports retrospective and inverse design.

Conclusion: SpinCastML transforms electrospinning from trial-and-error to reproducible design, reducing waste, accelerating discovery, and democratizing advanced modeling for sustainable nanofiber applications.

Abstract: Electrospinning is a powerful technique for producing micro to nanoscale fibers with application specific architectures. Small variations in solution or operating conditions can shift the jet regime, generating non Gaussian fiber diameter distributions. Despite substantial progress, no existing framework enables inverse design toward desired fiber outcomes while integrating polymer solvent chemical constraints or predicting full distributions. SpinCastML is an open source, distribution aware, chemically informed machine learning and Inverse Monte Carlo (IMC) software for inverse electrospinning design. Built on a rigorously curated dataset of 68,480 fiber diameters from 1,778 datasets across 16 polymers, SpinCastML integrates three structured sampling methods, a suite of 11 high-performance learners, and chemistry aware constraints to predict not only mean diameter but the entire distribution. Cubist model with a polymer balanced Sobol D optimal sampling provides the highest global performance (R2 > 0.92). IMC accurately captures the fiber distributions, achieving R2 > 0.90 and <1% error between predicted and experimental success rates. The IMC engine supports both retrospective analysis and forward-looking inverse design, generating physically and chemically feasible polymer solvent parameter combinations with quantified success probabilities for user-defined targets. SpinCastML reframes electrospinning from trial and error to a reproducible, data driven design process. As an open source executable, it enables laboratories to analyze their own datasets and co create an expanding community software. SpinCastML reduces experimental waste, accelerates discovery, and democratizes access to advanced modeling, establishing distribution aware inverse design as a new standard for sustainable nanofiber manufacturing across biomedical, filtration, and energy applications.

### [165] [Epistemic Throughput: Fundamental Limits of Attention-Constrained Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09127)
*Lei You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Attention-Constrained Inference (ACI) to address the bottleneck in processing AI-generated candidates efficiently. It proposes epistemic throughput as a measure and derives a scaling law (JaKoB) showing nonlinear benefits of expanding cheap screening alongside scarce verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of downstream decision-makers needing to form reliable conclusions from numerous AI-generated candidates under limited attention. The paper seeks to formalize and optimize this process.

Method: The method involves ACI, which includes a cheap screening stage (processing K records) and an expensive verification stage (limited to B records). The study uses Bayes log-loss to quantify epistemic throughput.

Result: The key result is the JaKoB scaling law, indicating that epistemic throughput grows linearly with verification and prevalence, with an additional term scaling as √(JKB). This shows nonlinear benefits of expanding screening. Heavy-tailed score distributions are crucial for leverage in sparse-verification regimes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that expanding cheap screening can significantly amplify scarce verification, especially in sparse-verification regimes, but its effectiveness depends on the score distribution's tail behavior.

Abstract: Recent generative and tool-using AI systems can surface a large volume of candidates at low marginal cost, yet only a small fraction can be checked carefully. This creates a decoder-side bottleneck: downstream decision-makers must form reliable posteriors from many public records under scarce attention. We formalize this regime via Attention-Constrained Inference (ACI), in which a cheap screening stage processes $K$ records and an expensive verification stage can follow up on at most $B$ of them. Under Bayes log-loss, we study the maximum achievable reduction in posterior uncertainty per window, which we call \emph{epistemic throughput}. Our main result is a ``JaKoB'' scaling law showing that epistemic throughput has a baseline term that grows linearly with verification and prevalence, and an additional \emph{information-leverage} term that scales as $\sqrt{JKB}$, where $J$ summarizes screening quality. Thus, expanding cheap screening can nonlinearly amplify scarce verification, even when informative records are rare. We further show that this scaling is tight in a weak-screening limit, and that in the sparse-verification regime ($B \ll K$), substantial leverage requires heavy-tailed score distributions; for light-tailed scores the amplification is only logarithmic.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an exact, efficient method for generating counterfactual explanations for tree ensembles by leveraging nearest-region search and volumetric KD trees, outperforming existing methods in speed and optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual explanations are crucial for interpretable ML but remain challenging to compute exactly for complex models like tree ensembles. Current methods lack optimality or scalability.

Method: The method compresses tree ensembles into labeled hyperrectangles and formulates counterfactual search as nearest-region queries using volumetric KD trees, enabling exact and fast solutions.

Result: Experiments show the approach provides optimal counterfactuals with millisecond latency, significantly faster than existing exact methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a scalable, exact solution for counterfactual generation in tree ensembles, enhancing interpretability in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations are a central tool in interpretable machine learning, yet computing them exactly for complex models remains challenging. For tree ensembles, predictions are piecewise constant over a large collection of axis-aligned hyperrectangles, implying that an optimal counterfactual for a point corresponds to its projection onto the nearest rectangle with an alternative label under a chosen metric. Existing methods largely overlook this geometric structure, relying either on heuristics with no optimality guarantees or on mixed-integer programming formulations that do not scale to interactive use.
  In this work, we revisit counterfactual generation through the lens of nearest-region search and introduce counterfactual maps, a global representation of recourse for tree ensembles. Leveraging the fact that any tree ensemble can be compressed into an equivalent partition of labeled hyperrectangles, we cast counterfactual search as the problem of identifying the generalized Voronoi cell associated with the nearest rectangle of an alternative label. This leads to an exact, amortized algorithm based on volumetric k-dimensional (KD) trees, which performs branch-and-bound nearest-region queries with explicit optimality certificates and sublinear average query time after a one-time preprocessing phase.
  Our experimental analyses on several real datasets drawn from high-stakes application domains show that this approach delivers globally optimal counterfactual explanations with millisecond-level latency, achieving query times that are orders of magnitude faster than existing exact, cold-start optimization methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of model compression lack comprehensive coverage and focus too narrowly on knowledge-centric benchmarks. UniComp aims to provide a holistic assessment.

Method: UniComp evaluates six compression techniques on modern LLMs using diverse benchmarks (capability- and safety-oriented) and hardware-aware efficiency analysis.

Result: Quantization provides the best balance between performance and efficiency. Distillation accelerates runtime but at high cost. Task-specific calibration improves pruned models' reasoning by up to 50%.

Conclusion: UniComp highlights knowledge bias in compression and demonstrates quantization's superiority, while task-specific methods enhance pruned models.

Abstract: Model compression is increasingly essential for deploying large language models (LLMs), yet existing evaluations are limited in method coverage and focus primarily on knowledge-centric benchmarks. Thus, we introduce UniComp, a unified evaluation framework for comparing pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation. UniComp evaluates compressed models along three dimensions: performance, reliability, and efficiency, using a diverse set of capability- and safety-oriented benchmarks together with a hardware-aware efficiency analysis. Through extensive evaluation of six compression techniques on modern LLMs across more than 40 datasets, we find that (i) compression exhibits a consistent knowledge bias, where knowledge-intensive tasks are relatively preserved while reasoning, multilingual, and instruction-following capabilities degrade substantially; (ii) quantization provides the best overall trade-off between retained performance and efficiency, whereas distillation yields strong runtime acceleration gains at high computational cost; and (iii) task-specific calibration can significantly improve the reasoning ability of pruned models by up to 50%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how geometric statistics in LLMs capture different types of hallucinations and introduces a normalization method to improve detection across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination in generative models is a significant issue, especially when external validation is unavailable, prompting the study of internal geometric signals to predict it.

Method: A synthetic dataset is created to vary properties like correctness, confidence, relevance, coherence, and completeness. Different geometric statistics are analyzed for their sensitivity to these properties.

Result: Different geometric statistics capture distinct types of hallucinations, and existing methods are sensitive to domain shifts. A normalization method improves AUROC by +34 points in multi-domain settings.

Conclusion: The study shows that specific geometric statistics correspond to different hallucination types, and domain adaptation via normalization significantly enhances detection performance.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a barrier to deploying generative models in high-consequence applications. This is especially true in cases where external ground truth is not readily available to validate model outputs. This situation has motivated the study of geometric signals in the internal state of an LLM that are predictive of hallucination and require limited external knowledge. Given that there are a range of factors that can lead model output to be called a hallucination (e.g., irrelevance vs incoherence), in this paper we ask what specific properties of a hallucination these geometric statistics actually capture. To assess this, we generate a synthetic dataset which varies distinct properties of output associated with hallucination. This includes output correctness, confidence, relevance, coherence, and completeness. We find that different geometric statistics capture different types of hallucinations. Along the way we show that many existing geometric detection methods have substantial sensitivity to shifts in task domain (e.g., math questions vs. history questions). Motivated by this, we introduce a simple normalization method to mitigate the effect of domain shift on geometric statistics, leading to AUROC gains of +34 points in multi-domain settings.

Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional optimization and sampling algorithms on analog Ising machines due to inherent measurement noise.

Method: Utilizes variational reinforcement learning to approximate the Boltzmann distribution by aggregating information across multiple noisy measurements.

Result: Maintains 98% ground state fidelity under 3% noise (vs. MCMC's 51%) and achieves solutions up to 192x faster. Scales well up to 65,536 spins.

Conclusion: BRAIN provides a scalable and noise-resilient method for complex optimizations on analog computing architectures, also capturing thermodynamic behaviors.

Abstract: Analog Ising machines (AIMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for combinatorial optimization, utilizing physical dynamics to solve Ising problems with high energy efficiency. However, the performance of traditional optimization and sampling algorithms on these platforms is often limited by inherent measurement noise. We introduce BRAIN (Boltzmann Reinforcement for Analog Ising Networks), a distribution learning framework that utilizes variational reinforcement learning to approximate the Boltzmann distribution. By shifting from state-by-state sampling to aggregating information across multiple noisy measurements, BRAIN is resilient to Gaussian noise characteristic of AIMs. We evaluate BRAIN across diverse combinatorial topologies, including the Curie-Weiss and 2D nearest-neighbor Ising systems. We find that under realistic 3\% Gaussian measurement noise, BRAIN maintains 98\% ground state fidelity, whereas Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods degrade to 51\% fidelity. Furthermore, BRAIN reaches the MCMC-equivalent solution up to 192x faster under these conditions. BRAIN exhibits $\mathcal{O}(N^{1.55})$ scaling up to 65,536 spins and maintains robustness against severe measurement uncertainty up to 40\%. Beyond ground state optimization, BRAIN accurately captures thermodynamic phase transitions and metastable states, providing a scalable and noise-resilient method for utilizing analog computing architectures in complex optimizations.

Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between existing convergence rates for federated optimization in stochastic VIs and the state-of-the-art bounds in federated convex optimization.

Method: The work refines the analysis of Local Extra SGD and introduces a new algorithm, LIPPAX, designed to reduce client drift and improve convergence in various settings like bounded Hessian, bounded operator, and low-variance.

Result: The results include tighter convergence guarantees for Local Extra SGD, identification of its limitations, and improved guarantees for the proposed LIPPAX algorithm in multiple regimes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed LIPPAX algorithm effectively mitigates client drift and achieves better convergence rates for federated stochastic VIs and composite VIs.

Abstract: In this paper, we study federated optimization for solving stochastic variational inequalities (VIs), a problem that has attracted growing attention in recent years. Despite substantial progress, a significant gap remains between existing convergence rates and the state-of-the-art bounds known for federated convex optimization. In this work, we address this limitation by establishing a series of improved convergence rates. First, we show that, for general smooth and monotone variational inequalities, the classical Local Extra SGD algorithm admits tighter guarantees under a refined analysis. Next, we identify an inherent limitation of Local Extra SGD, which can lead to excessive client drift. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new algorithm, the Local Inexact Proximal Point Algorithm with Extra Step (LIPPAX), and show that it mitigates client drift and achieves improved guarantees in several regimes, including bounded Hessian, bounded operator, and low-variance settings. Finally, we extend our results to federated composite variational inequalities and establish improved convergence guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Fully finetuning foundation language models (LMs) with billions of parameters is often impractical due to high computational costs, memory requirements, and the risk of overfitting. Although methods like low-rank adapters help address these challenges by adding small trainable modules to the frozen LM, they also increase memory usage and do not reduce inference latency. We uncover an intriguing phenomenon: sparsifying specific model rows and columns enables efficient task adaptation without requiring weight tuning. We propose a scheme for effective finetuning via sparsification using training stochastic gates, which requires minimal trainable parameters, reduces inference time, and removes 20--40\% of model parameters without significant accuracy loss. Empirical results show it outperforms recent finetuning baselines in efficiency and performance. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of this stochastic gating process, and show that our method admits a simpler and better-conditioned optimization landscape compared to LoRA. Our results highlight sparsity as a compelling mechanism for task-specific adaptation in LMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces W2BGP to unify exotic Bayesian Optimization tasks like collaborative/federated BO, batch BO, and multi-fidelity BO under one framework using weighted Wasserstein Barycenter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified framework for various Bayesian Optimization tasks that currently lack a common approach, simplifying implementation and computation.

Method: Uses weighted Wasserstein Barycenter of Gaussian Processes (W2BGP) with task-specific weighting schemes, reinterpreting BO acquisition functions for efficiency.

Result: Empirical analysis shows W2BGP works for all tasks with appropriate weights, offering computational efficiency over existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach successfully unifies diverse BO tasks and suggests further research directions.

Abstract: Exploiting the analogy between Gaussian Distributions and Gaussian Processes' posterior, we present how the weighted Wasserstein Barycenter of Gaussian Processes (W2BGP) can be used to unify, under a common framework, different exotic Bayesian Optimization (BO) tasks. Specifically, collaborative/federated BO, (synchronous) batch BO, and multi-fidelity BO are considered in this paper. Our empirical analysis proves that each one of these tasks requires just an appropriate weighting schema for the W2BGP, while the entire framework remains untouched. Moreover, we demonstrate that the most well-known BO acquisition functions can be easily re-interpreted under the proposed framework and also enable a more computationally efficient way to deal with the computation of the Wasserstein Barycenter, compared with state-of-the-art methods from the Machine Learning literature. Finally, research perspectives branching from the proposed approach are presented.

### [173] [Gradient Residual Connections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09190)
*Yangchen Pan,Qizhen Ying,Philip Torr,Bo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a gradient-based residual connection to improve neural networks' approximation of high-frequency functions, outperforming standard residual connections in synthetic and real-world tasks like super-resolution while maintaining performance in standard tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work shows gradients relate to function approximation difficulty. The authors aim to leverage gradient information to enhance neural networks' ability to approximate high-frequency functions.

Method: They introduce a gradient-based residual connection alongside standard identity skip connections, supported by theoretical intuition. A convex combination of both connections allows flexible reliance on gradient information.

Result: On synthetic high-frequency tasks, gradient residuals outperform standard residuals. Ablation studies validate the design, and the method works well in super-resolution while matching standard networks in classification and segmentation.

Conclusion: The gradient residual connection effectively improves high-frequency function approximation and maintains performance in standard tasks, demonstrating broad utility.

Abstract: Existing work has linked properties of a function's gradient to the difficulty of function approximation. Motivated by these insights, we study how gradient information can be leveraged to improve neural network's ability to approximate high-frequency functions, and we propose a gradient-based residual connection as a complement to the standard identity skip connection used in residual networks. We provide simple theoretical intuition for why gradient information can help distinguish inputs and improve the approximation of functions with rapidly varying behaviour. On a synthetic regression task with a high-frequency sinusoidal ground truth, we show that conventional residual connections struggle to capture high-frequency patterns. In contrast, our gradient residual substantially improves approximation quality. We then introduce a convex combination of the standard and gradient residuals, allowing the network to flexibly control how strongly it relies on gradient information. After validating the design choices of our proposed method through an ablation study, we further validate our approach's utility on the single-image super-resolution task, where the underlying function may be high-frequency. Finally, on standard tasks such as image classification and segmentation, our method achieves performance comparable to standard residual networks, suggesting its broad utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ML-DCN, a novel feature interaction module combining DCNv2 and MaskNet strengths, efficiently scales under fixed serving budgets, achieving state-of-the-art performance and improving ads metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature interaction modules like DCNv2 and MaskNet show diminishing returns when scaled, necessitating a more efficient solution for large-scale ad ranking systems.

Method: Proposes ML-DCN, integrating an instance-conditioned mask into a low-rank crossing layer for per-example selection and amplification of salient interactions.

Result: ML-DCN outperforms DCNv2, MaskNet, and alternatives in AUC and scaling efficiency on Pinterest ads data, with significant online metric improvements.

Conclusion: ML-DCN offers a compute-efficient, scalable solution for feature interaction, demonstrating superior performance and business impact in production.

Abstract: Deep learning recommendation systems rely on feature interaction modules to model complex user-item relationships across sparse categorical and dense features. In large-scale ad ranking, increasing model capacity is a promising path to improving both predictive performance and business outcomes, yet production serving budgets impose strict constraints on latency and FLOPs. This creates a central tension: we want interaction modules that both scale effectively with additional compute and remain compute-efficient at serving time. In this work, we study how to scale feature interaction modules under a fixed serving budget. We find that naively scaling DCNv2 and MaskNet, despite their widespread adoption in industry, yields rapidly diminishing offline gains in the Pinterest ads ranking system. To overcome aforementioned limitations, we propose ML-DCN, an interaction module that integrates an instance-conditioned mask into a low-rank crossing layer, enabling per-example selection and amplification of salient interaction directions while maintaining efficient computation. This novel architecture combines the strengths of DCNv2 and MaskNet, scales efficiently with increased compute, and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Experiments on a large internal Pinterest ads dataset show that ML-DCN achieves higher AUC than DCNv2, MaskNet, and recent scaling-oriented alternatives at matched FLOPs, and it scales more favorably overall as compute increases, exhibiting a stronger AUC-FLOPs trade-off. Finally, online A/B tests demonstrate statistically significant improvements in key ads metrics (including CTR and click-quality measures) and ML-DCN has been deployed in the production system with neutral serving cost.

*Camille Little,Madeline Navarro,Santiago Segarra,Genevera Allen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes two model-agnostic methods to measure feature importance in fairness contexts: permutation-based and occlusion-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of methods to assess feature contributions to fairness in machine learning models, which is critical for interpretability and equity.

Method: 1. Permutation-based: Compare fairness before/after permuting feature values. 2. Occlusion-based: Train models with/without a feature, simplified via minipatch learning.

Result: Empirical results show the methods are simple, scalable, and effective for various predictive tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics provide interpretable tools to quantify feature influence on fairness, aiding responsible ML development.

Abstract: As machine learning models increasingly impact society, their opaque nature poses challenges to trust and accountability, particularly in fairness contexts. Understanding how individual features influence model outcomes is crucial for building interpretable and equitable models. While feature importance metrics for accuracy are well-established, methods for assessing feature contributions to fairness remain underexplored. We propose two model-agnostic approaches to measure fair feature importance. First, we propose to compare model fairness before and after permuting feature values. This simple intervention-based approach decouples a feature and model predictions to measure its contribution to training. Second, we evaluate the fairness of models trained with and without a given feature. This occlusion-based score enjoys dramatic computational simplification via minipatch learning. Our empirical results reflect the simplicity and effectiveness of our proposed metrics for multiple predictive tasks. Both methods offer simple, scalable, and interpretable solutions to quantify the influence of features on fairness, providing new tools for responsible machine learning development.

### [176] [CausalGDP: Causality-Guided Diffusion Policies for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09207)
*Xiaofeng Xiao,Xiao Hu,Yang Ye,Xubo Yue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CausalGDP integrates causal reasoning into diffusion-based RL to improve policy performance by focusing on action components that causally influence rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion policies neglect causal relationships, limiting their ability to identify actions that truly drive high returns. Bridging this gap can enhance RL performance.

Method: CausalGDP learns a base diffusion policy and causal dynamical model from offline data, then continuously updates causal information to guide the diffusion process during real-time interaction.

Result: CausalGDP outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based and offline RL methods, particularly in complex, high-dimensional control tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating causality explicitly into diffusion policies enhances RL performance by focusing on causally impactful actions.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in a wide range of sequential decision-making problems. Recent diffusion-based policies further improve RL by modeling complex, high-dimensional action distributions. However, existing diffusion policies primarily rely on statistical associations and fail to explicitly account for causal relationships among states, actions, and rewards, limiting their ability to identify which action components truly cause high returns. In this paper, we propose Causality-guided Diffusion Policy (CausalGDP), a unified framework that integrates causal reasoning into diffusion-based RL. CausalGDP first learns a base diffusion policy and an initial causal dynamical model from offline data, capturing causal dependencies among states, actions, and rewards. During real-time interaction, the causal information is continuously updated and incorporated as a guidance signal to steer the diffusion process toward actions that causally influence future states and rewards. By explicitly considering causality beyond association, CausalGDP focuses policy optimization on action components that genuinely drive performance improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that CausalGDP consistently achieves competitive or superior performance over state-of-the-art diffusion-based and offline RL methods, especially in complex, high-dimensional control tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight multi-view approach for short-term load forecasting using single-value embeddings and scaled time-range inputs achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters, reducing overfitting and improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issues of overfitting and unstable forecasts in time series forecasting, especially in domains like energy, finance, and meteorology, by proposing a simpler yet effective model.

Method: Utilizes single-value embeddings and scaled time-range inputs, along with an embedding dropout mechanism, to efficiently capture temporally relevant features and prevent over-reliance on specific features.

Result: Demonstrates competitive performance across multiple datasets, including noisy or sparse data scenarios, with significantly fewer parameters and enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight approach offers a robust and interpretable solution for short-term load forecasting, outperforming more complex models in certain scenarios.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical task across domains such as energy, finance, and meteorology, where accurate predictions enable informed decision-making. While transformer-based and large-parameter models have recently achieved state-of-the-art results, their complexity can lead to overfitting and unstable forecasts, especially when older data points become less relevant. In this paper, we propose a lightweight multi-view approach to short-term load forecasting that leverages single-value embeddings and a scaled time-range input to capture temporally relevant features efficiently. We introduce an embedding dropout mechanism to prevent over-reliance on specific features and enhance interpretability. Our method achieves competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters, demonstrating robustness across multiple datasets, including scenarios with noisy or sparse data, and provides insights into the contributions of individual features to the forecast.

### [178] [Barycentric alignment for instance-level comparison of neural representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09225)
*Shreya Saha,Zoe Wanying He,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a barycentric alignment framework to compare neural network representations by eliminating symmetries, enabling instance-level similarity analysis and revealing insights into representational convergence/divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for comparing neural network representations struggle with symmetries like unit reordering or rotations, which obscure true equivalence. The paper aims to address this by creating a universal embedding space for meaningful comparisons.

Method: The authors propose a barycentric alignment framework that quotients out symmetries (e.g., rotations, reorderings) to enable instance-level similarity comparisons across models, brain representations, and unimodal vision/language models.

Result: The framework reveals systematic input properties predicting representational convergence/divergence across models. It also constructs universal embedding spaces for brain representations and shows that post-hoc alignment yields cross-modal similarity scores aligned with human judgments.

Conclusion: Instance-level comparison reveals phenomena missed by set-level metrics. Independently learned representations share geometric structure sufficient for human-aligned cross-modal comparison, suggesting underlying alignment even without explicit training.

Abstract: Comparing representations across neural networks is challenging because representations admit symmetries, such as arbitrary reordering of units or rotations of activation space, that obscure underlying equivalence between models. We introduce a barycentric alignment framework that quotients out these nuisance symmetries to construct a universal embedding space across many models. Unlike existing similarity measures, which summarize relationships over entire stimulus sets, this framework enables similarity to be defined at the level of individual stimuli, revealing inputs that elicit convergent versus divergent representations across models. Using this instance-level notion of similarity, we identify systematic input properties that predict representational convergence versus divergence across vision and language model families. We also construct universal embedding spaces for brain representations across individuals and cortical regions, enabling instance-level comparison of representational agreement across stages of the human visual hierarchy. Finally, we apply the same barycentric alignment framework to purely unimodal vision and language models and find that post-hoc alignment into a shared space yields image text similarity scores that closely track human cross-modal judgments and approach the performance of contrastively trained vision-language models. This strikingly suggests that independently learned representations already share sufficient geometric structure for human-aligned cross-modal comparison. Together, these results show that resolving representational similarity at the level of individual stimuli reveals phenomena that cannot be detected by set-level comparison metrics.

### [179] [Beyond the Unit Hypersphere: Embedding Magnitude in Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09229)
*Xincan Feng,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the role of embedding magnitude in contrastive learning, revealing its asymmetric utility in tasks like text retrieval and RAG, while showing it harms symmetric tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work overlooked the informational value of embedding magnitude, leaving gaps in understanding its impact on tasks.

Method: A systematic $2 \times 2$ ablation study independently controlling input and output normalization in text and vision models.

Result: Output magnitude correlates with relevance in text retrieval, benefiting reasoning tasks. Asymmetric roles of input/output magnitudes and task-specific impacts were identified.

Conclusion: The choice between cosine and dot product should align with task symmetry, offering cost-free improvements by removing unnecessary constraints.

Abstract: Cosine similarity is prevalent in contrastive learning, yet it makes an implicit assumption: embedding magnitude is noise. Prior work occasionally found dot product and cosine similarity comparable, but left unanswered WHAT information magnitude carries, WHEN it helps, and HOW to leverage it. We conduct a systematic study through a $2 \times 2$ ablation that independently controls input-side and output-side normalization across text and vision models. Our findings reveal three key insights. First, in text retrieval, output (document) magnitude strongly correlates with relevance (Cohen's $d$ up to 1.80), yielding the largest gains on reasoning-intensive tasks. Second, input and output magnitudes serve asymmetric roles: output magnitude directly scales similarity scores while input magnitude modulates training dynamics. Third, magnitude learning benefits asymmetric tasks (text retrieval, RAG) but harms symmetric tasks (STS, text-image alignment). These findings establish a task symmetry principle: the choice between cosine and dot product depends on whether the task has distinct input roles, enabling cost-free improvements by simply removing an unnecessary constraint.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores loss of plasticity in neural networks during continual learning, highlighting its artificial nature in abrupt task transitions and proposing gradual environmental changes as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unrealistic abrupt task transitions in existing plasticity research and demonstrate that loss of plasticity is an artifact of such settings.

Method: Investigates a gradually changing environment using input/output interpolation and task sampling, supported by theoretical and empirical analysis.

Result: Loss of plasticity is shown to be mitigated significantly when tasks change gradually, contrasting with abrupt transitions.

Conclusion: Gradual environmental changes can alleviate loss of plasticity, suggesting more realistic settings for future continual learning research.

Abstract: Continual learning has become a trending topic in machine learning. Recent studies have discovered an interesting phenomenon called loss of plasticity, referring to neural networks gradually losing the ability to learn new tasks. However, existing plasticity research largely relies on contrived settings with abrupt task transitions, which often do not reflect real-world environments. In this paper, we propose to investigate a gradually changing environment, and we simulate this by input/output interpolation and task sampling. We perform theoretical and empirical analysis, showing that the loss of plasticity is an artifact of abrupt tasks changes in the environment and can be largely mitigated if the world changes gradually.

### [181] [RAPID: Risk of Attribute Prediction-Induced Disclosure in Synthetic Microdata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09235)
*Matthias Templ,Oscar Thees,Roman Müller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAPID is a new risk measure quantifying inferential vulnerability in synthetic microdata, focusing on predicting sensitive attributes rather than classical identity disclosure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current identity disclosure measures are less useful for synthetic data; RAPID addresses inferential risk under realistic attack scenarios.

Method: RAPID uses predictive models trained on synthetic data to predict quasi-identifiers in real data, measuring risk for continuous and categorical attributes.

Result: RAPID provides interpretable, bounded risk metrics robust to class imbalance and independent of synthesizers, validated via simulations and real data.

Conclusion: RAPID offers a practical, attacker-realistic upper bound on attribute-inference risk, complementing existing utility and disclosure frameworks.

Abstract: Statistical data anonymization increasingly relies on fully synthetic microdata, for which classical identity disclosure measures are less informative than an adversary's ability to infer sensitive attributes from released data. We introduce RAPID (Risk of Attribute Prediction--Induced Disclosure), a disclosure risk measure that directly quantifies inferential vulnerability under a realistic attack model. An adversary trains a predictive model solely on the released synthetic data and applies it to real individuals' quasi-identifiers. For continuous sensitive attributes, RAPID reports the proportion of records whose predicted values fall within a specified relative error tolerance. For categorical attributes, we propose a baseline-normalized confidence score that measures how much more confident the attacker is about the true class than would be expected from class prevalence alone, and we summarize risk as the fraction of records exceeding a policy-defined threshold. This construction yields an interpretable, bounded risk metric that is robust to class imbalance, independent of any specific synthesizer, and applicable with arbitrary learning algorithms. We illustrate threshold calibration, uncertainty quantification, and comparative evaluation of synthetic data generators using simulations and real data. Our results show that RAPID provides a practical, attacker-realistic upper bound on attribute-inference disclosure risk that complements existing utility diagnostics and disclosure control frameworks.

### [182] [Feature salience -- not task-informativeness -- drives machine learning model explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09238)
*Benedict Clark,Marta Oliveira,Rick Wilming,Stefan Haufe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether the importance attributed by Explainable AI (XAI) methods is driven by informativeness or other factors like feature salience. Experiments on image classification tasks with watermarks show that salience, not informativeness, primarily drives importance attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to clarify whether XAI methods attribute importance based on informativeness of features or other factors like salience, novelty, or suppression.

Method: Deep learning models were trained on binary image classification tasks with varying watermark conditions (absent, class-dependent confounds, or noise). Five attribution methods were evaluated.

Result: Importance attribution was strongly influenced by feature salience, not informativeness, with watermarked areas consistently marked as important regardless of their role in the task.

Conclusion: XAI methods may conflate salience with informativeness, suggesting a need to reevaluate prior studies and workflows relying on feature attribution.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) promises to provide insight into machine learning models' decision processes, where one goal is to identify failures such as shortcut learning. This promise relies on the field's assumption that input features marked as important by an XAI must contain information about the target variable. However, it is unclear whether informativeness is indeed the main driver of importance attribution in practice, or if other data properties such as statistical suppression, novelty at test-time, or high feature salience substantially contribute. To clarify this, we trained deep learning models on three variants of a binary image classification task, in which translucent watermarks are either absent, act as class-dependent confounds, or represent class-independent noise. Results for five popular attribution methods show substantially elevated relative importance in watermarked areas (RIW) for all models regardless of the training setting ($R^2 \geq .45$). By contrast, whether the presence of watermarks is class-dependent or not only has a marginal effect on RIW ($R^2 \leq .03$), despite a clear impact impact on model performance and generalisation ability. XAI methods show similar behaviour to model-agnostic edge detection filters and attribute substantially less importance to watermarks when bright image intensities are encoded by smaller instead of larger feature values. These results indicate that importance attribution is most strongly driven by the salience of image structures at test time rather than statistical associations learned by machine learning models. Previous studies demonstrating successful XAI application should be reevaluated with respect to a possibly spurious concurrency of feature salience and informativeness, and workflows using feature attribution methods as building blocks should be scrutinised.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces STEM-GNN, a framework addressing the tradeoff between stability and generalization in deployed GNNs by using instance-conditional routing and stabilizing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deployed graph neural networks (GNNs) face challenges in balancing stability, generalization under distribution shifts, and robustness to perturbations.

Method: Proposes STEM-GNN, a pretrain-then-finetune framework with a mixture-of-experts encoder, vector-quantized token interface, and Lipschitz-regularized head.

Result: STEM-GNN achieves a stronger balance across nine benchmarks, improving robustness to shifts and corruptions while remaining competitive on clean graphs.

Conclusion: The framework effectively breaks the tradeoff ceiling in GNNs by stabilizing routing and bounding output amplification.

Abstract: Deployed graph neural networks (GNNs) are frozen at deployment yet must fit clean data, generalize under distribution shifts, and remain stable to perturbations. We show that static inference induces a fundamental tradeoff: improving stability requires reducing reliance on shift-sensitive features, leaving an irreducible worst-case generalization floor. Instance-conditional routing can break this ceiling, but is fragile because shifts can mislead routing and perturbations can make routing fluctuate. We capture these effects via two decompositions separating coverage vs selection, and base sensitivity vs fluctuation amplification. Based on these insights, we propose STEM-GNN, a pretrain-then-finetune framework with a mixture-of-experts encoder for diverse computation paths, a vector-quantized token interface to stabilize encoder-to-head signals, and a Lipschitz-regularized head to bound output amplification. Across nine node, link, and graph benchmarks, STEM-GNN achieves a stronger three-way balance, improving robustness to degree/homophily shifts and to feature/edge corruptions while remaining competitive on clean graphs.

*Benedict Clark,Stoyan Karastoyanov,Rick Wilming,Stefan Haufe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines if data whitening can improve the reliability of feature attribution methods in XAI by reducing errors from non-informative variables. It uses a benchmark and a theoretical model to evaluate the impact, finding mixed results depending on the method and data structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of unreliable feature attribution in XAI, particularly the misinterpretation caused by non-informative variables like suppressor features.

Method: The study evaluates 16 feature attribution methods combined with 5 whitening transforms using the XAI-TRIS benchmark and a linear classification problem.

Result: Whitening can improve explanation performance, but the effectiveness varies by method and model, highlighting the complexity of data non-linearities and preprocessing.

Conclusion: Data preprocessing, like whitening, plays a crucial role in enhancing XAI interpretability, but its impact depends on the context and method used.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to provide transparent insights into machine learning models, yet the reliability of many feature attribution methods remains a critical challenge. Prior research (Haufe et al., 2014; Wilming et al., 2022, 2023) has demonstrated that these methods often erroneously assign significant importance to non-informative variables, such as suppressor variables, leading to fundamental misinterpretations. Since statistical suppression is induced by feature dependencies, this study investigates whether data whitening, a common preprocessing technique for decorrelation, can mitigate such errors. Using the established XAI-TRIS benchmark (Clark et al., 2024b), which offers synthetic ground-truth data and quantitative measures of explanation correctness, we empirically evaluate 16 popular feature attribution methods applied in combination with 5 distinct whitening transforms. Additionally, we analyze a minimal linear two-dimensional classification problem (Wilming et al., 2023) to theoretically assess whether whitening can remove the impact of suppressor features from Bayes-optimal models. Our results indicate that, while specific whitening techniques can improve explanation performance, the degree of improvement varies substantially across XAI methods and model architectures. These findings highlight the complex relationship between data non-linearities, preprocessing quality, and attribution fidelity, underscoring the vital role of pre-processing techniques in enhancing model interpretability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The financial domain's high regulatory risk and severe class imbalance necessitate effective synthetic data generation methods that balance privacy and utility.

Method: The paper evaluates tabular data generators (autoencoders, GANs, diffusion, copula synthesizers) and introduces privacy-preserving implementations for GANs and autoencoders. It tests these on balanced and imbalanced datasets.

Result: The findings highlight the challenges of generating synthetic data from imbalanced datasets with mixed-type attributes, providing insights into privacy and utility tradeoffs.

Conclusion: The study offers valuable insights into synthetic data generation for financial datasets, emphasizing the need for tailored solutions to address class imbalance and privacy concerns.

Abstract: We explore the privacy-utility tradeoff of synthetic data generation schemes on tabular financial datasets, a domain characterized by high regulatory risk and severe class imbalance. We consider representative tabular data generators, including autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, diffusion, and copula synthesizers. To address the challenges of the financial domain, we provide novel privacy-preserving implementations of GAN and autoencoder synthesizers. We evaluate whether and how well the generators simultaneously achieve data quality, downstream utility, and privacy, with comparison across balanced and imbalanced input datasets. Our results offer insight into the distinct challenges of generating synthetic data from datasets that exhibit severe class imbalance and mixed-type attributes.

TL;DR: This paper presents the largest collection of Southern Resident Killer Whale (SRKW) acoustic data, using a novel active learning strategy to detect marine mammals. The resulting detectors outperform existing methods, and the dataset is the most extensive available for SRKW research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of comprehensive acoustic data for SRKWs, a critically endangered species, to support conservation efforts and habitat usage surveys.

Method: A weakly-supervised, positive-unlabelled, active learning strategy was used to identify marine mammal sounds from over 30 years of hydrophone data. Transformer-based detectors were developed and tested on multiple datasets.

Result: The detectors achieved high specificity and sensitivity. The dataset includes thousands of hours of SRKW and other marine mammal data, surpassing existing collections in size and utility.

Conclusion: This dataset is a valuable resource for conservation, habitat studies, and unsupervised machine learning, with publicly available labels and audio data.

Abstract: This work presents the largest curation of Southern Resident Killer Whale (SRKW) acoustic data to date, also containing other marine mammals in their environment. We systematically search all available public archival hydrophone data within the SRKW habitat (over 30 years of audio data). The search consists of a weakly-supervised, positive-unlabelled, active learning strategy to identify all instances of marine mammals. The resulting transformer-based detectors outperform state-of-the-art detectors on the DEEPAL, DCLDE-2026, and two newly introduced expert-annotated datasets in terms of accuracy, energy efficiency, and speed. The detection model has a specificity of 0-28.8% at 95% sensitivity. Our multiclass species classifier obtains a top-1 accuracy of 42.1% (11 train classes, 4 test classes) and our ecotype classifier obtains a top-1 accuracy of 43.0% (4 train classes, 5 test classes) on the DCLDE-2026 dataset.
  We yield 919 hours of SRKW data, 230 hours of Bigg's orca data, 1374 hours of orca data from unlabelled ecotypes, 1501 hours of humpback data, 88 hours of sea lion data, 246 hours of pacific white-sided dolphin data, and over 784 hours of unspecified marine mammal data. This SRKW dataset is larger than DCLDE-2026, Ocean Networks Canada, and OrcaSound combined. The curated species labels are available under CC-BY 4.0 license, and the corresponding audio data are available under the licenses of the original owners. The comprehensive nature of this dataset makes it suitable for unsupervised machine translation, habitat usage surveys, and conservation endeavours for this critically endangered ecotype.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Laplacian mechanism to replace attention in transformers, aiming to improve token variance control and achieve ideal token geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance transformer models by providing more direct control over token variance and achieving better token representation geometry.

Method: Replacing the attention mechanism with a Laplacian mechanism and evaluating its impact using PCA, cosine similarity, variance analysis, and Neural Collapse metrics.

Result: The Laplacian mechanism consistently improves transformer performance across benchmarks and reshapes token embeddings toward maximal separability, collapsing tokens by class and exhibiting Neural Collapse.

Conclusion: The Laplacian mechanism effectively improves token representation geometry and model performance, supporting the conjecture of ideal token geometry.

Abstract: Transformers leverage attention, the residual connection, and layer normalization to control the variance of token representations. We propose to modify attention into a Laplacian mechanism that gives the model more direct control over token variance. We conjecture that this helps transformers achieve the ideal token geometry. To investigate our conjecture, we first show that incorporating the Laplacian mechanism into transformers induces consistent improvements across benchmarks in computer vision and language. Next, we study how the Laplacian mechanism impacts the geometry of token representations using various tools: 1) principal component analysis, 2) cosine similarity metric, 3) analysis of variance, and 4) Neural Collapse metrics. Our investigation shows that the Laplacian mechanism reshapes token embeddings toward a geometry of maximal separability: tokens collapse according to their classes, and the class means exhibit Neural Collapse.

Second, we propose estimators of the risk-sensitive policy gradient for each of the aforementioned risk measures, and establish $\mathcal{O}\left(1/m\right)$ mean-squared error bounds for our estimators, where $m$ is the number of trajectories. Further, under standard assumptions for policy gradient-type algorithms, we establish smoothness of the risk-sensitive objective, in turn leading to stationary convergence rate bounds for the overall risk-sensitive policy gradient algorithm that we propose. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to validate the theoretical findings on popular RL benchmarks.

### [189] [Stabilizing Physics-Informed Consistency Models via Structure-Preserving Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09303)
*Che-Chia Chang,Chen-Yang Dai,Te-Sheng Lin,Ming-Chih Lai,Chieh-Hsin Lai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a physics-informed consistency modeling framework for solving PDEs efficiently through few-step generative inference, addressing stability challenges with a two-stage training strategy and a two-step residual objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the stability issues in physics-constrained consistency training, where PDE residuals can lead to trivial or degenerate solutions, degrading the learned data distribution.

Method: A structure-preserving two-stage training strategy decouples distribution learning from physics enforcement, freezing the coefficient decoder during fine-tuning, and a two-step residual objective enforces physical consistency on refined generative trajectories.

Result: The framework enables stable, high-fidelity inference for unconditional generation and forward problems, achieving accuracy comparable to diffusion baselines with significantly lower computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient and stable solution for PDE-based generative inference, with potential applications in forward problems and unconditional generation.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed consistency modeling framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) via fast, few-step generative inference. We identify a key stability challenge in physics-constrained consistency training, where PDE residuals can drive the model toward trivial or degenerate solutions, degrading the learned data distribution. To address this, we introduce a structure-preserving two-stage training strategy that decouples distribution learning from physics enforcement by freezing the coefficient decoder during physics-informed fine-tuning. We further propose a two-step residual objective that enforces physical consistency on refined, structurally valid generative trajectories rather than noisy single-step predictions. The resulting framework enables stable, high-fidelity inference for both unconditional generation and forward problems. We demonstrate that forward solutions can be obtained via a projection-based zero-shot inpainting procedure, achieving consistent accuracy of diffusion baselines with orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost.

### [190] [Statistical Roughness-Informed Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09304)
*Mohammad Partohaghighi,Roummel Marcia,Bruce J. West,YangQuan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SRAGU, a machine unlearning algorithm that uses spectral diagnostics to allocate updates across layers, improving stability and utility retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine unlearning struggles with large or adversarial deletions due to layer-wise heterogeneity, leading to catastrophic forgetting or instability.

Method: SRAGU employs layer-wise statistical roughness analysis via heavy-tailed spectral diagnostics to reweight updates, focusing on stable layers.

Result: SRAGU outperforms naive methods by concentrating updates in stable layers, reducing instability and leakage.

Conclusion: SRAGU provides a robust framework for machine unlearning, especially under challenging deletion scenarios.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of a designated forget set from a trained model while preserving utility on the retained data. In modern deep networks, approximate unlearning frequently fails under large or adversarial deletions due to pronounced layer-wise heterogeneity: some layers exhibit stable, well-regularized representations while others are brittle, undertrained, or overfit, so naive update allocation can trigger catastrophic forgetting or unstable dynamics. We propose Statistical-Roughness Adaptive Gradient Unlearning (SRAGU), a mechanism-first unlearning algorithm that reallocates unlearning updates using layer-wise statistical roughness operationalized via heavy-tailed spectral diagnostics of layer weight matrices. Starting from an Adaptive Gradient Unlearning (AGU) sensitivity signal computed on the forget set, SRAGU estimates a WeightWatcher-style heavy-tailed exponent for each layer, maps it to a bounded spectral stability weight, and uses this stability signal to spectrally reweight the AGU sensitivities before applying the same minibatch update form. This concentrates unlearning motion in spectrally stable layers while damping updates in unstable or overfit layers, improving stability under hard deletions. We evaluate unlearning via behavioral alignment to a gold retrained reference model trained from scratch on the retained data, using empirical prediction-divergence and KL-to-gold proxies on a forget-focused query set; we additionally report membership inference auditing as a complementary leakage signal, treating forget-set points as should-be-forgotten members during evaluation.

*Pei-Chi Pan,Yingbin Liang,Sen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reasoning-Aligned Reinforcement Learning (RARL), a framework addressing LLM challenges through systematic reward design, emphasizing trustworthiness and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LLM reasoning reliability by understanding the critical role of reward modeling in addressing evaluation bias, hallucination, and other core challenges.

Method: Proposes RARL, a framework unifying reward paradigms for multi-step reasoning, analyzing reward mechanisms, hacking, and benchmark vulnerabilities.

Result: RARL systematizes reward design, exposes reward hacking risks, and clarifies the link between rewards and reasoning alignment.

Conclusion: Reward modeling is pivotal for trustworthy LLMs; RARL provides a roadmap for robust, verifiable reasoning models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate transformative potential, yet their reasoning remains inconsistent and unreliable. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning is a key mechanism for improvement, but its effectiveness is fundamentally governed by reward design. Despite its importance, the relationship between reward modeling and core LLM challenges--such as evaluation bias, hallucination, distribution shift, and efficient learning--remains poorly understood. This work argues that reward modeling is not merely an implementation detail but a central architect of reasoning alignment, shaping what models learn, how they generalize, and whether their outputs can be trusted. We introduce Reasoning-Aligned Reinforcement Learning (RARL), a unifying framework that systematizes diverse reward paradigms for multi-step reasoning. Within this framework, we present a taxonomy of reward mechanisms, analyze reward hacking as a pervasive failure mode, and examine how reward signals unify challenges ranging from inference-time scaling to hallucination mitigation. We further critically evaluate existing benchmarks, highlighting vulnerabilities such as data contamination and reward misalignment, and outline directions for more robust evaluation. By integrating fragmented research threads and clarifying the interplay between reward design and fundamental reasoning capabilities, this work provides a foundational roadmap for building reasoning models that are robust, verifiable, and trustworthy.

*Thi Minh Chau Nguyen,Minh Hieu Nguyen,Duc Anh Nguyen,Xuan Huong Tran,Thanh Trung Huynh,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LUMOS enhances federated sequential recommendation by using LLMs locally to generate diverse sequence variants for better model training without compromising privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FedSeqRec methods suffer from fragmented and noisy user data, leading to limited model quality. Existing solutions either lack semantic diversity or increase overhead.

Method: LUMOS employs LLMs as local semantic generators to create three sequence variants: future-oriented trajectories, semantically equivalent rephrasings, and preference-inconsistent counterfactuals. These are optimized via tri-view contrastive learning.

Result: LUMOS outperforms centralized and federated baselines on HR@20 and NDCG@20 across three benchmarks, showing robustness in noisy settings.

Conclusion: LLM-driven semantic generation effectively improves federated recommendation, balancing privacy and performance.

Abstract: Federated sequential recommendation (FedSeqRec) aims to perform next-item prediction while keeping user data decentralised, yet model quality is frequently constrained by fragmented, noisy, and homogeneous interaction logs stored on individual devices. Many existing approaches attempt to compensate through manual data augmentation or additional server-side constraints, but these strategies either introduce limited semantic diversity or increase system overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose \textbf{LUMOS}, a parameter-isolated FedSeqRec architecture that integrates large language models (LLMs) as \emph{local semantic generators}. Instead of sharing gradients or auxiliary parameters, LUMOS privately invokes an on-device LLM to construct three complementary sequence variants from each user history: (i) \emph{future-oriented} trajectories that infer plausible behavioural continuations, (ii) \emph{semantically equivalent rephrasings} that retain user intent while diversifying interaction patterns, and (iii) \emph{preference-inconsistent counterfactuals} that serve as informative negatives. These synthesized sequences are jointly encoded within the federated backbone through a tri-view contrastive optimisation scheme, enabling richer representation learning without exposing sensitive information. Experimental results across three public benchmarks show that LUMOS achieves consistent gains over competitive centralised and federated baselines on HR@20 and NDCG@20. In addition, the use of semantically grounded positive signals and counterfactual negatives improves robustness under noisy and adversarial environments, even without dedicated server-side protection modules. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven semantic generation as a new paradigm for advancing privacy-preserving federated recommendation.

*Runa Eschenhagen,Anna Cai,Tsung-Hsien Lee,Hao-Jun Michael Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Shampoo outperforms Muon in token efficiency, similar to Adam vs. Signum, with its benefits tied to weight matrix updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the relationship and data efficiency between Shampoo/Muon optimizers in neural networks.

Method: Extensive experiments on language models, comparing Shampoo and Muon's token efficiency and decomposing Shampoo's updates.

Result: Shampoo achieves higher token efficiency than Muon; its benefits stem from weight matrix updates, not other factors.

Conclusion: Shampoo's success is due to time-averaged semi-orthogonal updates, offering a new perspective beyond variance adaptation.

Abstract: Optimizers leveraging the matrix structure in neural networks, such as Shampoo and Muon, are more data-efficient than element-wise algorithms like Adam and Signum. While in specific settings, Shampoo and Muon reduce to spectral descent analogous to how Adam and Signum reduce to sign descent, their general relationship and relative data efficiency under controlled settings remain unclear. Through extensive experiments on language models, we demonstrate that Shampoo achieves higher token efficiency than Muon, mirroring Adam's advantage over Signum. We show that Shampoo's update applied to weight matrices can be decomposed into an adapted Muon update. Consistent with this, Shampoo's benefits can be exclusively attributed to its application to weight matrices, challenging interpretations agnostic to parameter shapes. This admits a new perspective that also avoids shortcomings of related interpretations based on variance adaptation and whitening: rather than enforcing semi-orthogonality as in spectral descent, Shampoo's updates are time-averaged semi-orthogonal in expectation.

### [194] [Effective MoE-based LLM Compression by Exploiting Heterogeneous Inter-Group Experts Routing Frequency and Information Density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09316)
*Zhendong Mi,Yixiao Chen,Pu Zhao,Xiaodong Yu,Hao Wang,Yanzhi Wang,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RFID-MoE is a framework for compressing Mixture-of-Experts LLMs by leveraging heterogeneous expert importance metrics, outperforming existing methods in performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE-based LLMs face memory issues due to multiple expert networks, and existing SVD-based compression methods overlook heterogeneous expert utilization.

Method: RFID-MoE uses a fused metric of routing frequency and information density for adaptive rank allocation and reconstructs residuals via sparse projection.

Result: RFID-MoE achieves better perplexity (16.92) and zero-shot accuracy (8% improvement) compared to baselines like MoBE and D2-MoE.

Conclusion: RFID-MoE effectively compresses MoE models while maintaining performance, making it practical for deployment.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved superior performance, yet the massive memory overhead caused by storing multiple expert networks severely hinders their practical deployment. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as a promising post-training technique; however, most existing methods apply uniform rank allocation or rely solely on static weight properties. This overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in expert utilization observed in MoE models, where frequent routing patterns and intrinsic information density vary significantly across experts. In this work, we propose RFID-MoE, an effective framework for MoE compression by exploiting heterogeneous Routing Frequency and Information Density. We first introduce a fused metric that combines expert activation frequency with effective rank to measure expert importance, adaptively allocating higher ranks to critical expert groups under a fixed budget. Moreover, instead of discarding compression residuals, we reconstruct them via a parameter-efficient sparse projection mechanism to recover lost information with minimal parameter overhead. Extensive experiments on representative MoE LLMs (e.g., Qwen3, DeepSeekMoE) across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that RFID-MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods like MoBE and D2-MoE. Notably, RFID-MoE achieves a perplexity of 16.92 on PTB with the Qwen3-30B model at a 60% compression ratio, reducing perplexity by over 8.0 compared to baselines, and improves zero-shot accuracy on HellaSwag by approximately 8%.

*Ya-Chi Chu,Alkiviades Boukas,Madeleine Udell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SnareNet is a feasibility-controlled neural network architecture that ensures outputs meet input-dependent nonlinear constraints using a differentiable repair layer and adaptive relaxation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks often violate constraints, necessitating a method to ensure predictions meet physical, operational, or safety requirements.

Method: SnareNet uses a differentiable repair layer to iteratively steer outputs toward feasibility and adaptive relaxation to stabilize training.

Result: SnareNet outperforms prior work in optimization-learning and trajectory planning, achieving better objective quality and reliable constraint satisfaction.

Conclusion: SnareNet effectively balances early exploration and strict feasibility, making it a robust solution for constraint-aware learning.

Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly used as surrogate solvers and control policies, but unconstrained predictions can violate physical, operational, or safety requirements. We propose SnareNet, a feasibility-controlled architecture for learning mappings whose outputs must satisfy input-dependent nonlinear constraints. SnareNet appends a differentiable repair layer that navigates in the constraint map's range space, steering iterates toward feasibility and producing a repaired output that satisfies constraints to a user-specified tolerance. To stabilize end-to-end training, we introduce adaptive relaxation, which designs a relaxed feasible set that snares the neural network at initialization and shrinks it into the feasible set, enabling early exploration and strict feasibility later in training. On optimization-learning and trajectory planning benchmarks, SnareNet consistently attains improved objective quality while satisfying constraints more reliably than prior work.

### [196] [Priority-Aware Shapley Value](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09326)
*Kiljae Lee,Ziqi Liu,Weijing Tang,Yuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Priority-Aware Shapley Value (PASV) to address limitations of traditional Shapley values by incorporating precedence constraints and priority weights, offering a more flexible and accurate valuation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Shapley values assume contributors are interchangeable, which fails in scenarios with dependencies or when contributions need adjustment (e.g., trust, risk). PASV aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: The authors propose PASV, integrating hard precedence constraints and soft priority weights. They develop an adjacent-swap Metropolis-Hastings sampler for scalable estimation.

Result: PASV outperforms traditional Shapley values in data valuation (MNIST/CIFAR10) and feature attribution (Census Income), providing more accurate and structure-faithful allocations.

Conclusion: PASV offers a versatile and principled approach to data valuation and feature attribution, addressing dependencies and priority adjustments effectively.

Abstract: Shapley values are widely used for model-agnostic data valuation and feature attribution, yet they implicitly assume contributors are interchangeable. This can be problematic when contributors are dependent (e.g., reused/augmented data or causal feature orderings) or when contributions should be adjusted by factors such as trust or risk. We propose Priority-Aware Shapley Value (PASV), which incorporates both hard precedence constraints and soft, contributor-specific priority weights. PASV is applicable to general precedence structures, recovers precedence-only and weight-only Shapley variants as special cases, and is uniquely characterized by natural axioms. We develop an efficient adjacent-swap Metropolis-Hastings sampler for scalable Monte Carlo estimation and analyze limiting regimes induced by extreme priority weights. Experiments on data valuation (MNIST/CIFAR10) and feature attribution (Census Income) demonstrate more structure-faithful allocations and a practical sensitivity analysis via our proposed "priority sweeping".

*Jiaming Liu,Cheng Ding,Daoqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to predict stroke onset using pre-stroke PPG data mined from clinical datasets, validating PPG's predictive potential hours before stroke occurs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of pre-hospital physiological data limits early stroke prediction. This study addresses this by analyzing PPG waveforms from patients who had strokes during hospitalization.

Method: An LLM-assisted pipeline extracts stroke onset times from clinical notes, followed by physician validation. Hemodynamic features from PPG are then used with a ResNet-1D model for prediction.

Result: The model achieved high F1-scores (up to 0.9888) predicting stroke 4-6 hours before onset, demonstrating PPG's predictive capability.

Conclusion: Passively acquired PPG signals can enable proactive stroke surveillance, improving patient outcomes by shifting from post-event recognition to early warning.

Abstract: The absence of pre-hospital physiological data in standard clinical datasets fundamentally constrains the early prediction of stroke, as patients typically present only after stroke has occurred, leaving the predictive value of continuous monitoring signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) unvalidated. In this work, we overcome this limitation by focusing on a rare but clinically critical cohort - patients who suffered stroke during hospitalization while already under continuous monitoring - thereby enabling the first large-scale analysis of pre-stroke PPG waveforms aligned to verified onset times. Using MIMIC-III and MC-MED, we develop an LLM-assisted data mining pipeline to extract precise in-hospital stroke onset timestamps from unstructured clinical notes, followed by physician validation, identifying 176 patients (MIMIC) and 158 patients (MC-MED) with high-quality synchronized pre-onset PPG data, respectively. We then extract hemodynamic features from PPG and employ a ResNet-1D model to predict impending stroke across multiple early-warning horizons. The model achieves F1-scores of 0.7956, 0.8759, and 0.9406 at 4, 5, and 6 hours prior to onset on MIMIC-III, and, without re-tuning, reaches 0.9256, 0.9595, and 0.9888 on MC-MED for the same horizons. These results provide the first empirical evidence from real-world clinical data that PPG contains predictive signatures of stroke several hours before onset, demonstrating that passively acquired physiological signals can support reliable early warning, supporting a shift from post-event stroke recognition to proactive, physiology-based surveillance that may materially improve patient outcomes in routine clinical care.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MacrOData introduces a large-scale benchmark suite for tabular outlier detection, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks like AdBench by offering 2,446 diverse datasets across three components (OddBench, OvrBench, SynBench).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing outlier detection benchmarks are limited in scale and diversity, restricting fair evaluation of methods. MacrOData aims to provide a comprehensive, statistically robust benchmark for tabular outlier detection.

Method: MacrOData comprises three curated components: OddBench (790 real-world semantic anomaly datasets), OvrBench (856 real-world statistical outlier datasets), and SynBench (800 synthetic datasets). It includes standardized splits, public/private partitions, and semantic metadata.

Result: The benchmark enables robust evaluation of classical, deep, and foundation models across diverse configurations. Extensive experiments provide empirical findings and practical guidelines.

Conclusion: MacrOData offers a scalable, diverse, and standardized benchmark for outlier detection, supporting future research with open-sourced datasets and an online leaderboard.

Abstract: Quality benchmarks are essential for fairly and accurately tracking scientific progress and enabling practitioners to make informed methodological choices. Outlier detection (OD) on tabular data underpins numerous real-world applications, yet existing OD benchmarks remain limited. The prominent OD benchmark AdBench is the de facto standard in the literature, yet comprises only 57 datasets. In addition to other shortcomings discussed in this work, its small scale severely restricts diversity and statistical power. We introduce MacrOData, a large-scale benchmark suite for tabular OD comprising three carefully curated components: OddBench, with 790 datasets containing real-world semantic anomalies; OvrBench, with 856 datasets featuring real-world statistical outliers; and SynBench, with 800 synthetically generated datasets spanning diverse data priors and outlier archetypes. Owing to its scale and diversity, MacrOData enables comprehensive and statistically robust evaluation of tabular OD methods. Our benchmarks further satisfy several key desiderata: We provide standardized train/test splits for all datasets, public/private benchmark partitions with held-out test labels for the latter reserved toward an online leaderboard, and annotate our datasets with semantic metadata. We conduct extensive experiments across all benchmarks, evaluating a broad range of OD methods comprising classical, deep, and foundation models, over diverse hyperparameter configurations. We report detailed empirical findings, practical guidelines, as well as individual performances as references for future research. All benchmarks containing 2,446 datasets combined are open-sourced, along with a publicly accessible leaderboard hosted at https://huggingface.co/MacrOData-CMU.

### [199] [Large Language Models for Designing Participatory Budgeting Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09349)
*Nguyen Thach,Xingchen Sha,Hau Chan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLMRule, a framework using LLMs in evolutionary search to automate the design of participatory budgeting rules, showing improved utility over handcrafted rules while maintaining fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Participatory budgeting (PB) rules traditionally require extensive domain knowledge and face trade-offs between utility and fairness. The paper aims to overcome these challenges by leveraging LLMs for automated rule design.

Method: The authors propose LLMRule, which integrates LLMs into an evolutionary search procedure to generate PB rules. The approach is inspired by similarities between PB rules and classical knapsack problems.

Result: Evaluation on 600+ real-world PB instances from multiple countries shows that LLM-generated rules outperform handcrafted ones in utility while maintaining comparable fairness.

Conclusion: The LLMRule framework successfully automates PB rule design, achieving better utility without sacrificing fairness, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in algorithmic design for public decision-making.

Abstract: Participatory budgeting (PB) is a democratic paradigm for deciding the funding of public projects given the residents' preferences, which has been adopted in numerous cities across the world. The main focus of PB is designing rules, functions that return feasible budget allocations for a set of projects subject to some budget constraint. Designing PB rules that optimize both utility and fairness objectives based on agent preferences had been challenging due to the extensive domain knowledge required and the proven trade-off between the two notions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for automated algorithmic design. Given the resemblance of PB rules to algorithms for classical knapsack problems, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework, named LLMRule, that addresses the limitations of existing works by incorporating LLMs into an evolutionary search procedure for automating the design of PB rules. Our experimental results, evaluated on more than 600 real-world PB instances obtained from the U.S., Canada, Poland, and the Netherlands with different representations of agent preferences, demonstrate that the LLM-generated rules generally outperform existing handcrafted rules in terms of overall utility while still maintaining a similar degree of fairness.

TL;DR: LaPha trains AlphaZero-like LLM agents in Poincaré latent space, achieving significant accuracy improvements on MATH-500 and AIME datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLM agent training by leveraging hyperbolic geometry for better search processes and correctness verification.

Method: LaPha uses Poincaré latent space, hyperbolic geodesic distance for correctness, node potential for rewards, and a lightweight value head for scaling.

Result: Improves Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B from 66.0% to 88.2% on MATH-500; achieves 60.0% on AIME'24 and 53.3% on AIME'25 with LaPha-7B.

Conclusion: LaPha effectively enhances LLM agent performance through hyperbolic space training and self-guided scaling.

Abstract: We propose LaPha, a method for training AlphaZero-like LLM agents in a Poincaré latent space. Under LaPha, the search process can be visualized as a tree rooted at the prompt and growing outward from the origin toward the boundary of the Poincaré ball, where negative curvature provides exponentially increasing capacity with radius. Using hyperbolic geodesic distance to rule-verified correctness, we define a node potential and assign dense process rewards by potential differences. We further attach a lightweight value head on the same shared latent space, enabling self-guided test-time scaling with almost no additional overhead. On MATH-500, LaPha improves Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B from 66.0% to 88.2%. With value-head-guided search, LaPha-1.5B reaches 56.7% accuracy on AIME'24, and LaPha-7B further achieves 60.0% on AIME'24 and 53.3% on AIME'25.

TL;DR: SL-SAM reduces computation cost in SAM by dynamically selecting layers for perturbation and update steps, achieving comparable performance while activating fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM's high computation cost due to extra parameter perturbation steps limits its practical use.

Method: SL-SAM uses a multi-armed bandit approach to dynamically select layers for perturbation and update, reducing backpropagation complexity.

Result: SL-SAM matches state-of-the-art performance while activating significantly fewer parameters (47%, 22%, 21%) compared to vanilla SAM (100%).

Conclusion: SL-SAM efficiently balances performance and computation cost, making SAM more practical for tasks like LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) seeks the minima with a flat loss landscape to improve the generalization performance in machine learning tasks, including fine-tuning. However, its extra parameter perturbation step doubles the computation cost, which becomes the bottleneck of SAM in the practical implementation. In this work, we propose an approach SL-SAM to break this bottleneck by introducing the sparse technique to layers. Our key innovation is to frame the dynamic selection of layers for both the gradient ascent (perturbation) and descent (update) steps as a multi-armed bandit problem. At the beginning of each iteration, SL-SAM samples a part of the layers of the model according to the gradient norm to participate in the backpropagation of the following parameter perturbation and update steps, thereby reducing the computation complexity. We then provide the analysis to guarantee the convergence of SL-SAM. In the experiments of fine-tuning models in several tasks, SL-SAM achieves the performances comparable to the state-of-the-art baselines, including a \#1 rank on LLM fine-tuning. Meanwhile, SL-SAM significantly reduces the ratio of active parameters in backpropagation compared to vanilla SAM (SL-SAM activates 47\%, 22\% and 21\% parameters on the vision, moderate and large language model respectively while vanilla SAM always activates 100\%), verifying the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: Extending Self-Predictive Representations (SPR) to streaming RL improves sample efficiency by resolving gradient conflicts, outperforming baselines and learning richer representations without a replay buffer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Streaming RL's transient data makes agents sample-inefficient, necessitating better representation learning from limited observations.

Method: Introduces SPR with orthogonal gradient updates to mitigate instabilities from correlated samples in streaming RL.

Result: Outperforms baselines in Atari, MinAtar, and Octax; learns richer representations efficiently on few CPU cores.

Conclusion: The method bridges the performance gap caused by lacking a replay buffer, enhancing streaming RL efficiency.

Abstract: In streaming Reinforcement Learning (RL), transitions are observed and discarded immediately after a single update. While this minimizes resource usage for on-device applications, it makes agents notoriously sample-inefficient, since value-based losses alone struggle to extract meaningful representations from transient data. We propose extending Self-Predictive Representations (SPR) to the streaming pipeline to maximize the utility of every observed frame. However, due to the highly correlated samples induced by the streaming regime, naively applying this auxiliary loss results in training instabilities. Thus, we introduce orthogonal gradient updates relative to the momentum target and resolve gradient conflicts arising from streaming-specific optimizers. Validated across the Atari, MinAtar, and Octax suites, our approach systematically outperforms existing streaming baselines. Latent-space analysis, including t-SNE visualizations and effective-rank measurements, confirms that our method learns significantly richer representations, bridging the performance gap caused by the absence of a replay buffer, while remaining efficient enough to train on just a few CPU cores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by language generation tasks where prompts may have multiple valid completions.

Method: Analyzes three feedback models in both realizable and agnostic settings, using combinatorial dimensions.

Result: Characterizes optimal mistake bounds and establishes a trichotomy of regret bounds.

Conclusion: Results also provide sample complexity bounds for batch setups based on combinatorial dimensions.

Abstract: We study an online learning problem with multiple correct answers, where each instance admits a set of valid labels, and in each round the learner must output a valid label for the queried example. This setting is motivated by language generation tasks, in which a prompt may admit many acceptable completions, but not every completion is acceptable. We study this problem under three feedback models. For each model, we characterize the optimal mistake bound in the realizable setting using an appropriate combinatorial dimension. We then establish a trichotomy of regret bounds across the three models in the agnostic setting. Our results also imply sample complexity bounds for the batch setup that depend on the respective combinatorial dimensions.

TL;DR: A diffusion-based pretraining framework is proposed for brain signal foundation models, addressing limitations of naive augmentation and graph-level readout methods by preserving semantic connectivity and capturing global structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for graph-based pretraining in brain signals disrupt meaningful connectivity patterns and fail to capture global structural information, limiting representation robustness.

Method: The proposed framework uses diffusion to guide structure-aware augmentation (dropping/masking) and enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments on neuroimaging datasets (25,000+ subjects, 60,000+ scans) show consistent performance improvements across various mental disorders and brain atlases.

Conclusion: The diffusion-based framework effectively preserves brain graph semantics and captures global structure, outperforming existing methods in pretraining transferable representations for brain signals.

Abstract: With the growing interest in foundation models for brain signals, graph-based pretraining has emerged as a promising paradigm for learning transferable representations from connectome data. However, existing contrastive and masked autoencoder methods typically rely on naive random dropping or masking for augmentation, which is ill-suited for brain graphs and hypergraphs as it disrupts semantically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, commonly used graph-level readout and reconstruction schemes fail to capture global structural information, limiting the robustness of learned representations. In this work, we propose a unified diffusion-based pretraining framework that addresses both limitations. First, diffusion is designed to guide structure-aware dropping and masking strategies, preserving brain graph semantics while maintaining effective pretraining diversity. Second, diffusion enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction by allowing graph embeddings and masked nodes to aggregate information from globally related regions. Extensive experiments across multiple neuroimaging datasets with over 25,000 subjects and 60,000 scans involving various mental disorders and brain atlases demonstrate consistent performance improvements.

### [205] [Taming the Monster Every Context: Complexity Measure and Unified Framework for Offline-Oracle Efficient Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09456)
*Hao Qin,Chicheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces OE2D, an algorithmic framework for contextual bandit learning that reduces the problem to offline regression, achieving near-optimal regret with minimal oracle calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify contextual bandit learning by reducing it to offline regression, enabling efficient handling of large action spaces.

Method: OE2D uses an "exploitative F-design" action distribution to balance exploration and exploitation, leveraging a new complexity measure, DOEC.

Result: OE2D achieves O(log(T)) oracle calls for unknown T and O(loglog(T)) for known T, with bounded regret in certain settings.

Conclusion: OE2D bridges offline- and online-oracle efficient contextual bandit algorithms, offering efficient performance with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We propose an algorithmic framework, Offline Estimation to Decisions (OE2D), that reduces contextual bandit learning with general reward function approximation to offline regression. The framework allows near-optimal regret for contextual bandits with large action spaces with $O(log(T))$ calls to an offline regression oracle over $T$ rounds, and makes $O(loglog(T))$ calls when $T$ is known. The design of OE2D algorithm generalizes Falcon~\citep{simchi2022bypassing} and its linear reward version~\citep[][Section 4]{xu2020upper} in that it chooses an action distribution that we term ``exploitative F-design'' that simultaneously guarantees low regret and good coverage that trades off exploration and exploitation. Central to our regret analysis is a new complexity measure, the Decision-Offline Estimation Coefficient (DOEC), which we show is bounded in bounded Eluder dimension per-context and smoothed regret settings. We also establish a relationship between DOEC and Decision Estimation Coefficient (DEC)~\citep{foster2021statistical}, bridging the design principles of offline- and online-oracle efficient contextual bandit algorithms for the first time.

### [206] [Scalable and Reliable State-Aware Inference of High-Impact N-k Contingencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09461)
*Lihao Mai,Chenhan Xiao,Yang Weng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable framework using conditional diffusion models and graph neural networks to efficiently identify high-impact power grid contingencies without exhaustive enumeration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for assessing higher-order contingencies in power grids are computationally infeasible, leading to reliance on heuristic screening with uncertain reliability.

Method: The framework uses a conditional diffusion model to generate contingencies and a topology-aware graph neural network trained on base and N-1 cases for efficient offline sample construction.

Result: Tests on IEEE systems show the approach evaluates higher-severity contingencies more reliably than uniform sampling under limited computational budgets.

Conclusion: The framework offers scalable, state-aware contingency inference with controllable coverage guarantees, reducing computational effort while improving reliability.

Abstract: Increasing penetration of inverter-based resources, flexible loads, and rapidly changing operating conditions make higher-order $N\!-\!k$ contingency assessment increasingly important but computationally prohibitive. Exhaustive evaluation of all outage combinations using AC power-flow or ACOPF is infeasible in routine operation. This fact forces operators to rely on heuristic screening methods whose ability to consistently retain all critical contingencies is not formally established. This paper proposes a scalable, state-aware contingency inference framework designed to directly generate high-impact $N\!-\!k$ outage scenarios without enumerating the combinatorial contingency space. The framework employs a conditional diffusion model to produce candidate contingencies tailored to the current operating state, while a topology-aware graph neural network trained only on base and $N\!-\!1$ cases efficiently constructs high-risk training samples offline. Finally, the framework is developed to provide controllable coverage guarantees for severe contingencies, allowing operators to explicitly manage the risk of missing critical events under limited AC power-flow evaluation budgets. Experiments on IEEE benchmark systems show that, for a given evaluation budget, the proposed approach consistently evaluates higher-severity contingencies than uniform sampling. This allows critical outages to be identified more reliably with reduced computational effort.

*Ofir Schlisselberg,Tal Lancewicki,Yishay Mansour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies reinforcement learning in MDPs with mostly stochastic transitions but adversarial behavior at Λ steps per episode. It introduces conditioned occupancy measures and designs algorithms with varying regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reinforcement learning in environments that are mostly stable but have adversarial vulnerabilities, focusing on practical solutions.

Method: Introduces conditioned occupancy measures for stability and designs two algorithms: one for arbitrary adversarial steps and another for consecutive adversarial steps.

Result: Achieves regret bounds $	ilde{O}(H S^Λ√(K S A^{Λ+1})$ and $	ilde{O}(H√(K S^3 A^{Λ+1})$, and improves lower bounds.

Conclusion: The work provides robust algorithms for adversarial MDPs and clarifies the impact of feedback structures on learning hardness.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning in MDPs whose transition function is stochastic at most steps but may behave adversarially at a fixed subset of $Λ$ steps per episode. This model captures environments that are stable except at a few vulnerable points. We introduce \emph{conditioned occupancy measures}, which remain stable across episodes even with adversarial transitions, and use them to design two algorithms. The first handles arbitrary adversarial steps and achieves regret $\tilde{O}(H S^Λ\sqrt{K S A^{Λ+1}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $S$ is the number of state, $A$ is the number of actions and $H$ is the episode's horizon. The second, assuming the adversarial steps are consecutive, improves the dependence on $S$ to $\tilde{O}(H\sqrt{K S^{3} A^{Λ+1}})$. We further give a $K^{2/3}$-regret reduction that removes the need to know which steps are the $Λ$ adversarial steps. We also characterize the regret of adversarial MDPs in the \emph{fully adversarial} setting ($Λ=H-1$) both for full-information and bandit feedback, and provide almost matching upper and lower bounds (slightly strengthen existing lower bounds, and clarify how different feedback structures affect the hardness of learning).

*Huseyin Tunc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DDOL-ART is a data-driven operator learner using adaptive recurrent training to forecast long-term dynamics of reaction-diffusion equations, achieving stability and generalization without physics-based residuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in learning stable operators for reaction-diffusion equations, particularly avoiding error drift in autoregressive rollouts and degradation from OOD conditions.

Method: Uses adaptive recurrent training with lightweight validation milestones to exit unproductive rollout segments and optimize efficiently.

Result: DDOL-ART generalizes zero-shot to morphology shifts across systems, achieving stability and accuracy while being faster than physics-based methods.

Conclusion: Feedback-controlled recurrent training in DDOL-ART creates robust surrogates without PDE residuals, balancing accuracy and training cost.

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion (RD) equations underpin pattern formation across chemistry, biology, and physics, yet learning stable operators that forecast their long-term dynamics from data remains challenging. Neural-operator surrogates provide resolution-robust prediction, but autoregressive rollouts can drift due to the accumulation of error, and out-of-distribution (OOD) initial conditions often degrade accuracy. Physics-based numerical residual objectives can regularize operator learning, although they introduce additional assumptions, sensitivity to discretization and loss design, and higher training cost. Here we develop a purely data-driven operator learner with adaptive recurrent training (DDOL-ART) using a robust recurrent strategy with lightweight validation milestones that early-exit unproductive rollout segments and redirect optimization. Trained only on a single in-distribution toroidal Gaussian family over short horizons, DDOL-ART learns one-step operators that remain stable under long rollouts and generalize zero-shot to strong morphology shifts across FitzHugh-Nagumo (FN), Gray-Scott (GS), and Lambda-Omega (LO) systems. Across these benchmarks, DDOL-ART delivers a strong accuracy and cost trade-off. It is several-fold faster than a physics-based numerical-loss operator learner (NLOL) under matched settings, and it remains competitive on both in-distribution stability and OOD robustness. Training-dynamics diagnostics show that adaptivity strengthens the correlation between validation error and OOD test error performance, acting as a feedback controller that limits optimization drift. Our results indicate that feedback-controlled recurrent training of DDOL-ART generates robust flow-map surrogates without PDE residuals, while simultaneously maintaining competitiveness with NLOL at significantly reduced training costs.

### [209] [Beware of the Batch Size: Hyperparameter Bias in Evaluating LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09492)
*Sangyoon Lee,Jaeho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights that batch size is a critical but overlooked factor in the performance of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) variants. Proper tuning of batch size can make vanilla LoRA perform as well as complex variants, and the study provides a cost-efficient method for batch size tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from conflicting empirical results observed in LoRA variants, which the authors trace back to the batch size—an often-neglected parameter. By addressing this, they aim to reconcile inconsistencies and improve LoRA evaluations.

Method: The authors propose a proxy-based, cost-efficient strategy for tuning batch size. They investigate how factors like rank, dataset size, and model capacity influence the optimal batch size.

Result: The results show that vanilla LoRA, when tuned with the right batch size, performs comparably to more complex variants. The study also identifies relationships between batch size and other parameters.

Conclusion: The study repositions batch size as a key design parameter in LoRA, offering a practical tuning method and reconciling prior discrepancies in LoRA variant evaluations.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a standard approach for fine-tuning large language models, yet its many variants report conflicting empirical gains, often on the same benchmarks. We show that these contradictions arise from a single overlooked factor: the batch size. When properly tuned, vanilla LoRA often matches the performance of more complex variants. We further propose a proxy-based, cost-efficient strategy for batch size tuning, revealing the impact of rank, dataset size, and model capacity on the optimal batch size. Our findings elevate batch size from a minor implementation detail to a first-order design parameter, reconciling prior inconsistencies and enabling more reliable evaluations of LoRA variants.

*Moshe Noivirt,Jessica Sorrell,Eliad Tsfadia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the computational relationship between replicability, differential privacy, and the SQ model, showing efficient replicable learning extends beyond SQ-learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge gaps in understanding the computational boundaries between replicability and other stability notions like differential privacy and SQ-learning.

Method: The authors introduce an efficient replicable algorithm for learning parities over arbitrary distributions, leveraging a new subspace-covering technique.

Result: They demonstrate efficient replicable learning surpasses SQ-learning and approaches the power of differentially private learning.

Conclusion: This work provides evidence that replicable learning is computationally closer to differentially private learning than to SQ-learning.

Abstract: We study the computational relationship between replicability (Impagliazzo et al. [STOC `22], Ghazi et al. [NeurIPS `21]) and other stability notions. Specifically, we focus on replicable PAC learning and its connections to differential privacy (Dwork et al. [TCC 2006]) and to the statistical query (SQ) model (Kearns [JACM `98]). Statistically, it was known that differentially private learning and replicable learning are equivalent and strictly more powerful than SQ-learning. Yet, computationally, all previously known efficient (i.e., polynomial-time) replicable learning algorithms were confined to SQ-learnable tasks or restricted distributions, in contrast to differentially private learning.
  Our main contribution is the first computationally efficient replicable algorithm for realizable learning of parities over arbitrary distributions, a task that is known to be hard in the SQ-model, but possible under differential privacy. This result provides the first evidence that efficient replicable learning over general distributions strictly extends efficient SQ-learning, and is closer in power to efficient differentially private learning, despite computational separations between replicability and privacy. Our main building block is a new, efficient, and replicable algorithm that, given a set of vectors, outputs a subspace of their linear span that covers most of them.

*Wenzhe Yin,Pan Zhou,Zehao Xiao,Jie Liu,Shujian Yu,Jan-Jakob Sonke,Efstratios Gavves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses inherent conflicts in multimodal representation learning, proposing a decoupling method to improve alignment and uniformity, with proven theoretical and empirical benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing InfoNCE-based methods introduce conflicts (e.g., alignment-uniformity and intra-alignment) that worsen with more modalities, creating distribution gaps.

Method: The authors decouple alignment and uniformity for multimodal representations, ensuring conflict-free learning and supporting both discriminative and generative tasks without additional modules.

Result: The method theoretically guarantees reduced distribution gaps and shows consistent improvements in retrieval and generation tasks.

Conclusion: Decoupling alignment and uniformity effectively addresses multimodal conflicts, enhancing performance across tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning aims to construct a shared embedding space in which heterogeneous modalities are semantically aligned. Despite strong empirical results, InfoNCE-based objectives introduce inherent conflicts that yield distribution gaps across modalities. In this work, we identify two conflicts in the multimodal regime, both exacerbated as the number of modalities increases: (i) an alignment-uniformity conflict, whereby the repulsion of uniformity undermines pairwise alignment, and (ii) an intra-alignment conflict, where aligning multiple modalities induces competing alignment directions. To address these issues, we propose a principled decoupling of alignment and uniformity for multimodal representations, providing a conflict-free recipe for multimodal learning that simultaneously supports discriminative and generative use cases without task-specific modules. We then provide a theoretical guarantee that our method acts as an efficient proxy for a global Hölder divergence over multiple modality distributions, and thus reduces the distribution gap among modalities. Extensive experiments on retrieval and UnCLIP-style generation demonstrate consistent gains.

*Yiyun Zhou,Jingwei Shi,Mingjing Xu,Zhonghua Jiang,Jingyuan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InherNet proposes asymmetric low-rank decomposition of teacher weights to create a lightweight network that inherits principal knowledge, outperforming traditional KD student networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent capacity gap in traditional Knowledge Distillation (KD) limits student networks' performance, prompting exploration of networks that inherit both teacher structure and knowledge.

Method: InherNet uses asymmetric low-rank decomposition (via SVD) to reconstruct a lightweight network from teacher weights, ensuring principal knowledge inheritance.

Result: InherNet outperforms student networks of similar parameter sizes across unimodal and multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: InherNet offers a promising alternative to traditional KD for efficient model compression by maximizing knowledge inheritance.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a powerful technique for model compression, enabling lightweight student networks to benefit from the performance of redundant teacher networks. However, the inherent capacity gap often limits the performance of student networks. Inspired by the expressiveness of pretrained teacher networks, a compelling research question arises: is there a type of network that can not only inherit the teacher's structure but also maximize the inheritance of its knowledge? Furthermore, how does the performance of such an inheriting network compare to that of student networks, all benefiting from the same teacher network? To further explore this question, we propose InherNet, a neural network inheritance method that performs asymmetric low-rank decomposition on the teacher's weights and reconstructs a lightweight yet expressive network without significant architectural disruption. By leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for initialization to ensure the inheritance of principal knowledge, InherNet effectively balances depth, width, and compression efficiency. Experimental results across unimodal and multimodal tasks demonstrate that InherNet achieves higher performance compared to student networks of similar parameter sizes. Our findings reveal a promising direction for future research in efficient model compression beyond traditional distillation.

### [213] [Rashomon Sets and Model Multiplicity in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09520)
*Xenia Heilmann,Luca Corbucci,Mattia Cerrato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces formal definitions of Rashomon sets in Federated Learning (FL), addressing model multiplicity across diverse clients and demonstrating their utility for fairness and local data alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding model multiplicity (differences in decision boundaries among equally performing models) is key for transparency, fairness, and robustness. Existing definitions don't apply to decentralized settings like FL, where data heterogeneity and privacy constraints complicate model selection.

Method: The authors adapt Rashomon sets to FL via three perspectives: (I) global aggregated statistics, (II) intersection of local sets across clients (t-agreement), and (III) client-specific local distributions. They also estimate multiplicity metrics under FL's privacy constraints and introduce a multiplicity-aware FL pipeline.

Result: Empirical study on FL benchmarks shows that all three Rashomon set definitions provide valuable insights, helping clients deploy models aligned with local data, fairness, and practical needs.

Conclusion: The work bridges Rashomon sets and FL, offering tools to address heterogeneity and improve fairness while preserving privacy.

Abstract: The Rashomon set captures the collection of models that achieve near-identical empirical performance yet may differ substantially in their decision boundaries. Understanding the differences among these models, i.e., their multiplicity, is recognized as a crucial step toward model transparency, fairness, and robustness, as it reveals decision boundaries instabilities that standard metrics obscure. However, the existing definitions of Rashomon set and multiplicity metrics assume centralized learning and do not extend naturally to decentralized, multi-party settings like Federated Learning (FL). In FL, multiple clients collaboratively train models under a central server's coordination without sharing raw data, which preserves privacy but introduces challenges from heterogeneous client data distribution and communication constraints. In this setting, the choice of a single best model may homogenize predictive behavior across diverse clients, amplify biases, or undermine fairness guarantees. In this work, we provide the first formalization of Rashomon sets in FL.First, we adapt the Rashomon set definition to FL, distinguishing among three perspectives: (I) a global Rashomon set defined over aggregated statistics across all clients, (II) a t-agreement Rashomon set representing the intersection of local Rashomon sets across a fraction t of clients, and (III) individual Rashomon sets specific to each client's local distribution.Second, we show how standard multiplicity metrics can be estimated under FL's privacy constraints. Finally, we introduce a multiplicity-aware FL pipeline and conduct an empirical study on standard FL benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that all three proposed federated Rashomon set definitions offer valuable insights, enabling clients to deploy models that better align with their local data, fairness considerations, and practical requirements.

TL;DR: AutoSpec is a neural network framework that discovers iterative spectral algorithms for numerical linear algebra and optimization, achieving significant improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a framework that adapts to input operators using spectral information for efficient large-scale numerical tasks.

Method: AutoSpec uses self-supervised models trained on small synthetic problems, with an architecture designed for numerical linear algebra recurrences and task-defined objectives.

Result: The framework delivers orders-of-magnitude improvements in accuracy and iteration count for tasks like matrix-function approximation and spectral filtering.

Conclusion: AutoSpec successfully bridges neural networks and classical numerical theory, achieving near-minimax behavior akin to Chebyshev polynomials.

Abstract: We introduce AutoSpec, a neural network framework for discovering iterative spectral algorithms for large-scale numerical linear algebra and numerical optimization. Our self-supervised models adapt to input operators using coarse spectral information (e.g., eigenvalue estimates and residual norms), and they predict recurrence coefficients for computing or applying a matrix polynomial tailored to a downstream task. The effectiveness of AutoSpec relies on three ingredients: an architecture whose inference pass implements short, executable numerical linear algebra recurrences; efficient training on small synthetic problems with transfer to large-scale real-world operators; and task-defined objectives that enforce the desired approximation or preconditioning behavior across the range of spectral profiles represented in the training set. We apply AutoSpec to discovering algorithms for representative numerical linear algebra tasks: accelerating matrix-function approximation; accelerating sparse linear solvers; and spectral filtering/preconditioning for eigenvalue computations. On real-world matrices, the learned procedures deliver orders-of-magnitude improvements in accuracy and/or reductions in iteration count, relative to basic baselines. We also find clear connections to classical theory: the induced polynomials often exhibit near-equiripple, near-minimax behavior characteristic of Chebyshev polynomials.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ECG-IMN, an interpretable neural network for ECG diagnosis, combining deep learning accuracy with transparency by generating linear model weights per sample, enabling precise feature attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of transparency in deep learning models for ECG diagnosis, hindering clinical trust, by creating an intrinsically interpretable model.

Method: ECG-IMN uses a hypernetwork architecture where a convolutional backbone generates linear model weights per input, ensuring mathematically transparent decision logic.

Result: Outperforms post-hoc explainability methods in faithful, instance-specific explanations while maintaining competitive accuracy (AUROC) on PTB-XL.

Conclusion: ECG-IMN bridges deep learning capability and clinical trustworthiness, offering a transparent 'white-box' approach for cardiac diagnostics.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved expert-level performance in automated electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, yet the "black-box" nature of these models hinders their clinical deployment. Trust in medical AI requires not just high accuracy but also transparency regarding the specific physiological features driving predictions. Existing explainability methods for ECGs typically rely on post-hoc approximations (e.g., Grad-CAM and SHAP), which can be unstable, computationally expensive, and unfaithful to the model's actual decision-making process. In this work, we propose the ECG-IMN, an Interpretable Mesomorphic Neural Network tailored for high-resolution 12-lead ECG classification. Unlike standard classifiers, the ECG-IMN functions as a hypernetwork: a deep convolutional backbone generates the parameters of a strictly linear model specific to each input sample. This architecture enforces intrinsic interpretability, as the decision logic is mathematically transparent and the generated weights (W) serve as exact, high-resolution feature attribution maps. We introduce a transition decoder that effectively maps latent features to sample-wise weights, enabling precise localization of pathological evidence (e.g., ST-elevation, T-wave inversion) in both time and lead dimensions. We evaluate our approach on the PTB-XL dataset for classification tasks, demonstrating that the ECG-IMN achieves competitive predictive performance (AUROC comparable to black-box baselines) while providing faithful, instance-specific explanations. By explicitly decoupling parameter generation from prediction execution, our framework bridges the gap between deep learning capability and clinical trustworthiness, offering a principled path toward "white-box" cardiac diagnostics.

Motivation: Address the energy and latency constraints of traditional deep learning by leveraging analog dynamics in PNNs, while overcoming the challenge of training under arbitrary physical dynamics.

Result: Demonstrates successful learning across electronic memristive chips and optical computing platforms, adapting to hardware faults and supporting parallel training.

Conclusion: PIB provides a scalable, information-theoretic approach for training PNNs, compatible with various physical substrates and bypassing traditional constraints.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized modern society but faces growing energy and latency constraints. Deep physical neural networks (PNNs) are interconnected computing systems that directly exploit analog dynamics for energy-efficient, ultrafast AI execution. Realizing this potential, however, requires universal training methods tailored to physical intricacies. Here, we present the Physical Information Bottleneck (PIB), a general and efficient framework that integrates information theory and local learning, enabling deep PNNs to learn under arbitrary physical dynamics. By allocating matrix-based information bottlenecks to each unit, we demonstrate supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning across electronic memristive chips and optical computing platforms. PIB also adapts to severe hardware faults and allows for parallel training via geographically distributed resources. Bypassing auxiliary digital models and contrastive measurements, PIB recasts PNN training as an intrinsic, scalable information-theoretic process compatible with diverse physical substrates.

TL;DR: FlexMARL is a new training framework for large-scale MARL that optimizes rollout, training, and their coordination, addressing system-level challenges like synchronization barriers and load imbalance, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) are optimized for single-agent scenarios, failing to address MARL-specific challenges such as synchronization barriers, load imbalance, and resource underutilization.

Method: FlexMARL introduces a joint orchestrator for data flow, a micro-batch driven asynchronous pipeline for synchronization, parallel sampling with hierarchical load balancing for rollouts, and agent-centric resource allocation for training.

Result: Empirical results show FlexMARL achieves up to 7.3x speedup and improves hardware utilization by up to 5.6x compared to existing frameworks.

Conclusion: FlexMARL effectively addresses the system-level challenges of large-scale MARL training, offering significant performance and efficiency gains.

Abstract: Despite algorithm-level innovations for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the underlying networked infrastructure for large-scale MARL training remains underexplored. Existing training frameworks primarily optimize for single-agent scenarios and fail to address the unique system-level challenges of MARL, including rollout-training synchronization barriers, rollout load imbalance, and training resource underutilization. To bridge this gap, we propose FlexMARL, the first end-to-end training framework that holistically optimizes rollout, training, and their orchestration for large-scale LLM-based MARL. Specifically, FlexMARL introduces the joint orchestrator to manage data flow under the rollout-training disaggregated architecture. Building upon the experience store, a novel micro-batch driven asynchronous pipeline eliminates the synchronization barriers while providing strong consistency guarantees. Rollout engine adopts a parallel sampling scheme combined with hierarchical load balancing, which adapts to skewed inter/intra-agent request patterns. Training engine achieves on-demand hardware binding through agent-centric resource allocation. The training states of different agents are swapped via unified and location-agnostic communication. Empirical results on a large-scale production cluster demonstrate that FlexMARL achieves up to 7.3x speedup and improves hardware utilization by up to 5.6x compared to existing frameworks.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the paradox of deep generative models assigning high likelihoods to OOD inputs by controlling input entropy based on semantic similarity, improving OOD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the issue of deep generative models mistakenly assigning high likelihoods to OOD inputs, which undermines their reliability.

Method: Manipulates input entropy using semantic similarity, applying stronger perturbations to less similar inputs, without retraining the model.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows increased likelihood gaps favoring in-distribution samples, with empirical improvements in OOD detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: Entropy control based on semantic similarity effectively mitigates the likelihood paradox, enhancing OOD detection performance.

Abstract: Deep generative models that can tractably compute input likelihoods, including normalizing flows, often assign unexpectedly high likelihoods to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We mitigate this likelihood paradox by manipulating input entropy based on semantic similarity, applying stronger perturbations to inputs that are less similar to an in-distribution memory bank. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that entropy control increases the expected log-likelihood gap between in-distribution and OOD samples in favor of the in-distribution, and we explain why the procedure works without any additional training of the density model. We then evaluate our method against likelihood-based OOD detectors on standard benchmarks and find consistent AUROC improvements over baselines, supporting our explanation.

TL;DR: Deep generative models like normalizing flows are effective for anomaly detection via likelihood-based scoring, with counterintuitive behavior (higher likelihoods for anomalies) being rare in tabular data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify and address the counterintuitive behavior of deep generative models assigning higher likelihoods to anomalies, particularly in tabular settings.

Method: Introduces a domain-agnostic formulation to detect and evaluate the phenomenon, tested on 47 tabular and 10 CV/NLP datasets against 13 baselines.

Result: The counterintuitive behavior is consistently rare in tabular data. Likelihood-only detection with normalizing flows proves reliable.

Conclusion: Normalizing flows offer a practical and dependable method for anomaly detection in tabular domains.

Abstract: Deep generative models with tractable and analytically computable likelihoods, exemplified by normalizing flows, offer an effective basis for anomaly detection through likelihood-based scoring. We demonstrate that, unlike in the image domain where deep generative models frequently assign higher likelihoods to anomalous data, such counterintuitive behavior occurs far less often in tabular settings. We first introduce a domain-agnostic formulation that enables consistent detection and evaluation of the counterintuitive phenomenon, addressing the absence of precise definition. Through extensive experiments on 47 tabular datasets and 10 CV/NLP embedding datasets in ADBench, benchmarked against 13 baseline models, we demonstrate that the phenomenon, as defined, is consistently rare in general tabular data. We further investigate this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, focusing on the roles of data dimensionality and difference in feature correlation. Our results suggest that likelihood-only detection with normalizing flows offers a practical and reliable approach for anomaly detection in tabular domains.

Motivation: Continuous training in RLVR causes policy entropy collapse, leading to premature overconfidence and reduced diversity. Existing solutions lack dynamic control.

Method: The authors analyze gradient-preserving clipping, propose dynamic clipping thresholds, and introduce strategies like oscillatory decay for entropy management.

Result: Dynamic entropy control strategies mitigate entropy collapse and improve performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dynamic clipping-based entropy control effectively addresses entropy collapse in RLVR, enhancing LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a critical method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, continuous training often leads to policy entropy collapse, characterized by a rapid decay in entropy that results in premature overconfidence, reduced output diversity, and vanishing gradient norms that inhibit learning. Gradient-Preserving Clipping is a primary factor influencing these dynamics, but existing mitigation strategies are largely static and lack a framework connecting clipping mechanisms to precise entropy control. This paper proposes reshaping entropy control in RL from the perspective of Gradient-Preserving Clipping. We first theoretically and empirically verify the contributions of specific importance sampling ratio regions to entropy growth and reduction. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a novel regulation mechanism using dynamic clipping threshold to precisely manage entropy. Furthermore, we design and evaluate dynamic entropy control strategies, including increase-then-decrease, decrease-increase-decrease, and oscillatory decay. Experimental results demonstrate that these strategies effectively mitigate entropy collapse, and achieve superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

### [221] [LLM-FS: Zero-Shot Feature Selection for Effective and Interpretable Malware Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09634)
*Naveen Gill,Ajvad Haneef K,Madhu Kumar S D*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot feature selection in malware detection, showing competitive performance with traditional methods while offering better interpretability and reduced reliance on labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature selection methods overlook semantic context, prompting investigation into LLMs as a zero-shot alternative for high-dimensional malware datasets.

Method: Multiple LLMs (e.g., GPT-5.0, GPT-4.0) guide feature selection using feature names and task descriptions, evaluated on EMBOD dataset against traditional FS methods across various classifiers. Performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

Result: LLM-guided zero-shot feature selection matches traditional methods in performance and excels in interpretability, stability, and reduced labeled data dependence.

Conclusion: Zero-shot LLM-based FS is a promising alternative for malware detection, enabling knowledge-guided feature selection in security applications.

Abstract: Feature selection (FS) remains essential for building accurate and interpretable detection models, particularly in high-dimensional malware datasets. Conventional FS methods such as Extra Trees, Variance Threshold, Tree-based models, Chi-Squared tests, ANOVA, Random Selection, and Sequential Attention rely primarily on statistical heuristics or model-driven importance scores, often overlooking the semantic context of features. Motivated by recent progress in LLM-driven FS, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can guide feature selection in a zero-shot setting, using only feature names and task descriptions, as a viable alternative to traditional approaches. We evaluate multiple LLMs (GPT-5.0, GPT-4.0, Gemini-2.5 etc.) on the EMBOD dataset (a fusion of EMBER and BODMAS benchmark datasets), comparing them against established FS methods across several classifiers, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, MLP, and KNN. Performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC, MCC, and runtime. Our results demonstrate that LLM-guided zero-shot feature selection achieves competitive performance with traditional FS methods while offering additional advantages in interpretability, stability, and reduced dependence on labeled data. These findings position zero-shot LLM-based FS as a promising alternative strategy for effective and interpretable malware detection, paving the way for knowledge-guided feature selection in security-critical applications

*Andres Saurez,Yousung Lee,Dongsoo Har*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Linear interpretability methods succeed in transformers due to architectural necessity, not just empirical observation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explain why simple linear methods like probes and sparse autoencoders can recover meaningful structure from deep, nonlinear transformer representations.

Method: The authors formalize the architectural constraints of transformers, proving theorems about invariant subspaces and self-reference properties. They validate their framework empirically across tasks and models.

Result: Empirical validation shows alignment between class tokens and semantically related instances, confirming their theoretical framework.

Conclusion: The paper provides a principled explanation unifying why linear interpretability methods work in transformers, linking architecture to interpretability.

Abstract: Linear probes and sparse autoencoders consistently recover meaningful structure from transformer representations -- yet why should such simple methods succeed in deep, nonlinear systems? We show this is not merely an empirical regularity but a consequence of architectural necessity: transformers communicate information through linear interfaces (attention OV circuits, unembedding matrices), and any semantic feature decoded through such an interface must occupy a context-invariant linear subspace. We formalize this as the \emph{Invariant Subspace Necessity} theorem and derive the \emph{Self-Reference Property}: tokens directly provide the geometric direction for their associated features, enabling zero-shot identification of semantic structure without labeled data or learned probes. Empirical validation in eight classification tasks and four model families confirms the alignment between class tokens and semantically related instances. Our framework provides \textbf{a principled architectural explanation} for why linear interpretability methods work, unifying linear probes and sparse autoencoders.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Blind denoising diffusion models (BDDMs) automatically track an implicit noise schedule and perform well without knowing noise amplitude, outperforming non-blind models in sample quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the performance of generative diffusion models using blind denoisers, which do not require noise amplitude information, and to explore their advantages over non-blind models.

Method: Theoretical analysis and empirical validation on synthetic and image data, proving BDDMs can sample accurately in polynomially many steps based on intrinsic dimensionality.

Result: BDDMs automatically track an implicit noise schedule, accurately estimate noise variance from noisy images, and produce higher-quality samples than non-blind models.

Conclusion: BDDMs correct noise mismatch issues in non-blind models, making them more effective for sampling from data distributions.

Abstract: We analyze, theoretically and empirically, the performance of generative diffusion models based on \emph{blind denoisers}, in which the denoiser is not given the noise amplitude in either the training or sampling processes. Assuming that the data distribution has low intrinsic dimensionality, we prove that blind denoising diffusion models (BDDMs), despite not having access to the noise amplitude, \emph{automatically} track a particular \emph{implicit} noise schedule along the reverse process. Our analysis shows that BDDMs can accurately sample from the data distribution in polynomially many steps as a function of the intrinsic dimension. Empirical results corroborate these mathematical findings on both synthetic and image data, demonstrating that the noise variance is accurately estimated from the noisy image. Remarkably, we observe that schedule-free BDDMs produce samples of higher quality compared to their non-blind counterparts. We provide evidence that this performance gain arises because BDDMs correct the mismatch between the true residual noise (of the image) and the noise assumed by the schedule used in non-blind diffusion models.

TL;DR: Circuit discovery and activation steering in transformers share a geometric principle called the Circuit Fingerprint hypothesis, enabling efficient circuit discovery and controlled steering without gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify circuit discovery and activation steering by demonstrating they operate on the same geometric structure, simplifying interpretability and controllability in transformers.

Method: Uses geometric alignment (Circuit Fingerprint hypothesis) to discover circuits without gradients or causal intervention, validated on benchmarks like IOI, SVA, and MCQA across four model families.

Result: Achieves circuit discovery performance comparable to gradient-based methods and 69.8% emotion classification accuracy (vs. 53.1% for instruction prompting) while preserving factual accuracy.

Conclusion: Transformer circuits are fundamentally geometric structures, showing interpretability and controllability as two facets of the same object.

Abstract: Circuit discovery and activation steering in transformers have developed as separate research threads, yet both operate on the same representational space. Are they two views of the same underlying structure? We show they follow a single geometric principle: answer tokens, processed in isolation, encode the directions that would produce them. This Circuit Fingerprint hypothesis enables circuit discovery without gradients or causal intervention -- recovering comparable structure to gradient-based methods through geometric alignment alone. We validate this on standard benchmarks (IOI, SVA, MCQA) across four model families, achieving circuit discovery performance comparable to gradient-based methods. The same directions that identify circuit components also enable controlled steering -- achieving 69.8\% emotion classification accuracy versus 53.1\% for instruction prompting while preserving factual accuracy. Beyond method development, this read-write duality reveals that transformer circuits are fundamentally geometric structures: interpretability and controllability are two facets of the same object.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCIL (Streaming Class-Incremental Learning) addresses challenges like concept drift, class imbalance, and new class emergence in streaming data by integrating autoencoders with multi-layer perceptrons, using dual-loss strategies, pseudo-labels, and oversampling, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Massive streaming data faces issues like concept drift, class imbalance, label scarcity, and new class emergence, which degrade representation stability and reliability.

Method: SCIL combines autoencoders with multi-layer perceptrons, uses dual-loss (classification/reconstruction), corrected pseudo-labels, class queues, and oversampling for imbalance.

Result: SCIL outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art methods on real-world and synthetic datasets with class imbalance and concept drift.

Conclusion: SCIL effectively addresses streaming data challenges, supported by ablation studies and experimental results, with code and datasets made available for Open Science.

Abstract: In today's connected world, the generation of massive streaming data across diverse domains has become commonplace. In the presence of concept drift, class imbalance, label scarcity, and new class emergence, they jointly degrade representation stability, bias learning toward outdated distributions, and reduce the resilience and reliability of detection in dynamic environments. This paper proposes SCIL (Streaming Class-Incremental Learning) to address these challenges. The SCIL framework integrates an autoencoder (AE) with a multi-layer perceptron for multi-class prediction, uses a dual-loss strategy (classification and reconstruction) for prediction and new class detection, employs corrected pseudo-labels for online training, manages classes with queues, and applies oversampling to handle imbalance. The rationale behind the method's structure is elucidated through ablation studies and a comprehensive experimental evaluation is performed using both real-world and synthetic datasets that feature class imbalance, incremental classes, and concept drifts. Our results demonstrate that SCIL outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods. Based on our commitment to Open Science, we make our code and datasets available to the community.

### [226] [Model soups need only one ingredient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09689)
*Alireza Abdollahpoorrostam,Nikolaos Dimitriadis,Adam Hazimeh,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MonoSoup is a lightweight, efficient method for balancing in-distribution accuracy and out-of-distribution robustness using a single checkpoint via SVD and entropy-based re-weighting, avoiding the computational cost of multi-checkpoint ensembling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning pre-trained models enhances in-distribution performance but harms out-of-distribution robustness. Existing methods like Model Soups require multiple checkpoints, making them computationally expensive.

Method: MonoSoup applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to layer updates, decomposing them into task-specific and robustness-preserving components, then re-weights these using entropy-based effective rank.

Result: Experiments on CLIP and Qwen models show MonoSoup effectively balances ID-OOD performance without the overhead of multi-checkpoint methods.

Conclusion: MonoSoup offers a practical, efficient alternative to costly weight-space ensembling methods, maintaining robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pre-trained models on a target distribution often improves in-distribution (ID) accuracy, but at the cost of out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness as representations specialize to the fine-tuning data. Weight-space ensembling methods, such as Model Soups, mitigate this effect by averaging multiple checkpoints, but they are computationally prohibitive, requiring the training and storage of dozens of fine-tuned models. In this paper, we introduce MonoSoup, a simple, data-free, hyperparameter-free, post-hoc method that achieves a strong ID-OOD balance using only a single checkpoint. Our method applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to each layer's update and decomposes it into high-energy directions that capture task-specific adaptation and low-energy directions that introduce noise but may still encode residual signals useful for robustness. MonoSoup then uses entropy-based effective rank to automatically re-weigh these components with layer-wise coefficients that account for the spectral and geometric structure of the model. Experiments on CLIP models fine-tuned on ImageNet and evaluated under natural distribution shifts, as well as on Qwen language models tested on mathematical reasoning and multiple-choice benchmarks, show that this plug-and-play approach is a practical and effective alternative to multi-checkpoint methods, retaining much of their benefits without their computational overhead.

TL;DR: CS-LSTMs, a prediction-based framework, improve anomaly detection in univariate time series by combining contextual and seasonal patterns via noise decomposition and dual-domain representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to detect subtle anomalies like small point anomalies and slowly rising anomalies in univariate time series, which are critical for web systems and cloud servers.

Method: Proposes CS-LSTMs, leveraging contextual dependencies and seasonal patterns through noise decomposition and integrating time-domain and frequency-domain representations.

Result: CS-LSTMs outperform state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks, showing better anomaly detection and localization.

Conclusion: CS-LSTMs effectively address subtle anomaly detection challenges, offering robust practical value for time series analysis.

Abstract: Univariate time series (UTS), where each timestamp records a single variable, serve as crucial indicators in web systems and cloud servers. Anomaly detection in UTS plays an essential role in both data mining and system reliability management. However, existing reconstruction-based and prediction-based methods struggle to capture certain subtle anomalies, particularly small point anomalies and slowly rising anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prediction-based framework named Contextual and Seasonal LSTMs (CS-LSTMs). CS-LSTMs are built upon a noise decomposition strategy and jointly leverage contextual dependencies and seasonal patterns, thereby strengthening the detection of subtle anomalies. By integrating both time-domain and frequency-domain representations, CS-LSTMs achieve more accurate modeling of periodic trends and anomaly localization. Extensive evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that CS-LSTMs consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods, highlighting their effectiveness and practical value in robust time series anomaly detection.

TL;DR: A method combining generative latent diffusion models with physics-informed ML for solving parametric PDEs, improving accuracy and efficiency over existing diffusion-based solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address forward and inverse PDE problems by leveraging generative models and physics-informed constraints for better accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: Uses latent diffusion models in a spectral representation space, enforcing physics-informed constraints with Adam-based updates during inference.

Result: Demonstrates improved performance on Poisson, Helmholtz, and Navier-Stokes equations compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based PDE solvers.

Conclusion: The method effectively combines generative modeling with physics constraints, offering a scalable and accurate solution for parametric PDE problems.

Abstract: We propose a methodology that combines generative latent diffusion models with physics-informed machine learning to generate solutions of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) conditioned on partial observations, which includes, in particular, forward and inverse PDE problems. We learn the joint distribution of PDE parameters and solutions via a diffusion process in a latent space of scaled spectral representations, where Gaussian noise corresponds to functions with controlled regularity. This spectral formulation enables significant dimensionality reduction compared to grid-based diffusion models and ensures that the induced process in function space remains within a class of functions for which the PDE operators are well defined. Building on diffusion posterior sampling, we enforce physics-informed constraints and measurement conditions during inference, applying Adam-based updates at each diffusion step. We evaluate the proposed approach on Poisson, Helmholtz, and incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, demonstrating improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared with existing diffusion-based PDE solvers, which are state of the art for sparse observations.

TL;DR: BRAVA-GNN is a lightweight GNN architecture that predicts node betweenness centrality efficiently, outperforming existing methods on high-diameter graphs like road networks with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional betweenness centrality measures are computationally expensive on large-scale networks, and existing GNN models struggle with high-diameter graphs such as road networks.

Method: BRAVA-GNN leverages degree-based quantities (multi-hop degree mass) as features and uses hyperbolic random graphs for training to better match real-world network structures.

Result: BRAVA-GNN achieves up to 214% improvement in Kendall-Tau correlation and 70x speedup in inference time compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially on road networks.

Conclusion: BRAVA-GNN is a scalable and efficient solution for predicting node importance in diverse real-world networks, including challenging high-diameter graphs.

Abstract: Computing node importance in networks is a long-standing fundamental problem that has driven extensive study of various centrality measures. A particularly well-known centrality measure is betweenness centrality, which becomes computationally prohibitive on large-scale networks. Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have thus been proposed to predict node rankings according to their relative betweenness centrality. However, state-of-the-art methods fail to generalize to high-diameter graphs such as road networks. We propose BRAVA-GNN, a lightweight GNN architecture that leverages the empirically observed correlation linking betweenness centrality to degree-based quantities, in particular multi-hop degree mass. This correlation motivates the use of degree masses as size-invariant node features and synthetic training graphs that closely match the degree distributions of real networks. Furthermore, while previous work relies on scale-free synthetic graphs, we leverage the hyperbolic random graph model, which reproduces power-law exponents outside the scale-free regime, better capturing the structure of real-world graphs like road networks. This design enables BRAVA-GNN to generalize across diverse graph families while using 54x fewer parameters than the most lightweight existing GNN baseline. Extensive experiments on 19 real-world networks, spanning social, web, email, and road graphs, show that BRAVA-GNN achieves up to 214% improvement in Kendall-Tau correlation and up to 70x speedup in inference time over state-of-the-art GNN-based approaches, particularly on challenging road networks.

*Hanyong Wang,Menglong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ExO-PPO, a variant of PPO that balances sample efficiency and stability by combining on-policy and off-policy methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PPO algorithms sacrifice sample efficiency for stability, while off-policy methods introduce variance and bias. The goal is to leverage both approaches.

Method: The authors derive an off-policy improvement bound, extend the clipping mechanism with segmented exponential functions, and use a replay buffer for off-policy training.

Result: ExO-PPO outperforms PPO and other variants in empirical experiments, achieving balanced sample efficiency and stability.

Conclusion: ExO-PPO successfully combines the strengths of on-policy and off-policy methods, demonstrating improved performance across tasks.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has been able to solve various tasks successfully, however, due to the construction of policy gradient and training dynamics, tuning deep reinforcement learning models remains challenging. As one of the most successful deep reinforcement-learning algorithm, the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (PPO) clips the policy gradient within a conservative on-policy updates, which ensures reliable and stable policy improvement. However, this training pattern may sacrifice sample efficiency. On the other hand, off-policy methods make more adequate use of data through sample reuse, though at the cost of increased the estimation variance and bias. To leverage the advantages of both, in this paper, we propose a new PPO variant based on the stability guarantee from conservative on-policy iteration with a more efficient off-policy data utilization. Specifically, we first derive an extended off-policy improvement from an expectation form of generalized policy improvement lower bound. Then, we extend the clipping mechanism with segmented exponential functions for a suitable surrogate objective function. Third, the trajectories generated by the past $M$ policies are organized in the replay buffer for off-policy training. We refer to this method as Extended Off-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (ExO-PPO). Compared with PPO and some other state-of-the-art variants, we demonstrate an improved performance of ExO-PPO with balanced sample efficiency and stability on varied tasks in the empirical experiments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Targeted Partition Aggregation (TPA), the first algorithm to certify security properties (stability and validity) in autoregressive language generation, addressing robustness to poisoning attacks and exponentially large output spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable certified deployment of language models in security-sensitive domains by addressing the lack of certified defenses for autoregressive generation.

Method: Proposes TPA to certify validity against targeted attacks and extends it with MILP for multi-turn generations. Evaluates TPA in diverse settings like agent tool-calling and preference-based alignment.

Result: TPA effectively certifies validity (e.g., against 0.5% dataset poisoning) and stability (e.g., 8-token horizons), though inference-time latency remains a challenge.

Conclusion: TPA advances certified robustness for language models, enabling their use in security-critical applications despite computational challenges.

Abstract: Understanding the reliability of natural language generation is critical for deploying foundation models in security-sensitive domains. While certified poisoning defenses provide provable robustness bounds for classification tasks, they are fundamentally ill-equipped for autoregressive generation: they cannot handle sequential predictions or the exponentially large output space of language models. To establish a framework for certified natural language generation, we formalize two security properties: stability (robustness to any change in generation) and validity (robustness to targeted, harmful changes in generation). We introduce Targeted Partition Aggregation (TPA), the first algorithm to certify validity/targeted attacks by computing the minimum poisoning budget needed to induce a specific harmful class, token, or phrase. Further, we extend TPA to provide tighter guarantees for multi-turn generations using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Empirically, we demonstrate TPA's effectiveness across diverse settings including: certifying validity of agent tool-calling when adversaries modify up to 0.5% of the dataset and certifying 8-token stability horizons in preference-based alignment. Though inference-time latency remains an open challenge, our contributions enable certified deployment of language models in security-critical applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unrealistic assumption of prior knowledge mapping raw observations to symbols in multi-task RL settings.

Method: Jointly train multi-task policy and symbol grounder using raw observations and sparse rewards via Neural Reward Machines, semi-supervised.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to true symbol grounding and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sub-symbolic environments.

Conclusion: The method effectively eliminates the need for prior symbol mapping knowledge, advancing RL in sub-symbolic settings.

Abstract: In this work we address the problem of training a Reinforcement Learning agent to follow multiple temporally-extended instructions expressed in Linear Temporal Logic in sub-symbolic environments. Previous multi-task work has mostly relied on knowledge of the mapping between raw observations and symbols appearing in the formulae. We drop this unrealistic assumption by jointly training a multi-task policy and a symbol grounder with the same experience. The symbol grounder is trained only from raw observations and sparse rewards via Neural Reward Machines in a semi-supervised fashion. Experiments on vision-based environments show that our method achieves performance comparable to using the true symbol grounding and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for sub-symbolic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the opacity in the internal decision-making of diffusion models used for medical imaging, ensuring safer and more interpretable AI applications in healthcare.

Method: A faithfulness-based explainability framework analyzes prototype methods (ProtoPNet, Enhanced ProtoPNet, ProtoPool) to link generated and training features, focusing on denoising trajectories and prototype explainability.

Result: EPPNet achieved the highest faithfulness score (0.1534), providing more reliable insights into the generative process.

Conclusion: Faithfulness-based explanations enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of diffusion models, promoting safer use of generative AI in healthcare.

Abstract: This study investigates the explainability of generative diffusion models in the context of medical imaging, focusing on Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) synthesis. Although diffusion models have shown strong performance in generating realistic medical images, their internal decision making process remains largely opaque. We present a faithfulness-based explainability framework that analyzes how prototype-based explainability methods like ProtoPNet (PPNet), Enhanced ProtoPNet (EPPNet), and ProtoPool can link the relationship between generated and training features. Our study focuses on understanding the reasoning behind image formation through denoising trajectory of diffusion model and subsequently prototype explainability with faithfulness analysis. Experimental analysis shows that EPPNet achieves the highest faithfulness (with score 0.1534), offering more reliable insights, and explainability into the generative process. The results highlight that diffusion models can be made more transparent and trustworthy through faithfulness-based explanations, contributing to safer and more interpretable applications of generative AI in healthcare.

*Ruishan Guo,Yibing Liu,Guoxin Ma,Yan Wang,Yueyang Zhang,Long Xia,Kecheng Chen,Zhiyuan Sun,Daiting Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the Size-Fidelity Paradox in compressor-decoder setups, where larger models reduce faithfulness in reconstructed contexts despite lower training loss. It identifies knowledge overwriting and semantic drift as key factors and attributes the paradox to excessive semantic capacity and generative uncertainty, not parameter count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study challenges the assumption that larger models inherently improve generation capabilities, especially in contexts requiring faithful reconstruction. It aims to understand why larger models perform worse in preserving source facts and verbatim content.

Method: The authors conducted experiments across models ranging from 0.6B to 90B parameters, analyzing the effects of scaling on context compression. They identified knowledge overwriting and semantic drift as primary contributors to the paradox and investigated their causes.

Result: Larger models exhibit diminished faithfulness due to knowledge overwriting (replacing source facts with prior beliefs) and semantic drift (restructuring content). The paradox stems from heightened semantic capacity and generative uncertainty, not model size itself.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a breakdown in scaling laws for open-ended generation fidelity, suggesting that model scaling can harm faithful context preservation. The study calls for reevaluating scaling assumptions in compression tasks.

Abstract: Scaling up model parameters has long been a prevalent training paradigm driven by the assumption that larger models yield superior generation capabilities. However, under lossy context compression in a compressor-decoder setup, we observe a Size-Fidelity Paradox: increasing the compressor size can lessen the faithfulness of reconstructed contexts though training loss decreases. Through extensive experiments across models from 0.6B to 90B, we coin this paradox arising from two dominant factors: 1) knowledge overwriting: larger models increasingly replace source facts with their own prior beliefs, e.g., ``the white strawberry'' $\to$ ``the red strawberry''; and 2) semantic drift: larger models tend to paraphrase or restructure content instead of reproducing it verbatim, e.g., ``Alice hit Bob'' $\to$ ``Bob hit Alice''. By holding model size fixed, we reflect on the emergent properties of compressed context representations. We show that the culprit is not parameter count itself, but the excessive semantic capacity and amplified generative uncertainty that accompany scaling. Specifically, the increased rank of context embeddings facilitates prior knowledge intrusion, whereas higher entropy over token prediction distributions promotes rewriting. Our results complement existing evaluations over context compression paradigm, underpinning a breakdown in scaling laws for faithful preservation in open-ended generation.

TL;DR: DDQN avoids negative transfer across environments, while Dueling DQN consistently shows degraded performance under the same conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how architectural differences between DDQN and Dueling DQN affect transfer learning performance across distinct environments.

Method: Conducted a controlled empirical study using CartPole as the source task and LunarLander as the target task, with fixed layer-wise representation transfer under identical conditions.

Result: DDQN showed robust transfer and comparable performance to baseline, while Dueling DQN exhibited negative transfer with degraded rewards and unstable behavior.

Conclusion: Architectural inductive bias significantly influences robustness to cross-environment transfer in value-based deep reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Transfer learning in deep reinforcement learning is often motivated by improved stability and reduced training cost, but it can also fail under substantial domain shift. This paper presents a controlled empirical study examining how architectural differences between Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN) and Dueling DQN influence transfer behavior across environments. Using CartPole as a source task and LunarLander as a structurally distinct target task, we evaluate a fixed layer-wise representation transfer protocol under identical hyperparameters and training conditions, with baseline agents trained from scratch used to contextualize transfer effects. Empirical results show that DDQN consistently avoids negative transfer under the examined setup and maintains learning dynamics comparable to baseline performance in the target environment. In contrast, Dueling DQN consistently exhibits negative transfer under identical conditions, characterized by degraded rewards and unstable optimization behavior. Statistical analysis across multiple random seeds confirms a significant performance gap under transfer. These findings suggest that architectural inductive bias is strongly associated with robustness to cross-environment transfer in value-based deep reinforcement learning under the examined transfer protocol.

Result: PlugSI reduces MAE by 10.81% and integrates seamlessly with existing SI methods.

Conclusion: PlugSI addresses scalability and adaptability in SI, improving performance without requiring pre-trained model retraining.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of IoT and edge computing, sensor networks have become indispensable, driving the need for large-scale sensor deployment. However, the high deployment cost hinders their scalability. To tackle the issues, Spatial Interpolation (SI) introduces virtual sensors to infer readings from observed sensors, leveraging graph structure. However, current graph-based SI methods rely on pre-trained models, lack adaptation to larger and unseen graphs at test-time, and overlook test data utilization. To address these issues, we propose PlugSI, a plug-and-play framework that refines test-time graph through two key innovations. First, we design an Unknown Topology Adapter (UTA) that adapts to the new graph structure of each small-batch at test-time, enhancing the generalization of SI pre-trained models. Second, we introduce a Temporal Balance Adapter (TBA) that maintains a stable historical consensus to guide UTA adaptation and prevent drifting caused by noise in the current batch. Empirically, extensive experiments demonstrate PlugSI can be seamlessly integrated into existing graph-based SI methods and provide significant improvement (e.g., a 10.81% reduction in MAE).

*Beicheng Xu,Keyao Ding,Wei Liu,Yupeng Lu,Bin Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoFEH is a collaborative framework integrating LLM-based feature engineering (FE) and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization (HPO) to enhance AutoML performance, outperforming traditional methods and achieving robust end-to-end results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FE methods in AutoML are limited by rigid search spaces and lack domain awareness, while existing LLM-based approaches fail to optimize FE and HPO jointly. CoFEH addresses these gaps.

Method: CoFEH combines an LLM-driven FE optimizer (using Tree of Thought), Bayesian HPO, and a dynamic optimizer selector to interleave FE and HPO steps. It introduces mutual conditioning for context sharing.

Result: CoFEH outperforms traditional and LLM-based FE baselines and achieves superior end-to-end performance under joint optimization.

Conclusion: CoFEH demonstrates the effectiveness of collaborative FE-HPO optimization in AutoML, leveraging LLMs and Bayesian methods for robust performance.

Abstract: Feature Engineering (FE) is pivotal in automated machine learning (AutoML) but remains a bottleneck for traditional methods, which treat it as a black-box search, operating within rigid, predefined search spaces and lacking domain awareness. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging semantic reasoning to generate unbounded operators, existing methods fail to construct free-form FE pipelines, remaining confined to isolated subtasks such as feature generation. Most importantly, they are rarely optimized jointly with hyperparameter optimization (HPO) of the ML model, leading to greedy "FE-then-HPO" workflows that cannot capture strong FE-HPO interactions. In this paper, we present CoFEH, a collaborative framework that interleaves LLM-based FE and Bayesian HPO for robust end-to-end AutoML. CoFEH uses an LLM-driven FE optimizer powered by Tree of Thought (ToT) to explore flexible FE pipelines, a Bayesian optimization (BO) module to solve HPO, and a dynamic optimizer selector that realizes interleaved optimization by adaptively scheduling FE and HPO steps. Crucially, we introduce a mutual conditioning mechanism that shares context between LLM and BO, enabling mutually informed decisions. Experiments show that CoFEH not only outperforms traditional and LLM-based FE baselines, but also achieves superior end-to-end performance under joint optimization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differentiable tripartite modularity framework for clustering heterogeneous graphs with three node types, addressing challenges in higher-order relational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with clustering heterogeneous relational data, especially for interactions involving more than two entity types.

Method: Proposes differentiable tripartite modularity for graphs with three node types, using weighted co-paths and structural normalization to handle degree heterogeneity.

Result: Validated on urban cadastral data, the framework shows robust convergence and produces spatially coherent partitions.

Conclusion: Differentiable tripartite modularity is a promising tool for unsupervised clustering of heterogeneous graphs.

Abstract: Clustering heterogeneous relational data remains a central challenge in graph learning, particularly when interactions involve more than two types of entities. While differentiable modularity objectives such as DMoN have enabled end-to-end community detection on homogeneous and bipartite graphs, extending these approaches to higher-order relational structures remains non-trivial.
  In this work, we introduce a differentiable formulation of tripartite modularity for graphs composed of three node types connected through mediated interactions. Community structure is defined in terms of weighted co-paths across the tripartite graph, together with an exact factorized computation that avoids the explicit construction of dense third-order tensors. A structural normalization at pivot nodes is introduced to control extreme degree heterogeneity and ensure stable optimization.
  The resulting objective can be optimized jointly with a graph neural network in an end-to-end manner, while retaining linear complexity in the number of edges. We validate the proposed framework on large-scale urban cadastral data, where it exhibits robust convergence behavior and produces spatially coherent partitions. These results highlight differentiable tripartite modularity as a generic methodological building block for unsupervised clustering of heterogeneous graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers outperform baselines in low-data time-series forecasting, especially with dynamic sparsification in noisy settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate transformer architectures in low-data regimes for multivariate time-series forecasting and understand their performance under noise.

Method: Use synthetic processes with known dependencies, conduct bootstrapped experiments, and introduce dynamic sparsification for attention matrices.

Result: Two-way attention transformers outperform baselines like Lasso and MLPs, with dynamic sparsification improving performance in noisy environments.

Conclusion: Transformers generalize well under noise, with learned attention patterns revealing interpretable structure akin to classical sparsity-inducing methods.

Abstract: We study the performance of transformer architectures for multivariate time-series forecasting in low-data regimes consisting of only a few years of daily observations. Using synthetically generated processes with known temporal and cross-sectional dependency structures and varying signal-to-noise ratios, we conduct bootstrapped experiments that enable direct evaluation via out-of-sample correlations with the optimal ground-truth predictor. We show that two-way attention transformers, which alternate between temporal and cross-sectional self-attention, can outperform standard baselines-Lasso, boosting methods, and fully connected multilayer perceptrons-across a wide range of settings, including low signal-to-noise regimes. We further introduce a dynamic sparsification procedure for attention matrices applied during training, and demonstrate that it becomes significantly effective in noisy environments, where the correlation between the target variable and the optimal predictor is on the order of a few percent. Analysis of the learned attention patterns reveals interpretable structure and suggests connections to sparsity-inducing regularization in classical regression, providing insight into why these models generalize effectively under noise.

*Anna Bodonhelyi,Mengdi Wang,Efe Bozkir,Babette Bühler,Enkelejda Kasneci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a federated learning framework to detect cognitive and behavioral disengagement in online learning using video-based indicators while preserving user privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online learning lacks direct instructor support, leading to disengagement and mind wandering, which negatively impact learning outcomes. Privacy concerns arise with traditional machine learning methods.

Method: Uses federated learning for decentralized model training, focusing on facial expressions and gaze features to detect disengagement. Addresses challenges like eyeglasses with additional features.

Result: Extensive experiments on five datasets show promising results for privacy-preserving, real-time learner support.

Conclusion: The framework offers a viable, privacy-focused solution to enhance engagement in remote learning environments.

Abstract: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, online courses have expanded access to education, yet the absence of direct instructor support challenges learners' ability to self-regulate attention and engagement. Mind wandering and disengagement can be detrimental to learning outcomes, making their automated detection via video-based indicators a promising approach for real-time learner support. However, machine learning-based approaches often require sharing sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by enabling decentralized model training while also distributing computational load. We propose a framework exploiting cross-device federated learning to address different manifestations of behavioral and cognitive disengagement during remote learning, specifically behavioral disengagement, mind wandering, and boredom. We fit video-based cognitive disengagement detection models using facial expressions and gaze features. By adopting federated learning, we safeguard users' data privacy through privacy-by-design and introduce a novel solution with the potential for real-time learner support. We further address challenges posed by eyeglasses by incorporating related features, enhancing overall model performance. To validate the performance of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on five datasets and benchmark multiple federated learning algorithms. Our results show great promise for privacy-preserving educational technologies promoting learner engagement.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Bayesian PINNs (BPINNs) for accurate drug release modeling, outperforming classical methods with reduced error and faster predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical drug release models lack accuracy in complex scenarios. The study aims to improve predictions by integrating physical laws with experimental data.

Method: The approach embeds Fick's diffusion law into PINNs and BPINNs, using limited experimental data and 10,000 Latin-hypercube collocation points. Performance is evaluated via MAE and RMSE.

Result: PINNs reduced mean error by 40% compared to classical models, achieving RMSE <0.05 with only 6% of data for planar films. BPINNs improved uncertainty quantification under noise.

Conclusion: The framework enables accurate long-term predictions from short-term data, accelerating drug release characterization and early-stage formulation.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of drug release is essential for designing and developing controlled-release systems. Classical models (Fick, Higuchi, Peppas) rely on simplifying assumptions that limit their accuracy in complex geometries and release mechanisms. Here, we propose a novel approach using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Bayesian PINNs (BPINNs) for predicting release from planar, 1D-wrinkled, and 2D-crumpled films. This approach uniquely integrates Fick's diffusion law with limited experimental data to enable accurate long-term predictions from short-term measurements, and is systematically benchmarked against classical drug release models. We embedded Fick's second law into PINN as loss with 10,000 Latin-hypercube collocation points and utilized previously published experimental datasets to assess drug release performance through mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), considering noisy conditions and limited-data scenarios. Our approach reduced mean error by up to 40% relative to classical baselines across all film types. The PINN formulation achieved RMSE <0.05 utilizing only the first 6% of the release time data (reducing 94% of release time required for the experiments) for the planar film. For wrinkled and crumpled films, the PINN reached RMSE <0.05 in 33% of the release time data. BPINNs provide tighter and more reliable uncertainty quantification under noise. By combining physical laws with experimental data, the proposed framework yields highly accurate long-term release predictions from short-term measurements, offering a practical route for accelerated characterization and more efficient early-stage drug release system formulation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses multi-task demand learning in retail pricing, focusing on causal identification despite endogeneity issues caused by historical price variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to estimate heterogeneous linear price-response functions across diverse retail contexts, where historical price data may be endogenous due to managerial or algorithmic decisions.

Method: The proposed method, Decision-Conditioned Masked-Outcome Meta-Learning (DCMOML), designs a meta-learner's information set to leverage cross-task heterogeneity while accounting for endogenous decision histories.

Result: Under mild restrictions, DCMOML identifies the conditional mean of task-specific causal parameters, enabling reliable demand estimation even with small per-task samples.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust foundation for deploying causal, data-driven pricing models in operational settings with endogenous prices.

Abstract: We study a canonical multi-task demand learning problem motivated by retail pricing, in which a firm seeks to estimate heterogeneous linear price-response functions across a large collection of decision contexts. Each context is characterized by rich observable covariates yet typically exhibits only limited historical price variation, motivating the use of multi-task learning to borrow strength across tasks. A central challenge in this setting is endogeneity: historical prices are chosen by managers or algorithms and may be arbitrarily correlated with unobserved, task-level demand determinants. Under such confounding by latent fundamentals, commonly used approaches, such as pooled regression and meta-learning, fail to identify causal price effects.
  We propose a new estimation framework that achieves causal identification despite arbitrary dependence between prices and latent task structure. Our approach, Decision-Conditioned Masked-Outcome Meta-Learning (DCMOML), involves carefully designing the information set of a meta-learner to leverage cross-task heterogeneity while accounting for endogenous decision histories. Under a mild restriction on price adaptivity in each task, we establish that this method identifies the conditional mean of the task-specific causal parameters given the designed information set. Our results provide guarantees for large-scale demand estimation with endogenous prices and small per-task samples, offering a principled foundation for deploying causal, data-driven pricing models in operational environments.

*Enzo Nicolas Spotorno,Josafat Ribeiro Leal,Antonio Augusto Frohlich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TAPINN improves PINNs for modeling dynamical systems with sharp transitions by structuring the latent space using Supervised Metric Regularization, reducing physics residual by ~49%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PINNs struggle with spectral bias and mode collapse when modeling parameterized dynamical systems with sharp regime transitions (e.g., bifurcations).

Method: Proposes TAPINN, which uses Supervised Metric Regularization to structure the latent space and a phase-based Alternating Optimization schedule to manage gradient conflicts.

Result: Achieves ~49% lower physics residual (0.082 vs. 0.160) and stable convergence with 2.18x lower gradient variance than baselines, while using fewer parameters.

Conclusion: TAPINN effectively mitigates spectral bias and mode collapse in PINNs for dynamical systems with sharp transitions, outperforming standard methods.

Abstract: Standard Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) often face challenges when modeling parameterized dynamical systems with sharp regime transitions, such as bifurcations. In these scenarios, the continuous mapping from parameters to solutions can result in spectral bias or "mode collapse", where the network averages distinct physical behaviors. We propose a Topology-Aware PINN (TAPINN) that aims to mitigate this challenge by structuring the latent space via Supervised Metric Regularization. Unlike standard parametric PINNs that map physical parameters directly to solutions, our method conditions the solver on a latent state optimized to reflect the metric-based separation between regimes, showing ~49% lower physics residual (0.082 vs. 0.160). We train this architecture using a phase-based Alternating Optimization (AO) schedule to manage gradient conflicts between the metric and physics objectives. Preliminary experiments on the Duffing Oscillator demonstrate that while standard baselines suffer from spectral bias and high-capacity Hypernetworks overfit (memorizing data while violating physics), our approach achieves stable convergence with 2.18x lower gradient variance than a multi-output Sobolev Error baseline, and 5x fewer parameters than a hypernetwork-based alternative.

TL;DR: Proposes an online monitoring framework for detecting anomalies in autonomous vehicle object states using self-supervised embeddings, tested on the nuScenes dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safe operation of autonomous vehicles by detecting anomalies without relying on labeled anomaly data, which is often unavailable for unknown anomalies.

Method: Uses a JEPA-based self-supervised prediction task to create rich object embeddings, enabling anomaly detection without labels.

Result: Demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in identifying anomalies within object state representations on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: The framework is practical for real-world applications where unknown anomalies may arise, offering a solution without requiring labeled anomaly data.

Abstract: As autonomous vehicles are rolled out, measures must be taken to ensure their safe operation. In order to supervise a system that is already in operation, monitoring frameworks are frequently employed. These run continuously online in the background, supervising the system status and recording anomalies. This work proposes an online monitoring framework to detect anomalies in object state representations. Thereby, a key challenge is creating a framework for anomaly detection without anomaly labels, which are usually unavailable for unknown anomalies. To address this issue, this work applies a self-supervised embedding method to translate object data into a latent representation space. For this, a JEPA-based self-supervised prediction task is constructed, allowing training without anomaly labels and the creation of rich object embeddings. The resulting expressive JEPA embeddings serve as input for established anomaly detection methods, in order to identify anomalies within object state representations. This framework is particularly useful for applications in real-world environments, where new or unknown anomalies may occur during operation for which there are no labels available. Experiments performed on the publicly available, real-world nuScenes dataset illustrate the framework's capabilities.

TL;DR: Infusion uses influence functions to craft subtle training data edits that induce targeted model behavior, showing efficacy across domains and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore reverse influence functions—crafting training data that shapes model behavior—highlighting vulnerabilities in training data interpretability.

Method: Infusion employs scalable influence-function approximations to perturb training documents, inducing parameter shifts for targeted behavior.

Result: On CIFAR-10, subtle edits to 0.2% of training data rival inserting explicit examples. Effective across architectures (ResNet ↔ CNN) and amplifies learned behaviors in language tasks.

Conclusion: Small, subtle training data edits can systematically shape model behavior, emphasizing the need for interpretability in adversarial and defensive contexts.

Abstract: Influence functions are commonly used to attribute model behavior to training documents. We explore the reverse: crafting training data that induces model behavior. Our framework, Infusion, uses scalable influence-function approximations to compute small perturbations to training documents that induce targeted changes in model behavior through parameter shifts. We evaluate Infusion on data poisoning tasks across vision and language domains. On CIFAR-10, we show that making subtle edits via Infusion to just 0.2% (100/45,000) of the training documents can be competitive with the baseline of inserting a small number of explicit behavior examples. We also find that Infusion transfers across architectures (ResNet $\leftrightarrow$ CNN), suggesting a single poisoned corpus can affect multiple independently trained models. In preliminary language experiments, we characterize when our approach increases the probability of target behaviors and when it fails, finding it most effective at amplifying behaviors the model has already learned. Taken together, these results show that small, subtle edits to training data can systematically shape model behavior, underscoring the importance of training data interpretability for adversaries and defenders alike.

TL;DR: KANs integrated into HRPINNs were tested for accuracy in oscillatory systems but faced challenges like fragility and instability, often underperforming compared to MLPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem and initial gray-box results, aiming to improve recovery of unknown terms in systems.

Method: The method involved sensitivity analysis on configuration, parameter scale, and training paradigms to evaluate KANs against MLPs in handling univariate polynomial and multiplicative terms.

Result: KANs showed competitiveness in univariate polynomial residuals but struggled with hyperparameter fragility, instability in deeper setups, and consistently failed on multiplicative terms, generally underperforming MLPs.

Conclusion: The results highlight limitations of KANs' additive inductive bias for state coupling and suggest future work on hybrid modeling to address these challenges.

Abstract: We investigate the integration of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into hard-constrained recurrent physics-informed architectures (HRPINN) to evaluate the fidelity of learned residual manifolds in oscillatory systems. Motivated by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem and preliminary gray-box results, we hypothesized that KANs would enable efficient recovery of unknown terms compared to MLPs. Through initial sensitivity analysis on configuration sensitivity, parameter scale, and training paradigm, we found that while small KANs are competitive on univariate polynomial residuals (Duffing), they exhibit severe hyperparameter fragility, instability in deeper configurations, and consistent failure on multiplicative terms (Van der Pol), generally outperformed by standard MLPs. These empirical challenges highlight limitations of the additive inductive bias in the original KAN formulation for state coupling and provide preliminary empirical evidence of inductive bias limitations for future hybrid modeling.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AFRL, an Answer-First, Reason Later paradigm for search relevance models, balancing low latency and high performance using a novel Mode-Balanced Optimization strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of achieving low latency and high performance in search relevance models while retaining interpretability.

Method: Proposes AFRL, combining SFT and RL with Mode-Balanced Optimization, and includes automated instruction evolution and multi-stage curriculum.

Result: The 32B teacher model achieves state-of-the-art performance, and AFRL enables efficient knowledge distillation to smaller models.

Conclusion: AFRL effectively balances reasoning depth and deployment latency, successfully transferring expert logic to smaller models.

Abstract: Building a search relevance model that achieves both low latency and high performance is a long-standing challenge in the search industry. To satisfy the millisecond-level response requirements of online systems while retaining the interpretable reasoning traces of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel \textbf{Answer-First, Reason Later (AFRL)} paradigm. This paradigm requires the model to output the definitive relevance score in the very first token, followed by a structured logical explanation. Inspired by the success of reasoning models, we adopt a "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) + Reinforcement Learning (RL)" pipeline to achieve AFRL. However, directly applying existing RL training often leads to \textbf{mode collapse} in the search relevance task, where the model forgets complex long-tail rules in pursuit of high rewards. From an information theory perspective: RL inherently minimizes the \textbf{Reverse KL divergence}, which tends to seek probability peaks (mode-seeking) and is prone to "reward hacking." On the other hand, SFT minimizes the \textbf{Forward KL divergence}, forcing the model to cover the data distribution (mode-covering) and effectively anchoring expert rules. Based on this insight, we propose a \textbf{Mode-Balanced Optimization} strategy, incorporating an SFT auxiliary loss into Stepwise-GRPO training to balance these two properties. Furthermore, we construct an automated instruction evolution system and a multi-stage curriculum to ensure expert-level data quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 32B teacher model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the AFRL architecture enables efficient knowledge distillation, successfully transferring expert-level logic to a 0.6B model, thereby reconciling reasoning depth with deployment latency.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes iterative self-improvement in LLMs by modeling each improvement round as maximum-likelihood fine-tuning on reward-filtered outputs. It provides theoretical guarantees and explains the feedback loop sustaining improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The empirical success of self-improvement lacks theoretical grounding. The authors aim to bridge this gap by analyzing finite-sample guarantees and the dynamics of model improvement.

Method: Modeling self-improvement as maximum-likelihood fine-tuning on reward-filtered distributions, deriving finite-sample guarantees, and analyzing task difficulty and curricula.

Result: Identifies a feedback loop where better models process more data per iteration, leading to sustained improvement but eventual saturation. Shows easy-to-hard curricula outperform fixed task mixtures under specific conditions.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical insights into iterative self-improvement, supported by simulations and experiments, highlighting scenarios where curricula enhance model performance.

Abstract: Iterative self-improvement fine-tunes an autoregressive large language model (LLM) on reward-verified outputs generated by the LLM itself. In contrast to the empirical success of self-improvement, the theoretical foundation of this generative, iterative procedure in a practical, finite-sample setting remains limited. We make progress toward this goal by modeling each round of self-improvement as maximum-likelihood fine-tuning on a reward-filtered distribution and deriving finite-sample guarantees for the expected reward. Our analysis reveals an explicit feedback loop where better models accept more data per iteration, supporting sustained self-improvement while explaining eventual saturation of such improvement. Adopting a task-centric view by considering reasoning tasks with multiple difficulty levels, we further prove quantifiable conditions on model initialization, task difficulty, and sample budget where easy-to-hard curricula provably achieve better guarantees than training on fixed mixtures of tasks. Our analyses are validated via Monte-Carlo simulations and controlled experiments on graph-based reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADORA dynamically adjusts advantage function weights to improve policy optimization in reinforcement learning, enhancing performance without hyperparameter sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiency in credit assignment caused by static advantage estimation in reinforcement learning, which leads to suboptimal policy updates, slower convergence, and learning instability.

Method: The authors introduce ADORA, a framework that dynamically adjusts the advantage function's weighting by adaptively categorizing training data into advantageous and disadvantageous samples based on their evolving utility during online rollouts.

Result: Extensive evaluations show that ADORA significantly enhances reasoning tasks, achieving performance gains without needing sensitive hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: ADORA is a robust and efficient framework that improves policy optimization by dynamically adapting to the utility of training samples, leading to better performance in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become a cornerstone technique for developing reasoning models in complex tasks, ranging from mathematical problem-solving to imaginary reasoning. The optimization of these models typically relies on policy gradient methods, whose efficacy hinges on the accurate estimation of an advantage function. However, prevailing methods typically employ static advantage estimation, a practice that leads to inefficient credit assignment by neglecting the dynamic utility of training samples over time. This limitation results in suboptimal policy updates, which in turn manifest as slower convergence rates and increased learning instability, as models fail to adapt to evolving sample utilities effectively. To address this problem, we introduce \textbf{ADORA} (\textbf{A}dvantage \textbf{D}ynamics via \textbf{O}nline \textbf{R}ollout \textbf{A}daptation), a novel framework for policy optimization. ADORA dynamically adjusts the advantage function's weighting by adaptively categorizing training data into temporarily advantageous and disadvantageous samples, based on their evolving utility during online model rollouts. This tailored data differentiation strategy allows ADORA to be seamlessly integrated into existing policy optimization algorithms without significant architectural modifications, enabling the policy to prioritize learning from more informative experiences and thereby achieve more efficient policy updates. Extensive evaluations across diverse model families and varying data scales demonstrate that ADORA is a robust and efficient framework. It significantly enhances long reasoning in both geometric and mathematical tasks, consistently achieving notable performance gains without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vendi Novelty Score (VNS), a novel OOD detector based on diversity metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance without density modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detectors rely on restrictive assumptions. The authors propose a diversity-based approach to overcome these limitations.

Method: VNS uses similarity-based diversity metrics (Vendi Scores) to quantify novelty in test samples, combining local and global signals.

Result: VNS outperforms existing methods across benchmarks and works efficiently even with 1% of training data.

Conclusion: VNS provides a scalable, non-parametric solution for OOD detection, suitable for constrained settings.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of machine learning systems. Existing post-hoc detectors typically rely on model confidence scores or likelihood estimates in feature space, often under restrictive distributional assumptions. In this work, we introduce a third paradigm and formulate OOD detection from a diversity perspective. We propose the Vendi Novelty Score (VNS), an OOD detector based on the Vendi Scores (VS), a family of similarity-based diversity metrics. VNS quantifies how much a test sample increases the VS of the in-distribution feature set, providing a principled notion of novelty that does not require density modeling. VNS is linear-time, non-parametric, and naturally combines class-conditional (local) and dataset-level (global) novelty signals. Across multiple image classification benchmarks and network architectures, VNS achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance. Remarkably, VNS retains this performance when computed using only 1% of the training data, enabling deployment in memory- or access-constrained settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the artificial divide between MPNNs and spectral GNNs and accelerate progress in graph learning by unifying their theoretical frameworks.

Method: Proposes viewing MPNNs and spectral GNNs as different parametrizations of permutation-equivariant operators, analyzing their equivalence and complementary strengths.

Result: Many popular architectures are equivalent in expressive power, with genuine gaps only in specific regimes. MPNNs and spectral GNNs offer complementary strengths.

Conclusion: Progress in graph learning will benefit from unifying MPNNs and spectral GNNs within a common framework rather than treating them as competing paradigms.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly divided into message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) and spectral graph neural networks, reflecting two largely separate research traditions in machine learning and signal processing. This paper argues that this divide is mostly artificial, hindering progress in the field. We propose a viewpoint in which both MPNNs and spectral GNNs are understood as different parametrizations of permutation-equivariant operators acting on graph signals. From this perspective, many popular architectures are equivalent in expressive power, while genuine gaps arise only in specific regimes. We further argue that MPNNs and spectral GNNs offer complementary strengths. That is, MPNNs provide a natural language for discrete structure and expressivity analysis using tools from logic and graph isomorphism research, while the spectral perspective provides principled tools for understanding smoothing, bottlenecks, stability, and community structure. Overall, we posit that progress in graph learning will be accelerated by clearly understanding the key similarities and differences between these two types of GNNs, and by working towards unifying these perspectives within a common theoretical and conceptual framework rather than treating them as competing paradigms.

### [252] [Learning on the Manifold: Unlocking Standard Diffusion Transformers with Representation Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10099)
*Amandeep Kumar,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies Geometric Interference as the root cause of diffusion transformers' failure to converge on representation encoders. It proposes Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF) to solve this by aligning generative processes with manifold geodesics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency and failure of standard diffusion transformers to converge on representation encoders without costly width scaling.

Method: The method involves introducing RJF, which constrains generative processes to manifold geodesics and corrects curvature-induced errors, enabling standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge.

Result: RJF achieves an FID of 3.37 with the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters), where prior methods failed to converge.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that RJF effectively resolves Geometric Interference, enabling efficient and high-fidelity synthesis without costly architectural changes.

Abstract: Leveraging representation encoders for generative modeling offers a path for efficient, high-fidelity synthesis. However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge. Code: https://github.com/amandpkr/RJF

### [253] [Effectiveness of Binary Autoencoders for QUBO-Based Optimization Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10037)
*Tetsuro Abe,Masashi Yamashita,Shu Tanaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores FMQA with binary autoencoder (bAE) for black-box combinatorial optimization, showing bAE improves efficiency by aligning latent Hamming distances with original solution spaces and reducing infeasible candidates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in binary encodings for nonbinary structures in FMQA, ensuring meaningful modifications and fewer infeasible solutions.

Method: Combines FMQA with bAE to learn compact binary latent codes from feasible solutions, tested on a small traveling salesman problem.

Result: bAE reconstructs feasible tours accurately, aligns distances better, and produces smoother neighborhoods with fewer local optima, enhancing FMQA performance.

Conclusion: bAE+FMQA improves optimization efficiency by maintaining feasibility and aligning latent-representation properties with original solution spaces.

Abstract: In black-box combinatorial optimization, objective evaluations are often expensive, so high quality solutions must be found under a limited budget. Factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA) builds a quadratic surrogate model from evaluated samples and optimizes it on an Ising machine. However, FMQA requires binary decision variables, and for nonbinary structures such as integer permutations, the choice of binary encoding strongly affects search efficiency. If the encoding fails to reflect the original neighborhood structure, small Hamming moves may not correspond to meaningful modifications in the original solution space, and constrained problems can yield many infeasible candidates that waste evaluations. Recent work combines FMQA with a binary autoencoder (bAE) that learns a compact binary latent code from feasible solutions, yet the mechanism behind its performance gains is unclear. Using a small traveling salesman problem as an interpretable testbed, we show that the bAE reconstructs feasible tours accurately and, compared with manually designed encodings at similar compression, better aligns tour distances with latent Hamming distances, yields smoother neighborhoods under small bit flips, and produces fewer local optima. These geometric properties explain why bAE+FMQA improves the approximation ratio faster while maintaining feasibility throughout optimization, and they provide guidance for designing latent representations for black-box optimization.

*Akshay Mete,Shahid Aamir Sheikh,Tzu-Hsiang Lin,Dileep Kalathil,P. R. Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Optimistic World Models (OWMs) introduce a gradient-based optimistic exploration framework for RL, improving sample efficiency without needing uncertainty estimates or constrained optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient exploration in sparse-reward RL environments is challenging; OWMs address this by integrating optimism directly into model learning.

Method: OWMs use an optimistic dynamics loss to bias imagined transitions toward higher rewards, compatible with existing world model frameworks like DreamerV3 and STORM.

Result: OWMs (Optimistic DreamerV3 and Optimistic STORM) outperform baselines in sample efficiency and cumulative return.

Conclusion: OWMs provide a scalable, plug-and-play solution for optimistic exploration in deep RL.

Abstract: Efficient exploration remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in sparse-reward environments. We introduce Optimistic World Models (OWMs), a principled and scalable framework for optimistic exploration that brings classical reward-biased maximum likelihood estimation (RBMLE) from adaptive control into deep RL. In contrast to upper confidence bound (UCB)-style exploration methods, OWMs incorporate optimism directly into model learning by augmentation with an optimistic dynamics loss that biases imagined transitions toward higher-reward outcomes. This fully gradient-based loss requires neither uncertainty estimates nor constrained optimization. Our approach is plug-and-play with existing world model frameworks, preserving scalability while requiring only minimal modifications to standard training procedures. We instantiate OWMs within two state-of-the-art world model architectures, leading to Optimistic DreamerV3 and Optimistic STORM, which demonstrate significant improvements in sample efficiency and cumulative return compared to their baseline counterparts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FGO is a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes Chain-of-Thought reasoning in LLMs by compressing verbose responses without performance loss, addressing GRPO's limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational costs and latency in LLMs caused by unnecessarily verbose Chain-of-Thought reasoning, while maintaining performance.

Method: Proposes Fine-grained Group policy Optimization (FGO), an RL algorithm that subdivides group responses and assigns weights based on length and entropy for CoT compression.

Result: FGO effectively compresses CoT reasoning without degrading performance and resolves inefficiencies and entropy collapse in GRPO.

Conclusion: FGO successfully optimizes CoT reasoning in LLMs, addressing GRPO's limitations and improving efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate unnecessarily verbose Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning that increases computational costs and latency without proportional performance gains. In this paper, we propose \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{G}roup policy \textbf{O}ptimization (\textbf{FGO}), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm that refines group responses by subdividing them and assigning appropriate weights based on length and entropy, thereby enabling effective CoT compression. Meanwhile, as an enhanced variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), FGO successfully addresses two major limitations of the GRPO: inefficient data utilization and entropy collapse. We evaluate FGO on multiple reasoning LLMs and benchmarks, including MATH500, AIME24, AMC23, and Minerva. Experimental results show that FGO achieves efficient CoT compression without degrading performance, and simultaneously resolves the key limitations of GRPO.

### [256] [WildCat: Near-Linear Attention in Theory and Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10056)
*Tobias Schröder,Lester Mackey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WildCat compresses attention mechanisms in neural networks efficiently, using a coreset-based approach to achieve high accuracy with near-linear runtime, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The attention mechanism in neural networks is resource-intensive, scaling quadratically with input length. WildCat aims to reduce this cost while maintaining high accuracy.

Method: WildCat uses a weighted coreset selected via randomly pivoted Cholesky subsampling, optimizing weights to minimize reconstruction error.

Result: WildCat achieves super-polynomial error decay and near-linear runtime, demonstrating efficiency in image generation, classification, and language model tasks.

Conclusion: WildCat offers a practical, high-fidelity solution for attention mechanism compression, outperforming prior approximations.

Abstract: We introduce WildCat, a high-accuracy, low-cost approach to compressing the attention mechanism in neural networks. While attention is a staple of modern network architectures, it is also notoriously expensive to deploy due to resource requirements that scale quadratically with the input sequence length $n$. WildCat avoids these quadratic costs by only attending over a small weighted coreset. Crucially, we select the coreset using a fast but spectrally-accurate subsampling algorithm -- randomly pivoted Cholesky -- and weight the elements optimally to minimise reconstruction error. Remarkably, given bounded inputs, WildCat approximates exact attention with super-polynomial $O(n^{-\sqrt{\log(\log(n))}})$ error decay while running in near-linear $O(n^{1+o(1)})$ time. In contrast, prior practical approximations either lack error guarantees or require quadratic runtime to guarantee such high fidelity. We couple this advance with a GPU-optimized PyTorch implementation and a suite of benchmark experiments demonstrating the benefits of WildCat for image generation, image classification, and language model KV cache compression.

### [257] [Features as Rewards: Scalable Supervision for Open-Ended Tasks via Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10067)
*Aaditya Vikram Prasad,Connor Watts,Jack Merullo,Dhruvil Gala,Owen Lewis,Thomas McGrath,Ekdeep Singh Lubana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLFR, a reinforcement learning pipeline using language model features as scalable supervision for open-ended tasks, specifically reducing hallucinations by 58% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address open-ended tasks like hallucination-reduction, leveraging interpretable features from language models as scalable supervision.

Method: RLFR pipeline uses features as reward functions, probes for hallucinated claims, and teaches models to intervene and correct uncertain completions.

Result: A 58% reduction in hallucinations on Gemma-3-12B-IT without compromising standard benchmark performance.

Conclusion: Features-based supervision offers a novel paradigm for learning open-ended tasks using interpretability.

Abstract: Language models trained on large-scale datasets have been shown to learn features that encode abstract concepts such as factuality or intent. Such features are traditionally used for test-time monitoring or steering. We present an alternative affordance: features as scalable supervision for open-ended tasks. We consider the case of hallucination-reduction as a desirable, yet open-ended behavior and design a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline, titled RLFR (Reinforcement Learning from Feature Rewards), that uses features as reward functions. Grounded in a novel probing framework that identifies candidate hallucinated claims, our pipeline teaches a model to intervene and correct its completions when it is uncertain of their factuality. Furthermore, the pipeline enables scalable test-time compute, guided once more by our reward features. This end-to-end process operationalized on Gemma-3-12B-IT results in a policy that is 58% less likely to hallucinate compared to the original model, while preserving performance on standard benchmarks. Taken together, by grounding supervision in the language of features, this paper introduces a novel paradigm in the use of interpretability for learning open-ended tasks.

*Georgios Kaissis,David Mildenberger,Juan Felipe Gomez,Martin J. Menten,Eleni Triantafillou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SDI decomposes TracIn into step-by-step influence trajectories for looped transformers, enabling per-iteration insights into training data impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how individual training examples influence specific iterations in looped transformers, addressing the limitation of aggregated scores.

Method: Introduces Step-Decomposed Influence (SDI), unrolling the recurrent graph to attribute influence per iteration, and uses TensorSketch for scalability.

Result: SDI scales well, matches baselines accurately, and provides detailed insights into latent reasoning.

Conclusion: SDI offers practical, scalable per-step influence analysis for looped transformers, enhancing interpretability.

Abstract: We study how individual training examples shape the internal computation of looped transformers, where a shared block is applied for $τ$ recurrent iterations to enable latent reasoning. Existing training-data influence estimators such as TracIn yield a single scalar score that aggregates over all loop iterations, obscuring when during the recurrent computation a training example matters. We introduce \textit{Step-Decomposed Influence (SDI)}, which decomposes TracIn into a length-$τ$ influence trajectory by unrolling the recurrent computation graph and attributing influence to specific loop iterations. To make SDI practical at transformer scale, we propose a TensorSketch implementation that never materialises per-example gradients. Experiments on looped GPT-style models and algorithmic reasoning tasks show that SDI scales excellently, matches full-gradient baselines with low error and supports a broad range of data attribution and interpretability tasks with per-step insights into the latent reasoning process.

*Júlio Oliveira,Rodrigo Ferreira,André Riker,Glaucio H. S. Carvalho,Eirini Eleni Tsilopoulou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes FEXT-DP, a Federated Learning model combining Decision Trees for explainability with Differential Privacy for enhanced data privacy, though DP slightly reduces explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dual challenges of data privacy and explainability in Machine Learning by integrating Federated Learning with Decision Trees and Differential Privacy.

Method: Develop FEXT-DP, a Federated Learning system using Decision Trees (for explainability) and Differential Privacy (for privacy), then analyze DP's impact on explainability.

Result: FEXT-DP shows faster training, improved Mean Squared Error, and better explainability, despite DP's minor negative effect on interpretability.

Conclusion: FEXT-DP successfully balances privacy and explainability in ML, highlighting trade-offs and demonstrating effective performance.

Abstract: Data privacy and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) are two important aspects for modern Machine Learning systems. To enhance data privacy, recent machine learning models have been designed as a Federated Learning (FL) system. On top of that, additional privacy layers can be added, via Differential Privacy (DP). On the other hand, to improve explainability, ML must consider more interpretable approaches with reduced number of features and less complex internal architecture. In this context, this paper aims to achieve a machine learning (ML) model that combines enhanced data privacy with explainability. So, we propose a FL solution, called Federated EXplainable Trees with Differential Privacy (FEXT-DP), that: (i) is based on Decision Trees, since they are lightweight and have superior explainability than neural networks-based FL systems; (ii) provides additional layer of data privacy protection applying Differential Privacy (DP) to the Tree-Based model. However, there is a side effect adding DP: it harms the explainability of the system. So, this paper also presents the impact of DP protection on the explainability of the ML model. The carried out performance assessment shows improvements of FEXT-DP in terms of a faster training, i.e., numbers of rounds, Mean Squared Error and explainability.

*Iván Arcuschin,David Chanin,Adrià Garriga-Alonso,Oana-Maria Camburu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fully automated pipeline to detect unverbalized biases in LLMs, such as Spanish fluency or writing formality, by using statistical testing and LLM autoraters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias evaluations in LLMs are unreliable due to unverbalized biases (internal biases not stated in reasoning traces) and often require manual effort. This work aims to automate the detection of these biases.

Method: A black-box pipeline uses LLM autoraters to generate bias concepts, tests them on input samples with statistical techniques for multiple testing and early stopping, and flags biases if they cause performance differences without being cited in reasoning traces.

Result: The pipeline discovered unknown biases (e.g., Spanish fluency) in six LLMs across three decision tasks (hiring, loan approval, university admissions) and validated biases from prior work (e.g., gender, race).

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable, practical method for automatic task-specific bias discovery, enhancing bias monitoring in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning traces that appear plausible, but may hide internal biases. We call these *unverbalized biases*. Monitoring models via their stated reasoning is therefore unreliable, and existing bias evaluations typically require predefined categories and hand-crafted datasets. In this work, we introduce a fully automated, black-box pipeline for detecting task-specific unverbalized biases. Given a task dataset, the pipeline uses LLM autoraters to generate candidate bias concepts. It then tests each concept on progressively larger input samples by generating positive and negative variations, and applies statistical techniques for multiple testing and early stopping. A concept is flagged as an unverbalized bias if it yields statistically significant performance differences while not being cited as justification in the model's CoTs. We evaluate our pipeline across six LLMs on three decision tasks (hiring, loan approval, and university admissions). Our technique automatically discovers previously unknown biases in these models (e.g., Spanish fluency, English proficiency, writing formality). In the same run, the pipeline also validates biases that were manually identified by prior work (gender, race, religion, ethnicity). More broadly, our proposed approach provides a practical, scalable path to automatic task-specific bias discovery.

TL;DR: CoMMa is a decentralized LLM-agent framework for oncology tasks, using deterministic embedding projections for robust, interpretable decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve oncology decision support by enabling robust, interpretable reasoning over dynamic, heterogeneous patient data.

Method: Decentralized LLM-agents with game-theoretic coordination and deterministic embedding projections for contribution-aware credit assignment.

Result: Higher accuracy and stability compared to centralized and role-based multi-agent baselines.

Conclusion: CoMMa offers a mathematically grounded, interpretable approach for oncology decision support.

Abstract: Recent multi-agent frameworks have broadened the ability to tackle oncology decision support tasks that require reasoning over dynamic, heterogeneous patient data. We propose Contribution-Aware Medical Multi-Agents (CoMMa), a decentralized LLM-agent framework in which specialists operate on partitioned evidence and coordinate through a game-theoretic objective for robust decision-making. In contrast to most agent architectures relying on stochastic narrative-based reasoning, CoMMa utilizes deterministic embedding projections to approximate contribution-aware credit assignment. This yields explicit evidence attribution by estimating each agent's marginal utility, producing interpretable and mathematically grounded decision pathways with improved stability. Evaluated on diverse oncology benchmarks, including a real-world multidisciplinary tumor board dataset, CoMMa achieves higher accuracy and more stable performance than data-centralized and role-based multi-agents baselines.

TL;DR: Cadmus is a low-cost system with a small autoregressive transformer model and a dataset of true programs, enabling affordable research on program synthesis, out-of-distribution representations, and inductive reasoning, outperforming GPT-5 in accuracy while offering transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like distribution control, fine-tuning effects, and high costs in large language model (LLM)-based program synthesis research.

Method: Cadmus includes an integer VM, a diverse true program dataset, and a small transformer model trained for under $200, enabling fine-grained control and instrumentation.

Result: Cadmus models outperform GPT-5 (100% vs. 95% accuracy) on integer arithmetic tasks and provide transparent dataset-task relationships, unlike GPT-5's confounding priors.

Conclusion: Small models like Cadmus offer affordable, transparent alternatives for studying program synthesis and reasoning tasks, avoiding pitfalls of large LLMs.

Abstract: What research can be pursued with small models trained to complete true programs? Typically, researchers study program synthesis via large language models (LLMs) which introduce issues such as knowing what is in or out of distribution, understanding fine-tuning effects, understanding the effects of tokenization, and higher demand on compute and storage to carry out experiments. We present a system called Cadmus which includes an integer virtual machine (VM), a dataset composed of true programs of diverse tasks, and an autoregressive transformer model that is trained for under \$200 of compute cost. The system can be used to study program completion, out-of-distribution representations, inductive reasoning, and instruction following in a setting where researchers have effective and affordable fine-grained control of the training distribution and the ability to inspect and instrument models. Smaller models working on complex reasoning tasks enable instrumentation and investigations that may be prohibitively expensive on larger models. To demonstrate that these tasks are complex enough to be of interest, we show that these Cadmus models outperform GPT-5 (by achieving 100\% accuracy while GPT-5 has 95\% accuracy) even on a simple task of completing correct, integer arithmetic programs in our domain-specific language (DSL) while providing transparency into the dataset's relationship to the problem. We also show that GPT-5 brings unknown priors into its reasoning process when solving the same tasks, demonstrating a confounding factor that prevents the use of large-scale LLMs for some investigations where the training set relationship to the task needs to be fully understood.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A lightweight, privacy-preserving Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) framework is introduced for edge devices, using speech, text, and facial imagery. It employs efficient backbones for each modality and a novel fusion mechanism based on Dempster-Shafer theory, achieving competitive accuracy on benchmarks while being robust to uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a modular, scalable, and privacy-preserving MER framework for edge devices that handles uncertainty across modalities without requiring additional training.

Method: The framework uses dedicated backbones (Emotion2Vec for speech, ResNet for facial expressions, DistilRoBERTa for text) and introduces a model-agnostic fusion mechanism grounded in Dempster-Shafer theory and Dirichlet evidence.

Result: Validation on five benchmark datasets shows competitive accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness to ambiguous or missing inputs.

Conclusion: The framework highlights modularity, scalability, and real-world feasibility, enabling uncertainty-aware MER for applications like healthcare and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: In this work, we present a lightweight and privacy-preserving Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) framework designed for deployment on edge devices. To demonstrate framework's versatility, our implementation uses three modalities - speech, text and facial imagery. However, the system is fully modular, and can be extended to support other modalities or tasks. Each modality is processed through a dedicated backbone optimized for inference efficiency: Emotion2Vec for speech, a ResNet-based model for facial expressions, and DistilRoBERTa for text. To reconcile uncertainty across modalities, we introduce a model- and task-agnostic fusion mechanism grounded in Dempster-Shafer theory and Dirichlet evidence. Operating directly on model logits, this approach captures predictive uncertainty without requiring additional training or joint distribution estimation, making it broadly applicable beyond emotion recognition. Validation on five benchmark datasets (eNTERFACE05, MEAD, MELD, RAVDESS and CREMA-D) show that our method achieves competitive accuracy while remaining computationally efficient and robust to ambiguous or missing inputs. Overall, the proposed framework emphasizes modularity, scalability, and real-world feasibility, paving the way toward uncertainty-aware multimodal systems for healthcare, human-computer interaction, and other emotion-informed applications.

*Haitao Jiang,Lin Ge,Hengrui Cai,Rui Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PABU is a belief-state framework for LLM agents that focuses on task progress and selective retention of actions/observations, outperforming SoTA models in efficiency and task completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address redundant actions and high inference costs in LLM agents by filtering task-irrelevant information from action-observation histories.

Method: PABU predicts task progress and selectively retains relevant interactions, conditioning decisions only on retained subsets.

Result: Achieves 81.0% task completion (23.9% higher than SoTA) and reduces interaction steps by 26.9% (average 9.5 steps).

Conclusion: Explicit progress prediction and selective retention are key for efficient and robust belief learning in LLM agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents commonly condition actions on full action-observation histories, which introduce task-irrelevant information that easily leads to redundant actions and higher inference cost. We propose Progress-Aware Belief Update (PABU), a belief-state framework that compactly represents an agent's state by explicitly modeling task progress and selectively retaining past actions and observations. At each step, the agent predicts its relative progress since the previous round and decides whether the newly encountered interaction should be stored, conditioning future decisions only on the retained subset. Across eight environments in the AgentGym benchmark, and using identical training trajectories, PABU achieves an 81.0% task completion rate, outperforming previous State of the art (SoTA) models with full-history belief by 23.9%. Additionally, PABU's progress-oriented action selection improves efficiency, reducing the average number of interaction steps to 9.5, corresponding to a 26.9% reduction. Ablation studies show that both explicit progress prediction and selective retention are necessary for robust belief learning and performance gains.

*Xingjian Zhang,Sophia Moylan,Ziyang Xiong,Qiaozhu Mei,Yichen Luo,Jiaqi W. Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FlyBench is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate AI agents for ontology curation from scientific literature, focusing on end-to-end accuracy and workflow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks capturing the full workflow of expert curators in scientific knowledge bases, FlyBench evaluates AI agents on tasks like searching, reading, and annotating gene-related data.

Method: The benchmark involves tasks such as searching 16,898 papers, extracting structured annotations (e.g., Gene Ontology terms), and evaluating four agent architectures: memorization, fixed pipeline, single-agent, and multi-agent.

Result: Multi-agent designs outperform simpler architectures, but scaling models shows diminishing returns. All baselines indicate significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: FlyBench aims to advance retrieval-augmented scientific reasoning, highlighting the need for better agent designs to mimic curator workflows effectively.

Abstract: Scientific knowledge bases accelerate discovery by curating findings from primary literature into structured, queryable formats for both human researchers and emerging AI systems. Maintaining these resources requires expert curators to search relevant papers, reconcile evidence across documents, and produce ontology-grounded annotations - a workflow that existing benchmarks, focused on isolated subtasks like named entity recognition or relation extraction, do not capture. We present FlyBench to evaluate AI agents on end-to-end agentic ontology curation from scientific literature. Given only a gene symbol, agents must search and read from a corpus of 16,898 full-text papers to produce structured annotations: Gene Ontology terms describing function, expression patterns, and historical synonyms linking decades of nomenclature. The benchmark includes 7,397 expert-curated annotations across 100 genes drawn from FlyBase, the Drosophila (fruit fly) knowledge base. We evaluate four baseline agent architectures: memorization, fixed pipeline, single-agent, and multi-agent. We find that architectural choices significantly impact performance, with multi-agent designs outperforming simpler alternatives, yet scaling backbone models yields diminishing returns. All baselines leave substantial room for improvement. Our analysis surfaces several findings to guide future development; for example, agents primarily use retrieval to confirm parametric knowledge rather than discover new information. We hope FlyBench will drive progress on retrieval-augmented scientific reasoning, a capability with broad applications across scientific domains.

TL;DR: A new framework using topological data analysis (TDA) and persistence landscapes (PLs) to measure diversity by capturing geometric features in datasets, outperforming traditional entropy-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diversity metrics focus on distributional variation but overlook geometric structure, limiting their ability to capture the full richness of datasets.

Method: Proposes a framework leveraging TDA and PLs to extract and quantify geometric features, introducing the PLDiv metric.

Result: PLDiv is shown to be powerful, reliable, and interpretable, effectively linking diversity to dataset geometry across various modalities.

Conclusion: The PLDiv metric offers a foundational tool for dataset construction, augmentation, and evaluation, advancing diversity measurement beyond entropy-based approaches.

Abstract: Diversity can be broadly defined as the presence of meaningful variation across elements, which can be viewed from multiple perspectives, including statistical variation and geometric structural richness in the dataset. Existing diversity metrics, such as feature-space dispersion and metric-space magnitude, primarily capture distributional variation or entropy, while largely neglecting the geometric structure of datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a framework based on topological data analysis (TDA) and persistence landscapes (PLs) to extract and quantify geometric features from data. This approach provides a theoretically grounded means of measuring diversity beyond entropy, capturing the rich geometric and structural properties of datasets. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities, we demonstrate that our proposed PLs-based diversity metric (PLDiv) is powerful, reliable, and interpretable, directly linking data diversity to its underlying geometry and offering a foundational tool for dataset construction, augmentation, and evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentAuditor replaces majority voting in multi-agent systems with a reasoning tree approach, improving accuracy by 5% over voting and 3% over LLM-as-Judge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frameworks aggregate agent outputs via majority voting, which ignores reasoning traces and fails under correlated biases.

Method: AgentAuditor uses a Reasoning Tree to identify and resolve conflicts at divergence points, supported by ACPO to train adjudicators against consensus errors.

Result: AgentAuditor outperforms majority voting by 5% and LLM-as-Judge by 3% across various settings.

Conclusion: AgentAuditor offers a robust, efficient alternative to majority voting, enhancing accuracy in multi-agent reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) can substantially extend the reasoning capacity of large language models (LLMs), yet most frameworks still aggregate agent outputs with majority voting. This heuristic discards the evidential structure of reasoning traces and is brittle under the confabulation consensus, where agents share correlated biases and converge on the same incorrect rationale. We introduce AgentAuditor, which replaces voting with a path search over a Reasoning Tree that explicitly represents agreements and divergences among agent traces. AgentAuditor resolves conflicts by comparing reasoning branches at critical divergence points, turning global adjudication into efficient, localized verification. We further propose Anti-Consensus Preference Optimization (ACPO), which trains the adjudicator on majority-failure cases and rewards evidence-based minority selections over popular errors.

*Michail S. Alexiou,J. Sukarno Mertoguno*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes formal reasoning wrappers to enhance machine learning toxicity detection systems against adversarial attacks like negation, improving accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyberbullying via toxic comments necessitates robust moderation tools; current ML-based systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks.

Method: Developed formal reasoning methodologies as pre/post-processing steps around ML models to counter negation attacks.

Result: Hybrid methods outperformed purely statistical solutions in tests against negation adversarial datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating formal reasoning with ML enhances toxicity detection robustness against adversarial manipulations.

Abstract: The rise of cyberbullying in social media platforms involving toxic comments has escalated the need for effective ways to monitor and moderate online interactions. Existing solutions of automated toxicity detection systems, are based on a machine or deep learning algorithms. However, statistics-based solutions are generally prone to adversarial attacks that contain logic based modifications such as negation in phrases and sentences. In that regard, we present a set of formal reasoning-based methodologies that wrap around existing machine learning toxicity detection systems. Acting as both pre-processing and post-processing steps, our formal reasoning wrapper helps alleviating the negation attack problems and significantly improves the accuracy and efficacy of toxicity scoring. We evaluate different variations of our wrapper on multiple machine learning models against a negation adversarial dataset. Experimental results highlight the improvement of hybrid (formal reasoning and machine-learning) methods against various purely statistical solutions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses AI's growing role in radiology for image reconstruction and enhancement, highlighting its benefits and potential risks like image quality perception vs. information content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To raise awareness about the limitations of AI-enabled image reconstruction in radiology, ensuring safe and effective use while maximizing benefits.

Method: Focuses on evaluating AI's impact on image quality and information content in radiology, identifying risks and limitations.

Result: AI improves image sharpness and speed but introduces risks like misleading quality perception and information gaps.

Conclusion: Understanding AI's limitations is crucial for safe deployment, balancing benefits with minimized risks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being deployed within radiology at a rapid pace. AI has proven an excellent tool for reconstructing and enhancing images that appear sharper, smoother, and more detailed, can be acquired more quickly, and allowing clinicians to review them more rapidly. However, incorporation of AI also introduces new failure modes and can exacerbate the disconnect between perceived quality of an image and information content of that image. Understanding the limitations of AI-enabled image reconstruction and enhancement is critical for safe and effective use of the technology. Hence, the purpose of this communication is to bring awareness to limitations when AI is used to reconstruct or enhance a radiological image, with the goal of enabling users to reap benefits of the technology while minimizing risks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: P1-VL, a vision-language model, advances scientific reasoning by combining multimodal perception with abstract logic, achieving top performance in physics benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to bridge the visual-logical gap in LLMs for science-grade reasoning, especially physics, where diagrams provide essential constraints.

Method: Harmonizes Curriculum Reinforcement Learning for progressive difficulty and Agentic Augmentation for iterative self-verification.

Result: P1-VL-235B-A22B achieves 12 gold medals on HiPhO, ranks No.2 globally, and excels in STEM benchmarks.

Conclusion: P1-VL provides a foundational step toward general-purpose physical intelligence, aligning visual perception with abstract physical laws.

Abstract: The transition from symbolic manipulation to science-grade reasoning represents a pivotal frontier for Large Language Models (LLMs), with physics serving as the critical test anchor for binding abstract logic to physical reality. Physics demands that a model maintain physical consistency with the laws governing the universe, a task that fundamentally requires multimodal perception to ground abstract logic in reality. At the Olympiad level, diagrams are often constitutive rather than illustrative, containing essential constraints, such as boundary conditions and spatial symmetries, that are absent from the text. To bridge this visual-logical gap, we introduce P1-VL, a family of open-source vision-language models engineered for advanced scientific reasoning. Our method harmonizes Curriculum Reinforcement Learning, which employs progressive difficulty expansion to stabilize post-training, with Agentic Augmentation, enabling iterative self-verification at inference. Evaluated on HiPhO, a rigorous benchmark of 13 exams from 2024-2025, our flagship P1-VL-235B-A22B becomes the first open-source Vision-Language Model (VLM) to secure 12 gold medals and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the open-source models. Our agent-augmented system achieves the No.2 overall rank globally, trailing only Gemini-3-Pro. Beyond physics, P1-VL demonstrates remarkable scientific reasoning capacity and generalizability, establishing significant leads over base models in STEM benchmarks. By open-sourcing P1-VL, we provide a foundational step toward general-purpose physical intelligence to better align visual perceptions with abstract physical laws for machine scientific discovery.

### [271] [SpotAgent: Grounding Visual Geo-localization in Large Vision-Language Models through Agentic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09463)
*Furong Jia,Ling Dai,Wenjin Deng,Fan Zhang,Chen Hu,Daxin Jiang,Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SpotAgent is a new framework for geo-localization that combines visual interpretation with tool-assisted verification to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations in LVLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often struggle with sparse or ambiguous visual cues in geo-localization, leading to ungrounded predictions. SpotAgent aims to address this by integrating expert-level reasoning and external tools.

Method: SpotAgent uses a 3-stage training pipeline: SFT for alignment, Agentic Cold Start for tool-calling skills, and RL for refined reasoning. It employs a Spatially-Aware Dynamic Filtering strategy to optimize RL efficiency.

Result: SpotAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing hallucinations and delivering precise, verifiable geo-localization results.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines visual and tool-based reasoning, offering a robust solution for real-world geo-localization challenges.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in geo-localization, yet they often struggle in real-world scenarios where visual cues are sparse, long-tailed, and highly ambiguous. Previous approaches, bound by internal knowledge, often fail to provide verifiable results, yielding confident but ungrounded predictions when faced with confounded evidence. To address these challenges, we propose SpotAgent, a framework that formalizes geo-localization into an agentic reasoning process that leverages expert-level reasoning to synergize visual interpretation with tool-assisted verification. SpotAgent actively explores and verifies visual cues by leveraging external tools (e.g., web search, maps) through a ReAct diagram. We introduce a 3-stage post-training pipeline starting with a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage for basic alignment, followed by an Agentic Cold Start phase utilizing high-quality trajectories synthesized via a Multi-Agent framework, aiming to instill tool-calling expertise. Subsequently, the model's reasoning capabilities are refined through Reinforcement Learning. We propose a Spatially-Aware Dynamic Filtering strategy to enhance the efficiency of the RL stage by prioritizing learnable samples based on spatial difficulty. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SpotAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively mitigating hallucinations while delivering precise and verifiable geo-localization.

*Yizhi Wang,Linan Yue,Min-Ling Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: XMCC is an explainable multimodal CoT compressor that shortens reasoning trajectories while preserving key steps and correctness, using reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing long CoTs are inefficient due to redundancy and lack of explainability in compression.

Method: XMCC formulates compression as a sequential decision-making process optimized via reinforcement learning.

Result: XMCC reduces reasoning length and provides explainable explanations, validated by benchmarks.

Conclusion: XMCC effectively compresses CoTs while maintaining integrity and explainability.

Abstract: Long chains of thought (Long CoTs) are widely employed in multimodal reasoning models to tackle complex tasks by capturing detailed visual information. However, these Long CoTs are often excessively lengthy and contain redundant reasoning steps, which can hinder inference efficiency. Compressing these long CoTs is a natural solution, yet existing approaches face two major challenges: (1) they may compromise the integrity of visual-textual reasoning by removing essential alignment cues, and (2) the compression process lacks explainability, making it difficult to discern which information is critical. To address these problems, we propose XMCC, an eXplainable Multimodal CoT Compressor that formulates compression as a sequential decision-making process optimized via reinforcement learning. XMCC can effectively shorten reasoning trajectories while preserving key reasoning steps and answer correctness, and simultaneously generates natural-language explanations for its compression decisions. Extensive experiments on representative multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that XMCC not only reduces reasoning length but also provides explainable explanations, validating its effectiveness.

*Lars Henry Berge Olsen,Dennis Christensen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores using TabPFN, a tabular foundation model, to efficiently compute Shapley values by leveraging in-context learning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in most cases with significantly reduced runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley values are crucial for explainable AI but computationally expensive, especially with dependent features. Traditional methods require time-consuming retraining or Monte Carlo integration, which TabPFN aims to overcome.

Method: The paper evaluates Shapley values using multiple variants of TabPFN, comparing their performance with state-of-the-art methods on simulated and real datasets.

Result: TabPFN generally outperforms other methods or performs comparably at a fraction of the runtime.

Conclusion: TabPFN offers a promising solution for efficient Shapley value computation, though further adaptations could enhance its effectiveness for conditional estimation.

Abstract: Shapley values have become a cornerstone of explainable AI, but they are computationally expensive to use, especially when features are dependent. Evaluating them requires approximating a large number of conditional expectations, either via Monte Carlo integration or regression. Until recently it has not been possible to fully exploit deep learning for the regression approach, because retraining for each conditional expectation takes too long. Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN overcome this computational hurdle by leveraging in-context learning, so each conditional expectation can be approximated without any re-training. In this paper, we compute Shapley values with multiple variants of TabPFN and compare their performance with state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real datasets. In most cases, TabPFN yields the best performance; where it does not, it is only marginally worse than the best method, at a fraction of the runtime. We discuss further improvements and how tabular foundation models can be better adapted specifically for conditional Shapley value estimation.

*Martin Bauw*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using partially complex-valued neural networks for improved radar target detection in cluttered environments with distorted echoes and closely spaced targets, outperforming traditional pulse compression methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar target detection is hindered by clutter, waveform distortion, and target proximity, which complicates accurate detection. Current methods struggle with these challenges, necessitating adaptive solutions.

Method: The paper proposes partially complex-valued neural networks for processing radar range profiles. It generates simulated datasets and compares neural networks against traditional pulse compression techniques.

Result: The neural network processes the entire received signal at once to generate a detection profile, showing potential advantages over pulse compression, which handles only one pulse length at a time.

Conclusion: Partially complex-valued neural networks offer a promising adaptive approach for radar target detection, especially in scenarios with multiple, closely spaced targets and distorted echoes.

Abstract: Correctly detecting radar targets is usually challenged by clutter and waveform distortion. An additional difficulty stems from the relative proximity of several targets, the latter being perceived as a single target in the worst case, or influencing each other's detection thresholds. The negative impact of targets proximity notably depends on the range resolution defined by the radar parameters and the adaptive threshold adopted. This paper addresses the matter of targets detection in radar range profiles containing multiple targets with varying proximity and distorted echoes. Inspired by recent contributions in the radar and signal processing literature, this work proposes partially complex-valued neural networks as an adaptive range profile processing. Simulated datasets are generated and experiments are conducted to compare a common pulse compression approach with a simple neural network partially defined by complex-valued parameters. Whereas the pulse compression processes one pulse length at a time, the neural network put forward is a generative architecture going through the entire received signal in one go to generate a complete detection profile.

### [275] [FLINGO -- Instilling ASP Expressiveness into Linear Integer Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09620)
*Jorge Fandinno,Pedro Cabalar,Philipp Wanko,Torsten Schaub*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FLINGO extends CASP with ASP-like expressiveness for numerical constraints, bridging the gap between CASP and traditional ASP features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation in CASP where numerical attributes lose ASP-like expressiveness (e.g., default values, non-deterministic assignments) when represented as constraints.

Method: Introduces FLINGO, a language and tool that integrates ASP-like features into CASP's numerical constraints, and provides a translation from FLINGO to standard CASP programs in CLINGCON format.

Result: FLINGO successfully incorporates ASP expressiveness within numerical constraints, demonstrated through examples and a formal translation.

Conclusion: FLINGO enhances CASP by preserving ASP-like features in constraint handling, improving usability and flexibility in real-world applications.

Abstract: Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP) is a hybrid paradigm that enriches Answer Set Programming (ASP) with numerical constraint processing, something required in many real-world applications. The usual specification of constraints in most CASP solvers is closer to the numerical back-end expressiveness and semantics, rather than to standard specification in ASP. In the latter, numerical attributes are represented with predicates and this allows declaring default values, leaving the attribute undefined, making non-deterministic assignments with choice rules or using aggregated values. In CASP, most (if not all) of these features are lost once we switch to a constraint-based representation of those same attributes. In this paper, we present the FLINGO language (and tool) that incorporates the aforementioned expressiveness inside the numerical constraints and we illustrate its use with several examples. Based on previous work that established its semantic foundations, we also present a translation from the newly introduced FLINGO syntax to regular CASP programs following the CLINGCON input format.

*Shiwei Lyu,Xidong Wang,Lei Liu,Hao Zhu,Chaohe Zhang,Jian Wang,Jinjie Gu,Benyou Wang,Yue Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A two-stage framework improves clinical alignment of LLMs by distilling physician-verified preferences into reusable principles, outperforming larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs' outputs with clinician preferences is challenging due to coarse objectives and unreliable automated judges lacking professional grounding.

Method: Proposes a two-stage approach: (1) HealthRubrics, a dataset of physician-verified preference examples, and (2) HealthPrinciples, distilled reusable clinical principles for scalable supervision.

Result: A 30B parameter model trained with this framework achieves 33.4% on HealthBench-Hard, outperforming larger models like Deepseek-R1 and o3.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a resource-efficient baseline for clinical alignment by leveraging physician-verified data and reusable principles.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate expert-level medical knowledge, aligning their open-ended outputs with fine-grained clinician preferences remains challenging. Existing methods often rely on coarse objectives or unreliable automated judges that are weakly grounded in professional guidelines. We propose a two-stage framework to address this gap. First, we introduce HealthRubrics, a dataset of 7,034 physician-verified preference examples in which clinicians refine LLM-drafted rubrics to meet rigorous medical standards. Second, we distill these rubrics into HealthPrinciples: 119 broadly reusable, clinically grounded principles organized by clinical dimensions, enabling scalable supervision beyond manual annotation. We use HealthPrinciples for (1) offline alignment by synthesizing rubrics for unlabeled queries and (2) an inference-time tool for guided self-revision. A 30B parameter model that activates only 3B parameters at inference trained with our framework achieves 33.4% on HealthBench-Hard, outperforming much larger models including Deepseek-R1 and o3, establishing a resource-efficient baseline for clinical alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GHS-TDA addresses Chain-of-Thought's sensitivity to early errors and lack of structured analysis by using a global hypothesis graph and topological data analysis for more reliable reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Chain-of-Thought methods are error-prone due to their autoregressive nature and lack of global coordination or redundancy filtering.

Method: Proposes GHS-TDA, which constructs a global hypothesis graph for coordination and uses topological data analysis to refine reasoning paths.

Result: GHS-TDA improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across benchmarks by leveraging diversity and topological stability.

Conclusion: GHS-TDA enhances reasoning reliability and interpretability by addressing key limitations of Chain-of-Thought methods.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been shown to significantly improve the reasoning accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. However, due to the autoregressive, step-by-step generation paradigm, existing CoT methods suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, the reasoning process is highly sensitive to early decisions: once an initial error is introduced, it tends to propagate and amplify through subsequent steps, while the lack of a global coordination and revision mechanism makes such errors difficult to correct, ultimately leading to distorted reasoning chains. Second, current CoT approaches lack structured analysis techniques for filtering redundant reasoning and extracting key reasoning features, resulting in unstable reasoning processes and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose GHS-TDA. GHS-TDA first constructs a semantically enriched global hypothesis graph to aggregate, align, and coordinate multiple candidate reasoning paths, thereby providing alternative global correction routes when local reasoning fails. It then applies topological data analysis based on persistent homology to capture stable multi-scale structures, remove redundancy and inconsistencies, and extract a more reliable reasoning skeleton. By jointly leveraging reasoning diversity and topological stability, GHS-TDA achieves self-adaptive convergence, produces high-confidence and interpretable reasoning paths, and consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both accuracy and robustness across multiple reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study compares LLM-derived willingness to pay (WTP) in travel assistance with human benchmarks, finding meaningful but biased WTP estimates, especially favoring expensive options. Conditioning on user preferences improves alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand LLM decision-making in subjective contexts like travel assistance, where no objectively correct answer exists, and compare it to human benchmarks.

Method: Present LLMs with choice dilemmas, analyze responses using multinomial logit models to derive WTP, and compare to human WTP benchmarks. Test under baseline and realistic conditions (e.g., user history, persona-based prompting).

Result: Larger LLMs produce meaningful WTP but show systematic deviations, overestimating human WTP, especially for costly options or business personas. Conditioning on cheaper preferences improves alignment.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential for subjective decision support but require careful model selection, prompt design, and user representation to mitigate biases.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in applications such as travel assistance and purchasing support, they are often required to make subjective choices on behalf of users in settings where no objectively correct answer exists. We study LLM decision-making in a travel-assistant context by presenting models with choice dilemmas and analyzing their responses using multinomial logit models to derive implied willingness to pay (WTP) estimates. These WTP values are subsequently compared to human benchmark values from the economics literature. In addition to a baseline setting, we examine how model behavior changes under more realistic conditions, including the provision of information about users' past choices and persona-based prompting. Our results show that while meaningful WTP values can be derived for larger LLMs, they also display systematic deviations at the attribute level. Additionally, they tend to overestimate human WTP overall, particularly when expensive options or business-oriented personas are introduced. Conditioning models on prior preferences for cheaper options yields valuations that are closer to human benchmarks. Overall, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of using LLMs for subjective decision support and underscore the importance of careful model selection, prompt design, and user representation when deploying such systems in practice.

*Dexun Li,Sidney Tio,Pradeep Varakantham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hierarchical MDP framework is introduced for Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), improving efficiency by reducing teacher-student interactions through synthetic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The impracticality of stochastic environment generation in resource-constrained scenarios drives the need for a more efficient UED approach.

Method: A hierarchical MDP framework with a teacher agent uses student policy representations and a generative model to create training environments and augment data.

Result: The method outperforms baselines with fewer teacher-student interactions, demonstrating efficiency in limited training scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for UED in resource-constrained settings, showcasing its potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) has emerged as a promising approach to developing general-purpose agents through automated curriculum generation. Popular UED methods focus on Open-Endedness, where teacher algorithms rely on stochastic processes for infinite generation of useful environments. This assumption becomes impractical in resource-constrained scenarios where teacher-student interaction opportunities are limited. To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for environment design. Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions. In experiments across several domains, we show that our method outperforms baseline approaches while requiring fewer teacher-student interactions in a single episode. The results suggest the applicability of our approach in settings where training opportunities are limited.

*Taeyoon Kim,Woohyeok Park,Hoyeong Yun,Kyungyong Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes failures in LLM-based RCA agents, identifying 12 pitfall types and showing that prompt engineering alone isn't sufficient for mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating RCA in cloud systems is crucial to prevent financial losses, but current LLM-based solutions have low accuracy.

Method: The study evaluates five LLM models using the OpenRCA benchmark, classifying failures into 12 types across reasoning, communication, and interaction.

Result: The most common pitfalls (e.g., hallucinated data interpretation) persist across all models, requiring architectural improvements rather than model upgrades.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for better agent design, with enriched communication protocols reducing failures by up to 15%.

Abstract: Failures in large-scale cloud systems incur substantial financial losses, making automated Root Cause Analysis (RCA) essential for operational stability. Recent efforts leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate this task, yet existing systems exhibit low detection accuracy even with capable models, and current evaluation frameworks assess only final answer correctness without revealing why the agent's reasoning failed. This paper presents a process level failure analysis of LLM-based RCA agents. We execute the full OpenRCA benchmark across five LLM models, producing 1,675 agent runs, and classify observed failures into 12 pitfall types across intra-agent reasoning, inter-agent communication, and agent-environment interaction. Our analysis reveals that the most prevalent pitfalls, notably hallucinated data interpretation and incomplete exploration, persist across all models regardless of capability tier, indicating that these failures originate from the shared agent architecture rather than from individual model limitations. Controlled mitigation experiments further show that prompt engineering alone cannot resolve the dominant pitfalls, whereas enriching the inter-agent communication protocol reduces communication-related failures by up to 15 percentage points. The pitfall taxonomy and diagnostic methodology developed in this work provide a foundation for designing more reliable autonomous agents for cloud RCA.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DRL improves clinical decision-making by analyzing reasoning discrepancies between agents and references, using graph-based diagnostics and retrieval-augmented generation to enhance accuracy and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure clinically valid reasoning alongside correct answers in clinical decision support systems.

Method: DRL extracts reasoning graphs, performs discrepancy analysis via GED, and uses LLM-as-a-judge to align nodes. Instructions from discrepancies are stored in DR-KB and retrieved via RAG to patch logic gaps.

Result: Improves accuracy and reasoning fidelity on medical QA benchmarks and an RVA prediction task. Ablations confirm gains from reference rationales and retrieval. Clinicians reviewed outputs positively.

Conclusion: DRL enhances reliable clinical decision-making in complex scenarios and offers practical deployment under token constraints.

Abstract: Clinical decision support requires not only correct answers but also clinically valid reasoning. We propose Differential Reasoning Learning (DRL), a framework that improves clinical agents by learning from reasoning discrepancies. From reference reasoning rationales (e.g., physician-authored clinical rationale, clinical guidelines, or outputs from more capable models) and the agent's free-form chain-of-thought (CoT), DRL extracts reasoning graphs as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and performs a clinically weighted graph edit distance (GED)-based discrepancy analysis. An LLM-as-a-judge aligns semantically equivalent nodes and diagnoses discrepancies between graphs. These graph-level discrepancy diagnostics are converted into natural-language instructions and stored in a Differential Reasoning Knowledge Base (DR-KB). At inference, we retrieve top-$k$ instructions via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to augment the agent prompt and patch likely logic gaps. Evaluation on open medical question answering (QA) benchmarks and a Return Visit Admissions (RVA) prediction task from internal clinical data demonstrates gains over baselines, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning fidelity. Ablation studies confirm gains from infusing reference reasoning rationales and the top-$k$ retrieval strategy. Clinicians' review of the output provides further assurance of the approach. Together, results suggest that DRL supports more reliable clinical decision-making in complex reasoning scenarios and offers a practical mechanism for deployment under limited token budgets.

TL;DR: ESTAR introduces early stopping to reduce redundant reasoning in large reasoning models, improving efficiency without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies in large reasoning models (LRMs) that continue generating redundant reasoning even after reaching correct answers.

Method: ESTAR combines a trajectory-based classifier, supervised fine-tuning for self-generated stop signals, and stop-aware reinforcement learning with compute-aware rewards.

Result: Experiments show ESTAR reduces reasoning length by 3.7x (from 4,799 to 1,290 tokens) while maintaining accuracy (~74.9%).

Conclusion: Early stopping is a simple and effective mechanism to enhance reasoning efficiency in LRMs, with strong cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance by generating long chains-of-thought, but often waste computation on redundant reasoning after the correct answer has already been reached. We introduce Early-Stopping for Token-Aware Reasoning (ESTAR), which detects and reduces such reasoning redundancy to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Our method combines (i) a trajectory-based classifier that identifies when reasoning can be safely stopped, (ii) supervised fine-tuning to teach LRMs to propose self-generated <stop> signals, and (iii) <stop>-aware reinforcement learning that truncates rollouts at self-generated stop points with compute-aware rewards. Experiments on four reasoning datasets show that ESTAR reduces reasoning length by about 3.7x (from 4,799 to 1,290) while preserving accuracy (74.9% vs. 74.2%), with strong cross-domain generalization. These results highlight early stopping as a simple yet powerful mechanism for improving reasoning efficiency in LRMs.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of using LMs for physics-based tasks by proposing a method to extract coarse-grained patterns from simulation logs, improving natural language reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents struggle with physics tasks due to LMs' lack of grounded simulation data. Existing methods scale poorly.

Method: A natural language-guided approach synthesizes programs to map simulation logs to high-level patterns.

Result: The method improves LM reasoning on physics benchmarks and generates effective reward programs from natural language goals.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances LM capabilities for physics-based reasoning and interaction.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) agents embedded in environments with physics-based interaction face many challenges including reasoning, planning, summarization, and question answering. This problem is exacerbated when a human user wishes to either guide or interact with the agent in natural language. Although the use of Language Models (LMs) is the default choice, as an AI tool, they struggle with tasks involving physics. The LM's capability for physical reasoning is learned from observational data, rather than being grounded in simulation. A common approach is to include simulation traces as context, but this suffers from poor scalability as simulation traces contain larger volumes of fine-grained numerical and semantic data. In this paper, we propose a natural language guided method to discover coarse-grained patterns (e.g., 'rigid-body collision', 'stable support', etc.) from detailed simulation logs. Specifically, we synthesize programs that operate on simulation logs and map them to a series of high level activated patterns. We show, through two physics benchmarks, that this annotated representation of the simulation log is more amenable to natural language reasoning about physical systems. We demonstrate how this method enables LMs to generate effective reward programs from goals specified in natural language, which may be used within the context of planning or supervised learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM reasoning methods use a fixed mindset, limiting intelligence. CoM addresses this by integrating diverse mindsets dynamically.

Method: CoM decomposes reasoning into Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic mindsets, with a Meta-Agent and Context Gate for dynamic selection.

Result: CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance (+4.7-5%) on six benchmarks, balancing efficiency.

Conclusion: CoM's adaptive mindset framework advances LLM reasoning, demonstrating superior accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Human problem-solving is never the repetition of a single mindset, by which we mean a distinct mode of cognitive processing. When tackling a specific task, we do not rely on a single mindset; instead, we integrate multiple mindsets within the single solution process. However, existing LLM reasoning methods fall into a common trap: they apply the same fixed mindset across all steps, overlooking that different stages of solving the same problem require fundamentally different mindsets. This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments across six challenging benchmarks spanning mathematics, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 4.96\% and 4.72\% in overall accuracy on Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-Flash, while balancing reasoning efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CODE-SHARP is a framework using Foundation Models to open-endedly expand skills via hierarchical reward functions, enabling agents to solve complex tasks without predefined rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitation of hand-designed reward functions in reinforcement learning for open-ended skill discovery.

Method: Leverage Foundation Models to create a hierarchical skill archive structured as executable reward functions in code.

Result: Agents trained with CODE-SHARP outperform pretrained agents and task-specific experts by 134% on average in solving long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: CODE-SHARP enables scalable and automated skill discovery, advancing open-ended learning in AI.

Abstract: Developing agents capable of open-endedly discovering and learning novel skills is a grand challenge in Artificial Intelligence. While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average. We will open-source our code and provide additional videos $\href{https://sites.google.com/view/code-sharp/homepage}{here}$.

*Zhaoyang Wang,Canwen Xu,Boyi Liu,Yite Wang,Siwei Han,Zhewei Yao,Huaxiu Yao,Yuxiong He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agent World Model (AWM), a synthetic environment generation pipeline to train LLM-based agents efficiently, enabling scalable and reliable multi-turn interactions with tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of diverse and reliable environments limits the scalability of training autonomous agents for complex tasks involving multi-turn interactions.

Method: AWM is proposed as a fully synthetic environment pipeline, generating 1,000 code-driven environments backed by databases, each offering rich toolsets and high-quality observations.

Result: Experiments show that training agents exclusively in synthetic environments provides strong out-of-distribution generalization on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: The synthetic environments produced by AWM facilitate scalable and reliable agent training, outperforming benchmark-specific environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) have empowered autonomous agents to perform complex tasks that require multi-turn interactions with tools and environments. However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions. Experiments on three benchmarks show that training exclusively in synthetic environments, rather than benchmark-specific ones, yields strong out-of-distribution generalization.

TL;DR: LingxiDiagBench is a benchmark evaluating LLMs for psychiatric diagnosis using 16K synthetic dialogues, revealing challenges in comorbidity recognition and dynamic consultation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the shortage of psychiatrists and subjectivity in mental-health assessments with AI-assisted diagnosis benchmarks.

Method: Large-scale multi-agent benchmark (LingxiDiagBench) with LingxiDiag-16K dataset for static and dynamic psychiatric evaluation in Chinese.

Result: LLMs show high accuracy in binary classification (92.3%) but struggle with comorbidity (43.0%) and 12-way diagnosis (28.5%). Dynamic consultation underperforms static evaluation.

Conclusion: Dynamic consultation quality doesn't guarantee diagnostic accuracy, highlighting limitations in LLM-assisted psychiatric diagnosis.

Abstract: Mental disorders are highly prevalent worldwide, but the shortage of psychiatrists and the inherent subjectivity of interview-based diagnosis create substantial barriers to timely and consistent mental-health assessment. Progress in AI-assisted psychiatric diagnosis is constrained by the absence of benchmarks that simultaneously provide realistic patient simulation, clinician-verified diagnostic labels, and support for dynamic multi-turn consultation. We present LingxiDiagBench, a large-scale multi-agent benchmark that evaluates LLMs on both static diagnostic inference and dynamic multi-turn psychiatric consultation in Chinese. At its core is LingxiDiag-16K, a dataset of 16,000 EMR-aligned synthetic consultation dialogues designed to reproduce real clinical demographic and diagnostic distributions across 12 ICD-10 psychiatric categories. Through extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, we establish key findings: (1) although LLMs achieve high accuracy on binary depression--anxiety classification (up to 92.3%), performance deteriorates substantially for depression--anxiety comorbidity recognition (43.0%) and 12-way differential diagnosis (28.5%); (2) dynamic consultation often underperforms static evaluation, indicating that ineffective information-gathering strategies significantly impair downstream diagnostic reasoning; (3) consultation quality assessed by LLM-as-a-Judge shows only moderate correlation with diagnostic accuracy, suggesting that well-structured questioning alone does not ensure correct diagnostic decisions. We release LingxiDiag-16K and the full evaluation framework to support reproducible research at https://github.com/Lingxi-mental-health/LingxiDiagBench.

TL;DR: The book provides a systematic treatment of fundamental principles in multi-agent system control, developed from teaching materials. It covers basic concepts, linear consensus algorithms, and various applications, with a step-by-step approach to facilitate understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of comprehensive textbooks on multi-agent system control, despite its growing importance in diverse applications, motivated the creation of this book.

Method: The material is organized into three parts: introduction to multiagent systems and graph theory, design and analysis of linear consensus algorithms, and selected applications. Each chapter includes notes, further reading, and exercises.

Result: The book offers a structured and accessible resource for understanding multi-agent system control, bridging the gap between basic concepts and research-level topics.

Conclusion: This book fills a critical gap in educational resources for multi-agent system control, providing a foundational and practical guide for students and researchers.

Abstract: Since the early 2000s, control of multiagent systems has attracted significant research interest, with applications ranging from natural collective behaviors and social dynamics to engineered systems such as autonomous vehicles, sensor networks, and smart grids. Although research on multi-agent systems has diversified into numerous specialized directions, textbooks -- including those in English -- that provide a systematic treatment of the fundamental principles of multi-agent system control remain scarce. The material presented in this book has been developed and used in teaching since 2021, initially as a concise Vietnamese-language reference for the courses Networked Control Systems and Control of Multi-Agent Systems at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. The book focuses on a selection of fundamental topics of broad and continuing interest in the field. The complexity of several topics is asymptotic to that encountered in research-level studies, however, the analysis is presented in a step-by-step manner to facilitate access to commonly used methods and tools.
  The material is divided into three main parts. Part I introduces multiagent systems and basic graph-theoretic concepts. Part II addresses the design and analysis of linear consensus algorithms. Part III covers selected applications and research directions, including formation control, network localization, distributed optimization, opinion dynamics, and matrix-weighted networks. Each chapter concludes with notes on notable researchers in this field, further reading, and exercises.
  This book cannot be completed without the encouragement, support and suggestions from families, colleagues and friends. The authors appreciate feedback from readers to further improve the content of the book.

### [289] [Tiny Moves: Game-based Hypothesis Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09801)

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces The Hypothesis Game, a symbolic formalism using LLM agents for incremental hypothesis refinement, showing better error removal and precision than baselines in scientific discovery tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific progress often involves small, localized revisions rather than extensive rewrites. Existing machine learning approaches obscure this incremental structure.

Method: A symbolic framework (The Hypothesis Game) with LLM agents refining hypotheses using a fixed grammar of reasoning moves, evaluated on mechanistic refinement tasks.

Result: The game-based approach removes more errors and achieves higher precision than baselines in corruption recovery tasks, and performs comparably in reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: Game-based reasoning offers controllable, interpretable, and transferable hypothesis refinement for scientific discovery.

Abstract: Most machine learning approaches to scientific discovery frame hypotheses as end-to-end predictions, obscuring the incremental structure of scientific reasoning. We propose The Hypothesis Game, a symbolic formalism for hypothesis refinement in which LLM agents operate on a shared hypothesis state using a fixed grammar of reasoning moves. The framework is motivated by the observation that scientific progress often proceeds through small, localized revisions, grounded in domain context, rather than extensive rewrites. We instantiate a minimal game with LLM agents and evaluate it on pathway-level mechanistic refinement tasks. In the primary setting of corruption recovery, where hypotheses contain controlled errors, the game-based approach consistently removes more errors and achieves higher precision than strong prompting baselines, while preserving valid structure through incremental edits. In a secondary reconstruction setting from partial cues, it performs comparably to the strongest baseline, indicating that explicit move-based refinement remains competitive even when ground-truth recovery is difficult. These findings support game-based reasoning as a principled route to more controllable, interpretable, and transferable hypothesis refinement systems for scientific discovery.
