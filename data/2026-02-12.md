*Leo Thomas Ramos,Angel D. Sappa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeCSAFNet introduces a multi-branch encoder-decoder architecture for land cover segmentation in multispectral imagery, outperforming existing models in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately segmenting land cover in multispectral imagery by leveraging both visible and non-visible spectral channels and enhancing feature fusion.

Method: Dual ConvNeXt encoders process visible and non-visible channels separately, followed by individual decoders and a fusion decoder with CBAM attention and ASAU activation for optimized feature integration.

Result: Significant performance gains on FBP and Potsdam datasets, with improvements over U-Net, SegFormer, and DeepLabV3+ variants by up to +19.62% in mIoU.

Conclusion: MeCSAFNet provides a robust and efficient solution for land cover segmentation, with compact variants suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: This work proposes MeCSAFNet, a multi-branch encoder-decoder architecture for land cover segmentation in multispectral imagery. The model separately processes visible and non-visible channels through dual ConvNeXt encoders, followed by individual decoders that reconstruct spatial information. A dedicated fusion decoder integrates intermediate features at multiple scales, combining fine spatial cues with high-level spectral representations. The feature fusion is further enhanced with CBAM attention, and the ASAU activation function contributes to stable and efficient optimization. The model is designed to process different spectral configurations, including a 4-channel (4c) input combining RGB and NIR bands, as well as a 6-channel (6c) input incorporating NDVI and NDWI indices. Experiments on the Five-Billion-Pixels (FBP) and Potsdam datasets demonstrate significant performance gains. On FBP, MeCSAFNet-base (6c) surpasses U-Net (4c) by +19.21%, U-Net (6c) by +14.72%, SegFormer (4c) by +19.62%, and SegFormer (6c) by +14.74% in mIoU. On Potsdam, MeCSAFNet-large (4c) improves over DeepLabV3+ (4c) by +6.48%, DeepLabV3+ (6c) by +5.85%, SegFormer (4c) by +9.11%, and SegFormer (6c) by +4.80% in mIoU. The model also achieves consistent gains over several recent state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, compact variants of MeCSAFNet deliver notable performance with lower training time and reduced inference cost, supporting their deployment in resource-constrained environments.

*Zhihang Yi,Jian Zhao,Jiancheng Lv,Tao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for chart understanding, covering challenges, tasks, datasets, methodologies, limitations, and future directions to advance the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the fragmented and unsystematic landscape of MLLM-based chart analysis, aiming to provide a structured roadmap for researchers and practitioners.

Method: The survey analyzes challenges in chart understanding, categorizes tasks and datasets, introduces a taxonomy, and traces methodological evolution from classic deep learning to MLLMs.

Result: It highlights current model limitations (e.g., perceptual and reasoning deficits) and identifies future directions like advanced alignment and reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The survey equips the community with a structured understanding of MLLMs in chart fusion, aiming to catalyze progress toward more robust systems.

Abstract: Chart understanding is a quintessential information fusion task, requiring the seamless integration of graphical and textual data to extract meaning. The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized this domain, yet the landscape of MLLM-based chart analysis remains fragmented and lacks systematic organization. This survey provides a comprehensive roadmap of this nascent frontier by structuring the domain's core components. We begin by analyzing the fundamental challenges of fusing visual and linguistic information in charts. We then categorize downstream tasks and datasets, introducing a novel taxonomy of canonical and non-canonical benchmarks to highlight the field's expanding scope. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive evolution of methodologies, tracing the progression from classic deep learning techniques to state-of-the-art MLLM paradigms that leverage sophisticated fusion strategies. By critically examining the limitations of current models, particularly their perceptual and reasoning deficits, we identify promising future directions, including advanced alignment techniques and reinforcement learning for cognitive enhancement. This survey aims to equip researchers and practitioners with a structured understanding of how MLLMs are transforming chart information fusion and to catalyze progress toward more robust and reliable systems.

### [3] [MPA: Multimodal Prototype Augmentation for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10143)
*Liwen Wu,Wei Wang,Lei Zhao,Zhan Gao,Qika Lin,Shaowen Yao,Zuozhu Liu,Bin Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MPA, a Multimodal Prototype Augmentation FSL framework, addressing limitations in few-shot learning by leveraging multimodal information through semantic enhancement, visual augmentation, and uncertainty modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot learning methods focus mainly on visual modality, lacking rich multimodal information. The paper aims to enhance FSL by incorporating diverse semantic cues and visual augmentations.

Method: MPA includes three components: LLM-based Multi-Variant Semantic Enhancement (LMSE) for paraphrased descriptions, Hierarchical Multi-View Augmentation (HMA) for visual diversity, and Adaptive Uncertain Class Absorber (AUCA) for uncertainty modeling.

Result: MPA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 12.29% and 24.56% improvements over the second-best method in single-domain and cross-domain settings, respectively, for 5-way 1-shot tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed MPA framework effectively integrates multimodal information and uncertainty modeling, significantly advancing few-shot learning performance.

Abstract: Recently, few-shot learning (FSL) has become a popular task that aims to recognize new classes from only a few labeled examples and has been widely applied in fields such as natural science, remote sensing, and medical images. However, most existing methods focus only on the visual modality and compute prototypes directly from raw support images, which lack comprehensive and rich multimodal information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Prototype Augmentation FSL framework called MPA, including LLM-based Multi-Variant Semantic Enhancement (LMSE), Hierarchical Multi-View Augmentation (HMA), and an Adaptive Uncertain Class Absorber (AUCA). LMSE leverages large language models to generate diverse paraphrased category descriptions, enriching the support set with additional semantic cues. HMA exploits both natural and multi-view augmentations to enhance feature diversity (e.g., changes in viewing distance, camera angles, and lighting conditions). AUCA models uncertainty by introducing uncertain classes via interpolation and Gaussian sampling, effectively absorbing uncertain samples. Extensive experiments on four single-domain and six cross-domain FSL benchmarks demonstrate that MPA achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods across most settings. Notably, MPA surpasses the second-best method by 12.29% and 24.56% in the single-domain and cross-domain setting, respectively, in the 5-way 1-shot setting.

### [4] [VERA: Identifying and Leveraging Visual Evidence Retrieval Heads in Long-Context Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10146)
*Rongcan Pei,Huan Li,Fang Guo,Qi Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to identify bottlenecks in long-context processing, introduces VER Heads for visual cue retrieval, and proposes VERA to improve performance without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with long-context and complex reasoning tasks. Understanding their internal mechanisms can reveal performance bottlenecks and lead to improvements.

Method: The study uses attention analysis to identify VER Heads, critical for visual cue retrieval, and proposes VERA, a training-free framework that leverages VER Heads to verbalize visual evidence.

Result: VERA improves long-context understanding, showing average relative improvements of 21.3% and 20.1% on benchmarks for Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct and GLM-4.1V-Thinking, respectively.

Conclusion: Targeting VER Heads and using VERA can significantly enhance VLM performance in long-context tasks without additional training.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in textual understanding, they face significant challenges when handling long context and complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we dissect the internal mechanisms governing long-context processing in VLMs to understand their performance bottlenecks. Through the lens of attention analysis, we identify specific Visual Evidence Retrieval (VER) Heads - a sparse, dynamic set of attention heads critical for locating visual cues during reasoning, distinct from static OCR heads. We demonstrate that these heads are causal to model performance; masking them leads to significant degradation. Leveraging this discovery, we propose VERA (Visual Evidence Retrieval Augmentation), a training-free framework that detects model uncertainty (i.e., entropy) to trigger the explicit verbalization of visual evidence attended by VER heads. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that VERA significantly improves long-context understanding of open-source VLMs: it yields an average relative improvement of 21.3% on Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct and 20.1% on GLM-4.1V-Thinking across five benchmarks.

### [5] [Beyond Closed-Pool Video Retrieval: A Benchmark and Agent Framework for Real-World Video Search and Moment Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10159)
*Tao Yu,Yujia Yang,Haopeng Jin,Junhao Gong,Xinlong Chen,Yuxuan Zhou,Shanbin Zhang,Jiabing Yang,Xinming Wang,Hongzhu Yi,Ping Nie,Kai Zou,Zhang Zhang,Yan Huang,Liang Wang,Yeshani,Ruiwen Tao,Jin Ma,Haijin Liang,Jinwen Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RVMS-Bench introduces a benchmark for evaluating video retrieval in real-world scenarios, using fuzzy, multi-dimensional memories and a hierarchical description framework. It includes diverse samples and proposes RACLO for simulating human cognitive processes. Existing models show limitations in handling such tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in traditional video retrieval benchmarks, which fail to reflect real-world fuzzy, multi-dimensional searches, RVMS-Bench aims to provide a more realistic evaluation framework.

Method: The benchmark includes 1,440 samples across 20 categories and four duration groups, sourced from real-world videos. It uses a hierarchical description framework (Global Impression, Key Moment, Temporal Context, Auditory Memory) and a human-in-the-loop verification protocol. RACLO, an agentic framework, is proposed to simulate human cognitive processes for fuzzy memory searches.

Result: Experiments show existing MLLMs struggle with real-world video retrieval and moment localization based on fuzzy memories.

Conclusion: RVMS-Bench advances video retrieval robustness for unstructured real-world scenarios, highlighting limitations in current models.

Abstract: Traditional video retrieval benchmarks focus on matching precise descriptions to closed video pools, failing to reflect real-world searches characterized by fuzzy, multi-dimensional memories on the open web. We present \textbf{RVMS-Bench}, a comprehensive system for evaluating real-world video memory search. It consists of \textbf{1,440 samples} spanning \textbf{20 diverse categories} and \textbf{four duration groups}, sourced from \textbf{real-world open-web videos}. RVMS-Bench utilizes a hierarchical description framework encompassing \textbf{Global Impression, Key Moment, Temporal Context, and Auditory Memory} to mimic realistic multi-dimensional search cues, with all samples strictly verified via a human-in-the-loop protocol. We further propose \textbf{RACLO}, an agentic framework that employs abductive reasoning to simulate the human ``Recall-Search-Verify'' cognitive process, effectively addressing the challenge of searching for videos via fuzzy memories in the real world. Experiments reveal that existing MLLMs still demonstrate insufficient capabilities in real-world Video Retrieval and Moment Localization based on fuzzy memories. We believe this work will facilitate the advancement of video retrieval robustness in real-world unstructured scenarios.

### [6] [AD$^2$: Analysis and Detection of Adversarial Threats in Visual Perception for End-to-End Autonomous Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10160)
*Ishan Sahu,Somnath Hazra,Somak Aditya,Soumyajit Dey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates adversarial robustness of autonomous driving agents, revealing severe vulnerabilities to black-box attacks and proposing a lightweight detection model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in autonomous driving, adversarial robustness is underexplored, raising safety concerns.

Method: Closed-loop evaluation in CARLA under three attack vectors (physics-based blur, electromagnetic interference, ghost objects) on Transfuser and Interfuser agents.

Result: Driving scores dropped by up to 99%, highlighting vulnerabilities. Proposed AD² detector outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: Adversarial attacks pose significant threats; the AD² model offers improved detection and efficiency.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems have achieved significant progress, yet their adversarial robustness remains largely underexplored. In this work, we conduct a closed-loop evaluation of state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents under black-box adversarial threat models in CARLA. Specifically, we consider three representative attack vectors on the visual perception pipeline: (i) a physics-based blur attack induced by acoustic waves, (ii) an electromagnetic interference attack that distorts captured images, and (iii) a digital attack that adds ghost objects as carefully crafted bounded perturbations on images. Our experiments on two advanced agents, Transfuser and Interfuser, reveal severe vulnerabilities to such attacks, with driving scores dropping by up to 99% in the worst case, raising valid safety concerns. To help mitigate such threats, we further propose a lightweight Attack Detection model for Autonomous Driving systems (AD$^2$) based on attention mechanisms that capture spatial-temporal consistency. Comprehensive experiments across multi-camera inputs on CARLA show that our detector achieves superior detection capability and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches.

### [7] [ArtisanGS: Interactive Tools for Gaussian Splat Selection with AI and Human in the Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10173)
*Clement Fuji Tsang,Anita Hu,Or Perel,Carsten Kolve,Maria Shugrina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interactive toolset for selecting and segmenting 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS), enabling user control over AI-driven modifications for editing unstructured 3DGS scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for extracting and editing objects in 3DGS scenes are limited, prompting the need for versatile, user-friendly tools.

Method: The authors propose AI-driven 2D-to-3D selection propagation, manual selection tools, and a custom Video Diffusion Model for local editing.

Result: The toolset outperforms state-of-the-art Gaussian Splat selection methods and enables flexible binary segmentation and editing without additional optimization.

Conclusion: The interactive suite provides practical control over 3DGS editing, addressing limitations in current techniques and enhancing usability for in-the-wild captures.

Abstract: Representation in the family of 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS) are growing into a viable alternative to traditional graphics for an expanding number of application, including recent techniques that facilitate physics simulation and animation. However, extracting usable objects from in-the-wild captures remains challenging and controllable editing techniques for this representation are limited. Unlike the bulk of emerging techniques, focused on automatic solutions or high-level editing, we introduce an interactive suite of tools centered around versatile Gaussian Splat selection and segmentation. We propose a fast AI-driven method to propagate user-guided 2D selection masks to 3DGS selections. This technique allows for user intervention in the case of errors and is further coupled with flexible manual selection and segmentation tools. These allow a user to achieve virtually any binary segmentation of an unstructured 3DGS scene. We evaluate our toolset against the state-of-the-art for Gaussian Splat selection and demonstrate their utility for downstream applications by developing a user-guided local editing approach, leveraging a custom Video Diffusion Model. With flexible selection tools, users have direct control over the areas that the AI can modify. Our selection and editing tools can be used for any in-the-wild capture without additional optimization.

### [8] [When the Prompt Becomes Visual: Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attacks for Large Image Editing Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10179)
*Jiacheng Hou,Yining Sun,Ruochong Jin,Haochen Han,Fangming Liu,Wai Kin Victor Chan,Alex Jinpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack (VJA), a visual-to-visual jailbreak attack, and IESBench, a benchmark for assessing safety risks in image editing models. It also proposes a training-free defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored safety risks in vision-prompt editing models, where malicious instructions can be conveyed through visual inputs.

Method: Proposes VJA, a visual-to-visual jailbreak attack, and IESBench for evaluation. Introduces a training-free defense using introspective multimodal reasoning.

Result: VJA achieves high attack success rates (80.9% on Nano Banana Pro, 70.1% on GPT-Image-1.5). The defense improves safety without auxiliary models or significant overhead.

Conclusion: The work highlights new vulnerabilities in image editing models, provides a benchmark, and offers a practical defense to enhance system safety.

Abstract: Recent advances in large image editing models have shifted the paradigm from text-driven instructions to vision-prompt editing, where user intent is inferred directly from visual inputs such as marks, arrows, and visual-text prompts. While this paradigm greatly expands usability, it also introduces a critical and underexplored safety risk: the attack surface itself becomes visual. In this work, we propose Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack (VJA), the first visual-to-visual jailbreak attack that conveys malicious instructions purely through visual inputs. To systematically study this emerging threat, we introduce IESBench, a safety-oriented benchmark for image editing models. Extensive experiments on IESBench demonstrate that VJA effectively compromises state-of-the-art commercial models, achieving attack success rates of up to 80.9% on Nano Banana Pro and 70.1% on GPT-Image-1.5. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a training-free defense based on introspective multimodal reasoning, which substantially improves the safety of poorly aligned models to a level comparable with commercial systems, without auxiliary guard models and with negligible computational overhead. Our findings expose new vulnerabilities, provide both a benchmark and practical defense to advance safe and trustworthy modern image editing systems. Warning: This paper contains offensive images created by large image editing models.

### [9] [DEGMC: Denoising Diffusion Models Based on Riemannian Equivariant Group Morphological Convolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10221)
*El Hadji S. Diop,Thierno Fall,Mohamed Daoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper enhances DDPMs by addressing geometric feature extraction and network equivariance using Euclidean group properties and PDE-based convolutions, achieving better results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve DDPMs by resolving limitations in geometric key feature extraction and network equivariance, leveraging Euclidean group properties for broader symmetry incorporation.

Method: Introduces group morphological convolutions in Riemannian manifolds derived from PDEs, adds a convection term, and solves via the method of characteristics to capture nonlinearities and thin structures.

Result: Experiments on MNIST, RotoMNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate significant improvements over baseline DDPM models.

Conclusion: The proposed geometric and equivariance enhancements effectively address DDPM limitations, yielding superior performance.

Abstract: In this work, we address two major issues in recent Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM): {\bf 1)} geometric key feature extraction and {\bf 2)} network equivariance. Since the DDPM prediction network relies on the U-net architecture, which is theoretically only translation equivariant, we introduce a geometric approach combined with an equivariance property of the more general Euclidean group, which includes rotations, reflections, and permutations. We introduce the notion of group morphological convolutions in Riemannian manifolds, which are derived from the viscosity solutions of first-order Hamilton-Jacobi-type partial differential equations (PDEs) that act as morphological multiscale dilations and erosions. We add a convection term to the model and solve it using the method of characteristics. This helps us better capture nonlinearities, represent thin geometric structures, and incorporate symmetries into the learning process. Experimental results on the MNIST, RotoMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets show noticeable improvements compared to the baseline DDPM model.

### [10] [XSPLAIN: XAI-enabling Splat-based Prototype Learning for Attribute-aware INterpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10239)
*Dominik Galus,Julia Farganus,Tymoteusz Zapala,Mikołaj Czachorowski,Piotr Borycki,Przemysław Spurek,Piotr Syga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XSPLAIN introduces an interpretability framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) classification, using voxel-aggregated PointNet and invertible transformations, maintaining accuracy while providing intuitive explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explainability methods for 3D representations like point clouds fail to address the volumetric coherence of Gaussian primitives in 3DGS.

Method: Leverages a voxel-aggregated PointNet backbone and invertible orthogonal transformations to disentangle features without altering decision boundaries.

Result: Participants preferred XSPLAIN explanations 48.4% of the time, significantly outperforming baselines (p<0.001), with no performance degradation.

Conclusion: XSPLAIN successfully enhances transparency and user trust in 3DGS classification models.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly become a standard for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction, yet its adoption in multiple critical domains is hindered by the lack of interpretability of the generation models as well as classification of the Splats. While explainability methods exist for other 3D representations, like point clouds, they typically rely on ambiguous saliency maps that fail to capture the volumetric coherence of Gaussian primitives. We introduce XSPLAIN, the first ante-hoc, prototype-based interpretability framework designed specifically for 3DGS classification. Our approach leverages a voxel-aggregated PointNet backbone and a novel, invertible orthogonal transformation that disentangles feature channels for interpretability while strictly preserving the original decision boundaries. Explanations are grounded in representative training examples, enabling intuitive ``this looks like that'' reasoning without any degradation in classification performance. A rigorous user study (N=51) demonstrates a decisive preference for our approach: participants selected XSPLAIN explanations 48.4\% of the time as the best, significantly outperforming baselines $(p<0.001)$, showing that XSPLAIN provides transparency and user trust.

*Qingwu Liu,Nicolas Saunier,Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset called PMMA for detecting pedestrians using mobility aids was introduced. Seven detection models and three tracking algorithms were tested, with YOLOX, Deformable DETR, and Faster R-CNN performing best. The dataset and code are publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of datasets focusing on pedestrians using mobility aids, which is crucial for improving assistive technologies and accessibility.

Method: The PMMA dataset was collected outdoors with volunteers using wheelchairs, canes, and walkers, categorized into nine types. Seven object detection models and three tracking algorithms were implemented and tested under MMDetection.

Result: YOLOX, Deformable DETR, and Faster R-CNN had the best detection performance, while trackers showed minimal differences in performance.

Conclusion: The PMMA dataset fills a gap in pedestrian detection datasets and demonstrates effective detection models for mobility aid users.

Abstract: This study introduces a new object detection dataset of pedestrians using mobility aids, named PMMA. The dataset was collected in an outdoor environment, where volunteers used wheelchairs, canes, and walkers, resulting in nine categories of pedestrians: pedestrians, cane users, two types of walker users, whether walking or resting, five types of wheelchair users, including wheelchair users, people pushing empty wheelchairs, and three types of users pushing occupied wheelchairs, including the entire pushing group, the pusher and the person seated on the wheelchair. To establish a benchmark, seven object detection models (Faster R-CNN, CenterNet, YOLOX, DETR, Deformable DETR, DINO, and RT-DETR) and three tracking algorithms (ByteTrack, BOT-SORT, and OC-SORT) were implemented under the MMDetection framework. Experimental results show that YOLOX, Deformable DETR, and Faster R-CNN achieve the best detection performance, while the differences among the three trackers are relatively small. The PMMA dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5683/SP3/XJPQUG, and the video processing and model training code is available at https://github.com/DatasetPMMA/PMMA.

### [12] [Colorimeter-Supervised Skin Tone Estimation from Dermatoscopic Images for Fairness Auditing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10265)
*Marin Benčević,Krešimir Romić,Ivana Hartmann Tolić,Irena Galić*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neural networks predict Fitzpatrick skin type and ITA for fairness auditing in dermatoscopy, validated against real measurements, revealing underrepresentation of darker skin tones in datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance disparities across skin tones in neural-network-based dermatoscopy by developing reliable skin-tone annotation tools for bias auditing.

Method: Developed neural networks for ordinal regression (Fitzpatrick skin type) and color regression (ITA), validated with in-person labels and colorimeter measurements. Utilized extensive pretraining on synthetic and real images.

Result: High agreement with human annotations and colorimeter measurements, outperforming pixel-averaging. Found <1% representation of Fitzpatrick types V-VI in datasets.

Conclusion: Released open-source tools for skin-tone annotation and bias auditing, highlighting underrepresentation and performance gaps in darker skin tones.

Abstract: Neural-network-based diagnosis from dermatoscopic images is increasingly used for clinical decision support, yet studies report performance disparities across skin tones. Fairness auditing of these models is limited by the lack of reliable skin-tone annotations in public dermatoscopy datasets. We address this gap with neural networks that predict Fitzpatrick skin type via ordinal regression and the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) via color regression, using in-person Fitzpatrick labels and colorimeter measurements as targets. We further leverage extensive pretraining on synthetic and real dermatoscopic and clinical images. The Fitzpatrick model achieves agreement comparable to human crowdsourced annotations, and ITA predictions show high concordance with colorimeter-derived ITA, substantially outperforming pixel-averaging approaches. Applying these estimators to ISIC 2020 and MILK10k, we find that fewer than 1% of subjects belong to Fitzpatrick types V and VI. We release code and pretrained models as an open-source tool for rapid skin-tone annotation and bias auditing. This is, to our knowledge, the first dermatoscopic skin-tone estimation neural network validated against colorimeter measurements, and it supports growing evidence of clinically relevant performance gaps across skin-tone groups.

### [13] [ERGO: Excess-Risk-Guided Optimization for High-Fidelity Monocular 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10278)
*Zehua Ma,Hanhui Li,Zhenyu Xie,Xiaonan Luo,Michael Kampffmeyer,Feng Gao,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERGO is an adaptive optimization framework for 3D Gaussian splatting that dynamically adjusts loss weights to handle inconsistencies in synthesized views, improving 3D reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address geometric and textural inconsistencies in synthesized auxiliary views used for 3D reconstruction from single images.

Method: ERGO decomposes optimization losses into excess risk and Bayes error, dynamically adjusting weights. It also introduces geometry-aware and texture-aware objectives.

Result: ERGO outperforms state-of-the-art methods on datasets like Google Scanned Objects and OmniObject3D, enhancing geometric and textural fidelity.

Conclusion: ERGO effectively mitigates supervision noise and improves 3D reconstruction quality by adaptively optimizing loss weights.

Abstract: Generating 3D content from a single image remains a fundamentally challenging and ill-posed problem due to the inherent absence of geometric and textural information in occluded regions. While state-of-the-art generative models can synthesize auxiliary views to provide additional supervision, these views inevitably contain geometric inconsistencies and textural misalignments that propagate and amplify artifacts during 3D reconstruction. To effectively harness these imperfect supervisory signals, we propose an adaptive optimization framework guided by excess risk decomposition, termed ERGO. Specifically, ERGO decomposes the optimization losses in 3D Gaussian splatting into two components, i.e., excess risk that quantifies the suboptimality gap between current and optimal parameters, and Bayes error that models the irreducible noise inherent in synthesized views. This decomposition enables ERGO to dynamically estimate the view-specific excess risk and adaptively adjust loss weights during optimization. Furthermore, we introduce geometry-aware and texture-aware objectives that complement the excess-risk-derived weighting mechanism, establishing a synergistic global-local optimization paradigm. Consequently, ERGO demonstrates robustness against supervision noise while consistently enhancing both geometric fidelity and textural quality of the reconstructed 3D content. Extensive experiments on the Google Scanned Objects dataset and the OmniObject3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of ERGO over existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [14] [A Low-Rank Defense Method for Adversarial Attack on Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10319)
*Jiaxuan Zhu,Siyu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoRD, a defensive strategy for Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) against adversarial attacks, using low-rank adaptation modules and a balance parameter to ensure high-quality image generation post-attack.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counter the rapid development of adversarial attacks on diffusion models and ensure their practical usability, effective defense mechanisms are needed.

Method: LoRD integrates merging ideas and a balance parameter with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules to detect and defend adversarial samples, forming a defense pipeline for LDMs.

Result: Extensive experiments on facial and landscape images show LoRD outperforms baseline methods in defending against adversarial attacks while maintaining image quality.

Conclusion: LoRD is an effective defense strategy for LDMs, ensuring robustness against adversarial attacks without compromising image generation quality.

Abstract: Recently, adversarial attacks for diffusion models as well as their fine-tuning process have been developed rapidly. To prevent the abuse of these attack algorithms from affecting the practical application of diffusion models, it is critical to develop corresponding defensive strategies. In this work, we propose an efficient defensive strategy, named Low-Rank Defense (LoRD), to defend the adversarial attack on Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). LoRD introduces the merging idea and a balance parameter, combined with the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules, to detect and defend the adversarial samples. Based on LoRD, we build up a defense pipeline that applies the learned LoRD modules to help diffusion models defend against attack algorithms. Our method ensures that the LDM fine-tuned on both adversarial and clean samples can still generate high-quality images. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on facial and landscape images, and our method shows significantly better defense performance compared to the baseline methods.

### [15] [Flow Matching with Uncertainty Quantification and Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10326)
*Juyeop Han,Lukas Lao Beyer,Sertac Karaman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UA-Flow extends flow matching by predicting velocity field with heteroscedastic uncertainty to improve sample quality and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sampling-based generative models produce inconsistent or degraded samples; UA-Flow aims to assess reliability and enhance quality.

Method: UA-Flow predicts velocity field with uncertainty, propagates velocity uncertainty through flow dynamics, and uses uncertainty for guidance.

Result: UA-Flow's uncertainty signals correlate better with sample fidelity, and uncertainty-guided sampling enhances generation quality.

Conclusion: UA-Flow effectively improves sample reliability and quality through uncertainty-aware modeling and guidance.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of sampling-based generative models such as flow matching, they can still produce samples of inconsistent or degraded quality. To assess sample reliability and generate higher-quality outputs, we propose uncertainty-aware flow matching (UA-Flow), a lightweight extension of flow matching that predicts the velocity field together with heteroscedastic uncertainty. UA-Flow estimates per-sample uncertainty by propagating velocity uncertainty through the flow dynamics. These uncertainty estimates act as a reliability signal for individual samples, and we further use them to steer generation via uncertainty-aware classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance. Experiments on image generation show that UA-Flow produces uncertainty signals more highly correlated with sample fidelity than baseline methods, and that uncertainty-guided sampling further improves generation quality.

*Rafael-Petruţ Gardoş*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores uncertainty-aware deepfake detection in political contexts, comparing various methods to improve reliability and calibration of predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of realistic political deepfakes threatens information integrity and public trust, highlighting the need for more reliable, uncertainty-aware detection systems.

Method: The study uses stochastic convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B4) fine-tuned on a politically focused dataset, evaluating uncertainty through calibration, scoring rules, and prediction errors.

Result: Calibrated probabilistic outputs and uncertainty estimates improve risk-aware moderation, with performance assessed via ROC-AUC, confusion matrices, and out-of-distribution tests.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware detection offers operational benefits in political settings, though limitations exist, clarifying when uncertainty adds value beyond confidence predictions.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative image models have enabled the creation of highly realistic political deepfakes, posing risks to information integrity, public trust, and democratic processes. While automated deepfake detectors are increasingly deployed in moderation and investigative pipelines, most existing systems provide only point predictions and fail to indicate when outputs are unreliable, being an operationally critical limitation in high-stakes political contexts. This work investigates conditional, uncertainty-aware political deepfake detection using stochastic convolutional neural networks within an empirical, decision-oriented reliability framework. Rather than treating uncertainty as a purely Bayesian construct, it is evaluated through observable criteria, including calibration quality, proper scoring rules, and its alignment with prediction errors under both global and confidence-conditioned analyses. A politically focused binary image dataset is constructed via deterministic metadata filtering from a large public real-synthetic corpus. Two pretrained CNN backbones (ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B4) are fully fine-tuned for classification. Deterministic inference is compared with single-pass stochastic prediction, Monte Carlo dropout with multiple forward passes, temperature scaling, and ensemble-based uncertainty surrogates. Evaluation reports ROC-AUC, thresholded confusion matrices, calibration metrics, and generator-disjoint out-of-distribution performance. Results demonstrate that calibrated probabilistic outputs and uncertainty estimates enable risk-aware moderation policies. A systematic confidence-band analysis further clarifies when uncertainty provides operational value beyond predicted confidence, delineating both the benefits and limitations of uncertainty-aware deepfake detection in political settings.

*Xi Chen,Arian Maleki,Shirin Jalali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable MLE optimization method for coherent imaging, PGD-MC, avoids high-dimensional matrix inversion and improves reconstruction quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost of MLE hinders accurate aperture modeling in coherent imaging; a scalable solution is needed.

Method: Proposes PGD-MC, using randomized linear algebra and conjugate gradient for likelihood gradient evaluation without matrix inversion.

Result: PGD-MC outperforms prior methods in accuracy and speed, supporting diverse aperture models and scaling to high resolutions.

Conclusion: PGD-MC offers a flexible, effective MLE-based framework for digital holography, enhancing reconstruction quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In coherent imaging, speckle is statistically modeled as multiplicative noise, posing a fundamental challenge for image reconstruction. While maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) provides a principled framework for speckle mitigation, its application to coherent imaging system such as digital holography with finite apertures is hindered by the prohibitive cost of high-dimensional matrix inversion, especially at high resolutions. This computational burden has prevented the use of MLE-based reconstruction with physically accurate aperture modeling. In this work, we propose a randomized linear algebra approach that enables scalable MLE optimization without explicit matrix inversions in gradient computation. By exploiting the structural properties of sensing matrix and using conjugate gradient for likelihood gradient evaluation, the proposed algorithm supports accurate aperture modeling without the simplifying assumptions commonly imposed for tractability. We term the resulting method projected gradient descent with Monte Carlo estimation (PGD-MC). The proposed PGD-MC framework (i) demonstrates robustness to diverse and physically accurate aperture models, (ii) achieves substantial improvements in reconstruction quality and computational efficiency, and (iii) scales effectively to high-resolution digital holography. Extensive experiments incorporating three representative denoisers as regularization show that PGD-MC provides a flexible and effective MLE-based reconstruction framework for digital holography with finite apertures, consistently outperforming prior Plug-and-Play model-based iterative reconstruction methods in both accuracy and speed.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Comp2Comp, an open-source package with FDA-cleared deep learning pipelines (AAQ and BMD) for opportunistic analysis of CT scans. AAQ measures aortic aneurysm size, while BMD estimates osteoporosis risk. Both validated externally, showing clinical-grade accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of validated, transparent AI solutions for extracting imaging biomarkers from radiologic data without additional costs or patient exposure.

Method: Developed and validated two open-source, FDA-cleared deep learning pipelines (AAQ and BMD) within Comp2Comp, tested on external patient scans.

Result: AAQ had a mean absolute error of 1.57 mm; BMD showed 81.0% sensitivity and 78.4% specificity, meeting clinical standards.

Conclusion: Comp2Comp provides transparent, validated tools for imaging biomarker extraction, enabling pre-clinical testing and research use.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence allows automatic extraction of imaging biomarkers from already-acquired radiologic images. This paradigm of opportunistic imaging adds value to medical imaging without additional imaging costs or patient radiation exposure. However, many open-source image analysis solutions lack rigorous validation while commercial solutions lack transparency, leading to unexpected failures when deployed. Here, we report development and validation for two of the first fully open-sourced, FDA-510(k)-cleared deep learning pipelines to mitigate both challenges: Abdominal Aortic Quantification (AAQ) and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) estimation are both offered within the Comp2Comp package for opportunistic analysis of computed tomography scans. AAQ segments the abdominal aorta to assess aneurysm size; BMD segments vertebral bodies to estimate trabecular bone density and osteoporosis risk. AAQ-derived maximal aortic diameters were compared against radiologist ground-truth measurements on 258 patient scans enriched for abdominal aortic aneurysms from four external institutions. BMD binary classifications (low vs. normal bone density) were compared against concurrent DXA scan ground truths obtained on 371 patient scans from four external institutions. AAQ had an overall mean absolute error of 1.57 mm (95% CI 1.38-1.80 mm). BMD had a sensitivity of 81.0% (95% CI 74.0-86.8%) and specificity of 78.4% (95% CI 72.3-83.7%). Comp2Comp AAQ and BMD demonstrated sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Open-sourcing these algorithms improves transparency of typically opaque FDA clearance processes, allows hospitals to test the algorithms before cumbersome clinical pilots, and provides researchers with best-in-class methods.

*Yilin Yang,Zhenghui Guo,Yuke Wang,Omprakash Gnawali,Sheng Di,Chengming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to mitigate hallucinations in VLMs caused by language bias by synthesizing Hallucination-Inducing Images (HIIs) and proposing a fine-grained alignment approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the overlooked issue of language bias-driven hallucinations in VLMs and develop a solution to identify and mitigate them.

Method: Design a pipeline to synthesize HIIs, reveal scene-conditioned hallucination patterns, create the MOH benchmark, and use HIIs for fine-grained alignment.

Result: Achieves a 38% improvement over state-of-the-art on hallucination benchmarks while maintaining model capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively reduces hallucinations in VLMs by leveraging synthesized data and targeted alignment.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse multimodal tasks but remain vulnerable to hallucinations rooted in inherent language bias. Despite recent progress, existing hallucination mitigation methods often overlook the underlying hallucination patterns driven by language bias. In this work, we design a novel pipeline to accurately synthesize Hallucination-Inducing Images (HIIs). Using synthesized HIIs, we reveal a consistent scene-conditioned hallucination pattern: models tend to mention objects that are highly typical of the scene even when visual evidence is removed. To quantify the susceptibility of VLMs to this hallucination pattern, we establish the Masked-Object-Hallucination (MOH) benchmark to rigorously evaluate existing state-of-the-art alignment frameworks. Finally, we leverage HIIs to construct high-quality preference datasets for fine-grained alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates hallucinations while preserving general model capabilities. Specifically, our method achieves up to a 38% improvement over the current state-of-the-art on standard hallucination benchmarks.

TL;DR: ChangeTitans is a Titans-based framework for remote sensing change detection, addressing long-range dependency and computational efficiency challenges with VTitans, hierarchical VTitans-Adapter, and TS-CBAM. It achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for remote sensing change detection struggle with long-range dependencies and computational efficiency, despite the potential of Transformers.

Method: Proposes VTitans (Titans-based vision backbone with neural memory and segmented local attention), hierarchical VTitans-Adapter, and TS-CBAM (two-stream fusion module).

Result: Achieves 84.36% IoU and 91.52% F1-score on LEVIR-CD, outperforming benchmarks while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: ChangeTitans successfully combines long-range dependency modeling with computational efficiency, setting a new standard for remote sensing change detection.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and related applications. However, current methods often struggle to capture long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. Although Transformers can effectively model global context, their quadratic complexity poses scalability challenges, and existing linear attention approaches frequently fail to capture intricate spatiotemporal relationships. Drawing inspiration from the recent success of Titans in language tasks, we present ChangeTitans, the Titans-based framework for remote sensing change detection. Specifically, we propose VTitans, the first Titans-based vision backbone that integrates neural memory with segmented local attention, thereby capturing long-range dependencies while mitigating computational overhead. Next, we present a hierarchical VTitans-Adapter to refine multi-scale features across different network layers. Finally, we introduce TS-CBAM, a two-stream fusion module leveraging cross-temporal attention to suppress pseudo-changes and enhance detection accuracy. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, LEVIR-CD+, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate that ChangeTitans achieves state-of-the-art results, attaining \textbf{84.36\%} IoU and \textbf{91.52\%} F1-score on LEVIR-CD, while remaining computationally competitive.

*Siddhant Katyan,Marc-André Gardner,Jean-François Lalonde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed adaptive LiDAR sensing dynamically adjusts sensor parameters, jointly optimizing acquisition and registration for better accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LiDAR registration operates on fixed configurations, leading to suboptimal data collection and computational inefficiency.

Method: An adaptive LiDAR sensing framework integrates registration feedback to dynamically adjust sensor parameters, balancing point density, noise, and sparsity.

Result: Evaluations in CARLA simulation show improved registration accuracy and efficiency over fixed-parameter baselines.

Conclusion: Adaptive LiDAR sensing enhances autonomous perception and robotic applications by optimizing both data collection and registration.

Abstract: LiDAR sensors are a key modality for 3D perception, yet they are typically designed independently of downstream tasks such as point cloud registration. Conventional registration operates on pre-acquired datasets with fixed LiDAR configurations, leading to suboptimal data collection and significant computational overhead for sampling, noise filtering, and parameter tuning. In this work, we propose an adaptive LiDAR sensing framework that dynamically adjusts sensor parameters, jointly optimizing LiDAR acquisition and registration hyperparameters. By integrating registration feedback into the sensing loop, our approach optimally balances point density, noise, and sparsity, improving registration accuracy and efficiency. Evaluations in the CARLA simulation demonstrate that our method outperforms fixed-parameter baselines while retaining generalization abilities, highlighting the potential of adaptive LiDAR for autonomous perception and robotic applications.

### [22] [Characterizing and Optimizing the Spatial Kernel of Multi Resolution Hash Encodings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10495)
*Tianxiang Dai,Jonathan Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Multi-Resolution Hash Encoding (MHE) using an analytical approach based on its Point Spread Function (PSF), revealing grid-induced anisotropy and a logarithmic spatial profile. It introduces Rotated MHE (R-MHE) to mitigate anisotropy while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spatial behavior of MHE lacks rigorous understanding, leading to heuristic hyperparameter selection.

Method: The paper characterizes MHE by examining its PSF, deriving a closed-form approximation for the collision-free PSF, and analyzing the impact of finite hash capacity. It proposes R-MHE to address anisotropy.

Result: The effective resolution is governed by the broadened FWHM (determined by average resolution), not the finest resolution. Collisions degrade SNR. R-MHE mitigates anisotropy efficiently.

Conclusion: This study provides a methodology based on physical principles to characterize and optimize MHE, moving beyond heuristics.

Abstract: Multi-Resolution Hash Encoding (MHE), the foundational technique behind Instant Neural Graphics Primitives, provides a powerful parameterization for neural fields. However, its spatial behavior lacks rigorous understanding from a physical systems perspective, leading to reliance on heuristics for hyperparameter selection. This work introduces a novel analytical approach that characterizes MHE by examining its Point Spread Function (PSF), which is analogous to the Green's function of the system. This methodology enables a quantification of the encoding's spatial resolution and fidelity. We derive a closed-form approximation for the collision-free PSF, uncovering inherent grid-induced anisotropy and a logarithmic spatial profile. We establish that the idealized spatial bandwidth, specifically the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), is determined by the average resolution, $N_{\text{avg}}$. This leads to a counterintuitive finding: the effective resolution of the model is governed by the broadened empirical FWHM (and therefore $N_{\text{avg}}$), rather than the finest resolution $N_{\max}$, a broadening effect we demonstrate arises from optimization dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of finite hash capacity, demonstrating how collisions introduce speckle noise and degrade the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose Rotated MHE (R-MHE), an architecture that applies distinct rotations to the input coordinates at each resolution level. R-MHE mitigates anisotropy while maintaining the efficiency and parameter count of the original MHE. This study establishes a methodology based on physical principles that moves beyond heuristics to characterize and optimize MHE.

TL;DR: Med-SegLens is a model-diffing framework that decomposes segmentation model activations into interpretable latent features, enabling diagnosis of failures and mitigation of dataset shift without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern segmentation models are opaque, limiting failure diagnosis, understanding of dataset shift, and principled interventions.

Method: Uses sparse autoencoders on SegFormer and U-Net activations, identifies shared and population-specific latents, and applies targeted latent-level interventions.

Result: Latents act as causal bottlenecks; interventions correct errors, improve cross-dataset adaptation (70% failure recovery, Dice score from 39.4% to 74.2%).

Conclusion: Latent-level model diffing is practical for diagnosing failures and mitigating dataset shift in segmentation models.

Abstract: Modern segmentation models achieve strong predictive performance but remain largely opaque, limiting our ability to diagnose failures, understand dataset shift, or intervene in a principled manner. We introduce Med-SegLens, a model-diffing framework that decomposes segmentation model activations into interpretable latent features using sparse autoencoders trained on SegFormer and U-Net. Through cross-architecture and cross-dataset latent alignment across healthy, adult, pediatric, and sub-Saharan African glioma cohorts, we identify a stable backbone of shared representations, while dataset shift is driven by differential reliance on population-specific latents. We show that these latents act as causal bottlenecks for segmentation failures, and that targeted latent-level interventions can correct errors and improve cross-dataset adaption without retraining, recovering performance in 70% of failure cases and improving Dice score from 39.4% to 74.2%. Our results demonstrate that latent-level model diffing provides a practical and mechanistic tool for diagnosing failures and mitigating dataset shift in segmentation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoLin, a novel adapter with Complex Linear Projection Optimization, enhances efficiency in vision foundation model adaptation by introducing only 1% additional parameters, outperforming full fine-tuning and delta-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional full fine-tuning for vision foundation models is costly and inefficient. Delta-tuning, though effective for LLMs, doesn't translate well to vision tasks, prompting the need for a more efficient adaptation method.

Method: CoLin introduces a low-rank complex adapter with 1% additional parameters, addressing convergence issues with a tailored loss, and optimizes via Complex Linear Projection.

Result: CoLin surpasses full fine-tuning and classical delta-tuning in tasks like object detection, segmentation, image classification, and rotated object detection, using only 1% of parameters.

Conclusion: CoLin provides a highly efficient and novel solution for deploying vision foundation models, with significant performance improvements and minimal parameter overhead.

Abstract: Deploying vision foundation models typically relies on efficient adaptation strategies, whereas conventional full fine-tuning suffers from prohibitive costs and low efficiency. While delta-tuning has proven effective in boosting the performance and efficiency of LLMs during adaptation, its advantages cannot be directly transferred to the fine-tuning pipeline of vision foundation models. To push the boundaries of adaptation efficiency for vision tasks, we propose an adapter with Complex Linear Projection Optimization (CoLin). For architecture, we design a novel low-rank complex adapter that introduces only about 1% parameters to the backbone. For efficiency, we theoretically prove that low-rank composite matrices suffer from severe convergence issues during training, and address this challenge with a tailored loss. Extensive experiments on object detection, segmentation, image classification, and rotated object detection (remote sensing scenario) demonstrate that CoLin outperforms both full fine-tuning and classical delta-tuning approaches with merely 1% parameters for the first time, providing a novel and efficient solution for deployment of vision foundation models. We release the code on https://github.com/DongshuoYin/CoLin.

TL;DR: 3DXTalker is a novel framework addressing expressivity challenges in 3D talking avatars through data-driven identity modeling, enriched audio representations, and spatial dynamics control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance expressivity in audio-driven 3D talking avatars by overcoming challenges like limited training data, narrow audio cues, and lack of controllability.

Method: It employs a data curation pipeline for scalable identity modeling, integrates amplitude and emotional cues for lip sync and expression, and uses a flow-matching-based transformer for coherent dynamics. It also supports stylized control via prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm 3DXTalker's superior performance in unifying lip sync, emotion, and head-pose dynamics.

Conclusion: 3DXTalker successfully integrates multiple expressivity components into a unified framework, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Audio-driven 3D talking avatar generation is increasingly important in virtual communication, digital humans, and interactive media, where avatars must preserve identity, synchronize lip motion with speech, express emotion, and exhibit lifelike spatial dynamics, collectively defining a broader objective of expressivity. However, achieving this remains challenging due to insufficient training data with limited subject identities, narrow audio representations, and restricted explicit controllability. In this paper, we propose 3DXTalker, an expressive 3D talking avatar through data-curated identity modeling, audio-rich representations, and spatial dynamics controllability. 3DXTalker enables scalable identity modeling via 2D-to-3D data curation pipeline and disentangled representations, alleviating data scarcity and improving identity generalization. Then, we introduce frame-wise amplitude and emotional cues beyond standard speech embeddings, ensuring superior lip synchronization and nuanced expression modulation. These cues are unified by a flow-matching-based transformer for coherent facial dynamics. Moreover, 3DXTalker also enables natural head-pose motion generation while supporting stylized control via prompt-based conditioning. Extensive experiments show that 3DXTalker integrates lip synchronization, emotional expression, and head-pose dynamics within a unified framework, achieves superior performance in 3D talking avatar generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The abstract introduces MapVerse, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multimodal reasoning on real-world maps, highlighting gaps in current VLM capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for evaluating VLMs on map-based reasoning are narrow and rely on artificial content, lacking depth for genuine geospatial reasoning.

Method: MapVerse is introduced, featuring 11,837 human-authored QA pairs across 1,025 maps in ten categories, evaluating map reading and multimodal reasoning.

Result: Evaluation of ten state-of-the-art models shows VLMs perform well on classification tasks but struggle with complex spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: While VLMs excel in simpler tasks, they lack advanced reasoning skills, underscoring the need for improved benchmarks like MapVerse.

Abstract: Maps are powerful carriers of structured and contextual knowledge, encompassing geography, demographics, infrastructure, and environmental patterns. Reasoning over such knowledge requires models to integrate spatial relationships, visual cues, real-world context, and domain-specific expertise-capabilities that current large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle to exhibit consistently. Yet, datasets used to benchmark VLMs on map-based reasoning remain narrow in scope, restricted to specific domains, and heavily reliant on artificially generated content (outputs from LLMs or pipeline-based methods), offering limited depth for evaluating genuine geospatial reasoning. To address this gap, we present MapVerse, a large-scale benchmark built on real-world maps. It comprises 11,837 human-authored question-answer pairs across 1,025 maps, spanning ten diverse map categories and multiple question categories for each. The dataset provides a rich setting for evaluating map reading, interpretation, and multimodal reasoning. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art models against our benchmark to establish baselines and quantify reasoning gaps. Beyond overall performance, we conduct fine-grained categorical analyses to assess model inference across multiple dimensions and investigate the visual factors shaping reasoning outcomes. Our findings reveal that while current VLMs perform competitively on classification-style tasks, both open- and closed-source models fall short on advanced tasks requiring complex spatial reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a high-quality, large-scale dataset of 730,000+ images (real and AI-generated) to improve AI-generated image detection, addressing limitations in existing datasets. A lightweight detection method using noise entropy is also proposed, showing strong generalization and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the societal risks of AI-generated fake images by overcoming the limitations of current datasets (poor generalization, low quality, simple prompts, lack of diversity).

Method: Created a diverse dataset with 730,000+ images using advanced generation techniques (text-to-image, inpainting, refinement, face swapping). Proposed a lightweight detection method based on Non-Local Means noise entropy for classification.

Result: Models trained on the new dataset showed superior generalization. The proposed detection method achieved competitive performance, setting a strong baseline for future research.

Conclusion: The dataset and method advance AI-generated image detection, providing a robust benchmark and improving detection robustness. The dataset and source code are publicly available.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has raised concerns about the authenticity of digital images, as highly realistic fake images can now be generated at low cost, potentially increasing societal risks. In response, several datasets have been established to train detection models aimed at distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones. However, existing datasets suffer from limited generalization, low image quality, overly simple prompts, and insufficient image diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a high-quality, large-scale dataset comprising over 730,000 images across multiple categories, including both real and AI-generated images. The generated images are synthesized via state-of-the-art methods, including text-to-image generation (guided by over 10,000 carefully designed prompts), image inpainting, image refinement, and face swapping. Each generated image is annotated with its generation method and category. Inpainting images further include binary masks to indicate inpainted regions, providing rich metadata for analysis. Compared to existing datasets, detection models trained on our dataset demonstrate superior generalization capabilities. Our dataset not only serves as a strong benchmark for evaluating detection methods but also contributes to advancing the robustness of AI-generated image detection techniques. Building upon this, we propose a lightweight detection method based on image noise entropy, which transforms the original image into an entropy tensor of Non-Local Means (NLM) noise before classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on our dataset achieve strong generalization, and our method delivers competitive performance, establishing a solid baseline for future research. The dataset and source code are publicly available at https://real-hd.github.io.

*Shengyang Sun,Jiashen Hua,Junyi Feng,Xiaojin Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text-guided framework for weakly supervised multimodal video anomaly detection uses text augmentation and a multi-scale bottleneck Transformer fusion module to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text modality is under-explored in anomaly detection despite its potential to enhance anomaly characterization and reduce false alarms, while multimodal fusion often faces redundancy and imbalance issues.

Method: The framework employs an in-context learning-based multi-stage text augmentation mechanism for fine-tuning text features and a multi-scale bottleneck Transformer fusion module to integrate modalities efficiently.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets.

Conclusion: The text-guided framework effectively leverages text modality and addresses fusion challenges, advancing weakly supervised anomaly detection.

Abstract: Weakly supervised multimodal video anomaly detection has gained significant attention, yet the potential of the text modality remains under-explored. Text provides explicit semantic information that can enhance anomaly characterization and reduce false alarms. However, extracting effective text features is challenging due to the inability of general-purpose language models to capture anomaly-specific nuances and the scarcity of relevant descriptions. Furthermore, multimodal fusion often suffers from redundancy and imbalance. To address these issues, we propose a novel text-guided framework. First, we introduce an in-context learning-based multi-stage text augmentation mechanism to generate high-quality anomaly text samples for fine-tuning the text feature extractor. Second, we design a multi-scale bottleneck Transformer fusion module that uses compressed bottleneck tokens to progressively integrate information across modalities, mitigating redundancy and imbalance. Experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Method: Introduces C^2RoPE, combining 1D temporal positions with spatial coordinates and Chebyshev Causal Masking for better visual token processing.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in benchmarks like 3D scene reasoning and visual question answering.

Conclusion: C^2RoPE successfully mitigates RoPE's limitations, improving performance in 3D multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) have established the alignment of 3D visual features with LLM representations as the dominant paradigm. However, the inherited Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) introduces limitations for multimodal processing. Specifically, applying 1D temporal positional indices disrupts the continuity of visual features along the column dimension, resulting in spatial locality loss. Moreover, RoPE follows the prior that temporally closer image tokens are more causally related, leading to long-term decay in attention allocation and causing the model to progressively neglect earlier visual tokens as the sequence length increases. To address these issues, we propose C^2RoPE, an improved RoPE that explicitly models local spatial Continuity and spatial Causal relationships for visual processing. C^2RoPE introduces a spatio-temporal continuous positional embedding mechanism for visual tokens. It first integrates 1D temporal positions with Cartesian-based spatial coordinates to construct a triplet hybrid positional index, and then employs a frequency allocation strategy to encode spatio-temporal positional information across the three index components. Additionally, we introduce Chebyshev Causal Masking, which determines causal dependencies by computing the Chebyshev distance of image tokens in 2D space. Evaluation results across various benchmarks, including 3D scene reasoning and 3D visual question answering, demonstrate C^2RoPE's effectiveness.

Conclusion: MetaphorStar fills a critical gap in AI's metaphorical comprehension, demonstrating broad applicability and superior performance. All resources are open-sourced.

Abstract: Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for Nowadays AI systems. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at basic Visual Question Answering (VQA), they consistently struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional, and contextual implications embedded in visual content. This difficulty stems from the task's demand for sophisticated multi-hop reasoning, cultural context, and Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities, which current models lack. To fill this gap, we propose MetaphorStar, the first end-to-end visual reinforcement learning (RL) framework for image implication tasks. Our framework includes three core components: the fine-grained dataset TFQ-Data, the visual RL method TFQ-GRPO, and the well-structured benchmark TFQ-Bench.
  Our fully open-source MetaphorStar family, trained using TFQ-GRPO on TFQ-Data, significantly improves performance by an average of 82.6% on the image implication benchmarks. Compared with 20+ mainstream MLLMs, MetaphorStar-32B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on Multiple-Choice Question and Open-Style Question, significantly outperforms the top closed-source model Gemini-3.0-pro on True-False Question. Crucially, our experiments reveal that learning image implication tasks improves the general understanding ability, especially the complex visual reasoning ability. We further provide a systematic analysis of model parameter scaling, training data scaling, and the impact of different model architectures and training strategies, demonstrating the broad applicability of our method. We open-sourced all model weights, datasets, and method code at https://metaphorstar.github.io.

### [32] [Enhancing Underwater Images via Adaptive Semantic-aware Codebook Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10586)
*Bosen Lin,Feng Gao,Yanwei Yu,Junyu Dong,Qian Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SUCode proposes a semantic-aware codebook network for underwater image enhancement, addressing inconsistent degradation across regions with adaptive methods and achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from inconsistent degradation across regions, leading to color distortions and detail loss with existing global models.

Method: SUCode uses semantic-aware, pixel-level codebook representation, a three-stage training paradigm, GCAM, and FAFF for color and texture restoration.

Result: SUCode outperforms recent methods on benchmarks, excelling in both reference and no-reference metrics.

Conclusion: SUCode effectively addresses heterogeneous underwater degradation, offering advanced enhancement with adaptive techniques.

Abstract: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) is an ill-posed problem where natural clean references are not available, and the degradation levels vary significantly across semantic regions. Existing UIE methods treat images with a single global model and ignore the inconsistent degradation of different scene components. This oversight leads to significant color distortions and loss of fine details in heterogeneous underwater scenes, especially where degradation varies significantly across different image regions. Therefore, we propose SUCode (Semantic-aware Underwater Codebook Network), which achieves adaptive UIE from semantic-aware discrete codebook representation. Compared with one-shot codebook-based methods, SUCode exploits semantic-aware, pixel-level codebook representation tailored to heterogeneous underwater degradation. A three-stage training paradigm is employed to represent raw underwater image features to avoid pseudo ground-truth contamination. Gated Channel Attention Module (GCAM) and Frequency-Aware Feature Fusion (FAFF) jointly integrate channel and frequency cues for faithful color restoration and texture recovery. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SUCode achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent UIE methods on both reference and no-reference metrics. The code will be made public available at https://github.com/oucailab/SUCode.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight, deployment-ready pipeline for improving child detection in low-quality surveillance footage using YOLOv11n, domain-specific augmentations, and SAHI, achieving higher accuracy without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing child detection in surveillance systems is crucial for applications like missing child alerts and daycare monitoring, especially under challenging conditions like occlusion, low resolution, and poor lighting.

Method: The approach uses domain-specific augmentations (spatial perturbations and photometric degradations) to synthesize realistic child placements and integrates SAHI for better detection of small or occluded instances.

Result: The system achieves mAP@0.5 of 0.967 and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.783, improving the baseline by 0.7% and 2.3%, respectively, while maintaining real-time performance on edge devices.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline is practical for resource-constrained surveillance deployments, offering improved accuracy without hardware upgrades.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical and lightweight solution for enhancing child detection in low-quality surveillance footage, a critical component in real-world missing child alert and daycare monitoring systems. Building upon the efficient YOLOv11n architecture, we propose a deployment-ready pipeline that improves detection under challenging conditions including occlusion, small object size, low resolution, motion blur, and poor lighting commonly found in existing CCTV infrastructures. Our approach introduces a domain-specific augmentation strategy that synthesizes realistic child placements using spatial perturbations such as partial visibility, truncation, and overlaps, combined with photometric degradations including lighting variation and noise. To improve recall of small and partially occluded instances, we integrate Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) at inference time. All components are trained and evaluated on a filtered, child-only subset of the Roboflow Daycare dataset. Compared to the baseline YOLOv11n, our enhanced system achieves a mean Average Precision at 0.5 IoU (mAP@0.5) of 0.967 and a mean Average Precision averaged over IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 (mAP@0.5:0.95) of 0.783, yielding absolute improvements of 0.7 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, without architectural changes. Importantly, the entire pipeline maintains compatibility with low-power edge devices and supports real-time performance, making it particularly well suited for low-cost or resource-constrained industrial surveillance deployments.

TL;DR: The paper proposes VRFT-Aug, a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework for medical imaging, combining perception and reasoning strategies to outperform traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rule-based reward schemes for large language models lack exploration in cross-modal, vision-centric domains, especially medical imaging, which requires robust visual perception and structured reasoning.

Method: VRFT-Aug includes prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation to enhance RFT.

Result: Experiments on medical datasets show VRFT-Aug outperforms supervised fine-tuning and RFT baselines, offering practical training insights.

Conclusion: VRFT-Aug provides actionable guidance for developing reliable, reasoning-capable models in high-stakes medical applications.

Abstract: While recent advances in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) have shown that rule-based reward schemes can enable effective post-training for large language models, their extension to cross-modal, vision-centric domains remains largely underexplored. This limitation is especially pronounced in the medical imaging domain, where effective performance requires both robust visual perception and structured reasoning. In this work, we address this gap by proposing VRFT-Aug, a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for the medical domain. VRFT-Aug introduces a series of training strategies designed to augment both perception and reasoning, including prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation. Together, these methods aim to stabilize and improve the RFT process.
  Through extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets, we show that our approaches consistently outperform both standard supervised fine-tuning and RFT baselines. Moreover, we provide empirically grounded insights and practical training heuristics that can be generalized to other medical image tasks. We hope this work contributes actionable guidance and fresh inspiration for the ongoing effort to develop reliable, reasoning-capable models for high-stakes medical applications.

Motivation: To overcome the reliance on task-specific fine-tuning in medical foundation models and demonstrate effective zero-shot clinical decision support.

Method: Trained via masked latent modelling and contrastive learning on over 4 million multimodal data points, evaluated across 20 benchmarks and multinational reader studies.

Result: Enabled general practitioners to nearly double diagnostic accuracy, outperformed dermatologists in skin cancer assessment, and improved management appropriateness in collaborative workflows.

Conclusion: DermFM-Zero provides effective, safe, and transparent zero-shot clinical decision support with interpretable latent representations.

Abstract: Medical foundation models have shown promise in controlled benchmarks, yet widespread deployment remains hindered by reliance on task-specific fine-tuning. Here, we introduce DermFM-Zero, a dermatology vision-language foundation model trained via masked latent modelling and contrastive learning on over 4 million multimodal data points. We evaluated DermFM-Zero across 20 benchmarks spanning zero-shot diagnosis and multimodal retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific adaptation. We further evaluated its zero-shot capabilities in three multinational reader studies involving over 1,100 clinicians. In primary care settings, AI assistance enabled general practitioners to nearly double their differential diagnostic accuracy across 98 skin conditions. In specialist settings, the model significantly outperformed board-certified dermatologists in multimodal skin cancer assessment. In collaborative workflows, AI assistance enabled non-experts to surpass unassisted experts while improving management appropriateness. Finally, we show that DermFM-Zero's latent representations are interpretable: sparse autoencoders unsupervisedly disentangle clinically meaningful concepts that outperform predefined-vocabulary approaches and enable targeted suppression of artifact-induced biases, enhancing robustness without retraining. These findings demonstrate that a foundation model can provide effective, safe, and transparent zero-shot clinical decision support.

*Yan Wang,Shijie Zhao,Junlin Li,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenDR-Pix accelerates diffusion-based super-resolution by eliminating VAE bottlenecks, using pixel-shuffle and adversarial distillation to achieve faster inference and lower memory use with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to overcome slow inference and high memory demands in diffusion-based super-resolution models, especially for high-resolution images like 4K.

Method: Replace VAE with pixel-shuffle operations, use multi-stage adversarial distillation, random padding, masked Fourier space loss, and padding-based self-ensemble.

Result: GenDR-Pix achieves 2.8x speedup, 60% memory savings, and can restore 4K images in 1 second with negligible quality degradation.

Conclusion: GenDR-Pix effectively addresses latency and memory issues in diffusion SR models, enabling practical high-resolution image restoration.

Abstract: Diffusion models have attained remarkable breakthroughs in the real-world super-resolution (SR) task, albeit at slow inference and high demand on devices. To accelerate inference, recent works like GenDR adopt step distillation to minimize the step number to one. However, the memory boundary still restricts the maximum processing size, necessitating tile-by-tile restoration of high-resolution images. Through profiling the pipeline, we pinpoint that the variational auto-encoder (VAE) is the bottleneck of latency and memory. To completely solve the problem, we leverage pixel-(un)shuffle operations to eliminate the VAE, reversing the latent-based GenDR to pixel-space GenDR-Pix. However, upscale with x8 pixelshuffle may induce artifacts of repeated patterns. To alleviate the distortion, we propose a multi-stage adversarial distillation to progressively remove the encoder and decoder. Specifically, we utilize generative features from the previous stage models to guide adversarial discrimination. Moreover, we propose random padding to augment generative features and avoid discriminator collapse. We also introduce a masked Fourier space loss to penalize the outliers of amplitude. To improve inference performance, we empirically integrate a padding-based self-ensemble with classifier-free guidance to improve inference scaling. Experimental results show that GenDR-Pix performs 2.8x acceleration and 60% memory-saving compared to GenDR with negligible visual degradation, surpassing other one-step diffusion SR. Against all odds, GenDR-Pix can restore 4K image in only 1 second and 6GB.

*Yuxin Cao,Wei Song,Shangzhi Xu,Jingling Xue,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VideoSTF, a framework to measure output repetition in VideoLLMs, revealing its prevalence and sensitivity to temporal perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoLLM benchmarks miss output repetition failures, which degrade model performance and stability.

Method: VideoSTF uses three n-gram metrics and a testbed of 10,000 videos with temporal transformations to evaluate 10 VideoLLMs.

Result: Output repetition is widespread and exploitable via simple temporal perturbations, highlighting a security vulnerability.

Conclusion: Output repetition is a stability issue in VideoLLMs, motivating stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently achieved strong performance in video understanding tasks. However, we identify a previously underexplored generation failure: severe output repetition, where models degenerate into self-reinforcing loops of repeated phrases or sentences. This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability. Our results reveal output repetition as a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs and motivate stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MP-HOI, a novel framework to improve text-driven 3D human-object interaction (HOI) motion generation by addressing limitations in existing methods through multimodal data priors, enhanced object representation, a modality-aware MoE model, and cascaded diffusion with interaction supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-HOI methods suffer from sub-optimal human motion, unnatural object motion, and weak interaction due to cross-modality gaps. The paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: MP-HOI leverages multimodal data priors, enhances object representation, uses a modality-aware MoE model for feature fusion, and employs a cascaded diffusion framework with interaction supervision.

Result: MP-HOI outperforms existing methods in generating high-fidelity and fine-grained HOI motions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges the cross-modality gap and improves HOI motion generation through innovative multimodal and interaction-focused techniques.

Abstract: We address the challenging task of text-driven 3D human-object interaction (HOI) motion generation. Existing methods primarily rely on a direct text-to-HOI mapping, which suffers from three key limitations due to the significant cross-modality gap: (Q1) sub-optimal human motion, (Q2) unnatural object motion, and (Q3) weak interaction between humans and objects. To address these challenges, we propose MP-HOI, a novel framework grounded in four core insights: (1) Multimodal Data Priors: We leverage multimodal data (text, image, pose/object) from large multimodal models as priors to guide HOI generation, which tackles Q1 and Q2 in data modeling. (2) Enhanced Object Representation: We improve existing object representations by incorporating geometric keypoints, contact features, and dynamic properties, enabling expressive object representations, which tackles Q2 in data representation. (3) Multimodal-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Model: We propose a modality-aware MoE model for effective multimodal feature fusion paradigm, which tackles Q1 and Q2 in feature fusion. (4) Cascaded Diffusion with Interaction Supervision: We design a cascaded diffusion framework that progressively refines human-object interaction features under dedicated supervision, which tackles Q3 in interaction refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MP-HOI outperforms existing approaches in generating high-fidelity and fine-grained HOI motions.

*Tiandong Shi,Ling Zhao,Ji Qi,Jiayi Ma,Chengli Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses unintended structural changes in text-guided diffusion models by analyzing frequency components in noisy latent variables, proposing a training-free frequency modulation method to preserve structure during semantic edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent unintended global structure changes caused by modifying text prompts in diffusion models, ensuring user intent is preserved while allowing semantic adjustments.

Method: Analyzes frequency spectrum impact on generation, identifies low-frequency components' role in early structure framing, and introduces a frequency-dependent weighting function with dynamic decay for training-free modulation.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing techniques, balancing structure preservation and semantic updates without relying on empirical feature map selection.

Conclusion: Frequency-based modulation effectively maintains structural consistency during semantic edits in diffusion models, offering a stable alternative to current methods.

Abstract: The success of text-guided diffusion models has established a new image generation paradigm driven by the iterative refinement of text prompts. However, modifying the original text prompt to achieve the expected semantic adjustments often results in unintended global structure changes that disrupt user intent. Existing methods rely on empirical feature map selection for intervention, whose performance heavily depends on appropriate selection, leading to suboptimal stability. This paper tries to solve the aforementioned problem from a frequency perspective and analyzes the impact of the frequency spectrum of noisy latent variables on the hierarchical emergence of the structure framework and fine-grained textures during the generation process. We find that lower-frequency components are primarily responsible for establishing the structure framework in the early generation stage. Their influence diminishes over time, giving way to higher-frequency components that synthesize fine-grained textures. In light of this, we propose a training-free frequency modulation method utilizing a frequency-dependent weighting function with dynamic decay. This method maintains the structure framework consistency while permitting targeted semantic modifications. By directly manipulating the noisy latent variable, the proposed method avoids the empirical selection of internal feature maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving an effective balance between preserving structure and enabling semantic updates.

Motivation: Existing VCoT methods lack temporal dynamics, limiting their effectiveness in tasks like instruction and prediction. This paper addresses this gap.

Method: Proposes TwiFF-2.7M dataset, TwiFF-Bench for evaluation, and the TwiFF model, which combines video generation and image comprehension for coherent visual reasoning.

Result: TwiFF significantly outperforms existing VCoT and textual baselines in dynamic reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The approach validates the effectiveness of integrating temporal dynamics into visual reasoning for dynamic visual question answering.

Abstract: Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing multimodal reasoning by integrating visual perception into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing VCoT approaches are largely confined to static scenarios and struggle to capture the temporal dynamics essential for tasks such as instruction, prediction, and camera motion. To bridge this gap, we propose TwiFF-2.7M, the first large-scale, temporally grounded VCoT dataset derived from $2.7$ million video clips, explicitly designed for dynamic visual question and answer. Accompanying this, we introduce TwiFF-Bench, a high-quality evaluation benchmark of $1,078$ samples that assesses both the plausibility of reasoning trajectories and the correctness of final answers in open-ended dynamic settings. Building on these foundations, we propose the TwiFF model, a unified modal that synergistically leverages pre-trained video generation and image comprehension capabilities to produce temporally coherent visual reasoning cues-iteratively generating future action frames and textual reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TwiFF significantly outperforms existing VCoT methods and Textual Chain-of-Thought baselines on dynamic reasoning tasks, which fully validates the effectiveness for visual question answering in dynamic scenarios.

*Jinjie Shen,Jing Wu,Yaxiong Wang,Lechao Cheng,Shengeng Tang,Tianrui Hui,Nan Pu,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes OmniVL-Guard, a balanced reinforcement learning framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding, addressing the 'difficulty bias' problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forgery detection methods struggle with interleaved multi-modal data and the challenge of simultaneous detection and localization.

Method: Introduces Self-Evolving CoT Generation for reasoning paths and Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO) for balanced joint optimization.

Result: OmniVL-Guard outperforms state-of-the-art methods and shows robust generalization in out-of-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances multi-task optimization and enhances performance in vision-language forgery detection.

Abstract: Existing forgery detection methods are often limited to uni-modal or bi-modal settings, failing to handle the interleaved text, images, and videos prevalent in real-world misinformation. To bridge this gap, this paper targets to develop a unified framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. In this unified setting, the {interplay} between diverse modalities and the dual requirements of simultaneous detection and localization pose a critical ``difficulty bias`` problem: the simpler veracity classification task tends to dominate the gradients, leading to suboptimal performance in fine-grained grounding during multi-task optimization. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{OmniVL-Guard}, a balanced reinforcement learning framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. Particularly, OmniVL-Guard comprises two core designs: Self-Evolving CoT Generatio and Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO). {Self-Evolving CoT Generation} synthesizes high-quality reasoning paths, effectively overcoming the cold-start challenge. Building upon this, {Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO)} dynamically modulates reward scales and task weights, ensuring a balanced joint optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniVL-Guard significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits zero-shot robust generalization across out-of-domain scenarios.

*Zhifeng Rao,Wenlong Chen,Lei Xie,Xia Hua,Dongfu Yin,Zhen Tian,F. Richard Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes integrating depth estimation into Vision-Language-Action models to enhance 3D feature representations, improving spatial understanding and action grounding in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of existing Vision-Language-Action models relying solely on 2D images restrict their spatial understanding and action grounding in 3D environments.

Method: The authors introduce a framework combining depth estimation (using VGGT) with action priors through an action assistant module, fusing enhanced 3D features with 2D visual tokens.

Result: The method improves generalization and robustness, strengthens perception in ambiguous scenarios, and achieves superior action prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Depth-driven data augmentation and expert supervision bridge the gap between 2D observations and 3D-aware decision-making in robotics.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic perception and control, yet most existing approaches primarily rely on VLM trained using 2D images, which limits their spatial understanding and action grounding in complex 3D environments. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates depth estimation into VLA models to enrich 3D feature representations. Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios but also leads to superior action prediction accuracy. This work highlights the potential of depth-driven data augmentation and auxiliary expert supervision for bridging the gap between 2D observations and 3D-aware decision-making in robotic systems.

### [46] [(MGS)$^2$-Net: Unifying Micro-Geometric Scale and Macro-Geometric Structure for Cross-View Geo-Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10704)
*Minglei Li,Mengfan He,Chao Chen,Ziyang Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes (MGS)$^2$, a geometry-grounded framework for cross-view geo-localization, addressing geometric misalignment between aerial and satellite views through Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering and Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVGL methods ignore 3D geometry, leading to poor feature alignment due to vertical facades and scale variations.

Method: Introduces MGSF for filtering facade artifacts and MGSA for scale rectification, along with a GACD loss for occlusion discrimination.

Result: Achieves Recall@1 of 97.5% on University-1652 and 97.02% on SUES-200, with strong cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: (MGS)$^2$ outperforms existing methods by leveraging 3D geometry, demonstrating robustness against geometric ambiguity.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) is pivotal for GNSS-denied UAV navigation but remains brittle under the drastic geometric misalignment between oblique aerial views and orthographic satellite references. Existing methods predominantly operate within a 2D manifold, neglecting the underlying 3D geometry where view-dependent vertical facades (macro-structure) and scale variations (micro-scale) severely corrupt feature alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose (MGS)$^2$, a geometry-grounded framework. The core of our innovation is the Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering (MGSF) module. Unlike pixel-wise matching sensitive to noise, MGSF leverages dilated geometric gradients to physically filter out high-frequency facade artifacts while enhancing the view-invariant horizontal plane, directly addressing the domain shift. To guarantee robust input for this structural filtering, we explicitly incorporate a Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation (MGSA) module. MGSA utilizes depth priors to dynamically rectify scale discrepancies via multi-branch feature fusion. Furthermore, a Geometric-Appearance Contrastive Distillation (GACD) loss is designed to strictly discriminate against oblique occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (MGS)$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, recording a Recall@1 of 97.5\% on University-1652 and 97.02\% on SUES-200. Furthermore, the framework exhibits superior cross-dataset generalization against geometric ambiguity.

*Jialin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FGAA-FPN improves oriented object detection by addressing cluttered backgrounds and orientation changes with foreground-guided feature modulation and angle-aware attention, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like cluttered backgrounds, scale variation, and orientation changes hinder oriented object detection in remote sensing and aerial imagery. Existing methods lack explicit foreground modeling and geometric orientation priors.

Method: FGAA-FPN introduces Foreground-Guided Feature Modulation for enhancing object regions and suppressing background, and Angle-Aware Multi-Head Attention for encoding orientation relationships. It leverages hierarchical functional decomposition for multi-scale representation.

Result: FGAA-FPN achieves 75.5% mAP on DOTA v1.0 and 68.3% mAP on DOTA v1.5, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: FGAA-FPN effectively addresses limitations in oriented object detection by integrating foreground guidance and angle-aware attention, setting new benchmarks.

Abstract: With the increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing and aerial imagery, oriented object detection has become a key capability for geographic information updating, maritime surveillance, and disaster response. However, it remains challenging due to cluttered backgrounds, severe scale variation, and large orientation changes. Existing approaches largely improve performance through multi-scale feature fusion with feature pyramid networks or contextual modeling with attention, but they often lack explicit foreground modeling and do not leverage geometric orientation priors, which limits feature discriminability. To overcome these limitations, we propose FGAA-FPN, a Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for oriented object detection. FGAA-FPN is built on a hierarchical functional decomposition that accounts for the distinct spatial resolution and semantic abstraction across pyramid levels, thereby strengthening multi-scale representations. Concretely, a Foreground-Guided Feature Modulation module learns foreground saliency under weak supervision to enhance object regions and suppress background interference in low-level features. In parallel, an Angle-Aware Multi-Head Attention module encodes relative orientation relationships to guide global interactions among high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on DOTA v1.0 and DOTA v1.5 demonstrate that FGAA-FPN achieves state-of-the-art results, reaching 75.5% and 68.3% mAP, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GFMs outperform ResNet-101 in ecological tasks, with TerraMind showing slight advantages over Prithvi, especially with added modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore GFMs' utility, challenges, and opportunities in ecological mapping.

Method: Fine-tune Prithvi-E0-2.0 and TerraMind models across three ecological use cases, comparing them to ResNet-101.

Result: GFMs consistently outperform ResNet-101; TerraMind excels marginally and significantly with extra modalities.

Conclusion: GFMs show promise but require higher-resolution data and accurate labels for pixel-level mapping.

Abstract: Geospatial foundation models (GFMs) are a fast-emerging paradigm for various geospatial tasks, such as ecological mapping. However, the utility of GFMs has not been fully explored for high-value use cases. This study aims to explore the utility, challenges and opportunities associated with the application of GFMs for ecological uses. In this regard, we fine-tune several pretrained AI models, namely, Prithvi-E0-2.0 and TerraMind, across three use cases, and compare this with a baseline ResNet-101 model. Firstly, we demonstrate TerraMind's LULC generation capabilities. Lastly, we explore the utility of the GFMs in forest functional trait mapping and peatlands detection. In all experiments, the GFMs outperform the baseline ResNet models. In general TerraMind marginally outperforms Prithvi. However, with additional modalities TerraMind significantly outperforms the baseline ResNet and Prithvi models. Nonetheless, consideration should be given to the divergence of input data from pretrained modalities. We note that these models would benefit from higher resolution and more accurate labels, especially for use cases where pixel-level dynamics need to be mapped.

*Davide Evangelista,Pasquale Cascarano,Elena Loli Piccolomini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using diffusion-based generative models within the Deep Generative Prior framework to improve CT image reconstruction from sparse geometries, achieving promising results despite challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstruction of CT images from sparse or limited-angle geometries is challenging due to artifacts and distortions, motivating the use of deep generative models for better results.

Method: The method combines diffusion-based generative models with iterative optimization in the DGP framework, focusing on explainability and generative power.

Result: Promising results were achieved under highly sparse geometries, though further research is needed.

Conclusion: The proposed approach shows potential for improving CT image reconstruction quality, but additional investigation is required.

Abstract: The reconstruction of X-rays CT images from sparse or limited-angle geometries is a highly challenging task. The lack of data typically results in artifacts in the reconstructed image and may even lead to object distortions. For this reason, the use of deep generative models in this context has great interest and potential success. In the Deep Generative Prior (DGP) framework, the use of diffusion-based generative models is combined with an iterative optimization algorithm for the reconstruction of CT images from sinograms acquired under sparse geometries, to maintain the explainability of a model-based approach while introducing the generative power of a neural network. There are therefore several aspects that can be further investigated within these frameworks to improve reconstruction quality, such as image generation, the model, and the iterative algorithm used to solve the minimization problem, for which we propose modifications with respect to existing approaches. The results obtained even under highly sparse geometries are very promising, although further research is clearly needed in this direction.

*Xinhao Xiang,Zhengxin Li,Saurav Dhakad,Theo Bancroft,Jiawei Zhang,Weiyang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OccFace is an occlusion-aware framework for accurate facial landmark detection on human-like faces, predicting per-point visibility alongside coordinates, improving robustness under occlusion and rotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing facial landmark detectors struggle with occlusion and lack explicit visibility predictions, which downstream applications could benefit from.

Method: OccFace uses a unified dense 100-point layout and heatmap-based backbone, adding an occlusion module to predict landmark coordinates and visibility by combining local evidence and cross-landmark context. Visibility supervision includes manual labels and pseudo visibility from mask-heatmap overlap.

Result: OccFace improves robustness under occlusion and large rotations, especially on occluded regions, while maintaining accuracy on visible landmarks.

Conclusion: OccFace advances facial landmark detection by explicitly modeling visibility, enhancing performance under occlusion and head rotations.

Abstract: Accurate facial landmark detection under occlusion remains challenging, especially for human-like faces with large appearance variation and rotation-driven self-occlusion. Existing detectors typically localize landmarks while handling occlusion implicitly, without predicting per-point visibility that downstream applications can benefits. We present OccFace, an occlusion-aware framework for universal human-like faces, including humans, stylized characters, and other non-human designs. OccFace adopts a unified dense 100-point layout and a heatmap-based backbone, and adds an occlusion module that jointly predicts landmark coordinates and per-point visibility by combining local evidence with cross-landmark context. Visibility supervision mixes manual labels with landmark-aware masking that derives pseudo visibility from mask-heatmap overlap. We also create an occlusion-aware evaluation suite reporting NME on visible vs. occluded landmarks and benchmarking visibility with Occ AP, F1@0.5, and ROC-AUC, together with a dataset annotated with 100-point landmarks and per-point visibility. Experiments show improved robustness under external occlusion and large head rotations, especially on occluded regions, while preserving accuracy on visible landmarks.

*Kian Majlessi,Amir Masoud Soltani,Mohammad Ebrahim Mahdavi,Aurelien Gourrier,Peyman Adibi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a no-reference super-resolution image quality assessment (SR-IQA) method for real-world LR images, using self-supervised learning and a new dataset, outperforming existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world SR image degradations are unpredictable, making quality assessment challenging. Existing methods struggle with this complexity.

Method: Proposes S3RIQA, a no-reference SR-IQA approach using self-supervised learning (SSL) with contrastive learning, preprocessing, and an auxiliary task. Introduces the SRMORSS dataset for training.

Result: S3RIQA outperforms state-of-the-art metrics on real SR-IQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses the challenges of real-world SR-IQA, demonstrating superior performance in data-scarce domains.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) applied to real-world low-resolution (LR) images often results in complex, irregular degradations that stem from the inherent complexity of natural scene acquisition. In contrast to SR artifacts arising from synthetic LR images created under well-defined scenarios, those distortions are highly unpredictable and vary significantly across different real-life contexts. Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets. Experiments on real SR-IQA benchmarks demonstrate that S3 RIQA consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art relevant metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of contrastive learning studies for regression tasks, particularly in hyperspectral data applications.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and transformations effectively enhance regression task performance for hyperspectral data.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has demonstrated great success in representation learning, especially for image classification tasks.

In this paper, we propose a spectral-spatial contrastive learning framework for regression tasks for hyperspectral data, in a model-agnostic design allowing to enhance backbones such as 3D convolutional and transformer-based networks. Moreover, we provide a collection of transformations relevant for augmenting hyperspectral data. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed framework and transformations significantly improve the performance of all studied backbone models.

TL;DR: Novel method generates vector residential plans from text and improves vectorization of raster plans, outperforming existing solutions by ~5% and ~4% in CLIPScore, respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of raster graphics (scalability) and vector graphics (complexity) in design and architecture by simplifying the creation of scalable vector plans.

Method: Introduces a method for generating vector residential plans from text and a new algorithm for vectorizing raster plans into structured vector images.

Result: Achieves ~5% and ~4% better CLIPScore for text-to-vector generation and raster-to-vector conversion, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance the quality and ease of producing vector graphics for design and architecture.

Abstract: Computer graphics, comprising both raster and vector components, is a fundamental part of modern science, industry, and digital communication. While raster graphics offer ease of use, its pixel-based structure limits scalability. Vector graphics, defined by mathematical primitives, provides scalability without quality loss, however, it is more complex to produce. For design and architecture, the versatility of vector graphics is paramount, despite its computational demands. This paper introduces a novel method for generating vector residential plans from textual descriptions. Our approach surpasses existing solutions by approximately 5% in CLIPScore-based visual quality, benefiting from its inherent handling of right angles and flexible settings. Additionally, we present a new algorithm for vectorizing raster plans into structured vector images. Such images have a better CLIPscore compared to others by about 4%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dual-End Consistency Model (DE-CM) to address training instability and inflexible sampling in consistency models (CMs) by selecting vital sub-trajectories and using flow matching and noise-to-noisy mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the slow iterative sampling bottleneck in diffusion and flow-based models, specifically addressing training instability and inflexible sampling in CMs.

Method: Proposes DE-CM, which selects critical sub-trajectories, uses continuous-time CMs objectives for few-step distillation, and employs flow matching and noise-to-noisy mapping.

Result: Achieves a state-of-the-art FID score of 1.70 in one-step generation on ImageNet 256x256, outperforming existing CM-based approaches.

Conclusion: DE-CM effectively stabilizes training and enables flexible sampling, advancing the practicality of efficient generative models.

Abstract: The slow iterative sampling nature remains a major bottleneck for the practical deployment of diffusion and flow-based generative models. While consistency models (CMs) represent a state-of-the-art distillation-based approach for efficient generation, their large-scale application is still limited by two key issues: training instability and inflexible sampling. Existing methods seek to mitigate these problems through architectural adjustments or regularized objectives, yet overlook the critical reliance on trajectory selection. In this work, we first conduct an analysis on these two limitations: training instability originates from loss divergence induced by unstable self-supervised term, whereas sampling inflexibility arises from error accumulation. Based on these insights and analysis, we propose the Dual-End Consistency Model (DE-CM) that selects vital sub-trajectory clusters to achieve stable and effective training. DE-CM decomposes the PF-ODE trajectory and selects three critical sub-trajectories as optimization targets. Specifically, our approach leverages continuous-time CMs objectives to achieve few-step distillation and utilizes flow matching as a boundary regularizer to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, we propose a novel noise-to-noisy (N2N) mapping that can map noise to any point, thereby alleviating the error accumulation in the first step. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our method: it achieves a state-of-the-art FID score of 1.70 in one-step generation on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset, outperforming existing CM-based one-step approaches.

TL;DR: CyclingVQA is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate cyclist-centric perception and reasoning in VLMs, revealing gaps despite encouraging capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of cyclist-centric evaluations in VLMs despite their potential for traffic understanding.

Method: Introducing CyclingVQA to assess VLMs' perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule reasoning from a cyclist's perspective.

Result: Current VLMs show promise but struggle with cyclist-specific cues and lane associations, with specialized models underperforming generalist ones.

Conclusion: Systematic error analysis identifies failure modes to improve cyclist-assistive systems, highlighting the need for better cyclist-centric training.

Abstract: Cyclists often encounter safety-critical situations in urban traffic, highlighting the need for assistive systems that support safe and informed decision-making. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, suggesting their potential for general traffic understanding and navigation-related reasoning. However, existing evaluations are predominantly vehicle-centric and fail to assess perception and reasoning from a cyclist-centric viewpoint. To address this gap, we introduce CyclingVQA, a diagnostic benchmark designed to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from a cyclist's perspective. Evaluating 31+ recent VLMs spanning general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models, we find that current models demonstrate encouraging capabilities, while also revealing clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, particularly in interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with the correct navigational lanes. Notably, several driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs, indicating limited transfer from vehicle-centric training to cyclist-assistive scenarios. Finally, through systematic error analysis, we identify recurring failure modes to guide the development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RSHallu, a systematic study addressing hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for remote sensing (RS), featuring a taxonomy, benchmark, and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in MLLMs hinder their deployment in high-stakes RS scenarios like emergency management and agricultural monitoring. This work aims to formalize, benchmark, and mitigate these inconsistencies.

Method: The study: (1) formalizes RS hallucinations with an RS-oriented taxonomy, (2) builds RSHalluEval benchmark (2,023 QA pairs) and RSHalluCheck dataset (15,396 QA pairs), and (3) introduces RSHalluShield dataset (30k QA pairs) and plug-and-play mitigation strategies like logit correction and RS-aware prompting.

Result: Mitigation improves hallucination-free rates by up to 21.63 percentage points without degrading performance on RSVQA/RSVG tasks.

Conclusion: RSHallu provides a comprehensive framework to address hallucinations in RS-MLLMs, enhancing reliability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly adopted in remote sensing (RS) and have shown strong performance on tasks such as RS visual grounding (RSVG), RS visual question answering (RSVQA), and multimodal dialogue. However, hallucinations, which are responses inconsistent with the input RS images, severely hinder their deployment in high-stakes scenarios (e.g., emergency management and agricultural monitoring) and remain under-explored in RS. In this work, we present RSHallu, a systematic study with three deliverables: (1) we formalize RS hallucinations with an RS-oriented taxonomy and introduce image-level hallucination to capture RS-specific inconsistencies beyond object-centric errors (e.g., modality, resolution, and scene-level semantics); (2) we build a hallucination benchmark RSHalluEval (2,023 QA pairs) and enable dual-mode checking, supporting high-precision cloud auditing and low-cost reproducible local checking via a compact checker fine-tuned on RSHalluCheck dataset (15,396 QA pairs); and (3) we introduce a domain-tailored dataset RSHalluShield (30k QA pairs) for training-friendly mitigation and further propose training-free plug-and-play strategies, including decoding-time logit correction and RS-aware prompting. Across representative RS-MLLMs, our mitigation improves the hallucination-free rate by up to 21.63 percentage points under a unified protocol, while maintaining competitive performance on downstream RS tasks (RSVQA/RSVG). Code and datasets will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D anomaly detection rely on category-specific training, limiting flexibility in few-shot scenarios. DMP-3DAD addresses this by eliminating the need for training or adaptation.

Method: The framework converts point clouds into depth images, uses a frozen CLIP visual encoder for multi-view representation, and performs anomaly detection via weighted feature similarity.

Result: Experiments on ShapeNetPart show DMP-3DAD achieves state-of-the-art performance under few-shot conditions.

Conclusion: DMP-3DAD offers a simple, effective solution for practical cross-category 3D anomaly detection without requiring training or category-specific adjustments.

Abstract: Cross-category anomaly detection for 3D point clouds aims to determine whether an unseen object belongs to a target category using only a few normal examples. Most existing methods rely on category-specific training, which limits their flexibility in few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we propose DMP-3DAD, a training-free framework for cross-category 3D anomaly detection based on multi-view realistic depth map projection. Specifically, by converting point clouds into a fixed set of realistic depth images, our method leverages a frozen CLIP visual encoder to extract multi-view representations and performs anomaly detection via weighted feature similarity, which does not require any fine-tuning or category-dependent adaptation. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNetPart dataset demonstrate that DMP-3DAD achieves state-of-the-art performance under few-shot setting. The results show that the proposed approach provides a simple yet effective solution for practical cross-category 3D anomaly detection.

TL;DR: DeepImageSearch introduces an agentic paradigm for image retrieval, emphasizing multi-step reasoning over visual histories and contextual cues. DISBench benchmark and a modular agent baseline address scalability and reasoning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval systems ignore contextual dependencies in visual streams, limiting their effectiveness in realistic scenarios where information spans temporal sequences.

Method: DeepImageSearch reformulates retrieval as autonomous exploration, uses DISBench for evaluation, and employs a human-model pipeline to mine contextual cues. Modular agents with fine-grained tools and dual-memory systems provide scalable solutions.

Result: DISBench challenges state-of-the-art models, showing that agentic reasoning significantly improves retrieval performance in context-dependent scenarios.

Conclusion: Agentic reasoning is essential for next-generation retrieval systems to handle complex, context-rich visual streams effectively.

Abstract: Existing multimodal retrieval systems excel at semantic matching but implicitly assume that query-image relevance can be measured in isolation. This paradigm overlooks the rich dependencies inherent in realistic visual streams, where information is distributed across temporal sequences rather than confined to single snapshots. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepImageSearch, a novel agentic paradigm that reformulates image retrieval as an autonomous exploration task. Models must plan and perform multi-step reasoning over raw visual histories to locate targets based on implicit contextual cues. We construct DISBench, a challenging benchmark built on interconnected visual data. To address the scalability challenge of creating context-dependent queries, we propose a human-model collaborative pipeline that employs vision-language models to mine latent spatiotemporal associations, effectively offloading intensive context discovery before human verification. Furthermore, we build a robust baseline using a modular agent framework equipped with fine-grained tools and a dual-memory system for long-horizon navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DISBench poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art models, highlighting the necessity of incorporating agentic reasoning into next-generation retrieval systems.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the generalization gap in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning (RL) vs. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), attributing RL's advantage to implicit data filtering of medium-difficulty samples. It proposes DC-SFT, a method that explicitly filters training data by difficulty, improving OOD generalization and outperforming RL.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the generalization gap observed in VLMs fine-tuned with RL vs. SFT, suggesting a data-centric cause due to RL's implicit filtering of medium-difficulty samples.

Method: The authors systematically evaluate SFT models on datasets of varying difficulty levels and introduce DC-SFT, a method filtering training data explicitly by difficulty.

Result: DC-SFT significantly improves OOD generalization over standard SFT and surpasses RL-based training in performance, stability, and efficiency.

Conclusion: The work explains the OOD generalization gap in VLMs using a data-centric approach and presents DC-SFT as a more efficient and stable alternative to RL.

Abstract: The adaptation of large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through post-training reveals a pronounced generalization gap: models fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning (RL) consistently achieve superior out-of-distribution (OOD) performance compared to those trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This paper posits a data-centric explanation for this phenomenon, contending that RL's generalization advantage arises from an implicit data filtering mechanism that inherently prioritizes medium-difficulty training samples. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate the OOD generalization of SFT models across training datasets of varying difficulty levels. Our results confirm that data difficulty is a critical factor, revealing that training on hard samples significantly degrades OOD performance. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Difficulty-Curated SFT (DC-SFT), a straightforward method that explicitly filters the training set based on sample difficulty. Experiments show that DC-SFT not only substantially enhances OOD generalization over standard SFT, but also surpasses the performance of RL-based training, all while providing greater stability and computational efficiency. This work offers a data-centric account of the OOD generalization gap in VLMs and establishes a more efficient pathway to achieving robust generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A compact RGB-only network for efficient on-device action recognition, balancing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices demand low latency and resource efficiency; auxiliary modalities are impractical due to added complexity and cost.

Method: Uses X3D-style backbone with Temporal Shift, selective temporal adaptation, and parameter-free attention.

Result: Achieves strong accuracy-efficiency balance on NTU RGB+D benchmarks and practical resource use on Jetson Orin Nano.

Conclusion: Proposed network is efficient for edge deployment, outperforming existing RGB-based techniques.

Abstract: Action recognition on edge devices poses stringent constraints on latency, memory, storage, and power consumption. While auxiliary modalities such as skeleton and depth information can enhance recognition performance, they often require additional sensors or computationally expensive pose-estimation pipelines, limiting practicality for edge use. In this work, we propose a compact RGB-only network tailored for efficient on-device inference. Our approach builds upon an X3D-style backbone augmented with Temporal Shift, and further introduces selective temporal adaptation and parameter-free attention. Extensive experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 benchmarks demonstrate a strong accuracy-efficiency balance. Moreover, deployment-level profiling on the Jetson Orin Nano verifies a smaller on-device footprint and practical resource utilization compared to existing RGB-based action recognition techniques.

### [61] [Flow caching for autoregressive video generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10825)
*Yuexiao Ma,Xuzhe Zheng,Jing Xu,Xiwei Xu,Feng Ling,Xiawu Zheng,Huafeng Kuang,Huixia Li,Xing Wang,Xuefeng Xiao,Fei Chao,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowCache is a caching framework designed for autoregressive video generation, enabling faster synthesis by adapting caching policies per chunk and optimizing KV cache compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for video generation are slow due to sequential chunk processing. Existing caching methods assume uniform denoising, which fails with varying chunk similarities.

Method: FlowCache uses chunkwise caching policies and a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression to dynamically adapt denoising per chunk.

Result: Achieves speedups of 2.38× (MAGI-1) and 6.7× (SkyReels-V2) with minimal quality loss (VBench scores: +0.87, -0.79).

Conclusion: FlowCache enables real-time, ultra-long video generation, setting a new benchmark for efficient autoregressive synthesis.

Abstract: Autoregressive models, often built on Transformer architectures, represent a powerful paradigm for generating ultra-long videos by synthesizing content in sequential chunks. However, this sequential generation process is notoriously slow. While caching strategies have proven effective for accelerating traditional video diffusion models, existing methods assume uniform denoising across all frames-an assumption that breaks down in autoregressive models where different video chunks exhibit varying similarity patterns at identical timesteps. In this paper, we present FlowCache, the first caching framework specifically designed for autoregressive video generation. Our key insight is that each video chunk should maintain independent caching policies, allowing fine-grained control over which chunks require recomputation at each timestep. We introduce a chunkwise caching strategy that dynamically adapts to the unique denoising characteristics of each chunk, complemented by a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression mechanism that maintains fixed memory bounds while preserving generation quality. Our method achieves remarkable speedups of 2.38 times on MAGI-1 and 6.7 times on SkyReels-V2, with negligible quality degradation (VBench: 0.87 increase and 0.79 decrease respectively). These results demonstrate that FlowCache successfully unlocks the potential of autoregressive models for real-time, ultra-long video generation-establishing a new benchmark for efficient video synthesis at scale.

*Lujian Yao,Haitao Zhao,Xianghai Kong,Yuhan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces hyperspectral imaging for smoke segmentation, addressing limitations of visible-light methods with a new dataset (HSSDataset). It proposes a MoP network for adaptive band weighting and validates its effectiveness across hyperspectral and multispectral datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional smoke segmentation methods lack spectral information, struggling with cloud interference and semi-transparent smoke. Hyperspectral imaging offers a solution.

Method: Proposes a MoP network with band split, prototype-based spectral representation, and dual-level router for adaptive band weighting.

Result: Superior performance validated on HSSDataset and MSSDataset (RGB-infrared).

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for spectral-based smoke segmentation.

Abstract: Smoke segmentation is critical for wildfire management and industrial safety applications. Traditional visible-light-based methods face limitations due to insufficient spectral information, particularly struggling with cloud interference and semi-transparent smoke regions. To address these challenges, we introduce hyperspectral imaging for smoke segmentation and present the first hyperspectral smoke segmentation dataset (HSSDataset) with carefully annotated samples collected from over 18,000 frames across 20 real-world scenarios using a Many-to-One annotations protocol. However, different spectral bands exhibit varying discriminative capabilities across spatial regions, necessitating adaptive band weighting strategies. We decompose this into three technical challenges: spectral interaction contamination, limited spectral pattern modeling, and complex weighting router problems. We propose a mixture of prototypes (MoP) network with: (1) Band split for spectral isolation, (2) Prototype-based spectral representation for diverse patterns, and (3) Dual-level router for adaptive spatial-aware band weighting. We further construct a multispectral dataset (MSSDataset) with RGB-infrared images. Extensive experiments validate superior performance across both hyperspectral and multispectral modalities, establishing a new paradigm for spectral-based smoke segmentation.

*Darakshan Rashid,Raza Imam,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Brejesh Lall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stride-Net is a fairness-aware framework for chest X-ray classification that improves fairness metrics without sacrificing accuracy, using learnable masking and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address disparities in deep neural networks' performance across demographic subgroups in chest X-ray classification, ensuring clinical safety and equity.

Method: Uses patch-level learning with a learnable stride-based mask to suppress sensitive attributes and adversarial confusion loss, alongside semantic alignment with BioBERT embeddings via Group Optimal Transport.

Result: Consistently improves fairness metrics while maintaining or exceeding baseline accuracy on MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert benchmarks.

Conclusion: Stride-Net offers a superior accuracy-fairness trade-off compared to prior debiasing methods, enhancing clinical utility.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for chest X-ray classification achieve strong average performance, yet often underperform for specific demographic subgroups, raising critical concerns about clinical safety and equity. Existing debiasing methods frequently yield inconsistent improvements across datasets or attain fairness by degrading overall diagnostic utility, treating fairness as a post hoc constraint rather than a property of the learned representation. In this work, we propose Stride-Net (Sensitive Attribute Resilient Learning via Disentanglement and Learnable Masking with Embedding Alignment), a fairness-aware framework that learns disease-discriminative yet demographically invariant representations for chest X-ray analysis. Stride-Net operates at the patch level, using a learnable stride-based mask to select label-aligned image regions while suppressing sensitive attribute information through adversarial confusion loss. To anchor representations in clinical semantics and discourage shortcut learning, we further enforce semantic alignment between image features and BioBERT-based disease label embeddings via Group Optimal Transport. We evaluate Stride-Net on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert benchmarks across race and intersectional race-gender subgroups. Across architectures including ResNet and Vision Transformers, Stride-Net consistently improves fairness metrics while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy, achieving a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off than prior debiasing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Chart Specification, a structured intermediate representation for high-fidelity chart-to-code generation, outperforming prior methods with efficient data usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with structural fidelity in chart-to-code generation, often producing inconsistent outputs due to surface-level token imitation.

Method: Introduces Chart Specification for semantically grounded supervision, with Spec-Align Reward for fine-grained structural feedback via reinforcement learning.

Result: Outperforms baselines by up to 61.7% with 3K samples and achieves state-of-the-art results with 4K samples.

Conclusion: Precise structural supervision efficiently enhances fidelity in chart-to-code generation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating plotting code from chart images, yet achieving structural fidelity remains challenging. Existing approaches largely rely on supervised fine-tuning, encouraging surface-level token imitation rather than faithful modeling of underlying chart structure, which often leads to hallucinated or semantically inconsistent outputs. We propose Chart Specification, a structured intermediate representation that shifts training from text imitation to semantically grounded supervision. Chart Specification filters syntactic noise to construct a structurally balanced training set and supports a Spec-Align Reward that provides fine-grained, verifiable feedback on structural correctness, enabling reinforcement learning to enforce consistent plotting logic. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches. With only 3K training samples, we achieve strong data efficiency, surpassing leading baselines by up to 61.7% on complex benchmarks, and scaling to 4K samples establishes new state-of-the-art results across all evaluated metrics. Overall, our results demonstrate that precise structural supervision offers an efficient pathway to high-fidelity chart-to-code generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TR-World, a Temporal Residual World Model, focusing on dynamic object modeling for autonomous driving, and FGTR for trajectory refinement, achieving state-of-the-art planning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world models suffer from redundant static region modeling and lack deep interaction with trajectories, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: TR-World calculates temporal residuals to extract dynamic object info without detection/tracking, while FGTR refines trajectories using future BEV features.

Result: TR-World and FGTR enhance planning accuracy, validated on nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed ResWorld framework outperforms existing methods in autonomous driving planning.

Abstract: The comprehensive understanding capabilities of world models for driving scenarios have significantly improved the planning accuracy of end-to-end autonomous driving frameworks. However, the redundant modeling of static regions and the lack of deep interaction with trajectories hinder world models from exerting their full effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Temporal Residual World Model (TR-World), which focuses on dynamic object modeling. By calculating the temporal residuals of scene representations, the information of dynamic objects can be extracted without relying on detection and tracking. TR-World takes only temporal residuals as input, thus predicting the future spatial distribution of dynamic objects more precisely. By combining the prediction with the static object information contained in the current BEV features, accurate future BEV features can be obtained. Furthermore, we propose Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement (FGTR) module, which conducts interaction between prior trajectories (predicted from the current scene representation) and the future BEV features. This module can not only utilize future road conditions to refine trajectories, but also provides sparse spatial-temporal supervision on future BEV features to prevent world model collapse. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets demonstrate that our method, namely ResWorld, achieves state-of-the-art planning performance.

*Guandong Li*

TL;DR: FastUSP is a multi-level optimization framework improving Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP) for large-scale diffusion models, achieving speedups via compile, communication, and operator-level optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing USP implementations for distributed attention computation suffer from inefficiencies like kernel launch overhead and poor computation-communication scheduling, necessitating optimization.

Method: FastUSP integrates compile-level (graph compilation, computation-communication reordering), communication-level (FP8 quantized collective communication), and operator-level (pipelined Ring attention with double buffering) optimizations.

Result: FastUSP achieves 1.12–1.16× speedup on FLUX (12B) and 1.09× on Qwen-Image (2 GPUs), though PyTorch Inductor limits compile optimization scalability beyond 2 GPUs. Kernel launch overhead is identified as the primary bottleneck.

Conclusion: FastUSP effectively addresses USP inefficiencies, demonstrating significant speedups and highlighting kernel launch overhead as a key challenge for modern GPU interconnects.

Abstract: Large-scale diffusion models such as FLUX (12B parameters) and Stable Diffusion 3 (8B parameters) require multi-GPU parallelism for efficient inference. Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP), which combines Ulysses and Ring attention mechanisms, has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for distributed attention computation. However, existing USP implementations suffer from significant inefficiencies including excessive kernel launch overhead and suboptimal computation-communication scheduling. In this paper, we propose \textbf{FastUSP}, a multi-level optimization framework that integrates compile-level optimization (graph compilation with CUDA Graphs and computation-communication reordering), communication-level optimization (FP8 quantized collective communication), and operator-level optimization (pipelined Ring attention with double buffering). We evaluate FastUSP on FLUX (12B) and Qwen-Image models across 2, 4, and 8 NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPUs. On FLUX, FastUSP achieves consistent \textbf{1.12$\times$--1.16$\times$} end-to-end speedup over baseline USP, with compile-level optimization contributing the dominant improvement. On Qwen-Image, FastUSP achieves \textbf{1.09$\times$} speedup on 2 GPUs; on 4--8 GPUs, we identify a PyTorch Inductor compatibility limitation with Ring attention that prevents compile optimization, while baseline USP scales to 1.30$\times$--1.46$\times$ of 2-GPU performance. We further provide a detailed analysis of the performance characteristics of distributed diffusion inference, revealing that kernel launch overhead -- rather than communication latency -- is the primary bottleneck on modern high-bandwidth GPU interconnects.

Conclusion: Advanced deep learning models enhance disease classification, aiding early detection.

Abstract: Guava fruits often suffer from many diseases. This can harm fruit quality and fruit crop yield. Early identification is important for minimizing damage and ensuring fruit health. This study focuses on 3 different categories for classifying diseases. These are Anthracnose, Fruit flies, and Healthy fruit. The data set used in this study is collected from Mendeley Data. This dataset contains 473 original images of Guava. These images vary in size and format. The original dataset was resized to 256x256 pixels with RGB color mode for better consistency.

TL;DR: VFGS-Net is an advanced retinal vessel segmentation framework combining frequency-aware features, dual-path convolution, and spatial state-space modeling, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retinal vessel segmentation is vital for diagnosing vascular diseases, but current methods struggle with fine capillaries and global topology due to vessel morphology and low contrast.

Method: VFGS-Net integrates frequency-domain channel attention, dual-path convolution, and bidirectional Mamba2-based spatial modeling to enhance vessel segmentation.

Result: VFGS-Net excels on four datasets, improving accuracy for fine vessels, complex branching, and low-contrast regions, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: VFGS-Net demonstrates robustness and clinical potential, offering superior retinal vessel segmentation performance.

Abstract: Accurate retinal vessel segmentation is a critical prerequisite for quantitative analysis of retinal images and computer-aided diagnosis of vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. However, the elongated morphology, wide scale variation, and low contrast of retinal vessels pose significant challenges for existing methods, making it difficult to simultaneously preserve fine capillaries and maintain global topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose the Vessel-aware Frequency-domain and Global Spatial modeling Network (VFGS-Net), an end-to-end segmentation framework that seamlessly integrates frequency-aware feature enhancement, dual-path convolutional representation learning, and bidirectional asymmetric spatial state-space modeling within a unified architecture. Specifically, VFGS-Net employs a dual-path feature convolution module to jointly capture fine-grained local textures and multi-scale contextual semantics. A novel vessel-aware frequency-domain channel attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively reweight spectral components, thereby enhancing vessel-relevant responses in high-level features. Furthermore, at the network bottleneck, we propose a bidirectional asymmetric Mamba2-based spatial modeling block to efficiently capture long-range spatial dependencies and strengthen the global continuity of vascular structures. Extensive experiments on four publicly available retinal vessel datasets demonstrate that VFGS-Net achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our model consistently improves segmentation accuracy for fine vessels, complex branching patterns, and low-contrast regions, highlighting its robustness and clinical potential.

Motivation: Current manual inspection methods for ICAO compliance are inefficient; the DFIC dataset aims to enable automated verification with diverse and balanced facial images.

Method: The authors fine-tuned a novel method leveraging spatial attention mechanisms for ICAO compliance validation, tested against state-of-the-art techniques.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches, demonstrating improved accuracy for compliance verification.

Conclusion: DFIC enhances automated compliance methods and can benefit broader facial recognition applications, improving security, privacy, and fairness.

Abstract: Ensuring compliance with ISO/IEC and ICAO standards for facial images in machine-readable travel documents (MRTDs) is essential for reliable identity verification, but current manual inspection methods are inefficient in high-demand environments. This paper introduces the DFIC dataset, a novel comprehensive facial image dataset comprising around 58,000 annotated images and 2706 videos of more than 1000 subjects, that cover a broad range of non-compliant conditions, in addition to compliant portraits. Our dataset provides a more balanced demographic distribution than the existing public datasets, with one partition that is nearly uniformly distributed, facilitating the development of automated ICAO compliance verification methods.
  Using DFIC, we fine-tuned a novel method that heavily relies on spatial attention mechanisms for the automatic validation of ICAO compliance requirements, and we have compared it with the state-of-the-art aimed at ICAO compliance verification, demonstrating improved results. DFIC dataset is now made public (https://github.com/visteam-isr-uc/DFIC) for the training and validation of new models, offering an unprecedented diversity of faces, that will improve both robustness and adaptability to the intrinsically diverse combinations of faces and props that can be presented to the validation system. These results emphasize the potential of DFIC to enhance automated ICAO compliance methods but it can also be used in many other applications that aim to improve the security, privacy, and fairness of facial recognition systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) to Vision Transformers (ViTs), improving interpretability and sparsity while maintaining accuracy on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs lack interpretability and exhibit dense attention patterns. SVDA aims to enhance interpretability, sparsity, and spectral structure.

Method: Adapts SVDA to ViTs, uses interpretability indicators to monitor attention dynamics, and evaluates on four benchmarks.

Result: SVDA yields more interpretable attention patterns without losing accuracy on CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100.

Conclusion: SVDA is a useful tool for analyzing structured attention models, paving the way for explainable AI and attention-based compression.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification, yet their attention mechanisms often remain opaque and exhibit dense, non-structured behaviors. In this work, we adapt our previously proposed SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) mechanism to the ViT architecture, introducing a geometrically grounded formulation that enhances interpretability, sparsity, and spectral structure. We apply the use of interpretability indicators -- originally proposed with SVDA -- to monitor attention dynamics during training and assess structural properties of the learned representations. Experimental evaluations on four widely used benchmarks -- CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 -- demonstrate that SVDA consistently yields more interpretable attention patterns without sacrificing classification accuracy. While the current framework offers descriptive insights rather than prescriptive guidance, our results establish SVDA as a comprehensive and informative tool for analyzing and developing structured attention models in computer vision. This work lays the foundation for future advances in explainable AI, spectral diagnostics, and attention-based model compression.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'chatting with images,' a framework enhancing LVLMs by integrating language-guided visual feature modulation for improved cross-modal alignment and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs lose fine-grained visual details and lack semantic grounding in visual manipulation. The proposed framework aims to address these gaps.

Method: ViLaVT, a dynamic vision encoder, enables joint re-encoding of image regions guided by language prompts, trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: ViLaVT shows significant improvements across eight benchmarks, especially in multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The 'chatting with images' framework effectively bridges linguistic and visual reasoning, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically rely on text-only reasoning based on a single-pass visual encoding, which often leads to loss of fine-grained visual information. Recently the proposal of ''thinking with images'' attempts to alleviate this limitation by manipulating images via external tools or code; however, the resulting visual states are often insufficiently grounded in linguistic semantics, impairing effective cross-modal alignment - particularly when visual semantics or geometric relationships must be reasoned over across distant regions or multiple images. To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaVT achieves strong and consistent improvements, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: PP-DNN enhances AV perception by dynamically selecting critical frames and ROIs, reducing data processing while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of real-time DNN inference in AVs by optimizing data processing without compromising accuracy.

Method: PP-DNN uses an ROI generator, FLOPs predictor, ROI scheduler, and detection predictor to dynamically select and process critical frames and ROIs.

Result: PP-DNN improves fusion frames by 7.3x, reduces delays by >2.6x, and enhances detection completeness by 75.4%.

Conclusion: PP-DNN effectively balances resource constraints and accuracy, making AV perception more predictable and efficient.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on sensors and deep neural networks (DNNs) to perceive their surrounding environment and make maneuver decisions in real time. However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline.

*Vasileios Arampatzakis,George Pavlidis,Nikolaos Mitianoudis,Nikos Papamarkos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVDA introduces spectrally structured attention in DPT for monocular depth estimation, offering interpretable attention maps and spectral indicators without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opacity of self-attention mechanisms in Transformers motivates the need for interpretable attention structures in dense prediction tasks like monocular depth estimation.

Method: SVDA embeds a learnable diagonal matrix into query-key interactions to decouple directional alignment from spectral modulation, creating interpretable attention maps.

Result: SVDA maintains or slightly improves accuracy on KITTI and NYU-v2 datasets with minimal computational overhead, while providing six spectral indicators for analysis.

Conclusion: SVDA enhances interpretability in monocular depth estimation, transforming attention into a quantifiable descriptor and paving the way for transparent dense prediction models.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is a central problem in computer vision with applications in robotics, AR, and autonomous driving, yet the self-attention mechanisms that drive modern Transformer architectures remain opaque. We introduce SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) into the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT), providing the first spectrally structured formulation of attention for dense prediction tasks. SVDA decouples directional alignment from spectral modulation by embedding a learnable diagonal matrix into normalized query-key interactions, enabling attention maps that are intrinsically interpretable rather than post-hoc approximations. Experiments on KITTI and NYU-v2 show that SVDA preserves or slightly improves predictive accuracy while adding only minor computational overhead. More importantly, SVDA unlocks six spectral indicators that quantify entropy, rank, sparsity, alignment, selectivity, and robustness. These reveal consistent cross-dataset and depth-wise patterns in how attention organizes during training, insights that remain inaccessible in standard Transformers. By shifting the role of attention from opaque mechanism to quantifiable descriptor, SVDA redefines interpretability in monocular depth estimation and opens a principled avenue toward transparent dense prediction models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Chain-of-Look, a visual reasoning framework for accurately counting surgical instruments in dense OR scenarios, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate counting of surgical instruments is crucial for patient safety, but current methods struggle in dense, clustered environments.

Method: Chain-of-Look mimics human sequential counting using a structured visual chain and introduces a neighboring loss function for spatial constraints.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and multimodal large language models on the SurgCount-HD dataset.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Look offers a promising solution for dense surgical instrument counting, enhancing accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Accurate counting of surgical instruments in Operating Rooms (OR) is a critical prerequisite for ensuring patient safety during surgery. Despite recent progress of large visual-language models and agentic AI, accurately counting such instruments remains highly challenging, particularly in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. To address this problem, we introduce Chain-of-Look, a novel visual reasoning framework that mimics the sequential human counting process by enforcing a structured visual chain, rather than relying on classic object detection which is unordered. This visual chain guides the model to count along a coherent spatial trajectory, improving accuracy in complex scenes. To further enforce the physical plausibility of the visual chain, we introduce the neighboring loss function, which explicitly models the spatial constraints inherent to densely packed surgical instruments. We also present SurgCount-HD, a new dataset comprising 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for counting (e.g., CountGD, REC) as well as Multimodality Large Language Models (e.g., Qwen, ChatGPT) in the challenging task of dense surgical instrument counting.

TL;DR: PuriLight is a lightweight, efficient framework for self-supervised monocular depth estimation, balancing computational efficiency and detail preservation with novel modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between bulky architectures compromising practicality and lightweight models sacrificing structural precision in self-supervised depth estimation.

Method: Three-stage architecture with Shuffle-Dilation Convolution (SDC), Rotation-Adaptive Kernel Attention (RAKA), and Deep Frequency Signal Purification (DFSP) modules.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameters and exceptional computational efficiency.

Conclusion: PuriLight successfully balances lightweight design and structural precision, demonstrating superior performance in monocular depth estimation.

Abstract: We propose PuriLight, a lightweight and efficient framework for self-supervised monocular depth estimation, to address the dual challenges of computational efficiency and detail preservation. While recent advances in self-supervised depth estimation have reduced reliance on ground truth supervision, existing approaches remain constrained by either bulky architectures compromising practicality or lightweight models sacrificing structural precision. These dual limitations underscore the critical need to develop lightweight yet structurally precise architectures. Our framework addresses these limitations through a three-stage architecture incorporating three novel modules: the Shuffle-Dilation Convolution (SDC) module for local feature extraction, the Rotation-Adaptive Kernel Attention (RAKA) module for hierarchical feature enhancement, and the Deep Frequency Signal Purification (DFSP) module for global feature purification. Through effective collaboration, these modules enable PuriLight to achieve both lightweight and accurate feature extraction and processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuriLight achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal training parameters while maintaining exceptional computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Biometric footstep recognition faces challenges due to limited datasets. The UNB StepUP-P150 dataset and a global competition addressed these, with top results showing promise but also highlighting ongoing issues like footwear generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance biometric footstep recognition by addressing the lack of large, diverse datasets and improving robustness to factors like footwear and walking speed.

Method: The method involved launching a competition where participants developed recognition models using the StepUP-P150 dataset, evaluated on a challenging test set.

Result: The top team achieved an EER of 10.77% using GRM optimization, showcasing progress but also revealing challenges in generalization.

Conclusion: The competition demonstrated promising solutions but underscored the need for further research to improve generalization, particularly for unfamiliar footwear.

Abstract: Biometric footstep recognition, based on a person's unique pressure patterns under their feet during walking, is an emerging field with growing applications in security and safety. However, progress in this area has been limited by the lack of large, diverse datasets necessary to address critical challenges such as generalization to new users and robustness to shifts in factors like footwear or walking speed. The recent release of the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset, the largest and most comprehensive collection of high-resolution footstep pressure recordings to date, opens new opportunities for addressing these challenges through deep learning. To mark this milestone, the First International StepUP Competition for Biometric Footstep Recognition was launched. Competitors were tasked with developing robust recognition models using the StepUP-P150 dataset that were then evaluated on a separate, dedicated test set designed to assess verification performance under challenging variations, given limited and relatively homogeneous reference data. The competition attracted global participation, with 23 registered teams from academia and industry. The top-performing team, Saeid_UCC, achieved the best equal error rate (EER) of 10.77% using a generative reward machine (GRM) optimization strategy. Overall, the competition showcased strong solutions, but persistent challenges in generalizing to unfamiliar footwear highlight a critical area for future work.

*Divya Jyoti Bajpai,Dhruv Bhardwaj,Soumya Roy,Tejas Duseja,Harsh Agarwal,Aashay Sandansing,Manjesh Kumar Hanawal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastFlow is a plug-and-play adaptive inference framework that accelerates flow-matching models by skipping unnecessary denoising steps and approximating minor adjustments, achieving a 2.6x speedup without retraining or sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing acceleration methods for flow-matching models are static, require retraining, and lack task generality. FastFlow aims to overcome these limitations by dynamically adapting the denoising process.

Method: FastFlow identifies and approximates minor denoising adjustments using finite-difference velocity estimates from prior predictions. It models step-skipping as a multi-armed bandit problem to balance speed and performance.

Result: Experiments show FastFlow achieves a 2.6x speedup while maintaining output quality across image generation, video generation, and editing tasks.

Conclusion: FastFlow offers a flexible, efficient solution for accelerating flow-matching models without retraining or compromising quality, generalizing well across tasks.

Abstract: Flow-matching models deliver state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video generation, but the inherent sequential denoising process renders them slower. Existing acceleration methods like distillation, trajectory truncation, and consistency approaches are static, require retraining, and often fail to generalize across tasks. We propose FastFlow, a plug-and-play adaptive inference framework that accelerates generation in flow matching models. FastFlow identifies denoising steps that produce only minor adjustments to the denoising path and approximates them without using the full neural network models used for velocity predictions. The approximation utilizes finite-difference velocity estimates from prior predictions to efficiently extrapolate future states, enabling faster advancements along the denoising path at zero compute cost. This enables skipping computation at intermediary steps. We model the decision of how many steps to safely skip before requiring a full model computation as a multi-armed bandit problem. The bandit learns the optimal skips to balance speed with performance. FastFlow integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines and generalizes across image generation, video generation, and editing tasks. Experiments demonstrate a speedup of over 2.6x while maintaining high-quality outputs. The source code for this work can be found at https://github.com/Div290/FastFlow.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HairWeaver is a diffusion-based pipeline for animating single human images with realistic hair dynamics, using specialized modules to overcome limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack control over hair motion, resulting in stiff animations.

Method: Uses Motion-Context-LoRA and Sim2Real-Domain-LoRA modules with a video diffusion backbone, trained on CG-generated dynamic human motion data.

Result: Achieves fine control over hair motion and produces highly realistic animations.

Conclusion: Sets a new state of the art for lifelike human hair animations.

Abstract: We present HairWeaver, a diffusion-based pipeline that animates a single human image with realistic and expressive hair dynamics. While existing methods successfully control body pose, they lack specific control over hair, and as a result, fail to capture the intricate hair motions, resulting in stiff and unrealistic animations. HairWeaver overcomes this limitation using two specialized modules: a Motion-Context-LoRA to integrate motion conditions and a Sim2Real-Domain-LoRA to preserve the subject's photoreal appearance across different data domains. These lightweight components are designed to guide a video diffusion backbone while maintaining its core generative capabilities. By training on a specialized dataset of dynamic human motion generated from a CG simulator, HairWeaver affords fine control over hair motion and ultimately learns to produce highly realistic hair that responds naturally to movement. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach sets a new state of the art, producing lifelike human hair animations with dynamic details.

*Tianyi Xiong,Shihao Wang,Guilin Liu,Yi Dong,Ming Li,Heng Huang,Jan Kautz,Zhiding Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhyCritic is a multimodal critic model for physical AI tasks, using a two-stage RLVR pipeline to improve perception and reasoning, outperforming baselines in both physical and general benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing critics are mainly for general visual tasks, leaving physical AI tasks (perception, causal reasoning, planning) underexplored. PhyCritic addresses this gap.

Method: A two-stage RLVR pipeline: 1) Physical skill warmup for perception and reasoning, 2) Self-referential critic finetuning, where the model generates internal references before judging responses.

Result: PhyCritic outperforms open-source baselines in physical and general benchmarks and enhances perception and reasoning in physical tasks when used as a policy model.

Conclusion: PhyCritic effectively bridges the gap in physical AI evaluation, providing stable and correct judgments while improving task performance.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large multimodal models, reliable judge and critic models have become essential for open-ended evaluation and preference alignment, providing pairwise preferences, numerical scores, and explanatory justifications for assessing model-generated responses. However, existing critics are primarily trained in general visual domains such as captioning or image question answering, leaving physical AI tasks involving perception, causal reasoning, and planning largely underexplored. We introduce PhyCritic, a multimodal critic model optimized for physical AI through a two-stage RLVR pipeline: a physical skill warmup stage that enhances physically oriented perception and reasoning, followed by self-referential critic finetuning, where the critic generates its own prediction as an internal reference before judging candidate responses, improving judgment stability and physical correctness. Across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks, PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines and, when applied as a policy model, further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiNa-LRM is a diffusion-native latent reward model designed for efficient preference optimization in diffusion models, outperforming existing methods with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on computationally expensive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and suffer from domain mismatch issues when optimizing through pixel-space rewards.

Method: DiNa-LRM introduces a noise-calibrated Thurstone likelihood for preference learning on noisy diffusion states, using a pretrained latent diffusion backbone with a timestep-conditioned reward head.

Result: DiNa-LRM outperforms existing baselines and matches state-of-the-art VLM performance at lower computational costs, improving preference optimization dynamics.

Conclusion: DiNa-LRM offers a robust, efficient solution for preference optimization in diffusion models, addressing computational and domain mismatch challenges.

Abstract: Preference optimization for diffusion and flow-matching models relies on reward functions that are both discriminatively robust and computationally efficient. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as the primary reward provider, leveraging their rich multimodal priors to guide alignment. However, their computation and memory cost can be substantial, and optimizing a latent diffusion generator through a pixel-space reward introduces a domain mismatch that complicates alignment. In this paper, we propose DiNa-LRM, a diffusion-native latent reward model that formulates preference learning directly on noisy diffusion states. Our method introduces a noise-calibrated Thurstone likelihood with diffusion-noise-dependent uncertainty. DiNa-LRM leverages a pretrained latent diffusion backbone with a timestep-conditioned reward head, and supports inference-time noise ensembling, providing a diffusion-native mechanism for test-time scaling and robust rewarding. Across image alignment benchmarks, DiNa-LRM substantially outperforms existing diffusion-based reward baselines and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art VLMs at a fraction of the computational cost. In preference optimization, we demonstrate that DiNa-LRM improves preference optimization dynamics, enabling faster and more resource-efficient model alignment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interfacial dynamics in two-phase flows are critical for momentum, heat, and mass transfer but challenging to measure experimentally due to limitations near moving interfaces.

Method: SurfPhase integrates dynamic Gaussian surfels with a signed distance function for geometric consistency and uses a video diffusion model to synthesize novel-view videos for refining reconstructions from sparse observations.

Result: Evaluated on high-speed pool boiling videos, SurfPhase achieves high-quality view synthesis and velocity estimation from just two camera views.

Conclusion: SurfPhase addresses the limitations of existing methods in handling sharp, deformable liquid-vapor interfaces, offering a robust solution for measuring interfacial dynamics.

Abstract: Interfacial dynamics in two-phase flows govern momentum, heat, and mass transfer, yet remain difficult to measure experimentally. Classical techniques face intrinsic limitations near moving interfaces, while existing neural rendering methods target single-phase flows with diffuse boundaries and cannot handle sharp, deformable liquid-vapor interfaces. We propose SurfPhase, a novel model for reconstructing 3D interfacial dynamics from sparse camera views. Our approach integrates dynamic Gaussian surfels with a signed distance function formulation for geometric consistency, and leverages a video diffusion model to synthesize novel-view videos to refine reconstruction from sparse observations. We evaluate on a new dataset of high-speed pool boiling videos, demonstrating high-quality view synthesis and velocity estimation from only two camera views.

TL;DR: ECHWR improves handwriting recognition accuracy on edge devices by enhancing feature representation during training without adding inference costs, achieving significant error rate reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance privacy and reduce latency by enabling handwriting recognition on edge devices with memory constraints.

Method: Proposes ECHWR, a training framework using a temporary auxiliary branch with dual contrastive objectives (in-batch and error-based losses) to align sensor signals with text embeddings.

Result: Reduces character error rates by 7.4% (writer-independent) and 10.4% (writer-dependent) on the OnHW-Words500 dataset compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Error-based contrastive loss effectively handles unseen writing styles, though specific challenges may require tailored configurations.

Abstract: Online handwriting recognition using inertial measurement units opens up handwriting on paper as input for digital devices. Doing it on edge hardware improves privacy and lowers latency, but entails memory constraints. To address this, we propose Error-enhanced Contrastive Handwriting Recognition (ECHWR), a training framework designed to improve feature representation and recognition accuracy without increasing inference costs. ECHWR utilizes a temporary auxiliary branch that aligns sensor signals with semantic text embeddings during the training phase. This alignment is maintained through a dual contrastive objective: an in-batch contrastive loss for general modality alignment and a novel error-based contrastive loss that distinguishes between correct signals and synthetic hard negatives. The auxiliary branch is discarded after training, which allows the deployed model to keep its original, efficient architecture. Evaluations on the OnHW-Words500 dataset show that ECHWR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing character error rates by up to 7.4% on the writer-independent split and 10.4% on the writer-dependent split. Finally, although our ablation studies indicate that solving specific challenges require specific architectural and objective configurations, error-based contrastive loss shows its effectiveness for handling unseen writing styles.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-driven framework to detect and improve lazy thinking in peer reviews by decomposing reviews, identifying issues, and generating targeted feedback, outperforming baselines and enhancing review quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliance on lazy thinking in peer reviews lowers scientific quality, and existing methods lack guideline-aware feedback for actionable improvements.

Method: A framework decomposing reviews into argumentative segments, identifying issues using a neurosymbolic module (combining LLM features with classifiers), and generating feedback via issue-specific templates refined by a genetic algorithm.

Result: The method outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines and improves review quality by up to 92.4%. The dataset LazyReviewPlus (1,309 sentences) is released.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses lazy thinking in peer reviews by providing actionable feedback, significantly enhancing review quality.

Abstract: Peer review is central to scientific quality, yet reliance on simple heuristics -- lazy thinking -- has lowered standards. Prior work treats lazy thinking detection as a single-label task, but review segments may exhibit multiple issues, including broader clarity problems, or specificity issues. Turning detection into actionable improvements requires guideline-aware feedback, which is currently missing. We introduce an LLM-driven framework that decomposes reviews into argumentative segments, identifies issues via a neurosymbolic module combining LLM features with traditional classifiers, and generates targeted feedback using issue-specific templates refined by a genetic algorithm. Experiments show our method outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines and improves review quality by up to 92.4\%. We also release LazyReviewPlus, a dataset of 1,309 sentences labeled for lazy thinking and specificity.

*Weihao Liu,Dehai Min,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LT-Tuning proposes a framework for reasoning in continuous latent space, addressing issues like feature collapse and instability by leveraging contextual hidden states and predictive semantic guidance, outperforming existing latent reasoning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent reasoning paradigms suffer from feature collapse and instability due to distribution mismatches and alignment issues, prompting the need for a more robust framework.

Method: LT-Tuning introduces a Context-Prediction-Fusion mechanism and a progressive three-stage curriculum learning pipeline to dynamically switch between latent and explicit reasoning modes.

Result: The method outperforms existing latent reasoning baselines, mitigating feature collapse and achieving robust reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: LT-Tuning effectively redefines latent reasoning by combining contextual and predictive elements, offering a flexible and stable alternative to explicit CoT.

Abstract: While explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) equips Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities, it requires models to verbalize every intermediate step in text tokens, constraining the model thoughts to the discrete vocabulary space. Recently, reasoning in continuous latent space has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling more robust inference and flexible computation beyond discrete token constraints. However, current latent paradigms often suffer from feature collapse and instability, stemming from distribution mismatches when recurrently using hidden states as the input embeddings, or alignment issues when relying on assistant models. To address this, we propose Latent Thoughts Tuning (LT-Tuning), a framework that redefines how latent thoughts are constructed and deployed. Instead of relying solely on raw hidden states, our method introduces a Context-Prediction-Fusion mechanism that jointly leveraging contextual hidden states and predictive semantic guidance from the vocabulary embedding space. Combined with a progressive three-stage curriculum learning pipeline, LT-Tuning also enables dynamically switching between latent and explicit thinking modes. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing latent reasoning baselines, effectively mitigating feature collapse and achieving robust reasoning accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces KV Policy (KVP), a reinforcement learning framework for efficient KV cache eviction in LLMs, outperforming heuristic-based methods and generalizing well across tasks and contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the memory inefficiency of autoregressive KV caches in LLMs, which current heuristic-based methods handle suboptimally.

Method: Proposes KVP, lightweight RL agents trained on pre-computed traces to rank tokens by future utility without modifying the LLM.

Result: KVP outperforms baselines on benchmarks (RULER, OASST2-4k) and shows strong zero-shot generalization (LongBench, BOOLQ, ARC).

Conclusion: Learning future token utility via RL is scalable and effective for adaptive KV cache management.

Abstract: The growing size of Large Language Models (LLMs) makes efficient inference challenging, primarily due to the memory demands of the autoregressive Key-Value (KV) cache. Existing eviction or compression methods reduce cost but rely on heuristics, such as recency or past attention scores, which serve only as indirect proxies for a token's future utility and introduce computational overhead. We reframe KV cache eviction as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem: learning to rank tokens by their predicted usefulness for future decoding. To this end, we introduce KV Policy (KVP), a framework of lightweight per-head RL agents trained on pre-computed generation traces using only key and value vectors. Each agent learns a specialized eviction policy guided by future utility, which evaluates the quality of the ranking across all cache budgets, requiring no modifications to the underlying LLM or additional inference. Evaluated across two different model families on the long-context benchmark RULER and the multi-turn dialogue benchmark OASST2-4k, KVP significantly outperforms baselines. Furthermore, zero-shot tests on standard downstream tasks (e.g., LongBench, BOOLQ, ARC) indicate that KVP generalizes well beyond its training distribution and to longer context lengths. These results demonstrate that learning to predict future token utility is a powerful and scalable paradigm for adaptive KV cache management.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores if language models (LMs) use shared mechanisms for Theory of Mind (ToM) and pragmatic reasoning, suggesting they may develop integrated 'social world models'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LMs develop emergent social cognition, specifically interconnected representations of mental states across tasks.

Method: Behavioral evaluations and causal-mechanistic experiments using functional localization methods on a large dataset of ToM abilities.

Result: Findings suggest LMs may form interconnected 'social world models', supporting the functional integration hypothesis.

Conclusion: The study provides new ToM data, refined localization methods, and insights into social cognition emergence in LMs.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether LMs recruit shared computational mechanisms for general Theory of Mind (ToM) and language-specific pragmatic reasoning in order to contribute to the general question of whether LMs may be said to have emergent "social world models", i.e., representations of mental states that are repurposed across tasks (the functional integration hypothesis). Using behavioral evaluations and causal-mechanistic experiments via functional localization methods inspired by cognitive neuroscience, we analyze LMs' performance across seven subcategories of ToM abilities (Beaudoin et al., 2020) on a substantially larger localizer dataset than used in prior like-minded work. Results from stringent hypothesis-driven statistical testing offer suggestive evidence for the functional integration hypothesis, indicating that LMs may develop interconnected "social world models" rather than isolated competencies. This work contributes novel ToM localizer data, methodological refinements to functional localization techniques, and empirical insights into the emergence of social cognition in artificial systems.

### [88] [Are More Tokens Rational? Inference-Time Scaling in Language Models as Adaptive Resource Rationality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10329)
*Zhimin Hu,Riya Roshan,Sashank Varma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores whether resource rationality emerges in large language models through inference-time scaling without explicit cost-based rewards. It finds that models adjust reasoning strategies based on task complexity, with LRMs outperforming IT models on certain logical functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand if resource rationality arises naturally from inference-time scaling in large language models, independent of explicit computational cost rewards.

Method: Researchers introduced a Variable Attribution Task, varying task complexity by adjusting candidate variables and trials. They compared instruction-tuned (IT) models and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) under these conditions.

Result: Both models shifted from brute-force to analytic strategies as complexity increased. IT models struggled with XOR and XNOR functions, while LRMs remained robust, indicating adaptive reasoning behavior.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that resource rationality emerges inherently from inference-time scaling, even without explicit cost-based rewards, highlighting its role in adaptive reasoning strategies.

Abstract: Human reasoning is shaped by resource rationality -- optimizing performance under constraints. Recently, inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve the reasoning performance of Large Language Models by expanding test-time computation. Specifically, instruction-tuned (IT) models explicitly generate long reasoning steps during inference, whereas Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are trained by reinforcement learning to discover reasoning paths that maximize accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether resource-rationality can emerge from such scaling without explicit reward related to computational costs. We introduce a Variable Attribution Task in which models infer which variables determine outcomes given candidate variables, input-output trials, and predefined logical functions. By varying the number of candidate variables and trials, we systematically manipulate task complexity. Both models exhibit a transition from brute-force to analytic strategies as complexity increases. IT models degrade on XOR and XNOR functions, whereas LRMs remain robust. These findings suggest that models can adjust their reasoning behavior in response to task complexity, even without explicit cost-based reward. It provides compelling evidence that resource rationality is an emergent property of inference-time scaling itself.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A study analyzes traffic-stop interactions using body-worn camera footage, focusing on respect ratings from diverse community perspectives to improve understanding and trust-building in policing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Respect in police-civilian interactions is subjective and varies by community, impacting public trust. This study aims to capture diverse perspectives systematically.

Method: The study uses LA Police BWC footage, annotates respect ratings/rationales from police-affiliated, justice-impacted, and non-affiliated residents, and develops a rubric-driven framework for perspective-aware modeling.

Result: The approach improves rating prediction and rationale alignment across annotator groups, aiding law enforcement in understanding community expectations.

Conclusion: The perspective-aware framework enhances procedural legitimacy and public trust by accounting for diverse interpretations of respect.

Abstract: Traffic stops are among the most frequent police-civilian interactions, and body-worn cameras (BWCs) provide a unique record of how these encounters unfold. Respect is a central dimension of these interactions, shaping public trust and perceived legitimacy, yet its interpretation is inherently subjective and shaped by lived experience, rendering community-specific perspectives a critical consideration. Leveraging unprecedented access to Los Angeles Police Department BWC footage, we introduce the first large-scale traffic-stop dataset annotated with respect ratings and free-text rationales from multiple perspectives. By sampling annotators from police-affiliated, justice-system-impacted, and non-affiliated Los Angeles residents, we enable the systematic study of perceptual differences across diverse communities. To this end, we (i) develop a domain-specific evaluation rubric grounded in procedural justice theory, LAPD training materials, and extensive fieldwork; (ii) introduce a rubric-driven preference data construction framework for perspective-consistent alignment; and (iii) propose a perspective-aware modeling framework that predicts personalized respect ratings and generates annotator-specific rationales for both officers and civilian drivers from traffic-stop transcripts. Across all three annotator groups, our approach improves both rating prediction performance and rationale alignment. Our perspective-aware framework enables law enforcement to better understand diverse community expectations, providing a vital tool for building public trust and procedural legitimacy.

*Domenico De Cristofaro,Alessandro Vietti,Marianne Pouplier,Aleese Block*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Intermediate layers in multilingual speech models encode more phonetically accurate representations than final layers. Truncating upper layers improves PER, with best results two layers before the end. Early-layer probing is useful for ASR diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how phoneme-level predictions evolve across encoder layers in multilingual speech models, especially for low-resource languages like Campidanese Sardinian.

Method: Layer-wise decoding strategy applied to pretrained Wav2Vec2 model, analyzing phoneme predictions and alignment across layers.

Result: Best PER achieved two layers before the final layer; intermediate layers preserve segmental identity better and reduce certain errors. Regressive errors identified where correct intermediate predictions are overwritten by final-layer errors.

Conclusion: Early-layer probing is a valuable diagnostic tool for ASR models, particularly in low-resource settings, as it captures linguistically meaningful behavior missed by surface-level metrics.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that intermediate layers in multilingual speech models often encode more phonetically accurate representations than the final output layer. In this work, we apply a layer-wise decoding strategy to a pretrained Wav2Vec2 model to investigate how phoneme-level predictions evolve across encoder layers, focusing on Campidanese Sardinian, a low-resource language. We show that truncating upper transformer layers leads to improved Phoneme Error Rates (PER), with the best performance achieved not at the final layer, but two layers earlier. Through fine-grained alignment analysis, we find that intermediate predictions better preserve segmental identity, avoid overgeneration, and reduce certain classes of phonological errors. We also introduce the notion of regressive errors, cases where correct predictions at intermediate layers are overwritten by errors at the final layer. These regressions highlight the limitations of surface-level error metrics and reveal how deeper layers may generalize or abstract away from acoustic detail. Our findings support the use of early-layer probing as a diagnostic tool for ASR models, particularly in low-resource settings where standard evaluation metrics may fail to capture linguistically meaningful behavior.

*Keenan Pepper,Alex McKenzie,Florin Pop,Stijn Servaes,Martin Leitgab,Mike Vaiana,Judd Rosenblatt,Michael S. A. Graziano,Diogo de Lucena*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Training lightweight adapters on interpretability artifacts enables reliable self-interpretation in language models without modifying the original model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-interpretation methods are unreliable due to hyperparameter sensitivity, prompting the need for a more robust approach.

Method: The study trains scalar affine adapters (with minimal parameters) on interpretability artifacts while keeping the language model frozen.

Result: Adapters outperform baselines in feature labeling (71% vs 63%), topic identification (94% recall@1), and uncovering implicit reasoning.

Conclusion: Self-interpretation improves with model scale, and simple adapters generalize better, offering a scalable and effective solution.

Abstract: Self-interpretation methods prompt language models to describe their own internal states, but remain unreliable due to hyperparameter sensitivity. We show that training lightweight adapters on interpretability artifacts, while keeping the LM entirely frozen, yields reliable self-interpretation across tasks and model families. A scalar affine adapter with just $d_\text{model}+1$ parameters suffices: trained adapters generate sparse autoencoder feature labels that outperform the training labels themselves (71% vs 63% generation scoring at 70B scale), identify topics with 94% recall@1 versus 1% for untrained baselines, and decode bridge entities in multi-hop reasoning that appear in neither prompt nor response, surfacing implicit reasoning without chain-of-thought. The learned bias vector alone accounts for 85% of improvement, and simpler adapters generalize better than more expressive alternatives. Controlling for model knowledge via prompted descriptions, we find self-interpretation gains outpace capability gains from 7B to 72B parameters. Our results demonstrate that self-interpretation improves with scale, without modifying the model being interpreted.

*Mashrekur Rahman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the interpretability of Google AlphaEarth's satellite embeddings against 26 environmental variables, showing strong correlations and robustness. It also introduces a Land Surface Intelligence system for translating natural language queries into actionable satellite-based assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited understanding of satellite foundation model embeddings' physical interpretability and their potential integration into environmental decision systems.

Method: Combined linear, nonlinear, and attention-based methods to analyze embeddings against environmental variables. Developed a Land Surface Intelligence system using retrieval-augmented generation.

Result: Embeddings mapped strongly to specific land properties (e.g., temperature, elevation with R² ≈ 0.97). The system achieved high scores (μ= 3.74 on a 1–5 scale) for grounding and coherence.

Conclusion: Satellite foundation model embeddings are physically structured and can be effectively used for environmental and geospatial intelligence.

Abstract: Satellite foundation models produce dense embeddings whose physical interpretability remains poorly understood, limiting their integration into environmental decision systems. Using 12.1 million samples across the Continental United States (2017--2023), we first present a comprehensive interpretability analysis of Google AlphaEarth's 64-dimensional embeddings against 26 environmental variables spanning climate, vegetation, hydrology, temperature, and terrain. Combining linear, nonlinear, and attention-based methods, we show that individual embedding dimensions map onto specific land surface properties, while the full embedding space reconstructs most environmental variables with high fidelity (12 of 26 variables exceed $R^2 > 0.90$; temperature and elevation approach $R^2 = 0.97$). The strongest dimension-variable relationships converge across all three analytical methods and remain robust under spatial block cross-validation (mean $ΔR^2 = 0.017$) and temporally stable across all seven study years (mean inter-year correlation $r = 0.963$). Building on these validated interpretations, we then developed a Land Surface Intelligence system that implements retrieval-augmented generation over a FAISS-indexed embedding database of 12.1 million vectors, translating natural language environmental queries into satellite-grounded assessments. An LLM-as-Judge evaluation across 360 query--response cycles, using four LLMs in rotating generator, system, and judge roles, achieved weighted scores of $μ= 3.74 \pm 0.77$ (scale 1--5), with grounding ($μ= 3.93$) and coherence ($μ= 4.25$) as the strongest criteria. Our results demonstrate that satellite foundation model embeddings are physically structured representations that can be operationalized for environmental and geospatial intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACuRL is an Autonomous Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that enables continual learning for computer-use agents (CUAs) without human data. It uses environment exploration and iterative task synthesis, achieving 4-22% performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of continual learning in dynamic environments without costly human annotations.

Method: Introduces ACuRL, which explores environments for initial experiences and iteratively synthesizes tasks using feedback. Includes CUAJudge, an automatic evaluator with 93% human-judgment agreement.

Result: Achieves 4-22% performance gains in intra- and cross-environment learning, with sparse updates (e.g., 20% parameters) preventing catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: ACuRL successfully enables robust and efficient continual learning for CUAs, validated by empirical results and sparse parameter updates.

Abstract: Real-world digital environments are highly diverse and dynamic. These characteristics cause agents to frequently encounter unseen scenarios and distribution shifts, making continual learning in specific environments essential for computer-use agents (CUAs). However, a key challenge lies in obtaining high-quality and environment-grounded agent data without relying on costly human annotation. In this work, we introduce ACuRL, an Autonomous Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that continually adapts agents to specific environments with zero human data. The agent first explores target environments to acquire initial experiences. During subsequent iterative training, a curriculum task generator leverages these experiences together with feedback from the previous iteration to synthesize new tasks tailored for the agent's current capabilities. To provide reliable reward signals, we introduce CUAJudge, a robust automatic evaluator for CUAs that achieves 93% agreement with human judgments. Empirically, our method effectively enables both intra-environment and cross-environment continual learning, yielding 4-22% performance gains without catastrophic forgetting on existing environments. Further analyses show highly sparse updates (e.g., 20% parameters), which helps explain the effective and robust adaptation.

*Mahmud Elahi Akhter,Federico Ruggeri,Iman Munire Bilal,Rob Procter,Maria Liakata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Decomposing complex claims improves verification only with granular, aligned evidence, while repeated claim-level evidence often degrades performance. Noisy sub-claim labels require conservative handling to reduce error propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistent empirical results in structured claim decomposition by identifying overlooked bottlenecks: evidence alignment and sub-claim error profiles.

Method: Introduces a new dataset with temporally bounded evidence and human-annotated sub-claim spans. Evaluates decomposition under two setups: Sub-claim Aligned Evidence (SAE) and Repeated Claim-level Evidence (SRE).

Result: Decomposition improves performance only with granular, aligned evidence (SAE). SRE degrades performance across datasets. Conservative handling of noisy labels reduces error propagation.

Conclusion: Future claim decomposition frameworks must prioritize precise evidence synthesis and calibrate label bias in sub-claim verification models.

Abstract: Structured claim decomposition is often proposed as a solution for verifying complex, multi-faceted claims, yet empirical results have been inconsistent. We argue that these inconsistencies stem from two overlooked bottlenecks: evidence alignment and sub-claim error profiles. To better understand these factors, we introduce a new dataset of real-world complex claims, featuring temporally bounded evidence and human-annotated sub-claim evidence spans. We evaluate decomposition under two evidence alignment setups: Sub-claim Aligned Evidence (SAE) and Repeated Claim-level Evidence (SRE). Our results reveal that decomposition brings significant performance improvement only when evidence is granular and strictly aligned. By contrast, standard setups that rely on repeated claim-level evidence (SRE) fail to improve and often degrade performance as shown across different datasets and domains (PHEMEPlus, MMM-Fact, COVID-Fact). Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the presence of noisy sub-claim labels, the nature of the error ends up determining downstream robustness. We find that conservative "abstention" significantly reduces error propagation compared to aggressive but incorrect predictions. These findings suggest that future claim decomposition frameworks must prioritize precise evidence synthesis and calibrate the label bias of sub-claim verification models.

*Théo Lasnier,Wissam Antoun,Francis Kulumba,Djamé Seddah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how backdoor triggers in LLMs co-opt existing language components, aiding defense strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms of backdoor attacks in LLMs, particularly how triggers operate by leveraging existing language components.

Method: Mechanistic analysis using activation patching on the GAPperon model family to localize trigger formation and identify attention heads processing triggers.

Result: Trigger-activated heads overlap with heads encoding output language (Jaccard indices 0.18-0.66), showing triggers co-opt existing language circuits.

Conclusion: Backdoor defense can focus on monitoring known functional components and leveraging the entanglement between triggers and natural behaviors.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose significant security risks for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the internal mechanisms by which triggers operate remain poorly understood. We present the first mechanistic analysis of language-switching backdoors, studying the GAPperon model family (1B, 8B, 24B parameters) which contains triggers injected during pretraining that cause output language switching. Using activation patching, we localize trigger formation to early layers (7.5-25% of model depth) and identify which attention heads process trigger information. Our central finding is that trigger-activated heads substantially overlap with heads naturally encoding output language across model scales, with Jaccard indices between 0.18 and 0.66 over the top heads identified. This suggests that backdoor triggers do not form isolated circuits but instead co-opt the model's existing language components. These findings have implications for backdoor defense: detection methods may benefit from monitoring known functional components rather than searching for hidden circuits, and mitigation strategies could potentially leverage this entanglement between injected and natural behaviors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on general tasks but lack reliability in specialized non-English domains like finance. The paper introduces Multimodal Finance Eval, a benchmark for French financial documents, revealing VLMs struggle with charts and multi-turn dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliability of VLMs in specialized, non-English domains like finance is underexplored, despite real-world consequences of errors. Finance documents combine dense text, tables, and charts, making them a challenging testbed.

Method: The paper introduces Multimodal Finance Eval, a dataset with 1,204 expert-validated questions from financial documents. It evaluates six open-weight VLMs using an LLM-as-judge protocol.

Result: VLMs achieve 85-90% accuracy on text and table tasks but drop to 34-62% on chart interpretation. Multi-turn dialogue accuracy falls to ~50%, showing error propagation.

Conclusion: Current VLMs excel at extraction tasks but are brittle in interactive financial analysis. Multimodal Finance Eval provides a benchmark to drive progress in this high-stakes domain.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on many document understanding tasks, yet their reliability in specialized, non-English domains remains underexplored. This gap is especially critical in finance, where documents mix dense regulatory text, numerical tables, and visual charts, and where extraction errors can have real-world consequences. We introduce Multimodal Finance Eval, the first multimodal benchmark for evaluating French financial document understanding. The dataset contains 1,204 expert-validated questions spanning text extraction, table comprehension, chart interpretation, and multi-turn conversational reasoning, drawn from real investment prospectuses, KIDs, and PRIIPs. We evaluate six open-weight VLMs (8B-124B parameters) using an LLM-as-judge protocol. While models achieve strong performance on text and table tasks (85-90% accuracy), they struggle with chart interpretation (34-62%). Most notably, multi-turn dialogue reveals a sharp failure mode: early mistakes propagate across turns, driving accuracy down to roughly 50% regardless of model size.
  These results show that current VLMs are effective for well-defined extraction tasks but remain brittle in interactive, multi-step financial analysis. Multimodal Finance Eval offers a challenging benchmark to measure and drive progress in this high-stakes setting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Feature Activation Coverage (FAC) to measure data diversity and FAC Synthesis for generating diverse synthetic data, improving LLM downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diversity metrics for post-training LLM data rely on weak text-based signals, lacking task-relevant feature insights.

Method: Proposes FAC for interpretable diversity measurement and FAC Synthesis to generate data filling missing feature gaps using sparse autoencoders.

Result: FAC Synthesis boosts diversity and performance across tasks (e.g., instruction following, toxicity detection) and enables cross-model feature space transfer.

Conclusion: The work offers a practical, data-centric approach for optimizing LLM performance through diversity-focused synthetic data generation.

Abstract: The diversity of post-training data is critical for effective downstream performance in large language models (LLMs). Many existing approaches to constructing post-training data quantify diversity using text-based metrics that capture linguistic variation, but such metrics provide only weak signals for the task-relevant features that determine downstream performance. In this work, we introduce Feature Activation Coverage (FAC) which measures data diversity in an interpretable feature space. Building upon this metric, we further propose a diversity-driven data synthesis framework, named FAC Synthesis, that first uses a sparse autoencoder to identify missing features from a seed dataset, and then generates synthetic samples that explicitly reflect these features. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves both data diversity and downstream performance on various tasks, including instruction following, toxicity detection, reward modeling, and behavior steering. Interestingly, we identify a shared, interpretable feature space across model families (i.e., LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen), enabling cross-model knowledge transfer. Our work provides a solid and practical methodology for exploring data-centric optimization of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand when people are anxious and how different linguistic focuses (past, present, future, pronouns) relate to anxiety, providing insights into human behavior and mental states.

Method: The researchers used a lexicon of word-anxiety associations to analyze large datasets of US and Canadian tweets, examining patterns tied to time of day, day of the week, verb tenses, and pronoun usage.

Result: Key findings include: anxiety peaks at 8am and drops by noon, is lowest on weekends, highest in past tense sentences, and varies with pronoun usage (higher with 3rd person and subject pronouns).

Conclusion: The study highlights systematic patterns in anxiety expression on social media, linking them to biological rhythms and linguistic contexts, offering insights into how different focuses relate to anxiety.

Abstract: In this short paper, we make use of a recently created lexicon of word-anxiety associations to analyze large amounts of US and Canadian social media data (tweets) to explore *when* we are anxious and what insights that reveals about us. We show that our levels of anxiety on social media exhibit systematic patterns of rise and fall during the day -- highest at 8am (in-line with when we have high cortisol levels in the body) and lowest around noon. Anxiety is lowest on weekends and highest mid-week. We also examine anxiety in past, present, and future tense sentences to show that anxiety is highest in past tense and lowest in future tense. Finally, we examine the use of anxiety and calmness words in posts that contain pronouns to show: more anxiety in 3rd person pronouns (he, they) posts than 1st and 2nd person pronouns and higher anxiety in posts with subject pronouns (I, he, she, they) than object pronouns (me, him, her, them). Overall, these trends provide valuable insights on not just when we are anxious, but also how different types of focus (future, past, self, outward, etc.) are related to anxiety.

TL;DR: A hybrid framework, NeSyS, combines large language models (LLMs) and symbolic world models (WMs) to enhance expressivity and robustness by alternating training and constraining outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the hallucination issues of LLMs and the limited expressivity of symbolic WMs in deterministic environments.

Method: Integrates LLMs' probabilistic priors with symbolic rules, alternates training on inadequately explained trajectories, and directly modifies LLM output probabilities.

Result: Achieves better prediction accuracy and data efficiency than baselines in interactive environments like ScienceWorld, Webshop, and Plancraft.

Conclusion: NeSyS effectively bridges the gap between neural and symbolic WMs, balancing expressivity and robustness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong general-purpose reasoning capabilities, yet they frequently hallucinate when used as world models (WMs), where strict compliance with deterministic transition rules--particularly in corner cases--is essential. In contrast, Symbolic WMs provide logical consistency but lack semantic expressivity. To bridge this gap, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Synergy (NeSyS), a framework that integrates the probabilistic semantic priors of LLMs with executable symbolic rules to achieve both expressivity and robustness. NeSyS alternates training between the two models using trajectories inadequately explained by the other. Unlike rule-based prompting, the symbolic WM directly constrains the LLM by modifying its output probability distribution. The neural WM is fine-tuned only on trajectories not covered by symbolic rules, reducing training data by 50% without loss of accuracy. Extensive experiments on three distinct interactive environments, i.e., ScienceWorld, Webshop, and Plancraft, demonstrate NeSyS's consistent advantages over baselines in both WM prediction accuracy and data efficiency.

TL;DR: Canvas-of-Thought (Canvas-CoT) improves multimodal reasoning by using a HTML Canvas for state revisions and visual feedback, outperforming traditional CoT methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoT prompting lacks visual guidance and efficient state updates, especially in high-dimensional domains like geometry.

Method: Introduces Canvas-CoT, leveraging HTML Canvas for atomic DOM-based operations and rendering-based critique loops for visual feedback.

Result: Outperforms baselines on VCode, RBench-V, and MathVista benchmarks, enhancing reasoning precision and efficiency.

Conclusion: Canvas-CoT offers a context-efficient paradigm for multimodal reasoning by integrating explicit visual feedback and state management.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), relying solely on linear text sequences remains a bottleneck for complex tasks. We observe that even when auxiliary visual elements are interleaved, they are often treated as static snapshots within a one-dimensional, unstructured reasoning chain. We argue that such approaches treat reasoning history as an immutable stream: correcting a local error necessitates either generating verbose downstream corrections or regenerating the entire context. This forces the model to implicitly maintain and track state updates, significantly increasing token consumption and cognitive load. This limitation is particularly acute in high-dimensional domains, such as geometry and SVG design, where the textual expression of CoT lacks explicit visual guidance, further constraining the model's reasoning precision. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Canvas-of-Thought (Canvas-CoT)}. By leveraging a HTML Canvas as an external reasoning substrate, Canvas-CoT empowers the model to perform atomic, DOM-based CRUD operations. This architecture enables in-place state revisions without disrupting the surrounding context, allowing the model to explicitly maintain the "ground truth". Furthermore, we integrate a rendering-based critique loop that serves as a hard constraint validator, providing explicit visual feedback to resolve complex tasks that are difficult to articulate through text alone. Extensive experiments on VCode, RBench-V, and MathVista demonstrate that Canvas-CoT significantly outperforms existing baselines, establishing a new paradigm for context-efficient multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper critiques current KE-based detoxification evaluations, proposing a robustness framework and revealing limitations like pseudo-detoxification and degraded effectiveness in complex or cross-lingual scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of KE-based detoxification rely heavily on toxicity classifiers, which may not accurately reflect true behavioral suppression, prompting the need for a more robust framework.

Method: The authors propose a robustness-oriented evaluation framework focusing on optimisation robustness, compositional robustness, and cross-lingual robustness to assess KE-based detoxification reliability.

Result: Identified pseudo-detoxification as a failure mode, found detoxification effectiveness declines with multiple edits, and noted limited effectiveness in monolingual and cross-lingual contexts under specific conditions.

Conclusion: KE-based detoxification is only robust for certain models, limited objectives, and specific languages, highlighting the need for more comprehensive evaluation methods.

Abstract: Knowledge-Editing-based (KE-based) detoxification has emerged as a promising approach for mitigating harmful behaviours in Large Language Models. Existing evaluations, however, largely rely on automatic toxicity classifiers, implicitly assuming that reduced toxicity scores reflect genuine behavioural suppression. In this work, we propose a robustness-oriented evaluation framework for KE-based detoxification that examines its reliability beyond standard classifier-based metrics along three dimensions: optimisation robustness, compositional robustness, and cross-lingual robustness. We identify pseudo-detoxification as a common failure mode, where apparent toxicity reductions arise from degenerate generation behaviours rather than meaningful suppression of unsafe content. We further show that detoxification effectiveness degrades when multiple unsafe behaviours are edited jointly, and that both monolingual and cross-lingual detoxification remain effective only under specific model-method combinations. Overall, our results indicate that KE-based detoxification is robust only for certain models, limited numbers of detoxification objectives, and a subset of languages.

TL;DR: LHAW introduces a modular pipeline to create ambiguous task variants for evaluating long-horizon agents, validated empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of scalable frameworks for measuring ambiguity's impact on autonomous systems.

Method: LHAW systematically removes information across Goals, Constraints, Inputs, and Context to create task variants, validated through agent trials.

Result: 285 task variants were released, classifying ambiguity's impact as outcome-critical, divergent, or benign.

Conclusion: LHAW offers a cost-sensitive evaluation framework for agent clarification behavior, aiding reliable autonomous systems.

Abstract: Long-horizon workflow agents that operate effectively over extended periods are essential for truly autonomous systems. Their reliable execution critically depends on the ability to reason through ambiguous situations in which clarification seeking is necessary to ensure correct task execution. However, progress is limited by the lack of scalable, task-agnostic frameworks for systematically curating and measuring the impact of ambiguity across custom workflows. We address this gap by introducing LHAW (Long-Horizon Augmented Workflows), a modular, dataset-agnostic synthetic pipeline that transforms any well-specified task into controllable underspecified variants by systematically removing information across four dimensions - Goals, Constraints, Inputs, and Context - at configurable severity levels. Unlike approaches that rely on LLM predictions of ambiguity, LHAW validates variants through empirical agent trials, classifying them as outcome-critical, divergent, or benign based on observed terminal state divergence. We release 285 task variants from TheAgentCompany, SWE-Bench Pro and MCP-Atlas according to our taxonomy alongside formal analysis measuring how current agents detect, reason about, and resolve underspecification across ambiguous settings. LHAW provides the first systematic framework for cost-sensitive evaluation of agent clarification behavior in long-horizon settings, enabling development of reliable autonomous systems.

TL;DR: GRU-Mem improves long-context reasoning in LLMs by using text-controlled gates (update and exit gates) to prevent memory explosion and unnecessary computations, outperforming MemAgent with 400% faster inference speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and performance degradation in large language models (LLMs) when processing long contexts, particularly with naive recurrent memory updates.

Method: Introduces GRU-Mem, featuring update and exit gates controlled by rewards signals (r^update and r^exit) via end-to-end RL, ensuring stable and efficient memory management.

Result: GRU-Mem significantly outperforms MemAgent, achieving up to 400% faster inference speeds while maintaining or improving reasoning performance.

Conclusion: GRU-Mem presents a robust solution for long-context reasoning by dynamically managing memory updates and computations, enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness in LLMs.

Abstract: While reasoning over long context is crucial for various real-world applications, it remains challenging for large language models (LLMs) as they suffer from performance degradation as the context length grows. Recent work MemAgent has tried to tackle this by processing context chunk-by-chunk in an RNN-like loop and updating a textual memory for final answering. However, this naive recurrent memory update faces two crucial drawbacks: (i) memory can quickly explode because it can update indiscriminately, even on evidence-free chunks; and (ii) the loop lacks an exit mechanism, leading to unnecessary computation after even sufficient evidence is collected. To address these issues, we propose GRU-Mem, which incorporates two text-controlled gates for more stable and efficient long-context reasoning. Specifically, in GRU-Mem, the memory only updates when the update gate is open and the recurrent loop will exit immediately once the exit gate is open. To endow the model with such capabilities, we introduce two reward signals $r^{\text{update}}$ and $r^{\text{exit}}$ within end-to-end RL, rewarding the correct updating and exiting behaviors respectively. Experiments on various long-context reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GRU-Mem, which generally outperforms the vanilla MemAgent with up to 400\% times inference speed acceleration.

Abstract: We introduce Step 3.5 Flash, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model that bridges frontier-level agentic intelligence and computational efficiency. We focus on what matters most when building agents: sharp reasoning and fast, reliable execution. Step 3.5 Flash pairs a 196B-parameter foundation with 11B active parameters for efficient inference. It is optimized with interleaved 3:1 sliding-window/full attention and Multi-Token Prediction (MTP-3) to reduce the latency and cost of multi-round agentic interactions. To reach frontier-level intelligence, we design a scalable reinforcement learning framework that combines verifiable signals with preference feedback, while remaining stable under large-scale off-policy training, enabling consistent self-improvement across mathematics, code, and tool use. Step 3.5 Flash demonstrates strong performance across agent, coding, and math tasks, achieving 85.4% on IMO-AnswerBench, 86.4% on LiveCodeBench-v6 (2024.08-2025.05), 88.2% on tau2-Bench, 69.0% on BrowseComp (with context management), and 51.0% on Terminal-Bench 2.0, comparable to frontier models such as GPT-5.2 xHigh and Gemini 3.0 Pro. By redefining the efficiency frontier, Step 3.5 Flash provides a high-density foundation for deploying sophisticated agents in real-world industrial environments.

TL;DR: KPO addresses high-variance IS ratios in RL for LLMs by using a Kalman filter to stabilize policy updates, outperforming SOTA methods on math reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-variance IS ratios destabilize policy optimization in RL for LLMs, leading to training collapse.

Method: Proposes Online Causal Kalman Filtering (KPO) to model IS ratios as latent states, updating them autoregressively for stability.

Result: KPO achieves superior results on challenging math reasoning datasets compared to SOTA methods.

Conclusion: KPO effectively stabilizes policy updates by smoothing IS ratio noise, improving RL performance for LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for large language models suffers from high-variance token-level importance sampling (IS) ratios, which would destabilize policy optimization at scale. To improve stability, recent methods typically use a fixed sequence-level IS ratio for all tokens in a sequence or adjust each token's IS ratio separately, thereby neglecting temporal off-policy derivation across tokens in a sequence. In this paper, we first empirically identify that local off-policy deviation is structurally inconsistent at the token level, which may distort policy-gradient updates across adjacent tokens and lead to training collapse. To address the issue, we propose Online Causal Kalman Filtering for stable and effective Policy Optimization (KPO). Concretely, we model the desired IS ratio as a latent state that evolves across tokens and apply a Kalman filter to update this state online and autoregressively based on the states of past tokens, regardless of future tokens. The resulting filtered IS ratios preserve token-wise local structure-aware variation while strongly smoothing noise spikes, yielding more stable and effective policy updates. Experimentally, KPO achieves superior results on challenging math reasoning datasets compared with state-of-the-art counterparts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UMEM is a framework that jointly optimizes memory extraction and management for LLM-based agents, outperforming baselines by up to 10.67% in multi-turn tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on memory management but treat extraction as static, leading to poor generalization due to instance-specific noise.

Method: UMEM jointly optimizes extraction and management using Semantic Neighborhood Modeling and GRPO rewards for generalizable memories.

Result: UMEM achieves significant improvements (up to 10.67%) across five benchmarks and maintains monotonic growth during evolution.

Conclusion: UMEM effectively enhances memory generalization and performance in multi-turn tasks.

Abstract: Self-evolving memory serves as the trainable parameters for Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents, where extraction (distilling insights from experience) and management (updating the memory bank) must be tightly coordinated. Existing methods predominately optimize memory management while treating memory extraction as a static process, resulting in poor generalization, where agents accumulate instance-specific noise rather than robust memories. To address this, we propose Unified Memory Extraction and Management (UMEM), a self-evolving agent framework that jointly optimizes a Large Language Model to simultaneous extract and manage memories. To mitigate overfitting to specific instances, we introduce Semantic Neighborhood Modeling and optimize the model with a neighborhood-level marginal utility reward via GRPO. This approach ensures memory generalizability by evaluating memory utility across clusters of semantically related queries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate that UMEM significantly outperforms highly competitive baselines, achieving up to a 10.67% improvement in multi-turn interactive tasks. Futhermore, UMEM maintains a monotonic growth curve during continuous evolution. Codes and models will be publicly released.

*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines if benchmark performance in language models is driven by word-level statistical overlap between pre-training data and evaluation datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of word-level statistical patterns in determining the quality of pre-training data for language models.

Method: Used word-level unigram cross-entropy and frequency statistics across 10 zero-shot benchmarks, 4 pre-training datasets (8.5B to 60B tokens), and models (400M to 3B parameters).

Result: Found an inverse relationship between word-level unigram cross-entropy and benchmark performance, indicating strong influence of word overlap.

Conclusion: Standard benchmarks are weakly out-of-distribution; word-overlap statistics can predict benchmark performance.

Abstract: Understanding what constitutes high-quality pre-training data remains a central question in language model training. In this work, we investigate whether benchmark performance is primarily driven by the degree of statistical pattern overlap between pre-training corpora and evaluation datasets. We measure this overlap using word-level unigram cross-entropy and word frequency statistics, and perform controlled experiments across $10$ zero-shot benchmarks, $4$ pre-training datasets spanning $8.5\mathrm{B}$ to $60\mathrm{B}$ tokens, and model sizes ranging from $400\mathrm{M}$ to $3\mathrm{B}$ parameters. Our results demonstrate a robust inverse relationship between word-level unigram cross-entropy and benchmark performance, suggesting that widely used benchmarks are strongly influenced by word overlap between training and evaluation data. Thus, larger pre-training subsets with similar word-level unigram cross-entropy yield improved downstream results, indicating that word frequency statistics play an additional role in shaping benchmark scores. Taken together, these results suggest that many standard benchmarks are only weakly out-of-distribution relative to pre-training corpora, so that simple word-overlap statistics predict benchmark performance.

*Daniel Gallagher,Gerhard Heyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper assesses transformer models' ability to handle Georgian's split-ergative case system, finding ergative case assignment the most challenging due to its rarity and lack of training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how well transformer-based language models perform on Georgian's rare split-ergative case alignment system and identify performance gaps.

Method: A treebank-based approach using Grew query language generates minimal pairs, creating a dataset of 370 syntactic tests across seven tasks. Five encoder and two decoder models are evaluated using word- and sentence-level accuracy metrics.

Result: Models struggled most with ergative case assignment and performed best on nominative case assignment. Performance aligned with the frequency distribution of cases (NOM > DAT > ERG).

Conclusion: Data scarcity and the ergative case's specificity hinder model performance. The publicly available dataset and methodology offer a framework for future syntactic evaluations in low-resource languages.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of transformer-based language models on split-ergative case alignment in Georgian, a particularly rare system for assigning grammatical cases to mark argument roles. We focus on subject and object marking determined through various permutations of nominative, ergative, and dative noun forms. A treebank-based approach for the generation of minimal pairs using the Grew query language is implemented. We create a dataset of 370 syntactic tests made up of seven tasks containing 50-70 samples each, where three noun forms are tested in any given sample. Five encoder- and two decoder-only models are evaluated with word- and/or sentence-level accuracy metrics. Regardless of the specific syntactic makeup, models performed worst in assigning the ergative case correctly and strongest in assigning the nominative case correctly. Performance correlated with the overall frequency distribution of the three forms (NOM > DAT > ERG). Though data scarcity is a known issue for low-resource languages, we show that the highly specific role of the ergative along with a lack of available training data likely contributes to poor performance on this case. The dataset is made publicly available and the methodology provides an interesting avenue for future syntactic evaluations of languages where benchmarks are limited.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoCoMo-Plus, a benchmark for evaluating cognitive memory in LLM-based dialogue systems, focusing on latent constraints rather than surface-level factual recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for conversational memory emphasize factual recall but overlook implicit constraints like user state or goals, which are crucial for realistic interactions.

Method: The authors propose LoCoMo-Plus, a benchmark assessing cognitive memory under cue-trigger semantic disconnect, and introduce a unified evaluation framework based on constraint consistency.

Result: Experiments show that cognitive memory is challenging for models, revealing failures not identified by existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the limitations of traditional metrics and benchmarks, advocating for a focus on latent constraints in evaluating conversational memory.

Abstract: Long-term conversational memory is a core capability for LLM-based dialogue systems, yet existing benchmarks and evaluation protocols primarily focus on surface-level factual recall. In realistic interactions, appropriate responses often depend on implicit constraints such as user state, goals, or values that are not explicitly queried later. To evaluate this setting, we introduce \textbf{LoCoMo-Plus}, a benchmark for assessing cognitive memory under cue--trigger semantic disconnect, where models must retain and apply latent constraints across long conversational contexts. We further show that conventional string-matching metrics and explicit task-type prompting are misaligned with such scenarios, and propose a unified evaluation framework based on constraint consistency. Experiments across diverse backbone models, retrieval-based methods, and memory systems demonstrate that cognitive memory remains challenging and reveals failures not captured by existing benchmarks. Our code and evaluation framework are publicly available at: https://github.com/xjtuleeyf/Locomo-Plus.

TL;DR: Macaron is a multilingual benchmark designed to test reasoning over culturally grounded premises by using language-agnostic templates across diverse languages and cultures. It evaluates LLMs' performance on culture-grounded tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multilingual benchmarks often lack cultural grounding or control over reasoning types. Macaron addresses this gap by integrating cultural aspects and reasoning types systematically.

Method: Macaron uses 100 language-agnostic templates covering 7 reasoning types and 22 cultural aspects. Native annotators create scenario-aligned questions in English and local languages, resulting in 11,862 instances across 20 languages and cultural contexts.

Result: Zero-shot evaluations of 21 multilingual LLMs show reasoning-mode models perform best, achieving near-parity between English and local languages. Open-weight models degrade significantly in local languages. Culture-grounded mathematical and counting tasks are the hardest.

Conclusion: Macaron successfully bridges the gap in culturally grounded multilingual benchmarks, highlighting the importance of cultural context in reasoning tasks and revealing performance disparities among LLMs.

Abstract: Multilingual benchmarks rarely test reasoning over culturally grounded premises: translated datasets keep English-centric scenarios, while culture-first datasets often lack control over the reasoning required. We propose Macaron, a template-first benchmark that factorizes reasoning type and cultural aspect across question languages. Using 100 language-agnostic templates that cover 7 reasoning types, 22 cultural aspects, native annotators create scenario-aligned English and local-language multiple-choice questions and systematically derived True/False questions. Macaron contains 11,862 instances spanning 20 countries/cultural contexts, 10 scripts, and 20 languages (including low-resource ones like Amharic, Yoruba, Zulu, Kyrgyz, and some Arabic dialects). In zero-shot evaluation of 21 multilingual LLMs, reasoning-mode models achieve the strongest performance and near-parity between English and local languages, while open-weight models degrade substantially in local languages and often approach chance on T/F tasks. Culture-grounded mathematical and counting templates are consistently the hardest. The data can be accessed here https://huggingface.co/datasets/AlaaAhmed2444/Macaron.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reinforced Curriculum Pre-Alignment (RCPA), a method to adapt Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to specialized domains without losing general-purpose capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle in specialized domains, and existing methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning or continual pretraining are either ineffective or computationally expensive.

Method: RCPA uses a curriculum-aware progressive modulation mechanism, starting with partial output constraints and transitioning to full generation optimization.

Result: Experiments show RCPA effectively balances domain adaptation while preserving general multimodal capabilities.

Conclusion: RCPA provides a practical solution for building high-performing, domain-adaptive VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable general-purpose capabilities but often fall short in specialized domains such as medical imaging or geometric problem-solving. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can enhance performance within a target domain, but it typically causes catastrophic forgetting, limiting its generalization. The central challenge, therefore, is to adapt VLMs to new domains while preserving their general-purpose capabilities. Continual pretraining is effective for expanding knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), but it is less feasible for VLMs due to prohibitive computational costs and the unavailability of pretraining data for most open-source models. This necessitates efficient post-training adaptation methods. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in preserving general abilities, yet they often fail in domain adaptation scenarios where the model initially lacks sufficient domain knowledge, leading to optimization collapse. To bridge this gap, we propose Reinforced Curriculum Pre-Alignment (RCPA), a novel post-training paradigm that introduces a curriculum-aware progressive modulation mechanism. In the early phase, RCPA applies partial output constraints to safely expose the model to new domain concepts. As the model's domain familiarity increases, training gradually transitions to full generation optimization, refining responses and aligning them with domain-specific preferences. This staged adaptation balances domain knowledge acquisition with the preservation of general multimodal capabilities. Extensive experiments across specialized domains and general benchmarks validate the effectiveness of RCPA, establishing a practical pathway toward building high-performing and domain-adaptive VLMs.

*Haotian Sheng,Heyong Wang,Ming Hong,Hongman He,Junqiu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LSCL, a deep learning method to help black-box LLMs express their knowledge boundaries, addressing hallucination issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate distorted content (hallucination) due to unawareness of their knowledge boundaries. Existing solutions focus on white-box models, leaving black-box LLMs unexplored.

Method: LSCL uses knowledge distillation to map inputs (question, answer, token probability) to the LLM's knowledge state, quantifying boundaries.

Result: LSCL outperforms baselines in accuracy and recall on diverse datasets and LLMs. An adaptive method for LLMs without token probability access also performs well.

Conclusion: LSCL effectively expresses knowledge boundaries for black-box LLMs, reducing hallucination and enhancing practical utility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, however, the emergence of content generation distortion (hallucination) limits their practical applications. The core cause of hallucination lies in LLMs' lack of awareness regarding their stored internal knowledge, preventing them from expressing their knowledge state on questions beyond their internal knowledge boundaries, as humans do. However, existing research on knowledge boundary expression primarily focuses on white-box LLMs, leaving methods suitable for black-box LLMs which offer only API access without revealing internal parameters-largely unexplored. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes LSCL (LLM-Supervised Confidence Learning), a deep learning-based method for expressing the knowledge boundaries of black-box LLMs. Based on the knowledge distillation framework, this method designs a deep learning model. Taking the input question, output answer, and token probability from a black-box LLM as inputs, it constructs a mapping between the inputs and the model' internal knowledge state, enabling the quantification and expression of the black-box LLM' knowledge boundaries. Experiments conducted on diverse public datasets and with multiple prominent black-box LLMs demonstrate that LSCL effectively assists black-box LLMs in accurately expressing their knowledge boundaries. It significantly outperforms existing baseline models on metrics such as accuracy and recall rate. Furthermore, considering scenarios where some black-box LLMs do not support access to token probability, an adaptive alternative method is proposed. The performance of this alternative approach is close to that of LSCL and surpasses baseline models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Token Constraint Bound ($δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$), a metric assessing LLM robustness against input perturbations, revealing prediction instabilities overlooked by traditional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics like accuracy and perplexity fail to measure local prediction robustness in LLMs, necessitating a new approach.

Method: Proposes $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ to quantify internal state perturbation resilience, linked to output embedding geometry.

Result: Experiments show $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ correlates with prompt engineering and identifies instabilities perplexity misses.

Conclusion: $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ offers a principled way to analyze and enhance LLM contextual stability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities yet suffer from sensitivity to slight input context variations, hampering reliability. Conventional metrics like accuracy and perplexity fail to assess local prediction robustness, as normalized output probabilities can obscure the underlying resilience of an LLM's internal state to perturbations. We introduce the Token Constraint Bound ($δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$), a novel metric that quantifies the maximum internal state perturbation an LLM can withstand before its dominant next-token prediction significantly changes. Intrinsically linked to output embedding space geometry, $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ provides insights into the stability of the model's internal predictive commitment. Our experiments show $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ correlates with effective prompt engineering and uncovers critical prediction instabilities missed by perplexity during in-context learning and text generation. $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ offers a principled, complementary approach to analyze and potentially improve the contextual stability of LLM predictions.

*Hardi Garari,Hossein Hassani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper fills a gap in Native Language Identification (NLI) research by focusing on Hewlêri, a subdialect of Sorani Kurdish. It introduces a speech dataset and evaluates three neural network models, with RNN achieving the highest accuracy (95.92%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NLI research lacks focus on dialects and subdialects, especially in less-resourced languages like Kurdish. This study addresses this gap by examining Hewlêri subdialect.

Method: The study collected 24 hours of speech from 40 speakers. Three neural network models (ANN, CNN, RNN) were evaluated through 66 experiments, testing various parameters like segmentation length and sampling methods.

Result: The RNN model performed best with 95.92% accuracy for 5-second audio segments using an 80:10:10 data split. The dataset is the first of its kind for Hewlêri NLI.

Conclusion: This work advances NLI research for less-resourced dialects by providing a new dataset and demonstrating the effectiveness of neural networks, particularly RNN, for Hewlêri subdialect identification.

Abstract: Native Language Identification (NLI) is a task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that typically determines the native language of an author through their writing or a speaker through their speaking. It has various applications in different areas, such as forensic linguistics and general linguistics studies. Although considerable research has been conducted on NLI regarding two different languages, such as English and German, the literature indicates a significant gap regarding NLI for dialects and subdialects. The gap becomes wider in less-resourced languages such as Kurdish. This research focuses on NLI within the context of a subdialect of Sorani (Central) Kurdish. It aims to investigate the NLI for Hewlêri, a subdialect spoken in Hewlêr (Erbil), the Capital of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We collected about 24 hours of speech by recording interviews with 40 native or non-native Hewlêri speakers, 17 female and 23 male. We created three Neural Network-based models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which were evaluated through 66 experiments, covering various time-frames from 1 to 60 seconds, undersampling, oversampling, and cross-validation. The RNN model showed the highest accuracy of 95.92% for 5-second audio segmentation, using an 80:10:10 data splitting scheme. The created dataset is the first speech dataset for NLI on the Hewlêri subdialect in the Sorani Kurdish dialect, which can be of benefit to various research areas.

TL;DR: C-MOP is a framework for prompt optimization in LLMs, using BACS and MGSC to stabilize updates and resolve conflicts, outperforming SOTA baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt optimization methods face noisy and conflicting signals, limiting performance.

Method: C-MOP employs Boundary-Aware Contrastive Sampling (BACS) and Momentum-Guided Semantic Clustering (MGSC) to stabilize optimization.

Result: C-MOP outperforms PromptWizard and ProTeGi by 1.58% and 3.35%, respectively, and enables smaller models to surpass larger ones.

Conclusion: C-MOP effectively drives precise prompt evolution in LLMs, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization is a promising direction to boost the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods often suffer from noisy and conflicting update signals. In this research, we propose C-MOP (Cluster-based Momentum Optimized Prompting), a framework that stabilizes optimization via Boundary-Aware Contrastive Sampling (BACS) and Momentum-Guided Semantic Clustering (MGSC). Specifically, BACS utilizes batch-level information to mine tripartite features--Hard Negatives, Anchors, and Boundary Pairs--to precisely characterize the typical representation and decision boundaries of positive and negative prompt samples. To resolve semantic conflicts, MGSC introduces a textual momentum mechanism with temporal decay that distills persistent consensus from fluctuating gradients across iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C-MOP consistently outperforms SOTA baselines like PromptWizard and ProTeGi, yielding average gains of 1.58% and 3.35%. Notably, C-MOP enables a general LLM with 3B activated parameters to surpass a 70B domain-specific dense LLM, highlighting its effectiveness in driving precise prompt evolution.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with structured evidence extraction for meta-analyses due to relational and numerical complexity, despite advances in entity recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLMs can meet the structural demands of converting narrative articles into numerically grounded study records for systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

Method: A diagnostic framework tests LLMs with schema-constrained queries of increasing complexity, using a manually curated corpus across five domains and a unified evaluation protocol.

Result: LLMs perform moderately on single-property queries but fail significantly with relational tasks, showing near-zero reliability for full meta-analytic tuples and unreliable corpus-level statistics.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack the structural fidelity, relational binding, and numerical grounding needed for automated meta-analysis due to systematic breakdowns.

Abstract: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses rely on converting narrative articles into structured, numerically grounded study records. Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), it remains unclear whether they can meet the structural requirements of this process, which hinge on preserving roles, methods, and effect-size attribution across documents rather than on recognizing isolated entities. We propose a structural, diagnostic framework that evaluates LLM-based evidence extraction as a progression of schema-constrained queries with increasing relational and numerical complexity, enabling precise identification of failure points beyond atom-level extraction. Using a manually curated corpus spanning five scientific domains, together with a unified query suite and evaluation protocol, we evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs under both per-document and long-context, multi-document input regimes. Across domains and models, performance remains moderate for single-property queries but degrades sharply once tasks require stable binding between variables, roles, statistical methods, and effect sizes. Full meta-analytic association tuples are extracted with near-zero reliability, and long-context inputs further exacerbate these failures. Downstream aggregation amplifies even minor upstream errors, rendering corpus-level statistics unreliable. Our analysis shows that these limitations stem not from entity recognition errors, but from systematic structural breakdowns, including role reversals, cross-analysis binding drift, instance compression in dense result sections, and numeric misattribution, indicating that current LLMs lack the structural fidelity, relational binding, and numerical grounding required for automated meta-analysis. The code and data are publicly available at GitHub (https://github.com/zhiyintan/LLM-Meta-Analysis).

TL;DR: FinMMEval Lab at CLEF 2026 introduces a multilingual, multimodal evaluation framework for financial LLMs, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial NLP benchmarks are monolingual, text-only, and limited in scope. FinMMEval aims to fill this gap.

Method: The lab offers three tasks: Financial Exam Question Answering, PolyFiQA (Multilingual Financial QA), and Financial Decision Making.

Result: A comprehensive evaluation suite measures models' reasoning, generalization, and decision-making across languages and modalities.

Conclusion: FinMMEval promotes robust, transparent, and globally inclusive financial AI systems, with publicly released datasets.

Abstract: We present the setup and the tasks of the FinMMEval Lab at CLEF 2026, which introduces the first multilingual and multimodal evaluation framework for financial Large Language Models (LLMs). While recent advances in financial natural language processing have enabled automated analysis of market reports, regulatory documents, and investor communications, existing benchmarks remain largely monolingual, text-only, and limited to narrow subtasks. FinMMEval 2026 addresses this gap by offering three interconnected tasks that span financial understanding, reasoning, and decision-making: Financial Exam Question Answering, Multilingual Financial Question Answering (PolyFiQA), and Financial Decision Making. Together, these tasks provide a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures models' ability to reason, generalize, and act across diverse languages and modalities. The lab aims to promote the development of robust, transparent, and globally inclusive financial AI systems, with datasets and evaluation resources publicly released to support reproducible research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An ultra-fast search algorithm for trillion-scale corpora achieves sub-0.3 second search times by combining suffix arrays, disk-aware design, and dynamic pruning, outperforming existing methods in latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient search over large natural language corpora with semantic variations drives the development of a scalable and fast algorithm.

Method: The paper introduces a string-matching approach using suffix arrays, enhanced by disk-aware exact lookup and dynamic corpus-aware pruning to manage query complexity.

Result: The method outperforms competitors (infini-gram, infini-gram mini, SoftMatcha) in latency on the FineWeb-Edu dataset (1.4T tokens) and detects previously missed benchmark contamination.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm offers a scalable, fast solution for large-scale semantic search, with practical applications in detecting corpus contamination and supporting multilingual search.

Abstract: We present an ultra-fast and flexible search algorithm that enables search over trillion-scale natural language corpora in under 0.3 seconds while handling semantic variations (substitution, insertion, and deletion). Our approach employs string matching based on suffix arrays that scales well with corpus size. To mitigate the combinatorial explosion induced by the semantic relaxation of queries, our method is built on two key algorithmic ideas: fast exact lookup enabled by a disk-aware design, and dynamic corpus-aware pruning. We theoretically show that the proposed method suppresses exponential growth in the search space with respect to query length by leveraging statistical properties of natural language. In experiments on FineWeb-Edu (Lozhkov et al., 2024) (1.4T tokens), we show that our method achieves significantly lower search latency than existing methods: infini-gram (Liu et al., 2024), infini-gram mini (Xu et al., 2025), and SoftMatcha (Deguchi et al., 2025). As a practical application, we demonstrate that our method identifies benchmark contamination in training corpora, unidentified by existing approaches. We also provide an online demo of fast, soft search across corpora in seven languages.

### [120] [Computational Phenomenology of Temporal Experience in Autism: Quantifying the Emotional and Narrative Characteristics of Lived Unpredictability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10947)
*Kacper Dudzic,Karolina Drożdż,Maciej Wodziński,Anastazja Szuła,Marcin Moskalewicz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores temporal disturbances in autism by integrating phenomenological and computational methods, revealing lived unpredictability as a key challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in autism research (e.g., deficit-focused models, small qualitative samples, lack of computational-phenomenological integration) and understand core temporal disturbances.

Method: Combined three methodologies: phenomenological interviews (Study A), computational analysis of autistic narratives (Study B), and replication of computational narrative flow measures (Study C).

Result: Interviews and computational analysis highlighted unpredictability as central in autistic temporal experience, with negative valence in temporal lexicon and narrative authenticity resembling autobiographies.

Conclusion: Temporal challenges in autism stem from lived unpredictability, not narrative construction, bridging phenomenological and computational insights.

Abstract: Disturbances in temporality, such as desynchronization with the social environment and its unpredictability, are considered core features of autism with a deep impact on relationships. However, limitations regarding research on this issue include: 1) the dominance of deficit-based medical models of autism, 2) sample size in qualitative research, and 3) the lack of phenomenological anchoring in computational research. To bridge the gap between phenomenological and computational approaches and overcome sample-size limitations, our research integrated three methodologies. Study A: structured phenomenological interviews with autistic individuals using the Transdiagnostic Assessment of Temporal Experience. Study B: computational analysis of an autobiographical corpus of autistic narratives built for this purpose. Study C: a replication of a computational study using narrative flow measures to assess the perceived phenomenological authenticity of autistic autobiographies. Interviews revealed that the most significant differences between the autistic and control groups concerned unpredictability of experience. Computational results mirrored these findings: the temporal lexicon in autistic narratives was significantly more negatively valenced - particularly the "Immediacy & Suddenness" category. Outlier analysis identified terms associated with perceived discontinuity (unpredictably, precipitously, and abruptly) as highly negative. The computational analysis of narrative flow found that the autistic narratives contained within the corpus quantifiably resemble autobiographical stories more than imaginary ones. Overall, the temporal challenges experienced by autistic individuals were shown to primarily concern lived unpredictability and stem from the contents of lived experience, and not from autistic narrative construction.

*Ivan Vulić,Adam Grycner,Quentin de Laroussilhe,Jonas Pfeiffer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introducing LoRA-Squeeze improves standard LoRA learning by dynamically adjusting ranks during training or post-hoc compression, outperforming direct low-rank solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA faces challenges like pre-selecting optimal ranks and dealing with deployment complexities of heterogeneous-rank modules. LoRA-Squeeze aims to address these by learning higher-rank solutions first and then compressing them.

Method: Fine-tune with a high source rank, reconstruct the full weight update matrix, and use Randomized SVD to compress it to a lower target rank. Also includes a rank annealing variant during training.

Result: Post-hoc compression often outperforms direct low-rank training, especially with fine-tuning steps at the target rank. The rank annealing variant achieves the best size-performance trade-off.

Conclusion: LoRA-Squeeze is a promising approach for efficient fine-tuning, offering flexibility and improved performance over standard LoRA methods.

Abstract: Despite its huge number of variants, standard Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is still a dominant technique for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Nonetheless, it faces persistent challenges, including the pre-selection of an optimal rank and rank-specific hyper-parameters, as well as the deployment complexity of heterogeneous-rank modules and more sophisticated LoRA derivatives. In this work, we introduce LoRA-Squeeze, a simple and efficient methodology that aims to improve standard LoRA learning by changing LoRA module ranks either post-hoc or dynamically during training}. Our approach posits that it is better to first learn an expressive, higher-rank solution and then compress it, rather than learning a constrained, low-rank solution directly. The method involves fine-tuning with a deliberately high(er) source rank, reconstructing or efficiently approximating the reconstruction of the full weight update matrix, and then using Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) to create a new, compressed LoRA module at a lower target rank. Extensive experiments across 13 text and 10 vision-language tasks show that post-hoc compression often produces lower-rank adapters that outperform those trained directly at the target rank, especially if a small number of fine-tuning steps at the target rank is allowed. Moreover, a gradual, in-tuning rank annealing variant of LoRA-Squeeze consistently achieves the best LoRA size-performance trade-off.

### [122] [Linguistic Indicators of Early Cognitive Decline in the DementiaBank Pitt Corpus: A Statistical and Machine Learning Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11028)
*Artsvik Avetisyan,Sachin Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores linguistically interpretable markers of dementia in spontaneous speech, using logistic regression and random forest models on transcript data. Stable performance was found across linguistic representations, with syntactic and grammatical features being particularly discriminative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify transparent and clinically grounded linguistic markers of cognitive decline for early screening.

Method: Analyzed DementiaBank Pitt Corpus transcripts using three linguistic representations (raw text, POS-enhanced, POS-only). Evaluated models with transcript-level and subject-level protocols, ensuring speaker overlap prevention. Used Mann-Whitney U tests for validation.

Result: Models showed stable performance; syntactic and grammatical features were robust discriminators. Statistical analysis confirmed significant group differences in functional word usage, lexical diversity, and discourse coherence.

Conclusion: Abstract linguistic features reliably mark early cognitive decline. Interpretable machine learning and statistical validation support transparent language-based cognitive screening.

Abstract: Background: Subtle changes in spontaneous language production are among the earliest indicators of cognitive decline. Identifying linguistically interpretable markers of dementia can support transparent and clinically grounded screening approaches.
  Methods: This study analyzes spontaneous speech transcripts from the DementiaBank Pitt Corpus using three linguistic representations: raw cleaned text, a part-of-speech (POS)-enhanced representation combining lexical and grammatical information, and a POS-only syntactic representation. Logistic regression and random forest models were evaluated under two protocols: transcript-level train-test splits and subject-level five-fold cross-validation to prevent speaker overlap. Model interpretability was examined using global feature importance, and statistical validation was conducted using Mann-Whitney U tests with Cliff's delta effect sizes.
  Results: Across representations, models achieved stable performance, with syntactic and grammatical features retaining strong discriminative power even in the absence of lexical content. Subject-level evaluation yielded more conservative but consistent results, particularly for POS-enhanced and POS-only representations. Statistical analysis revealed significant group differences in functional word usage, lexical diversity, sentence structure, and discourse coherence, aligning closely with machine learning feature importance findings.
  Conclusion: The results demonstrate that abstract linguistic features capture robust markers of early cognitive decline under clinically realistic evaluation. By combining interpretable machine learning with non-parametric statistical validation, this study supports the use of linguistically grounded features for transparent and reliable language-based cognitive screening.

### [123] [Language Model Inversion through End-to-End Differentiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11044)
*Kevin Yandoka Denamganaï,Kartic Subr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of inverting Language Models (LMs) to find input prompts that produce specific target outputs, proposing a gradient-based optimization method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the open problem of determining input prompts that yield desired target outputs from LMs, which is not well-explored in current research.

Method: The method involves formulating the problem as gradient-based optimization, making LMs end-to-end differentiable, and optimizing prompts via gradient descent by viewing LMs as functions on token distributions.

Result: Experiments show the proposed DLM-powered inversion reliably and efficiently optimizes prompts of lengths 10 and 80 for targets of length 20 on white-box LMs.

Conclusion: The study concludes that gradient-based inversion of LMs is viable and effective for prompt optimization.

Abstract: Despite emerging research on Language Models (LM), few approaches analyse the invertibility of LMs. That is, given a LM and a desirable target output sequence of tokens, determining what input prompts would yield the target output remains an open problem. We formulate this problem as a classical gradient-based optimisation. First, we propose a simple algorithm to achieve end-to-end differentiability of a given (frozen) LM and then find optimised prompts via gradient descent. Our central insight is to view LMs as functions operating on sequences of distributions over tokens (rather than the traditional view as functions on sequences of tokens). Our experiments and ablations demonstrate that our DLM-powered inversion can reliably and efficiently optimise prompts of lengths $10$ and $80$ for targets of length $20$, for several white-box LMs (out-of-the-box).

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We frame embedding inversion as conditional masked diffusion, recovering all tokens in parallel through iterative denoising rather than sequential autoregressive generation. A masked diffusion language model is conditioned on the target embedding via adaptive layer normalization, requiring only 8 forward passes through a 78M parameter model with no access to the target encoder. On 32-token sequences across three embedding models, the method achieves 81.3% token accuracy and 0.87 cosine similarity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT) framework to model human conversation as multi-level perception, capturing intent-to-action pathways for robust and interpretable dialogue systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build natural full-duplex interactive systems by modeling the implicit chain of thoughts in human conversation.

Method: A hierarchical labeling scheme predicts communicative intents and speech acts, trained on a high-quality annotated corpus. The GoT framework structures predictions as an evolving graph for forecasting and refining reasoning.

Result: The framework shows robust behavior detection, interpretable reasoning chains, and benchmarks conversational reasoning in spoken dialogue systems.

Conclusion: The GoT framework effectively models conversational pathways and enhances interpretability and performance in dialogue systems.

Abstract: Human conversation is organized by an implicit chain of thoughts that manifests as timed speech acts. Capturing this perceptual pathway is key to building natural full-duplex interactive systems. We introduce a framework that models this process as multi-level perception, and then reasons over conversational behaviors via a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). Our approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. To train this system, we develop a high quality corpus that pairs controllable, event-rich dialogue data with human-annotated labels. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a transformer to forecast the next speech act, generate concise justifications for its decisions, and dynamically refine its reasoning. Experiments on both synthetic and real duplex dialogues show that the framework delivers robust behavior detection, produces interpretable reasoning chains, and establishes a foundation for benchmarking conversational reasoning in full duplex spoken dialogue systems.

*Tom Labiausse,Romain Fabre,Yannick Estève,Alexandre Défossez,Neil Zeghidour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hibiki-Zero eliminates the need for word-level alignments in speech translation, simplifying training and scaling across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods rely on hard-to-collect word-level alignments and suboptimal synthetic alignments.

Method: Train on sentence-level data first, then use GRPO-based reinforcement learning to optimize latency and quality.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy, latency, and adaptability with minimal data.

Conclusion: Hibiki-Zero simplifies multilingual speech translation and enables efficient adaptation to new languages.

Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation requires translating source speech into a target language in real-time while handling non-monotonic word dependencies. Traditional approaches rely on supervised training with word-level aligned data, which is difficult to collect at scale and thus depends on synthetic alignments using language-specific heuristics that are suboptimal. We propose Hibiki-Zero, which eliminates the need for word-level alignments entirely. This fundamentally simplifies the training pipeline and enables seamless scaling to diverse languages with varying grammatical structures, removing the bottleneck of designing language-specific alignment heuristics. We first train on sentence-level aligned data to learn speech translation at high latency, then apply a novel reinforcement learning strategy using GRPO to optimize latency while preserving translation quality. Hibiki-Zero achieves state-of-the-art performance in translation accuracy, latency, voice transfer, and naturalness across five X-to-English tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model can be adapted to support a new input language with less than 1000h of speech. We provide examples, model weights, inference code and we release a benchmark containing 45h of multilingual data for speech translation evaluation.

TL;DR: SteuerEx is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in tax law, derived from German university exams. SteuerLLM, a domain-adapted LLM, outperforms general-purpose models, showing domain-specific data is key.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle in domains requiring strict formal rules and precise terminology, such as tax law. This work aims to address this gap by creating a specialized benchmark and model.

Method: The authors generate SteuerEx from authentic German tax law exams and develop SteuerLLM, a domain-adapted LLM trained on synthetic data using retrieval-augmented methods.

Result: SteuerLLM outperforms general-purpose models of comparable size and even larger systems, highlighting the importance of domain-specific data and adaptation.

Conclusion: Domain-specific adaptation and data are more critical than model size for legal reasoning tasks. All resources are openly released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning and language understanding, yet their performance degrades in domains governed by strict formal rules, precise terminology, and legally binding structure. Tax law exemplifies these challenges, as correct answers require exact statutory citation, structured legal argumentation, and numerical accuracy under rigid grading schemes. We algorithmically generate SteuerEx, the first open benchmark derived from authentic German university tax law examinations. SteuerEx comprises 115 expert-validated examination questions spanning six core tax law domains and multiple academic levels, and employs a statement-level, partial-credit evaluation framework that closely mirrors real examination practice. We further present SteuerLLM, a domain-adapted LLM for German tax law trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset generated from authentic examination material using a controlled retrieval-augmented pipeline. SteuerLLM (28B parameters) consistently outperforms general-purpose instruction-tuned models of comparable size and, in several cases, substantially larger systems, demonstrating that domain-specific data and architectural adaptation are more decisive than parameter scale for performance on realistic legal reasoning tasks. All benchmark data, training datasets, model weights, and evaluation code are released openly to support reproducible research in domain-specific legal artificial intelligence. A web-based demo of SteuerLLM is available at https://steuerllm.i5.ai.fau.de.

*Yicheng Chen,Zerun Ma,Xinchen Xie,Yining Li,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DataChef-32B for automating LLM data recipe generation, achieving results comparable to human-curated recipes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual data recipe design for LLMs is labor-intensive, prompting the need for automated solutions.

Method: Uses end-to-end data recipe generation with reinforcement learning and a proxy reward for downstream performance.

Result: DataChef-32B matches human expert performance on six tasks and adapts Qwen3-1.7B-Base to math, scoring 66.7 on AIME'25.

Conclusion: Automating data recipe generation advances LLM training and enables self-evolving AI systems.

Abstract: In the current landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs), the curation of large-scale, high-quality training data is a primary driver of model performance. A key lever is the \emph{data recipe}, which comprises a data processing pipeline to transform raw sources into training corpora. Despite the growing use of LLMs to automate individual data processing steps, such as data synthesis and filtering, the overall design of data recipes remains largely manual and labor-intensive, requiring substantial human expertise and iteration. To bridge this gap, we formulate \emph{end-to-end data recipe generation} for LLM adaptation. Given a target benchmark and a pool of available data sources, a model is required to output a complete data recipe that adapts a base LLM to the target task. We present DataChef-32B, which performs online reinforcement learning using a proxy reward that predicts downstream performance for candidate recipes. Across six held-out tasks, DataChef-32B produces practical recipes that reach comparable downstream performance to those curated by human experts. Notably, the recipe from DataChef-32B adapts Qwen3-1.7B-Base to the math domain, achieving 66.7 on AIME'25 and surpassing Qwen3-1.7B. This work sheds new light on automating LLM training and developing self-evolving AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MisAlign-Profile, a unified benchmark for measuring misalignment trade-offs in LLMs across safety, value, and cultural dimensions, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate safety, value, and cultural dimensions in isolation, lacking insights into their interactions and trade-offs. The paper aims to systematically characterize cross-dimensional misalignment.

Method: MisAlign-Profile constructs MISALIGNTRADE, a dataset spanning 112 normative domains, labeled with semantic types, and pairs prompts with misaligned/aligned responses. It benchmarks LLMs using this dataset.

Result: The benchmark reveals 12%-34% misalignment trade-offs across dimensions in tested LLMs.

Conclusion: MisAlign-Profile provides a comprehensive tool for evaluating misalignment trade-offs in LLMs, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Misalignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the failure to simultaneously satisfy safety, value, and cultural dimensions, leading to behaviors that diverge from human expectations in real-world settings where these dimensions must co-occur. Existing benchmarks, such as SAFETUNEBED (safety-centric), VALUEBENCH (value-centric), and WORLDVIEW-BENCH (culture-centric), primarily evaluate these dimensions in isolation and therefore provide limited insight into their interactions and trade-offs. More recent efforts, including MIB and INTERPRETABILITY BENCHMARK-based on mechanistic interpretability, offer valuable perspectives on model failures; however, they remain insufficient for systematically characterizing cross-dimensional trade-offs. To address these gaps, we introduce MisAlign-Profile, a unified benchmark for measuring misalignment trade-offs inspired by mechanistic profiling. First, we construct MISALIGNTRADE, an English misaligned-aligned dataset across 112 normative domains taxonomies, including 14 safety, 56 value, and 42 cultural domains. In addition to domain labels, each prompt is classified with one of three orthogonal semantic types-object, attribute, or relations misalignment-using Gemma-2-9B-it and expanded via Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 with SimHash-based fingerprinting to avoid deduplication. Each prompt is paired with misaligned and aligned responses through two-stage rejection sampling to ensure quality. Second, we benchmark general-purpose, fine-tuned, and open-weight LLMs on MISALIGNTRADE-revealing 12%-34% misalignment trade-offs across dimensions.

TL;DR: SafeThink is a lightweight defense method that improves safety in MLRMs by injecting corrective prefixes during reasoning when safety thresholds are violated, reducing jailbreak success rates significantly while maintaining reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based post-training methods enhance reasoning but degrade safety alignment in MLRMs, increasing jailbreak risks. SafeThink aims to address this trade-off.

Method: SafeThink uses a safety reward model to monitor reasoning traces and injects optimized corrective prefixes (e.g., "Wait, think safely") only when safety thresholds are breached.

Result: SafeThink reduces jailbreak success rates by 30-60% across benchmarks while preserving reasoning accuracy (e.g., MathVista accuracy drops minimally from 65.20% to 65.00%). Intervening early (1-3 steps) often suffices for safety recovery.

Conclusion: SafeThink effectively balances safety and reasoning performance in MLRMs by treating safety recovery as a satisficing constraint and intervening early in reasoning traces.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) based post-training for explicit chain-of-thought (e.g., GRPO) improves the reasoning ability of multimodal large-scale reasoning models (MLRMs). But recent evidence shows that it can simultaneously degrade safety alignment and increase jailbreak success rates. We propose SafeThink, a lightweight inference-time defense that treats safety recovery as a satisficing constraint rather than a maximization objective. SafeThink monitors the evolving reasoning trace with a safety reward model and conditionally injects an optimized short corrective prefix ("Wait, think safely") only when the safety threshold is violated. In our evaluations across six open-source MLRMs and four jailbreak benchmarks (JailbreakV-28K, Hades, FigStep, and MM-SafetyBench), SafeThink reduces attack success rates by 30-60% (e.g., LlamaV-o1: 63.33% to 5.74% on JailbreakV-28K, R1-Onevision: 69.07% to 5.65% on Hades) while preserving reasoning performance (MathVista accuracy: 65.20% to 65.00%). A key empirical finding from our experiments is that safety recovery is often only a few steering steps away: intervening in the first 1-3 reasoning steps typically suffices to redirect the full generation toward safe completions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TEG and TEGRA methods for misinformation detection, combining text and graph-based knowledge to improve accuracy over language models alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation detection benefits from external knowledge, similar to manual fact-checking, prompting the need for enhanced document representation methods.

Method: Proposes Text Encoding with Graph (TEG) for hybrid text-graph representation and TEGRA for domain-specific knowledge integration.

Result: Experiments show TEG improves misinformation detection; TEGRA further enhances accuracy in most cases.

Conclusion: Hybrid representations outperform language models alone, with domain-specific knowledge (TEGRA) offering additional benefits.

Abstract: Misinformation detection is a critical task that can benefit significantly from the integration of external knowledge, much like manual fact-checking. In this work, we propose a novel method for representing textual documents that facilitates the incorporation of information from a knowledge base. Our approach, Text Encoding with Graph (TEG), processes documents by extracting structured information in the form of a graph and encoding both the text and the graph for classification purposes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this hybrid representation enhances misinformation detection performance compared to using language models alone. Furthermore, we introduce TEGRA, an extension of our framework that integrates domain-specific knowledge, further enhancing classification accuracy in most cases.

TL;DR: Training reasoning language models with repeated epochs on smaller datasets outperforms single-epoch training on larger datasets, suggesting a repetition advantage for supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to challenge standard intuition by showing that repetition during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) improves generalization better than scaling training data size.

Method: The method involves training Olmo3-7B models for varying epochs (up to 128) on smaller datasets (400 samples) versus fewer epochs on larger datasets (51200 samples), evaluating performance on AIME'24/25 and GPQA benchmarks.

Result: Results show that 128 epochs on 400 samples outperform 1 epoch on 51200 samples by 12-26 percentage points, with training token accuracy indicating when repetition benefits plateau.

Conclusion: The findings suggest a practical approach for reasoning SFT, proposing epoch scaling with token accuracy as a stopping criterion instead of costly data scaling, and introducing the repetition advantage as a new research problem.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data is an essential post-training step for reasoning language models. Standard machine learning intuition suggests that training with more unique training samples yields better generalization. Counterintuitively, we show that SFT benefits from repetition: under a fixed update budget, training for more epochs on smaller datasets outperforms single-epoch training on larger datasets. On AIME'24/25 and GPQA benchmarks, Olmo3-7B trained for 128 epochs on 400 samples outperforms the equivalent 1 epoch on 51200 samples by 12-26 percentage points, with no additional catastrophic forgetting. We find that training token accuracy reliably signals when repetition has saturated; improvements from additional epochs plateau at full memorization, a pattern consistent across all settings. These findings provide a practical approach for reasoning SFT, where scaling epochs with token accuracy as a stopping criterion can replace expensive undirected data scaling. We pose the repetition advantage, where full memorization coincides with improved generalization, as a new open problem for the community in understanding the training dynamics of large language models.

Motivation: Predicting stroke outcomes aids clinical decisions; current methods rely on structured data.

Method: Evaluated LLMs (BERT, NYUTron, Llama-3.1-8B, MedGemma-4B) on discharge/90-day mRS prediction using stroke registry notes.

Result: Fine-tuned Llama achieved 33.9% exact mRS and 76.3% binary accuracy for 90-day outcomes.

Conclusion: LLMs can predict outcomes from text alone, enabling seamless clinical integration.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke can inform clinical decision-making and resource allocation. Prior work on modified Rankin Scale (mRS) prediction has relied primarily on structured variables (e.g., age, NIHSS) and conventional machine learning. The ability of large language models (LLMs) to infer future mRS scores directly from routine admission notes remains largely unexplored. We evaluated encoder (BERT, NYUTron) and generative (Llama-3.1-8B, MedGemma-4B) LLMs, in both frozen and fine-tuned settings, for discharge and 90-day mRS prediction using a large, real-world stroke registry. The discharge outcome dataset included 9,485 History and Physical notes and the 90-day outcome dataset included 1,898 notes from the NYU Langone Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry (2016-2025). Data were temporally split with the most recent 12 months held out for testing. Performance was assessed using exact (7-class) mRS accuracy and binary functional outcome (mRS 0-2 vs. 3-6) accuracy and compared against established structured-data baselines incorporating NIHSS and age. Fine-tuned Llama achieved the highest performance, with 90-day exact mRS accuracy of 33.9% [95% CI, 27.9-39.9%] and binary accuracy of 76.3% [95% CI, 70.7-81.9%]. Discharge performance reached 42.0% [95% CI, 39.0-45.0%] exact accuracy and 75.0% [95% CI, 72.4-77.6%] binary accuracy. For 90-day prediction, Llama performed comparably to structured-data baselines. Fine-tuned LLMs can predict post-stroke functional outcomes from admission notes alone, achieving performance comparable to models requiring structured variable abstraction. Our findings support the development of text-based prognostic tools that integrate seamlessly into clinical workflows without manual data extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between competition-level problem-solving and professional mathematical research by developing an AI system that can navigate literature, construct proofs, and collaborate with humans.

Method: Aletheia combines an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think for reasoning, a novel inference-time scaling law, and intensive tool use to generate, verify, and revise solutions in natural language.

Conclusion: The paper highlights AI's potential in mathematics research and advocates for standard levels to quantify AI autonomy and novelty, reflecting on human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational models have yielded reasoning systems capable of achieving a gold-medal standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad. The transition from competition-level problem-solving to professional research, however, requires navigating vast literature and constructing long-horizon proofs. In this work, we introduce Aletheia, a math research agent that iteratively generates, verifies, and revises solutions end-to-end in natural language. Specifically, Aletheia is powered by an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think for challenging reasoning problems, a novel inference-time scaling law that extends beyond Olympiad-level problems, and intensive tool use to navigate the complexities of mathematical research. We demonstrate the capability of Aletheia from Olympiad problems to PhD-level exercises and most notably, through several distinct milestones in AI-assisted mathematics research: (a) a research paper (Feng26) generated by AI without any human intervention in calculating certain structure constants in arithmetic geometry called eigenweights; (b) a research paper (LeeSeo26) demonstrating human-AI collaboration in proving bounds on systems of interacting particles called independent sets; and (c) an extensive semi-autonomous evaluation (Feng et al., 2026a) of 700 open problems on Bloom's Erdos Conjectures database, including autonomous solutions to four open questions. In order to help the public better understand the developments pertaining to AI and mathematics, we suggest codifying standard levels quantifying autonomy and novelty of AI-assisted results. We conclude with reflections on human-AI collaboration in mathematics.

### [135] [Signature-Kernel Based Evaluation Metrics for Robust Probabilistic and Tail-Event Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10182)
*Benjamin R. Redhead,Thomas L. Lee,Peng Gu,Víctor Elvira,Amos Storkey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two kernel-based metrics (Sig-MMD and CSig-MMD) for probabilistic forecasting, addressing flaws in current evaluation frameworks by capturing dependencies and improving sensitivity to tail events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation frameworks for probabilistic forecasting lack consensus metrics and have flaws like assuming independence and poor sensitivity to tail events, which are crucial for decision-making.

Method: Proposes signature maximum mean discrepancy (Sig-MMD) and censored Sig-MMD (CSig-MMD) using signature kernels to capture inter-variate and inter-temporal dependencies and handle missing data. CSig-MMD includes censoring to prioritize tail events.

Result: The new metrics enable reliable evaluation of multi-step forecasting by capturing dependencies and improving sensitivity to tail events while maintaining properness.

Conclusion: Sig-MMD and CSig-MMD provide robust tools for evaluating probabilistic forecasts, addressing critical gaps in current frameworks and supporting better forecasting algorithms.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting is increasingly critical across high-stakes domains, from finance and epidemiology to climate science. However, current evaluation frameworks lack a consensus metric and suffer from two critical flaws: they often assume independence across time steps or variables, and they demonstrably lack sensitivity to tail events, the very occurrences that are most pivotal in real-world decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose two kernel-based metrics: the signature maximum mean discrepancy (Sig-MMD) and our novel censored Sig-MMD (CSig-MMD). By leveraging the signature kernel, these metrics capture complex inter-variate and inter-temporal dependencies and remain robust to missing data. Furthermore, CSig-MMD introduces a censoring scheme that prioritizes a forecaster's capability to predict tail events while strictly maintaining properness, a vital property for a good scoring rule. These metrics enable a more reliable evaluation of direct multi-step forecasting, facilitating the development of more robust probabilistic algorithms.

TL;DR: Versor is a novel architecture using Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) for improved generalization and performance, outperforming Transformers and others with fewer parameters and linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replace traditional non-linear operations with CGA for better structural generalization, interpretability, and efficiency in handling geometric tasks.

Method: States are embedded in the $Cl_{4,1}$ manifold and evolved via geometric transformations (rotors), avoiding explicit structural encoding while maintaining $SE(3)$-equivariance.

Result: Versor outperforms baselines on tasks like chaotic N-body dynamics and benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR-10), with fewer parameters, interpretable attention, and $O(L)$ complexity. Custom Clifford kernels offer significant speedups.

Conclusion: Versor provides a scalable, efficient, and interpretable solution for geometrically-aware modeling, with robust out-of-distribution performance.

Abstract: A novel sequence architecture design is introduced, Versor, which uses Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) in place of the traditional fundamental non-linear operations to achieve structural generalization and significant performance improvements on a variety of tasks, while offering improved interpretability and efficiency. By embedding states in the $Cl_{4,1}$ manifold and evolving them via geometric transformations (rotors), Versor natively represents $SE(3)$-equivariant relationships without requiring explicit structural encoding. Versor is validated on chaotic N-body dynamics, topological reasoning, and standard multimodal benchmarks (CIFAR-10, WikiText-103), consistently outperforming Transformers, Graph Networks, and geometric baselines (GATr, EGNN). Key results include: orders of magnitude fewer parameters ($200\times$ vs. Transformers); interpretable attention decomposing into proximity and orientational components; zero-shot scale generalization (99.3% MCC on topology vs. 50.4% for ViT); and $O(L)$ linear complexity via the novel Recursive Rotor Accumulator. In out-of-distribution tests, Versor maintains stable predictions while Transformers fail catastrophically. Custom Clifford kernels achieve up to $78\times$ speedup, providing a scalable foundation for geometrically-aware scientific modeling.

*Francisco Patitucci,Aryan Mokhtari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MVN-Grad is an Adam-style optimizer that improves stability and performance by combining variance-based normalization and post-normalization momentum, outperforming existing methods in benchmarks like CIFAR-100 and GPT-style language modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of standard Adam-type optimizers, such as the coupling between stale momentum and stochastic normalizers, by proposing a decoupled approach for better stability and performance.

Method: MVN-Grad introduces an optimizer that normalizes gradients based on their variance and applies momentum after normalization, eliminating cross-time coupling issues and improving robustness to outliers.

Result: MVN-Grad demonstrates strictly smaller one-step conditional update variance, robustness to outliers, and avoids sign-type collapse in low-variance regimes. It matches or outperforms Adam, AdaBelief, and LaProp in benchmarks.

Conclusion: MVN-Grad offers smoother training, improved generalization, and no added overhead, making it a strong alternative to existing Adam-style optimizers.

Abstract: We introduce MVN-Grad (Momentum on Variance-Normalized Gradients), an Adam-style optimizer that improves stability and performance by combining two complementary ideas: variance-based normalization and momentum applied after normalization. MVN-Grad scales each coordinate by an exponential moving average of gradient uncertainty and applies momentum to the resulting normalized gradients, eliminating the cross-time coupling between stale momentum and a stochastic normalizer present in standard Adam-type updates. We prove that this decoupling yields strictly smaller one-step conditional update variance than momentum-then-normalize variance methods under standard noise assumptions, and that MVN-Grad is robust to outliers: it has a uniformly bounded response to single gradient spikes.
  In low-variance regimes, we further show variance normalization avoids sign-type collapse associated with second-moment scaling and can yield accelerated convergence. Across CIFAR-100 image classification and GPT-style language modeling benchmarks, MVN-Grad matches or outperforms Adam, AdaBelief, and LaProp, delivering smoother training and improved generalization with no added overhead.

*Dmitry S. Ageev,Yulia A. Ageeva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neural-network construction of Euclidean scalar quantum field theories using transformer attention heads, demonstrating non-Gaussian field statistics and Gaussian behavior in large-head limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how transformer attention heads can construct quantum field theories and analyze their statistical properties in infinite-width and large-head limits.

Method: Using random network parameters in the NN-QFT framework, analyzing correlators (e.g., two-point and four-point functions) via attention-weight representations and random-feature token embeddings.

Result: Non-Gaussian field statistics persist in infinite-width limits, and summing many independent heads with standard normalization yields Gaussian behavior as head count increases.

Conclusion: The framework successfully maps transformer attention heads to quantum field theories, with controllable non-Gaussian effects and convergence to Gaussian behavior at large scales.

Abstract: We propose a neural-network construction of Euclidean scalar quantum field theories from transformer attention heads, defining $n$-point correlators by averaging over random network parameters in the NN-QFT framework. For a single attention head, shared random softmax weights couple different width coordinates and induce non-Gaussian field statistics that persist in the infinite-width limit $d_k\to\infty$. We compute the two-point function in an attention-weight representation and show how Euclidean-invariant kernels can be engineered via random-feature token embeddings. We then analyze the connected four-point function and identify an "independence-breaking" contribution, expressible as a covariance over query-key weights, which remains finite at infinite width. Finally, we show that summing many independent heads with standard $1/N_h$ normalization suppresses connected non-Gaussian correlators as $1/N_h$, yielding a Gaussian NN-QFT in the large-head limit.

TL;DR: HybridRAG-Bench is introduced as a framework to evaluate LLMs on retrieval-intensive tasks involving hybrid knowledge (unstructured text and structured knowledge graphs), avoiding contamination from pretraining data and rewarding genuine reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with tasks requiring up-to-date knowledge or multi-hop reasoning. Existing benchmarks often overlap with pretraining data, making it hard to assess true retrieval and reasoning abilities.

Method: HybridRAG-Bench constructs benchmarks by coupling unstructured text and structured KG representations from recent arXiv literature, generating grounded QA pairs with explicit reasoning paths.

Result: Experiments in AI, governance, and bioinformatics show HybridRAG-Bench effectively rewards genuine reasoning over parametric recall.

Conclusion: HybridRAG-Bench provides a flexible, contamination-aware evaluation framework for hybrid knowledge-augmented LLMs, with publicly released code and data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with knowledge-intensive questions that require up-to-date information and multi-hop reasoning. Augmenting LLMs with hybrid external knowledge, such as unstructured text and structured knowledge graphs, offers a promising alternative to costly continual pretraining. As such, reliable evaluation of their retrieval and reasoning capabilities becomes critical. However, many existing benchmarks increasingly overlap with LLM pretraining data, which means answers or supporting knowledge may already be encoded in model parameters, making it difficult to distinguish genuine retrieval and reasoning from parametric recall. We introduce HybridRAG-Bench, a framework for constructing benchmarks to evaluate retrieval-intensive, multi-hop reasoning over hybrid knowledge. HybridRAG-Bench automatically couples unstructured text and structured knowledge graph representations derived from recent scientific literature on arXiv, and generates knowledge-intensive question-answer pairs grounded in explicit reasoning paths. The framework supports flexible domain and time-frame selection, enabling contamination-aware and customizable evaluation as models and knowledge evolve. Experiments across three domains (artificial intelligence, governance and policy, and bioinformatics) demonstrate that HybridRAG-Bench rewards genuine retrieval and reasoning rather than parametric recall, offering a principled testbed for evaluating hybrid knowledge-augmented reasoning systems. We release our code and data at github.com/junhongmit/HybridRAG-Bench.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes LoRA's accuracy from a dynamical systems perspective, deriving explicit relationships between rank and accuracy for two loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the theoretical underpinnings of LoRA's accuracy dependence on update rank, which remains relatively unexplored despite empirical success.

Method: Gradient flow analysis in full-rank and low-rank regimes to derive dynamical system equations for LoRA, comparing rank-r updates to full-parameter updates.

Result: Closed-form relationships between LoRA rank and accuracy are established for trace-squared and Frobenius-norm loss functions.

Conclusion: The study provides rigorous theoretical insights into LoRA's performance, showing identical dynamics for simultaneous and sequential updates.

Abstract: Previous empirical studies have shown that LoRA achieves accuracy comparable to full-parameter methods on downstream fine-tuning tasks, even for rank-1 updates. By contrast, the theoretical underpinnings of the dependence of LoRA's accuracy on update rank remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we compare the accuracy of rank-r LoRA updates against full-parameter updates for fine-tuning tasks from a dynamical systems perspective. We perform gradient flow analysis in both full-rank and low-rank regimes to establish explicit relationships between rank and accuracy for two loss functions under LoRA. While gradient flow equations for LoRA are presented in prior work, we rigorously derive their form and show that they are identical for simultaneous and sequential LoRA parameter updates. We then use the resulting dynamical system equations to obtain closed-form relationships between LoRA rank and accuracy for trace-squared and Frobenius-norm low-rank approximation loss functions.

*Paweł Skierś,Tomasz Trzciński,Kamil Deja*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to control semantic variations in diffusion models by analyzing gradients from stochastic outputs, enabling precise concept steering and mitigating mode collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models lack direct user control over semantic variations in generated images, relying solely on stochastic processes. Existing methods ignore the generative process, prompting a need for better control mechanisms.

Method: The framework collects gradients from stochastic outputs of a fixed prompt and decomposes them into interpretable directions using Principal Components Analysis or Sparse Autoencoder.

Result: The approach isolates steerable semantic directions, reduces mode collapse in distilled models, and introduces a measure for concept complexity based on subspace dimensionality.

Conclusion: The framework enhances user control over diffusion models, offering interpretable directions and improved diversity while quantifying concept complexity.

Abstract: A single text prompt passed to a diffusion model often yields a wide range of visual outputs determined solely by stochastic process, leaving users with no direct control over which specific semantic variations appear in the image. While existing unsupervised methods attempt to analyze these variations via output features, they omit the underlying generative process. In this work, we propose a framework to disentangle these semantic directions directly within the input embedding space. To that end, we collect a set of gradients obtained by backpropagating the differences between stochastic realizations of a fixed prompt that we later decompose into meaningful steering directions with either Principal Components Analysis or Sparse Autoencoder. Our approach yields three key contributions: (1) it isolates interpretable, steerable directions for precise, fine-grained control over a single concept; (2) it effectively mitigates mode collapse in distilled models by reintroducing lost diversity; and (3) it establishes a novel estimator for concept complexity under a specific model, based on the dimensionality of the discovered subspace.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T3-Unlearning improves machine unlearning in generative models by tempering and tilting distributions, outperforming baselines with minimal runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations of classifier guidance in unlearning concentrated data distributions, proposing a more effective method.

Method: Introduces T3-Unlearning: tempering to flatten spikes and tilting with a lightweight classifier, freezing the base model.

Result: T3-Unlearning enhances forget quality and generative utility on the TOFU benchmark with fewer parameters and less runtime.

Conclusion: T3-Unlearning efficiently unlearns concentrated distributions, validated by theory and empirical results.

Abstract: We study machine unlearning in large generative models by framing the task as density ratio estimation to a target distribution rather than supervised fine-tuning. While classifier guidance is a standard approach for approximating this ratio and can succeed in general, we show it can fail to faithfully unlearn with finite samples when the forget set represents a sharp, concentrated data distribution. To address this, we introduce Temper-Then-Tilt Unlearning (T3-Unlearning), which freezes the base model and applies a two-step inference procedure: (i) tempering the base distribution to flatten high-confidence spikes, and (ii) tilting the tempered distribution using a lightweight classifier trained to distinguish retain from forget samples. Our theoretical analysis provides finite-sample guarantees linking the surrogate classifier's risk to unlearning error, proving that tempering is necessary to successfully unlearn for concentrated distributions. Empirical evaluations on the TOFU benchmark show that T3-Unlearning improves forget quality and generative utility over existing baselines, while training only a fraction of the parameters with a minimal runtime.

TL;DR: RLVR enhances LLM reasoning but lacks mechanisms for error attribution and knowledge reuse. Proposed MEL framework addresses this by incorporating meta-experience derived from past errors, improving benchmark performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR lacks human-like error attribution and reusable knowledge formation, limiting its effectiveness. MEL aims to address these gaps.

Method: MEL leverages LLM's self-verification to analyze correct/incorrect reasoning trajectories, identifies error points, and internalizes meta-experience into parametric memory via negative log-likelihood minimization.

Result: MEL improves benchmark performance with 3.92%--4.73% Pass@1 gains across different model sizes.

Conclusion: MEL enhances RLVR by integrating meta-experience, bridging reasoning gaps, and enabling effective knowledge reuse.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an effective approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its efficacy, RLVR faces a meta-learning bottleneck: it lacks mechanisms for error attribution and experience internalization intrinsic to the human learning cycle beyond practice and verification, thereby limiting fine-grained credit assignment and reusable knowledge formation. We term such reusable knowledge representations derived from past errors as meta-experience. Based on this insight, we propose Meta-Experience Learning (MEL), a novel framework that incorporates self-distilled meta-experience into the model's parametric memory. Building upon standard RLVR, we introduce an additional design that leverages the LLM's self-verification capability to conduct contrastive analysis on paired correct and incorrect trajectories, identify the precise bifurcation points where reasoning errors arise, and summarize them into generalizable meta-experience. The meta-experience is further internalized into the LLM's parametric memory by minimizing the negative log-likelihood, which induces a language-modeled reward signal that bridges correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories and facilitates effective knowledge reuse. Experimental results demonstrate that MEL achieves consistent improvements on benchmarks, yielding 3.92%--4.73% Pass@1 gains across varying model sizes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A self-evolving system using LLMs autonomously generates and optimizes machine learning models, outperforming traditional manual methods in speed and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization of large-scale ML systems relies on manual iterations, which is time-consuming and inefficient. Automating this process can improve development velocity and model performance.

Method: The system uses LLMs (Gemini family) with two agents: an Offline Agent for hypothesis generation using proxy metrics and an Online Agent for validation against live production metrics.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through successful production launches at YouTube, showing better speed and performance than traditional workflows.

Conclusion: Autonomous, LLM-driven evolution can surpass manual engineering workflows in optimizing large-scale ML systems.

Abstract: Optimizing large-scale machine learning systems, such as recommendation models for global video platforms, requires navigating a massive hyperparameter search space and, more critically, designing sophisticated optimizers, architectures, and reward functions to capture nuanced user behaviors. Achieving substantial improvements in these areas is a non-trivial task, traditionally relying on extensive manual iterations to test new hypotheses. We propose a self-evolving system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically those from Google's Gemini family, to autonomously generate, train, and deploy high-performing, complex model changes within an end-to-end automated workflow. The self-evolving system is comprised of an Offline Agent (Inner Loop) that performs high-throughput hypothesis generation using proxy metrics, and an Online Agent (Outer Loop) that validates candidates against delayed north star business metrics in live production. Our agents act as specialized Machine Learning Engineers (MLEs): they exhibit deep reasoning capabilities, discovering novel improvements in optimization algorithms and model architecture, and formulating innovative reward functions that target long-term user engagement. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through several successful production launches at YouTube, confirming that autonomous, LLM-driven evolution can surpass traditional engineering workflows in both development velocity and model performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method called frame-level internal tool use improves temporal grounding tasks in audio LMs, outperforming token-based approaches with faster inference and better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio LMs struggle with precise temporal tasks like word alignment and speaker diarization, especially for audio lengths outside their training distribution.

Method: The proposed approach trains audio LMs to use internal audio representations for temporal grounding, employing a binary frame classifier and an inhomogeneous Poisson process (IHP) loss.

Result: The method outperforms token-based baselines, achieving >50x speedup and robust generalization for out-of-distribution audio lengths.

Conclusion: Frame-level internal tool use offers a more efficient and accurate solution for temporal grounding tasks in audio LMs compared to traditional token-based methods.

Abstract: Large audio language models are increasingly used for complex audio understanding tasks, but they struggle with temporal tasks that require precise temporal grounding, such as word alignment and speaker diarization. The standard approach, where we generate timestamps as sequences of text tokens, is computationally expensive and prone to hallucination, especially when processing audio lengths outside the model's training distribution. In this work, we propose frame-level internal tool use, a method that trains audio LMs to use their own internal audio representations to perform temporal grounding directly. We introduce a lightweight prediction mechanism trained via two objectives: a binary frame classifier and a novel inhomogeneous Poisson process (IHP) loss that models temporal event intensity. Across word localization, speaker diarization, and event localization tasks, our approach outperforms token-based baselines. Most notably, it achieves a >50x inference speedup and demonstrates robust length generalization, maintaining high accuracy on out-of-distribution audio durations where standard token-based models collapse completely.

*Kirill Pavlenko,Alexander Golubev,Simon Karasik,Boris Yangel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Blockwise Advantage Estimation to address reward signal coupling in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by assigning separate advantages to tokens in different text blocks, reducing credit misattribution and interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO's single scalar advantage for all tokens in structured generations leads to coupling of unrelated reward signals, causing objective interference and misattributed credit. The paper aims to solve this issue.

Method: Proposes Blockwise Advantage Estimation, which assigns unique advantages to each objective's tokens. Introduces an Outcome-Conditioned Baseline to estimate advantages for later blocks without expensive nested rollouts.

Result: On math tasks with uncertainty estimation, the method mitigates reward interference, matches a state-of-the-art reward-designed approach, and preserves test-time gains from confidence-weighted ensembling.

Conclusion: Blockwise Advantage Estimation offers a modular solution for optimizing sequential objectives in structured generations without extra rollouts, addressing key challenges in GRPO.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) assigns a single scalar advantage to all tokens in a completion. For structured generations with explicit segments and objectives, this couples unrelated reward signals across segments, leading to objective interference and misattributed credit. We propose Blockwise Advantage Estimation, a family of GRPO-compatible methods that assigns each objective its own advantage and applies it only to the tokens in the corresponding text block, reducing reliance on hand-designed scalar rewards and scaling naturally to additional objectives. A key challenge is estimating advantages for later blocks whose rewards are conditioned on sampled prefixes; standard unbiased approaches require expensive nested rollouts from intermediate states. Concretely, we introduce an Outcome-Conditioned Baseline that approximates intermediate state values using only within-group statistics by stratifying samples according to a prefix-derived intermediate outcome. On math tasks with uncertainty estimation, our method mitigates reward interference, is competitive with a state-of-the-art reward-designed approach, and preserves test-time gains from confidence-weighted ensembling. More broadly, it provides a modular recipe for optimizing sequential objectives in structured generations without additional rollouts.

*Amir Asiaee,Chao Yan,Zachary B. Abrams,Bradley A. Malin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces risk-equalized DP synthesis, a method prioritizing protection for high-risk records in synthetic data by reducing their influence during generation. It shows effectiveness against membership inference attacks, especially for outliers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current differential privacy (DP) methods struggle to protect outliers effectively, making them vulnerable to empirical attacks like membership inference. The paper aims to address this gap by focusing on high-risk records.

Method: The framework uses a two-stage process: estimating outlierness with a small privacy budget and then applying DP learning with inverse risk-based weighting. This reduces outliers' influence, tightening their privacy bounds.

Result: Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate reduced membership inference success for high-risk records, with improvements linked to targeted risk-weighting, not randomness.

Conclusion: Risk-equalized DP synthesis effectively enhances privacy protection for outliers, though its success varies by dataset, emphasizing the importance of scorer quality and synthesis pipeline.

Abstract: When synthetic data is released, some individuals are harder to protect than others. A patient with a rare disease combination or a transaction with unusual characteristics stands out from the crowd. Differential privacy provides worst-case guarantees, but empirical attacks -- particularly membership inference -- succeed far more often against such outliers, especially under moderate privacy budgets and with auxiliary information.
  This paper introduces risk-equalized DP synthesis, a framework that prioritizes protection for high-risk records by reducing their influence on the learned generator. The mechanism operates in two stages: first, a small privacy budget estimates each record's "outlierness"; second, a DP learning procedure weights each record inversely to its risk score. Under Gaussian mechanisms, a record's privacy loss is proportional to its influence on the output -- so deliberately shrinking outliers' contributions yields tighter per-instance privacy bounds for precisely those records that need them most.
  We prove end-to-end DP guarantees via composition and derive closed-form per-record bounds for the synthesis stage (the scoring stage adds a uniform per-record term). Experiments on simulated data with controlled outlier injection show that risk-weighting substantially reduces membership inference success against high-outlierness records; ablations confirm that targeting -- not random downweighting -- drives the improvement. On real-world benchmarks (Breast Cancer, Adult, German Credit), gains are dataset-dependent, highlighting the interplay between scorer quality and synthesis pipeline.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve exercise recommendations by predicting student skills and matching them with homework requirements.

Method: It employs cosine similarity between student profiles (from embeddings) and problem skill vectors.

Result: Jina embeddings outperformed alternatives like TF-IDF and CodeBERT-cpp.

Conclusion: The system's recommendations based on skill predictions are more effective than correctness or time-based baselines.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a context-aware recommender system that models students' programming skills using embeddings of the source code they submit throughout a course. These embeddings predict students' skills across multiple programming topics, producing profiles that are matched to the skills required by unseen homework problems. To generate recommendations, we compute the cosine similarity between student profiles and problem skill vectors, ranking exercises according to their alignment with each student's current abilities. We evaluated our approach using real data from students and exercises in an introductory programming course at our university. First, we assessed the effectiveness of our source code embeddings for predicting skills, comparing them with token-based and graph-based alternatives. Results showed that Jina embeddings outperformed TF-IDF, CodeBERT-cpp, and GraphCodeBERT across most skills. Additionally, we evaluated the system's ability to recommend exercises aligned with weekly course content by analyzing student submissions collected over seven course offerings. Our approach consistently produced more suitable recommendations than baselines based on correctness or solution time, indicating that predicted programming skills provide a stronger signal for problem recommendation.

TL;DR: GLIMARK extends multiple kernel learning to handle diverse outcome types within the exponential family, demonstrating effectiveness in predicting ICU escalation from COVID-19 chest X-rays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single kernel methods are limited in capturing complex data patterns, and traditional MKL lacks flexibility for non-continuous outcomes.

Method: Proposes GLIMARK, integrating multiple kernels for generalized linear models, validated on COVID-19 chest X-ray data.

Result: GLIMARK effectively recovers true data mechanisms and identifies clinically meaningful features.

Conclusion: GLIMARK is a versatile and practical tool for diverse data types and real-world applications.

Abstract: Kernel methods have been extensively utilized in machine learning for classification and prediction tasks due to their ability to capture complex non-linear data patterns. However, single kernel approaches are inherently limited, as they rely on a single type of kernel function (e.g., Gaussian kernel), which may be insufficient to fully represent the heterogeneity or multifaceted nature of real-world data. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) addresses these limitations by constructing composite kernels from simpler ones and integrating information from heterogeneous sources. Despite these advances, traditional MKL methods are primarily designed for continuous outcomes. We extend MKL to accommodate the outcome variable belonging to the exponential family, representing a broader variety of data types, and refer to our proposed method as generalized linear models with integrated multiple additive regression with kernels (GLIMARK). Empirically, we demonstrate that GLIMARK can effectively recover or approximate the true data-generating mechanism. We have applied it to a COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, predicting binary outcomes of ICU escalation and extracting clinically meaningful features, underscoring the practical utility of this approach in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' ability to perform quantitative causal reasoning in continuous domains using Linear-LLM-SCM, a benchmarking framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' underexplored potential in estimating effect sizes for quantitative causal reasoning.

Method: Linear-LLM-SCM decomposes a DAG into local parent-child sets and prompts LLMs to produce regression-style equations, comparing results to ground-truth.

Result: Experiments reveal challenges like stochasticity, susceptibility to DAG misspecification, and variability in coefficient estimates.

Conclusion: LLMs currently have limitations as quantitative causal parameterizers, but the framework is open-sourced for broader evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in identifying qualitative causal relations, but their ability to perform quantitative causal reasoning -- estimating effect sizes that parametrize functional relationships -- remains underexplored in continuous domains. We introduce Linear-LLM-SCM, a plug-and-play benchmarking framework for evaluating LLMs on linear Gaussian structural causal model (SCM) parametrization when the DAG is given. The framework decomposes a DAG into local parent-child sets and prompts an LLM to produce a regression-style structural equation per node, which is aggregated and compared against available ground-truth parameters. Our experiments show several challenges in such benchmarking tasks, namely, strong stochasticity in the results in some of the models and susceptibility to DAG misspecification via spurious edges in the continuous domains. Across models, we observe substantial variability in coefficient estimates for some settings and sensitivity to structural and semantic perturbations, highlighting current limitations of LLMs as quantitative causal parameterizers. We also open-sourced the benchmarking framework so that researchers can utilize their DAGs and any off-the-shelf LLMs plug-and-play for evaluation in their domains effortlessly.

### [152] [Configuration-to-Performance Scaling Law with Neural Ansatz](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10300)
*Huaqing Zhang,Kaiyue Wen,Tengyu Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural Configuration-to-Performance Scaling Law (NCPL), an LLM-based model predicting training performance across diverse hyperparameters, outperforming traditional scaling laws like Chinchilla.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scaling laws assume optimal hyperparameters, which is often unrealistic due to hardware constraints or tuning complexity. NCPL aims to generalize performance prediction across varied configurations.

Method: The authors use a large language model (LLM) to parameterize a mapping from full training configurations to performance, trained on diverse pretraining logs.

Result: NCPL reduces prediction error by 20-40% compared to Chinchilla, scales to 10x more compute, and supports joint hyperparameter tuning and loss-curve prediction.

Conclusion: NCPL offers a flexible, accurate alternative to traditional scaling laws, enhancing predictability and simplifying large-scale hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Researchers build scaling laws to forecast the training performance of expensive large-scale runs with larger model size N and data size D. These laws assume that other training hyperparameters are optimally chosen, which can require significant effort and, in some cases, be impossible due to external hardware constraints. To improve predictability across a broader set of hyperparameters and enable simpler tuning at scale, we propose learning a \textit{Configuration-to-Performance Scaling Law} (CPL): a mapping from the \textit{full training configuration} to training performance. Because no simple functional form can express this mapping, we parameterize it with a large language model (LLM), and fit it with diverse open-source pretraining logs across multiple sources, yielding a \textit{Neural} Configuration-to-Performance Scaling Law (NCPL). NCPL accurately predicts how training configurations influence the final pretraining loss, achieving 20-40% lower prediction error than the configuration-agnostic Chinchilla law and generalizing to runs using up to 10 x more compute than any run in the training set. It further supports joint tuning of multiple hyperparameters with performance comparable to hyperparameter scaling law baselines. Finally, NCPL naturally and effectively extends to richer prediction targets such as loss-curve prediction.

*Haoling Wang,Lang Zeng,Tao Sun,Youngjoo Cho,Ying Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ICODEN is a neural network-based method using differential equations for flexible survival prediction with interval-censored data, handling high-dimensional predictors without strong assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing survival analysis methods for interval-censored data often rely on strong assumptions or struggle with high-dimensional predictors, limiting their practicality.

Method: ICODEN employs ordinary differential equations and deep neural networks to model hazard functions, avoiding proportional hazards assumptions or parametric forms.

Result: Simulations and real-world applications (ADNI, AREDS, AREDS2) show ICODEN's accuracy and stability in high-dimensional settings, effectively identifying risk subgroups.

Conclusion: ICODEN is a versatile tool for interval-censored survival prediction in biomedical research, accommodating complex data without restrictive assumptions.

Abstract: Predicting time-to-event outcomes when event times are interval censored is challenging because the exact event time is unobserved. Many existing survival analysis approaches for interval-censored data rely on strong model assumptions or cannot handle high-dimensional predictors. We develop ICODEN, an ordinary differential equation-based neural network for interval-censored data that models the hazard function through deep neural networks and obtains the cumulative hazard by solving an ordinary differential equation. ICODEN does not require the proportional hazards assumption or a prespecified parametric form for the hazard function, thereby permitting flexible survival modeling. Across simulation settings with proportional or non-proportional hazards and both linear and nonlinear covariate effects, ICODEN consistently achieves satisfactory predictive accuracy and remains stable as the number of predictors increases. Applications to data from multiple phases of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and to two Age-Related Eye Disease Studies (AREDS and AREDS2) for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) demonstrate ICODEN's robust prediction performance. In both applications, predicting time-to-AD or time-to-late AMD, ICODEN effectively uses hundreds to more than 1,000 SNPs and supports data-driven subgroup identification with differential progression risk profiles. These results establish ICODEN as a practical assumption-lean tool for prediction with interval-censored survival data in high-dimensional biomedical settings.

TL;DR: Proposes learning reward shaping functions from offline datasets for continuous control RL, addressing unobserved confounders via causal Bellman equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing effective reward shaping functions for continuous control RL lacks principled methods, especially under unobserved confounders.

Method: Uses causal Bellman equation to learn optimal state value bounds, applied as potentials in PBRS framework.

Result: Tested with SAC on benchmarks; shows robust performance despite unobserved confounders.

Conclusion: First step towards confounding-robust continuous control from a causal perspective.

Abstract: Reward shaping has been applied widely to accelerate Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents' training. However, a principled way of designing effective reward shaping functions, especially for complex continuous control problems, remains largely under-explained. In this work, we propose to automatically learn a reward shaping function for continuous control problems from offline datasets, potentially contaminated by unobserved confounding variables. Specifically, our method builds upon the recently proposed causal Bellman equation to learn a tight upper bound on the optimal state values, which is then used as the potentials in the Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) framework. Our proposed reward shaping algorithm is tested with Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) on multiple commonly used continuous control benchmarks and exhibits strong performance guarantees under unobserved confounders. More broadly, our work marks a solid first step towards confounding robust continuous control from a causal perspective. Code for training our reward shaping functions can be found at https://github.com/mateojuliani/confounding_robust_cont_control.

### [155] [R2RAG-Flood: A reasoning-reinforced training-free retrieval augmentation generation framework for flood damage nowcasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10312)
*Lipai Huang,Kai Yin,Chia-Fu Liu,Ali Mostafavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: R2RAG-Flood is a training-free framework for post-storm property damage prediction, leveraging retrieval-augmented generation and reasoning trajectories to achieve competitive accuracy without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to improve post-storm property damage nowcasting by combining structured data with natural language reasoning, avoiding the need for costly task-specific training or fine-tuning.

Method: The framework uses a reasoning-centric knowledge base and retrieves relevant reasoning trajectories for inference, enabling adaptability without new parameter learning. Predictions follow a two-stage procedure with severity correction.

Result: R2RAG-Flood achieves 0.613-0.668 overall accuracy and 0.757-0.896 damage class accuracy, nearing supervised baselines while providing rationales. Lightweight variants show higher efficiency.

Conclusion: R2RAG-Flood effectively balances accuracy and efficiency for property damage nowcasting, offering interpretable predictions without task-specific training.

Abstract: R2RAG-Flood is a reasoning-reinforced, training-free retrieval-augmented generation framework for post-storm property damage nowcasting. Building on an existing supervised tabular predictor, the framework constructs a reasoning-centric knowledge base composed of labeled tabular records, where each sample includes structured predictors, a compact natural language text-mode summary, and a model-generated reasoning trajectory. During inference, R2RAG-Flood issues context-augmented prompts that retrieve and condition on relevant reasoning trajectories from nearby geospatial neighbors and canonical class prototypes, enabling the large language model backbone to emulate and adapt prior reasoning rather than learn new task-specific parameters. Predictions follow a two-stage procedure that first determines property damage occurrence and then refines severity within a three-level Property Damage Extent categorization, with a conditional downgrade step to correct over-predicted severity. In a case study of Harris County, Texas at the 12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code scale, the supervised tabular baseline trained directly on structured predictors achieves 0.714 overall accuracy and 0.859 damage class accuracy for medium and high damage classes. Across seven large language model backbones, R2RAG-Flood attains 0.613 to 0.668 overall accuracy and 0.757 to 0.896 damage class accuracy, approaching the supervised baseline while additionally producing a structured rationale for each prediction. Using a severity-per-cost efficiency metric derived from API pricing and GPU instance costs, lightweight R2RAG-Flood variants demonstrate substantially higher efficiency than both the supervised tabular baseline and larger language models, while requiring no task-specific training or fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PUMA improves MDMs by aligning training-time and inference-time masking patterns, speeding up training without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDMs face challenges due to the computational expense of training on random masks and a mismatch between training and inference masks.

Method: PUMA modifies the forward masking process to align training and inference masks, optimizing for inference-aligned patterns.

Result: PUMA speeds up pretraining by ≈2.5× and complements techniques like autoregressive initialization.

Conclusion: PUMA effectively reduces training complexity for MDMs while maintaining performance, offering practical benefits for generative modeling.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete spaces. By generating sequences in any order and allowing for parallel decoding, they enable fast inference and strong performance on non-causal tasks. However, this flexibility comes with a training complexity trade-off: MDMs train on an exponentially large set of masking patterns, which is not only computationally expensive, but also creates a train--test mismatch between the random masks used in training and the highly structured masks induced by inference-time unmasking. In this work, we propose Progressive UnMAsking (PUMA), a simple modification of the forward masking process that aligns training-time and inference-time masking patterns, thereby focusing optimization on inference-aligned masks and speeding up training. Empirically, PUMA speeds up pretraining at the 125M scale by $\approx 2.5\times$ and offers complementary advantages on top of common recipes like autoregressive initialization. We open-source our codebase at https://github.com/JaeyeonKim01/PUMA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a theoretical framework to analyze contrastive learning with Transformers under imbalanced data, revealing training dynamics and proposing pruning as a solution to restore performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical understanding of contrastive learning under imbalanced data distributions, which degrade representation quality and induce bias.

Method: Theoretical analysis of contrastive learning with Transformer-based encoders, focusing on neuron weight evolution and feature dynamics.

Result: Neuron weights evolve through three stages, minority features reduce capacity, and pruning restores performance and enhances feature separation.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into contrastive learning dynamics under imbalance and suggests pruning as a practical solution.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful framework for learning generalizable representations, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited, particularly under imbalanced data distributions that are prevalent in real-world applications. Such an imbalance can degrade representation quality and induce biased model behavior, yet a rigorous characterization of these effects is lacking. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the training dynamics of contrastive learning with Transformer-based encoders under imbalanced data. Our results reveal that neuron weights evolve through three distinct stages of training, with different dynamics for majority features, minority features, and noise. We further show that minority features reduce representational capacity, increase the need for more complex architectures, and hinder the separation of ground-truth features from noise. Inspired by these neuron-level behaviors, we show that pruning restores performance degraded by imbalance and enhances feature separation, offering both conceptual insights and practical guidance. Major theoretical findings are validated through numerical experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces model diffing to uncover unexpected behavioral differences in LLMs, comparing LLM-based and SAE-based methods with new evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM evaluations miss unforeseen behavioral shifts or misalignments. The study aims to systematically compare methods for identifying these differences.

Method: Proposes evaluation metrics (generalization, interestingness, abstraction level) to compare LLM-based and SAE-based model diffing approaches.

Result: An improved LLM-based baseline matches SAE-based performance but often highlights more abstract differences.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of LLM-based methods for revealing abstract behavioral differences in LLMs.

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluations only test capabilities or dispositions that evaluators designed them for, missing unexpected differences such as behavioral shifts between model revisions or emergent misaligned tendencies. Model diffing addresses this limitation by automatically surfacing systematic behavioral differences. Recent approaches include LLM-based methods that generate natural language descriptions and sparse autoencoder (SAE)-based methods that identify interpretable features. However, no systematic comparison of these approaches exists nor are there established evaluation criteria. We address this gap by proposing evaluation metrics for key desiderata (generalization, interestingness, and abstraction level) and use these to compare existing methods. Our results show that an improved LLM-based baseline performs comparably to the SAE-based method while typically surfacing more abstract behavioral differences.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hardware-software co-design framework for optimizing Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) in resource-constrained settings, balancing accuracy and latency through empirical scaling laws and architecture search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient on-device LLM deployment in autonomous systems requires balancing accuracy with hardware constraints, necessitating tailored architectural solutions.

Method: The authors propose a hardware co-design law modeling training loss and inference latency, evaluate 1,942 architectures, and formulate architecture search as a joint optimization problem.

Result: Their co-designed architecture reduces perplexity by 19.42% at the same latency as a baseline model, speeding up architecture selection from months to days.

Conclusion: This work presents the first principled framework for hardware co-design scaling laws in on-device LLMs, with publicly available code and checkpoints.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) have emerged as a key paradigm of Physical AI and are increasingly deployed in autonomous vehicles, robots, and smart spaces. In these resource-constrained on-device settings, selecting an appropriate large language model (LLM) backbone is a critical challenge: models must balance accuracy with strict inference latency and hardware efficiency constraints. This makes hardware-software co-design a game-changing requirement for on-device LLM deployment, where each hardware platform demands a tailored architectural solution. We propose a hardware co-design law that jointly captures model accuracy and inference performance. Specifically, we model training loss as an explicit function of architectural hyperparameters and characterise inference latency via roofline modelling. We empirically evaluate 1,942 candidate architectures on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, training 170 selected models for 10B tokens each to fit a scaling law relating architecture to training loss. By coupling this scaling law with latency modelling, we establish a direct accuracy-latency correspondence and identify the Pareto frontier for hardware co-designed LLMs. We further formulate architecture search as a joint optimisation over precision and performance, deriving feasible design regions under industrial hardware and application budgets. Our approach reduces architecture selection from months to days. At the same latency as Qwen2.5-0.5B on the target hardware, our co-designed architecture achieves 19.42% lower perplexity on WikiText-2. To our knowledge, this is the first principled and operational framework for hardware co-design scaling laws in on-device LLM deployment. We will make the code and related checkpoints publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates machine learning and deep learning methods to identify childhood malnutrition in Nepal, using data from the 2019 MICS. TabNet outperformed other models, with key predictors including maternal education and household wealth. The approach offers scalable screening for malnutrition risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address labor-intensive and inaccessible conventional malnutrition screening in Nepal's remote areas, this study explores efficient machine learning solutions.

Method: The study compares 16 algorithms (deep learning, gradient boosting, traditional ML) using Nepal MICS 2019 data, focusing on a composite malnutrition indicator evaluated via ten metrics, prioritizing F1-score and recall.

Result: TabNet performed best due to its attention-based architecture. Key predictors were maternal education, household wealth, child age, geography, vaccination, and meal frequency.

Conclusion: The framework provides scalable malnutrition screening for Nepal and transferable methods for low-resource settings globally, aiding Sustainable Development Goals.

Abstract: Childhood malnutrition remains a major public health concern in Nepal and other low-resource settings, while conventional case-finding approaches are labor-intensive and frequently unavailable in remote areas. This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of machine learning and deep learning methodologies for identifying malnutrition among children under five years of age in Nepal. We systematically compared 16 algorithms spanning deep learning, gradient boosting, and traditional machine learning families, using data from the Nepal Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019. A composite malnutrition indicator was constructed by integrating stunting, wasting, and underweight status, and model performance was evaluated using ten metrics, with emphasis on F1-score and recall to account for substantial class imbalance and the high cost of failing to detect malnourished children. Among all models, TabNet demonstrated the best performance, likely attributable to its attention-based architecture, and outperformed both support vector machine and AdaBoost classifiers. A consensus feature importance analysis identified maternal education, household wealth index, and child age as the primary predictors of malnutrition, followed by geographic characteristics, vaccination status, and meal frequency. Collectively, these results demonstrate a scalable, survey-based screening framework for identifying children at elevated risk of malnutrition and for guiding targeted nutritional interventions. The proposed approach supports Nepal's progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals and offers a transferable methodological template for similar low-resource settings globally.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LITT introduces a Timing-Transformer to align sequential events on a relative timeline, improving personalized event prediction and outperforming existing methods in clinical AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precision medicine requires personalized sequential event discovery from time-series data, but current AI models lack timing awareness, limiting causal reasoning.

Method: LITT uses a Timing-Transformer to assign relative timestamps and enable event-timing-focused attention for personalized clinical trajectory analysis.

Result: Validated on 3,276 breast cancer patients, LITT predicts cardiotoxicity timing accurately and outperforms benchmark survival analysis methods.

Conclusion: LITT advances precision medicine by integrating event timing into AI models, enhancing clinical trajectory interpretation and prediction.

Abstract: Automatically discovering personalized sequential events from large-scale time-series data is crucial for enabling precision medicine in clinical research, yet it remains a formidable challenge even for contemporary AI models. For example, while transformers capture rich associations, they are mostly agnostic to event timing and ordering, thereby bypassing potential causal reasoning.
  Intuitively, we need a method capable of evaluating the "degree of alignment" among patient-specific trajectories and identifying their shared patterns, i.e., the significant events in a consistent sequence. This necessitates treating timing as a true \emph{computable} dimension, allowing models to assign ``relative timestamps'' to candidate events beyond their observed physical times.
  In this work, we introduce LITT, a novel Timing-Transformer architecture that enables temporary alignment of sequential events on a virtual ``relative timeline'', thereby enabling \emph{event-timing-focused attention} and personalized interpretations of clinical trajectories. Its interpretability and effectiveness are validated on real-world longitudinal EHR data from 3,276 breast cancer patients to predict the onset timing of cardiotoxicity-induced heart disease. Furthermore, LITT outperforms both the benchmark and state-of-the-art survival analysis methods on public datasets, positioning it as a significant step forward for precision medicine in clinical AI.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structural encoding strategy for graph-to-text translation using human-interpretable color tokens derived from Weisfeiler-Lehman similarity classes to improve LLM performance on graph tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph problems pose challenges for LLMs due to their text-based representations lacking explicit structure and permutation invariance. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The method involves encoding graph structure via WL similarity classes mapped to color tokens, integrating graph dependencies into natural language prompts.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in LLM performance on algorithmic and predictive graph tasks across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Human-interpretable structural encoding enhances LLMs' ability to handle graph tasks, particularly those requiring global structure reasoning.

Abstract: Graph problems are fundamentally challenging for large language models (LLMs). While LLMs excel at processing unstructured text, graph tasks require reasoning over explicit structure, permutation invariance, and computationally complex relationships, creating a mismatch with the representations of text-based models. Our work investigates how LLMs can be effectively applied to graph problems despite these barriers. We introduce a human-interpretable structural encoding strategy for graph-to-text translation that injects graph structure directly into natural language prompts. Our method involves computing a variant of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) similarity classes and maps them to human-like color tokens rather than numeric labels. The key insight is that semantically meaningful and human-interpretable cues may be more effectively processed by LLMs than opaque symbolic encoding. Experimental results on multiple algorithmic and predictive graph tasks show the considerable improvements by our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets. By capturing both local and global-range dependencies, our method enhances LLM performance especially on graph tasks that require reasoning over global graph structure.

TL;DR: The paper explores using large models as partial world models focused on affordances to improve search efficiency and accuracy in achieving task-agnostic, language-conditioned intents. Empirical results show better performance compared to full world models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full world models are inefficient and inaccurate for direct search, while partial models linked to affordances can achieve user intents more effectively. The study questions whether large models can serve as such partial models.

Method: The paper formalizes the concept of partial-world models informed by affordances, introduces distribution-robust affordances for multi-task settings, and empirically evaluates them in tabletop robotics tasks.

Result: Affordance-aware partial models reduce search branching factors and achieve higher rewards compared to full world models.

Conclusion: Large models can be effectively posited as partial world models, improving search efficiency and task performance in robotics applications.

Abstract: Full models of the world require complex knowledge of immense detail. While pre-trained large models have been hypothesized to contain similar knowledge due to extensive pre-training on vast amounts of internet scale data, using them directly in a search procedure is inefficient and inaccurate. Conversely, partial models focus on making high quality predictions for a subset of state and actions: those linked through affordances that achieve user intents~\citep{khetarpal2020can}. Can we posit large models as partial world models? We provide a formal answer to this question, proving that agents achieving task-agnostic, language-conditioned intents necessarily possess predictive partial-world models informed by affordances. In the multi-task setting, we introduce distribution-robust affordances and show that partial models can be extracted to significantly improve search efficiency. Empirical evaluations in tabletop robotics tasks demonstrate that our affordance-aware partial models reduce the search branching factor and achieve higher rewards compared to full world models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: When designing new materials, it is often necessary to tailor the material design (with respect to its design parameters) to have some desired properties (e.g. Young's modulus). As the set of design parameters grow, the search space grows exponentially, making the actual synthesis and evaluation of all material combinations virtually impossible. Even using traditional computational methods such as Finite Element Analysis becomes too computationally heavy to search the design space. Recent methods use machine learning (ML) surrogate models to more efficiently determine optimal material designs; unfortunately, these methods often (i) are notoriously difficult to interpret and (ii) under perform when the training data comes from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We suggest the use of tensor completion methods as an all-in-one approach for interpretability and predictions. We observe classical tensor methods are able to compete with traditional ML in predictions, with the added benefit of their interpretable tensor factors (which are given completely for free, as a result of the prediction). In our experiments, we are able to rediscover physical phenomena via the tensor factors, indicating that our predictions are aligned with the true underlying physics of the problem. This also means these tensor factors could be used by experimentalists to identify potentially novel patterns, given we are able to rediscover existing ones. We also study the effects of both types of surrogate models when we encounter training data from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We observe more specialized tensor methods that can give better generalization in these non-uniforms sampling scenarios. We find the best generalization comes from a tensor model, which is able to improve upon the baseline ML methods by up to 5% on aggregate $R^2$, and halve the error in some out of distribution regions.

TL;DR: LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, matches full fine-tuning in accuracy for organic reaction prediction while reducing catastrophic forgetting and better preserving multi-task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting large language models (LLMs) to domain-specific chemical datasets is crucial for chemical and pharmaceutical R&D, but requires balancing new knowledge acquisition with preserving general chemical understanding.

Method: The study evaluates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for organic reaction prediction on limited datasets (USPTO reaction classes and C-H functionalisation reactions), benchmarking tasks like forward reaction prediction, retrosynthesis, and reagent prediction.

Result: LoRA achieves comparable accuracy to full fine-tuning, mitigates catastrophic forgetting, and preserves multi-task performance better. It also reveals subtly different reactivity patterns in C-H functionalisation, suggesting more effective reaction-specific adaptation.

Conclusion: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies like LoRA are practical for scaling LLMs in chemistry applications, offering flexibility and modularity.

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) trained on broad organic chemistry to smaller, domain-specific reaction datasets is a key challenge in chemical and pharmaceutical R&D. Effective specialisation requires learning new reaction knowledge while preserving general chemical understanding across related tasks. Here, we evaluate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as a parameter-efficient alternative to full fine-tuning for organic reaction prediction on limited, complex datasets. Using USPTO reaction classes and challenging C-H functionalisation reactions, we benchmark forward reaction prediction, retrosynthesis and reagent prediction. LoRA achieves accuracy comparable to full fine-tuning while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting and better preserving multi-task performance. Both fine-tuning approaches generalise beyond training distributions, producing plausible alternative solvent predictions. Notably, C-H functionalisation fine-tuning reveals that LoRA and full fine-tuning encode subtly different reactivity patterns, suggesting more effective reaction-specific adaptation with LoRA. As LLMs continue to scale, our results highlight the practicality of modular, parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for their flexible deployment for chemistry applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TaperNorm replaces RMSNorm/LayerNorm by tapering to a fixed scaling, enabling norm-free Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on sample-dependent normalization in Transformers and improve efficiency.

Method: Introduces TaperNorm, which transitions from standard normalization to fixed scaling, eliminating per-token statistics.

Result: Matches performance of normalized baselines, increases throughput by 1.22×, and enables folding normalization layers.

Conclusion: TaperNorm achieves norm-free Transformers by isolating scale anchoring as key.

Abstract: Normalization is widely viewed as essential for stabilizing Transformer training. We revisit this assumption for pre-norm Transformers and ask to what extent sample-dependent normalization is needed inside Transformer blocks. We introduce TaperNorm, a drop-in replacement for RMSNorm/LayerNorm that behaves exactly like the standard normalizer early in training and then smoothly tapers to a learned sample-independent linear/affine map. A single global gate is held at $g{=}1$ during gate warmup, used to calibrate the scaling branch via EMAs, and then cosine-decayed to $g{=}0$, at which point per-token statistics vanish and the resulting fixed scalings can be folded into adjacent linear projections. Our theoretical and empirical results isolate scale anchoring as the key role played by output normalization: as a (near) $0$-homogeneous map it removes radial gradients at the output, whereas without such an anchor cross-entropy encourages unbounded logit growth (``logit chasing''). We further show that a simple fixed-target auxiliary loss on the pre-logit residual-stream scale provides an explicit alternative anchor and can aid removal of the final normalization layer. Empirically, TaperNorm matches normalized baselines under identical setups while eliminating per-token statistics and enabling these layers to be folded into adjacent linear projections at inference. On an efficiency microbenchmark, folding internal scalings yields up to $1.22\times$ higher throughput in last-token logits mode. These results take a step towards norm-free Transformers while identifying the special role output normalization plays.

*Alex Bie,Travis Dick,Alex Kulesza,Prabhakar Raghavan,Vinod Raman,Sergei Vassilvitskii*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Modern AI models excel in advanced math but struggle with basic arithmetic, particularly multi-digit addition due to operand misalignment and carrying errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand why advanced AI models perform poorly on simple arithmetic tasks despite their success in complex mathematics.

Method: The investigation systematically analyzes errors in integer addition across frontier models (Claude Opus 4.1, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro), categorizing mistakes into operand misalignment and carrying failures.

Result: Most errors fall into two interpretable categories: operand misalignment (linked to tokenization) and carrying failures (random). These explain 87.9%, 62.9%, and 92.4% of errors in the tested models.

Conclusion: The findings highlight specific weaknesses in AI arithmetic, suggesting improvements in tokenization and error-handling mechanisms could enhance performance.

Abstract: Modern AI systems have been successfully deployed to win medals at international math competitions, assist with research workflows, and prove novel technical lemmas. However, despite their progress at advanced levels of mathematics, they remain stubbornly bad at basic arithmetic, consistently failing on the simple task of adding two numbers. We present a systematic investigation of this phenomenon. We demonstrate empirically that all frontier models suffer significantly degraded accuracy for integer addition as the number of digits increases. Furthermore, we show that most errors made by these models are highly interpretable and can be attributed to either operand misalignment or a failure to correctly carry; these two error classes explain 87.9%, 62.9%, and 92.4% of Claude Opus 4.1, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro errors, respectively. Finally, we show that misalignment errors are frequently related to tokenization, and that carrying errors appear largely as independent random failures.

*Sai Surya Duvvuri,Nirmal Patel,Nilesh Gupta,Inderjit S. Dhillon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LUCID Attention, a novel architectural modification using preconditioning, improves long-context retrieval performance without increasing computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax-based attention struggles with long sequences due to diffused probability mass and vanishing gradients when temperature is lowered.

Method: LUCID applies a preconditioner derived from exponentiated key-key similarities to reduce overlap in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: LUCID shows significant improvements (up to 18% on BABILong, 14% on RULER) in long-context tasks compared to standard attention.

Conclusion: LUCID Attention effectively addresses long-context limitations without sacrificing learnability or computational efficiency.

Abstract: Softmax-based dot-product attention is a cornerstone of Transformer architectures, enabling remarkable capabilities such as in-context learning. However, as context lengths increase, a fundamental limitation of the softmax function emerges: it tends to diffuse probability mass to irrelevant tokens degrading performance in long-sequence scenarios. Furthermore, attempts to sharpen focus by lowering softmax temperature hinder learnability due to vanishing gradients. We introduce LUCID Attention, an architectural modification that applies a preconditioner to the attention probabilities. This preconditioner, derived from exponentiated key-key similarities, minimizes overlap between the keys in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, thus allowing the query to focus on important keys among large number of keys accurately with same computational complexity as standard attention. Additionally, LUCID's preconditioning-based approach to retrieval bypasses the need for low temperature and the learnability problems associated with it. We validate our approach by training ~1 billion parameter language models evaluated on up to 128K tokens. Our results demonstrate significant gains on long-context retrieval tasks, specifically retrieval tasks from BABILong, RULER, SCROLLS and LongBench. For instance, LUCID achieves up to 18% improvement in BABILong and 14% improvement in RULER multi-needle performance compared to standard attention.

*Zhongyao Wang,Taoyong Cui,Jiawen Zou,Shufei Zhang,Bo Yan,Wanli Ouyang,Weimin Tan,Mao Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces $	ext{e}^2$IP, an equivariant evidential deep learning framework for uncertainty quantification in MLIPs, addressing challenges in vector-valued uncertainty modeling and outperforming existing methods in accuracy, efficiency, and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for reliable machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) in molecular dynamics, but existing UQ methods are either costly or ineffective. Evidential deep learning (EDL) offers a promising alternative but faces challenges when extended to vector-valued quantities like atomic forces.

Method: The authors propose $	ext{e}^2$IP, a backbone-agnostic framework that models atomic forces and their uncertainty using a full $3	imes3$ symmetric positive definite covariance tensor, ensuring rotational equivariance.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that $	ext{e}^2$IP outperforms non-equivariant evidential baselines and ensemble methods in accuracy, efficiency, and reliability, while also improving data efficiency.

Conclusion: $	ext{e}^2$IP provides a robust solution for uncertainty quantification in MLIPs, combining theoretical grounding with practical benefits like equivariance and single-model efficiency.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is critical for assessing the reliability of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, identifying extrapolation regimes and enabling uncertainty-aware workflows such as active learning for training dataset construction. Existing UQ approaches for MLIPs are often limited by high computational cost or suboptimal performance. Evidential deep learning (EDL) provides a theoretically grounded single-model alternative that determines both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a single forward pass. However, extending evidential formulations from scalar targets to vector-valued quantities such as atomic forces introduces substantial challenges, particularly in maintaining statistical self-consistency under rotational transformations. To address this, we propose \textit{Equivariant Evidential Deep Learning for Interatomic Potentials} ($\text{e}^2$IP), a backbone-agnostic framework that models atomic forces and their uncertainty jointly by representing uncertainty as a full $3\times3$ symmetric positive definite covariance tensor that transforms equivariantly under rotations. Experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks show that $\text{e}^2$IP provides a stronger accuracy-efficiency-reliability balance than the non-equivariant evidential baseline and the widely used ensemble method. It also achieves better data efficiency through the fully equivariant architecture while retaining single-model inference efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LightGTS-Cov extends LightGTS by integrating covariates residually, outperforming baselines in covariate-rich applications like energy forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series foundation models often poorly handle exogenous covariates, limiting their effectiveness in applications like electricity price forecasting.

Method: LightGTS-Cov enhances LightGTS with a small MLP plug-in ($\sim$0.1M parameters) to integrate time-aligned covariates residually during decoding.

Result: LightGTS-Cov consistently outperforms LightGTS and other baselines on covariate-aware benchmarks, showing strong accuracy in real-world energy applications.

Conclusion: LightGTS-Cov is effective for covariate-rich forecasting tasks, validated by its practical performance in industrial settings.

Abstract: Time series foundation models are typically pre-trained on large, multi-source datasets; however, they often ignore exogenous covariates or incorporate them via simple concatenation with the target series, which limits their effectiveness in covariate-rich applications such as electricity price forecasting and renewable energy forecasting. We introduce LightGTS-Cov, a covariate-enhanced extension of LightGTS that preserves its lightweight, period-aware backbone while explicitly incorporating both past and future-known covariates. Built on a $\sim$1M-parameter LightGTS backbone, LightGTS-Cov adds only a $\sim$0.1M-parameter MLP plug-in that integrates time-aligned covariates into the target forecasts by residually refining the outputs of the decoding process. Across covariate-aware benchmarks on electricity price and energy generation datasets, LightGTS-Cov consistently outperforms LightGTS and achieves superior performance over other covariate-aware baselines under both settings, regardless of whether future-known covariates are provided. We further demonstrate its practical value in two real-world energy case applications: long-term photovoltaic power forecasting with future weather forecasts and day-ahead electricity price forecasting with weather and dispatch-plan covariates. Across both applications, LightGTS-Cov achieves strong forecasting accuracy and stable operational performance after deployment, validating its effectiveness in real-world industrial settings.

TL;DR: DRPO addresses model collapse in offline RL recommendation by identifying high-quality data within noisy logs, reformulating the objective as a DRO problem, and using hard filtering for optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy-based RL struggles with low-quality offline data, causing severe model collapse. The paper aims to solve this by uncovering high-quality data entangled in noisy logs.

Method: Proposes DRPO, which reformulates the objective as an Optimistic DRO problem. Hard filtering is proven as the exact solution to recover high-quality behaviors.

Result: DRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on mixed-quality recommendation benchmarks.

Conclusion: DRPO successfully breaks the curse of model collapse in offline RL by rigorously identifying and utilizing high-quality data.

Abstract: Policy-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) has established itself as the dominant paradigm in generative recommendation for optimizing sequential user interactions. However, when applied to offline historical logs, these methods suffer a critical failure: the dominance of low-quality data induces severe model collapse. We first establish the Divergence Theory of Repulsive Optimization, revealing that negative gradient updates inherently trigger exponential intensity explosion during off-policy training. This theory elucidates the inherent dilemma of existing methods, exposing their inability to reconcile variance reduction and noise imitation. To break this curse, we argue that the solution lies in rigorously identifying the latent high-quality distribution entangled within the noisy behavior policy. Accordingly, we reformulate the objective as an Optimistic Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) problem. Guided by this formulation, we propose Distributionally Robust Policy Optimization (DRPO). We prove that hard filtering is the exact solution to this DRO objective, enabling DRPO to optimally recover high-quality behaviors while strictly discarding divergence-inducing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on mixed-quality recommendation benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like mileage don't capture mechanical burden, and unsupervised deep learning often misses high-load steady states critical for drivetrain fatigue.

Method: Proposes a Dual-Stream Architecture integrating unsupervised anomaly detection with macroscopic physics proxies for cumulative load estimation, using low-frequency sensor data.

Result: Validated on RISC-V embedded platform, the solution shows low computational overhead, enabling edge-based health monitoring on resource-constrained ECUs.

Conclusion: The architecture effectively distinguishes dynamic hazards from sustained mechanical effort, offering a practical solution for predictive maintenance in fleets.

Abstract: Runtime quantification of vehicle operational intensity is essential for predictive maintenance and condition monitoring in commercial and heavy-duty fleets. Traditional metrics like mileage fail to capture mechanical burden, while unsupervised deep learning models detect statistical anomalies, typically transient surface shocks, but often conflate statistical stability with mechanical rest. We identify this as a critical blind spot: high-load steady states, such as hill climbing with heavy payloads, appear statistically normal yet impose significant drivetrain fatigue. To resolve this, we propose a Dual-Stream Architecture that fuses unsupervised learning for surface anomaly detection with macroscopic physics proxies for cumulative load estimation. This approach leverages low-frequency sensor data to generate a multi-dimensional health vector, distinguishing between dynamic hazards and sustained mechanical effort. Validated on a RISC-V embedded platform, the architecture demonstrates low computational overhead, enabling comprehensive, edge-based health monitoring on resource-constrained ECUs without the latency or bandwidth costs of cloud-based monitoring.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores transferring flow matching techniques to binary manifolds, identifies issues with velocity-based objectives, and proposes signal-space alignment for robust training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the success of flow matching in generative modeling to binary manifolds and address challenges like gradient sensitivity due to structural mismatches.

Method: Investigates x-prediction and v-loss coupling, proposes aligning objectives in signal space (x-loss) to eliminate singular weighting, and examines design choices for binary data.

Result: Aligning objectives in signal space removes singular weighting, ensures uniformly bounded gradients, and enables robust training without heuristic schedules.

Conclusion: Signal-space alignment is crucial for robust flow matching in binary domains, offering theoretical and practical guidelines for diffusion learning.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling, with recent empirical successes highlighting the effectiveness of signal-space prediction ($x$-prediction). In this work, we investigate the transfer of this paradigm to binary manifolds, a fundamental setting for generative modeling of discrete data. While $x$-prediction remains effective, we identify a latent structural mismatch that arises when it is coupled with velocity-based objectives ($v$-loss), leading to a time-dependent singular weighting that amplifies gradient sensitivity to approximation errors. Motivated by this observation, we formalize prediction-loss alignment as a necessary condition for flow matching training. We prove that re-aligning the objective to the signal space ($x$-loss) eliminates the singular weighting, yielding uniformly bounded gradients and enabling robust training under uniform timestep sampling without reliance on heuristic schedules. Finally, with alignment secured, we examine design choices specific to binary data, revealing a topology-dependent distinction between probabilistic objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and geometric losses (e.g., mean squared error). Together, these results provide theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for robust flow matching on binary -- and related discrete -- domains, positioning signal-space alignment as a key principle for robust diffusion learning.

Abstract: Modern data lakes have emerged as foundational platforms for large-scale machine learning, enabling flexible storage of heterogeneous data and structured analytics through table-oriented abstractions. Despite their growing importance, standardized benchmarks for evaluating machine learning performance in data lake environments remain scarce. To address this gap, we present LakeMLB (Data Lake Machine Learning Benchmark), designed for the most common multi-source, multi-table scenarios in data lakes. LakeMLB focuses on two representative multi-table scenarios, Union and Join, and provides three real-world datasets for each scenario, covering government open data, finance, Wikipedia, and online marketplaces. The benchmark supports three representative integration strategies: pre-training-based, data augmentation-based, and feature augmentation-based approaches. We conduct extensive experiments with state-of-the-art tabular learning methods, offering insights into their performance under complex data lake scenarios.

*Kanghyun Noh,Jinheon Choi,Yulwha Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QTALE integrates token-adaptive layer execution and quantization for efficient LLM deployment without significant accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require high computational and memory resources, leading to deployment inefficiencies. Combining token-adaptive execution and quantization can address this but risks accuracy degradation due to reduced redundancy.

Method: QTALE introduces a training strategy for diverse execution paths and a post-training mechanism to adjust execution ratios, enabling seamless integration of token-adaptive execution with quantization.

Result: QTALE maintains accuracy with less than 0.5% degradation compared to quantization-only models on CommonsenseQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: QTALE effectively combines token-adaptive execution and quantization for efficient LLM deployment while preserving accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand substantial computational and memory resources, posing challenges for efficient deployment. Two complementary approaches have emerged to address these issues: token-adaptive layer execution, which reduces floating-point operations (FLOPs) by selectively bypassing layers, and quantization, which lowers memory footprint by reducing weight precision. However, naively integrating these techniques leads to additional accuracy degradation due to reduced redundancy in token-adaptive models. We propose QTALE (Quantization-Robust Token-Adaptive Layer Execution for LLMs), a novel framework that enables seamless integration of token-adaptive execution with quantization while preserving accuracy. Conventional token-adaptive methods reduce redundancy in two ways: (1) by limiting the diversity of training paths explored during fine-tuning, and (2) by lowering the number of parameters actively involved in inference. To overcome these limitations, QTALE introduces two key components: (1) a training strategy that ensures diverse execution paths are actively explored during fine-tuning, and (2) a post-training mechanism that allows flexible adjustment of the execution ratio at inference to reintroduce redundancy when needed. Experimental results show that QTALE enables seamless integration of token-adaptive layer execution with quantization, showing no noticeable accuracy difference, with the gap to quantization-only models kept below 0.5% on CommonsenseQA benchmarks. By combining token-adaptive execution for FLOPs reduction and quantization for memory savings, QTALE provides an effective solution for efficient LLM deployment.

### [177] [A Unified Theory of Random Projection for Influence Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10449)
*Pingbang Hu,Yuzheng Hu,Jiaqi W. Ma,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a theoretical framework to understand when random projection (sketching) preserves influence functions in overparameterized models, addressing limitations of the JL lemma and interactions with ridge regularization and structured approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern models often require scalable influence computation due to prohibitive costs of forming or inverting large curvature matrices. Existing methods rely on JL lemma, but it doesn’t address inversion or interaction with techniques like regularization. This gap motivates a unified theory.

Method: The study analyzes projection preservation under unregularized and ridge-regularized settings, as well as for Kronecker-factored curvatures. It introduces guarantees for injective sketches, effective dimension, and leakage terms for out-of-range gradients.

Result: 1) Unregularized projection preserves influence iff the sketch is injective on the range of $F$. 2) Ridge regularization changes the sketching barrier, governed by effective dimension. 3) Kronecker-factored curvatures allow decoupled sketches. 4) Leakage terms quantify out-of-range influence.

Conclusion: The work provides a principled theory for when sketching preserves influence functions and offers practical guidance for sketch size selection, addressing key gaps in scalable influence computation.

Abstract: Influence functions and related data attribution scores take the form of $g^{\top}F^{-1}g^{\prime}$, where $F\succeq 0$ is a curvature operator. In modern overparameterized models, forming or inverting $F\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ is prohibitive, motivating scalable influence computation via random projection with a sketch $P \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$. This practice is commonly justified via the Johnson--Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma, which ensures approximate preservation of Euclidean geometry for a fixed dataset. However, JL does not address how sketching behaves under inversion. Furthermore, there is no existing theory that explains how sketching interacts with other widely-used techniques, such as ridge regularization and structured curvature approximations.
  We develop a unified theory characterizing when projection provably preserves influence functions. When $g,g^{\prime}\in\text{range}(F)$, we show that: 1) Unregularized projection: exact preservation holds iff $P$ is injective on $\text{range}(F)$, which necessitates $m\geq \text{rank}(F)$; 2) Regularized projection: ridge regularization fundamentally alters the sketching barrier, with approximation guarantees governed by the effective dimension of $F$ at the regularization scale; 3) Factorized influence: for Kronecker-factored curvatures $F=A\otimes E$, the guarantees continue to hold for decoupled sketches $P=P_A\otimes P_E$, even though such sketches exhibit row correlations that violate i.i.d. assumptions. Beyond this range-restricted setting, we analyze out-of-range test gradients and quantify a \emph{leakage} term that arises when test gradients have components in $\ker(F)$. This yields guarantees for influence queries on general test points.
  Overall, this work develops a novel theory that characterizes when projection provably preserves influence and provides principled guidance for choosing the sketch size in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIPLIB-NL, a benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in translating natural-language optimization requirements into solver-executable code, addressing gaps in current benchmarks by using real-world problems with large-scale variables and constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs in optimization modeling are limited to toy-sized or synthetic problems, failing to represent the complexity of industrial-scale optimization tasks.

Method: The authors develop MIPLIB-NL by reverse-engineering real mixed-integer linear programs from MIPLIB~2017, recovering model structure, generating natural-language specifications tied to this structure, and validating through expert review and LLM interaction.

Result: The benchmark includes 223 reconstructions that retain the original models' mathematical content, revealing significant performance drops for systems effective on smaller benchmarks.

Conclusion: MIPLIB-NL fills a critical gap, enabling more realistic evaluation of natural-language-to-optimization systems and exposing limitations invisible at smaller scales.

Abstract: Optimization modeling underpins decision-making in logistics, manufacturing, energy, and finance, yet translating natural-language requirements into correct optimization formulations and solver-executable code remains labor-intensive. Although large language models (LLMs) have been explored for this task, evaluation is still dominated by toy-sized or synthetic benchmarks, masking the difficulty of industrial problems with $10^{3}$--$10^{6}$ (or more) variables and constraints. A key bottleneck is the lack of benchmarks that align natural-language specifications with reference formulations/solver code grounded in real optimization models. To fill in this gap, we introduce MIPLIB-NL, built via a structure-aware reverse construction methodology from real mixed-integer linear programs in MIPLIB~2017. Our pipeline (i) recovers compact, reusable model structure from flat solver formulations, (ii) reverse-generates natural-language specifications explicitly tied to this recovered structure under a unified model--data separation format, and (iii) performs iterative semantic validation through expert review and human--LLM interaction with independent reconstruction checks. This yields 223 one-to-one reconstructions that preserve the mathematical content of the original instances while enabling realistic natural-language-to-optimization evaluation. Experiments show substantial performance degradation on MIPLIB-NL for systems that perform strongly on existing benchmarks, exposing failure modes invisible at toy scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LatentRxnFlow introduces a continuous latent trajectory model for reaction prediction, achieving high accuracy and enabling detailed diagnostics without mechanistic supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current one-shot reaction prediction models lack insight into reaction processes, while stepwise alternatives require costly supervision or discrete edits.

Method: LatentRxnFlow uses Conditional Flow Matching to model reactions as continuous latent trajectories, learning from reactant-product pairs without intermediate labels.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on USPTO benchmarks and provides trajectory-level diagnostics, uncertainty signals, and error mitigation.

Conclusion: LatentRxnFlow enhances predictive accuracy, transparency, and uncertainty awareness, advancing trustworthy deployment in discovery workflows.

Abstract: Recent advances in reaction prediction have achieved near-saturated accuracy on standard benchmarks (e.g., USPTO), yet most state-of-the-art models formulate the task as a one-shot mapping from reactants to products, offering limited insight into the underlying reaction process. Procedural alternatives introduce stepwise generation but often rely on mechanism-specific supervision, discrete symbolic edits, and computationally expensive inference. In this work, we propose LatentRxnFlow, a new reaction prediction paradigm that models reactions as continuous latent trajectories anchored at the thermodynamic product state. Built on Conditional Flow Matching, our approach learns time-dependent latent dynamics directly from standard reactant-product pairs, without requiring mechanistic annotations or curated intermediate labels. While LatentRxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on USPTO benchmarks, more importantly, the continuous formulation exposes the full generative trajectory, enabling trajectory-level diagnostics that are difficult to realize with discrete or one-shot models. We show that latent trajectory analysis allows us to localize and characterize failure modes and to mitigate certain errors via gated inference. Furthermore, geometric properties of the learned trajectories provide an intrinsic signal of epistemic uncertainty, helping prioritize reliably predictable reaction outcomes and flag ambiguous cases for additional validation. Overall, LatentRxnFlow combines strong predictive accuracy with improved transparency, diagnosability, and uncertainty awareness, moving reaction prediction toward more trustworthy deployment in high-throughput discovery workflows.

*Wei Chen,Xingyu Guo,Shuang Li,Zhao Zhang,Yan Zhong,Fuzhen Zhuang,Deqing wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAlign is an adaptive framework for Graph Domain Adaptation that automatically identifies and aligns discrepancies without manual intervention, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Domain Adaptation methods rely on manual feature alignment and struggle with diverse distributional shifts, limiting flexibility and adaptability.

Method: ADAlign introduces Neural Spectral Discrepancy (NSD) to automatically detect and align relevant discrepancies across graphs, leveraging neural characteristic functions and adaptive spectral sampling.

Result: Experiments on 10 datasets and 16 tasks show ADAlign outperforms baselines with lower memory usage and faster training.

Conclusion: ADAlign provides a flexible, scenario-aware solution for GDA, effectively addressing diverse and dynamic distributional shifts.

Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) transfers knowledge from labeled source graphs to unlabeled target graphs but is challenged by complex, multi-faceted distributional shifts. Existing methods attempt to reduce distributional shifts by aligning manually selected graph elements (e.g., node attributes or structural statistics), which typically require manually designed graph filters to extract relevant features before alignment. However, such approaches are inflexible: they rely on scenario-specific heuristics, and struggle when dominant discrepancies vary across transfer scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{ADAlign}, an Adaptive Distribution Alignment framework for GDA. Unlike heuristic methods, ADAlign requires no manual specification of alignment criteria. It automatically identifies the most relevant discrepancies in each transfer and aligns them jointly, capturing the interplay between attributes, structures, and their dependencies. This makes ADAlign flexible, scenario-aware, and robust to diverse and dynamically evolving shifts. To enable this adaptivity, we introduce the Neural Spectral Discrepancy (NSD), a theoretically principled parametric distance that provides a unified view of cross-graph shifts. NSD leverages neural characteristic function in the spectral domain to encode feature-structure dependencies of all orders, while a learnable frequency sampler adaptively emphasizes the most informative spectral components for each task via minimax paradigm. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets and 16 transfer tasks show that ADAlign not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines but also achieves efficiency gains with lower memory usage and faster training.

### [181] [Chamfer-Linkage for Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10444)
*Kishen N Gowda,Willem Fletcher,MohammadHossein Bateni,Laxman Dhulipala,D Ellis Hershkowitz,Rajesh Jayaram,Jakub Łącki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Chamfer-linkage, a novel linkage function for Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), which uses Chamfer distance to improve clustering quality consistently across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical linkage functions like single-linkage, average-linkage, and Ward's method vary widely in performance across datasets, often failing to deliver high-quality clusterings.

Method: The authors propose Chamfer-linkage, leveraging Chamfer distance—popular in machine learning and computer vision—to measure inter-cluster distances. They also provide an efficient O(n²) implementation.

Result: Experiments show Chamfer-linkage outperforms classical linkages in clustering quality across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Chamfer-linkage is a practical, efficient, and superior alternative to classical linkage functions for HAC.

Abstract: Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) is a widely-used clustering method based on repeatedly merging the closest pair of clusters, where inter-cluster distances are determined by a linkage function. Unlike many clustering methods, HAC does not optimize a single explicit global objective; clustering quality is therefore primarily evaluated empirically, and the choice of linkage function plays a crucial role in practice. However, popular classical linkages, such as single-linkage, average-linkage and Ward's method show high variability across real-world datasets and do not consistently produce high-quality clusterings in practice.
  In this paper, we propose \emph{Chamfer-linkage}, a novel linkage function that measures the distance between clusters using the Chamfer distance, a popular notion of distance between point-clouds in machine learning and computer vision. We argue that Chamfer-linkage satisfies desirable concept representation properties that other popular measures struggle to satisfy. Theoretically, we show that Chamfer-linkage HAC can be implemented in $O(n^2)$ time, matching the efficiency of classical linkage functions. Experimentally, we find that Chamfer-linkage consistently yields higher-quality clusterings than classical linkages such as average-linkage and Ward's method across a diverse collection of datasets. Our results establish Chamfer-linkage as a practical drop-in replacement for classical linkage functions, broadening the toolkit for hierarchical clustering in both theory and practice.

*Yongzhong Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how overparameterized transformers collapse into low-dimensional execution manifolds during training, revealing insights into attention dynamics and SGD behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the geometric structure of learning dynamics in overparameterized transformers and its implications for phenomena like attention concentration and SGD dynamics.

Method: Analysis of transformer training trajectories on modular arithmetic tasks, focusing on dimensional collapse and manifold orientation in parameter spaces.

Result: Training trajectories collapse onto low-dimensional (3--4D) execution manifolds, explaining attention saturation, integrable SGD dynamics, and limitations of sparse autoencoders.

Conclusion: Transformers perform core computation in a reduced subspace, with most parameters absorbing optimization noise, offering a geometric framework for interpretability and curriculum design.

Abstract: We investigate the geometric structure of learning dynamics in overparameterized transformer models through carefully controlled modular arithmetic tasks. Our primary finding is that despite operating in high-dimensional parameter spaces ($d=128$), transformer training trajectories rapidly collapse onto low-dimensional execution manifolds of dimension $3$--$4$. This dimensional collapse is robust across random seeds and moderate task difficulties, though the orientation of the manifold in parameter space varies between runs. We demonstrate that this geometric structure underlies several empirically observed phenomena: (1) sharp attention concentration emerges as saturation along routing coordinates within the execution manifold, (2) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits approximately integrable dynamics when projected onto the execution subspace, with non-integrability confined to orthogonal staging directions, and (3) sparse autoencoders capture auxiliary routing structure but fail to isolate execution itself, which remains distributed across the low-dimensional manifold. Our results suggest a unifying geometric framework for understanding transformer learning, where the vast majority of parameters serve to absorb optimization interference while core computation occurs in a dramatically reduced subspace. These findings have implications for interpretability, training curriculum design, and understanding the role of overparameterization in neural network learning.

TL;DR: DiffGDA is a diffusion-based Graph Domain Adaptation method that models adaptation as a continuous-time generative process, outperforming traditional discrete approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GDA methods use discrete strategies, which fail in scenarios where graph structures evolve continuously and nonlinearly.

Method: DiffGDA formulates the adaptation process using stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and introduces a domain-aware network to guide the generative process.

Result: Experiments on 14 graph transfer tasks across 8 datasets show DiffGDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: DiffGDA effectively bridges the source and target domains by modeling adaptation as a continuous process, proving superior to discrete methods.

Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) aims to bridge distribution shifts between domains by transferring knowledge from well-labeled source graphs to given unlabeled target graphs. One promising recent approach addresses graph transfer by discretizing the adaptation process, typically through the construction of intermediate graphs or stepwise alignment procedures. However, such discrete strategies often fail in real-world scenarios, where graph structures evolve continuously and nonlinearly, making it difficult for fixed-step alignment to approximate the actual transformation process. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{DiffGDA}, a \textbf{Diff}usion-based \textbf{GDA} method that models the domain adaptation process as a continuous-time generative process. We formulate the evolution from source to target graphs using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), enabling the joint modeling of structural and semantic transitions. To guide this evolution, a domain-aware network is introduced to steer the generative process toward the target domain, encouraging the diffusion trajectory to follow an optimal adaptation path. We theoretically show that the diffusion process converges to the optimal solution bridging the source and target domains in the latent space. Extensive experiments on 14 graph transfer tasks across 8 real-world datasets demonstrate DiffGDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

### [184] [A Multimodal Conditional Mixture Model with Distribution-Level Physics Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10451)
*Jinkyo Han,Bahador Bahmani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed multimodal modeling framework using mixture density networks (MDNs) is proposed to address challenges in learning conditional distributions for complex systems while preserving physical consistency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of modeling multimodal behavior in scientific and engineering systems, where physical constraints and limited data make traditional approaches inadequate.

Method: The framework leverages MDNs to parameterize multimodal distributions, incorporating physics through regularization terms to penalize violations of governing equations.

Result: The method is tested on various scientific problems, showing competitive performance against advanced generative models like CFM while maintaining simplicity and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed MDN-based framework successfully integrates physical constraints for multimodal modeling, offering interpretable and efficient solutions for complex systems.

Abstract: Many scientific and engineering systems exhibit intrinsically multimodal behavior arising from latent regime switching and non-unique physical mechanisms. In such settings, learning the full conditional distribution of admissible outcomes in a physically consistent and interpretable manner remains a challenge. While recent advances in machine learning have enabled powerful multimodal generative modeling, their integration with physics-constrained scientific modeling remains nontrivial, particularly when physical structure must be preserved or data are limited. This work develops a physics-informed multimodal conditional modeling framework based on mixture density representations. Mixture density networks (MDNs) provide an explicit and interpretable parameterization of multimodal conditional distributions. Physical knowledge is embedded through component-specific regularization terms that penalize violations of governing equations or physical laws. This formulation naturally accommodates non-uniqueness and stochasticity while remaining computationally efficient and amenable to conditioning on contextual inputs. The proposed framework is evaluated across a range of scientific problems in which multimodality arises from intrinsic physical mechanisms rather than observational noise, including bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems, stochastic partial differential equations, and atomistic-scale shock dynamics. In addition, the proposed method is compared with a conditional flow matching (CFM) model, a representative state-of-the-art generative modeling approach, demonstrating that MDNs can achieve competitive performance while offering a simpler and more interpretable formulation.

### [185] [Analyzing Fairness of Neural Network Prediction via Counterfactual Dataset Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10457)
*Brian Hyeongseok Kim,Jacqueline L. Mitchell,Chao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to analyze deep neural networks by exploring counterfactual datasets instead of perturbing inputs, focusing on label bias and its impact on predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how biased labels in training data influence model predictions and assessing fairness in deep learning models.

Method: The approach constructs counterfactual datasets by modifying a few training labels, retrains the model, and checks prediction changes on test cases. It traces bias propagation and ranks critical training examples.

Result: Evaluated on 7 fairness datasets with 1100+ test cases, the method modifies few labels to pinpoint influential examples. It reveals connections between training examples and test cases.

Conclusion: Counterfactual datasets provide an interpretable way to probe dataset bias, highlighting critical training examples and their impact on predictions.

Abstract: Interpreting the inference-time behavior of deep neural networks remains a challenging problem. Existing approaches to counterfactual explanation typically ask: What is the closest alternative input that would alter the model's prediction in a desired way? In contrast, we explore counterfactual datasets. Rather than perturbing the input, our method efficiently finds the closest alternative training dataset, one that differs from the original dataset by changing a few labels. Training a new model on this altered dataset can then lead to a different prediction of a given test instance. This perspective provides a new way to assess fairness by directly analyzing the influence of label bias on training and inference. Our approach can be characterized as probing whether a given prediction depends on biased labels. Since exhaustively enumerating all possible alternate datasets is infeasible, we develop analysis techniques that trace how bias in the training data may propagate through the learning algorithm to the trained network. Our method heuristically ranks and modifies the labels of a bounded number of training examples to construct a counterfactual dataset, retrains the model, and checks whether its prediction on a chosen test case changes. We evaluate our approach on feedforward neural networks across over 1100 test cases from 7 widely-used fairness datasets. Results show that it modifies only a small subset of training labels, highlighting its ability to pinpoint the critical training examples that drive prediction changes. Finally, we demonstrate how our counterfactual datasets reveal connections between training examples and test cases, offering an interpretable way to probe dataset bias.

### [186] [A Swap-Adversarial Framework for Improving Domain Generalization in Electroencephalography-Based Parkinson's Disease Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10528)
*Seongwon Jin,Hanseul Choi,Sunggu Yang,Sungho Park,Jibum Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new ECoG dataset for PD prediction and proposes the Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) to address inter-subject variability and domain generalization, outperforming baselines in cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethical constraints and lack of benchmark datasets limit reproducible comparisons for PD prediction using ECoG. The paper addresses this gap with a new dataset and a robust framework.

Method: Proposes SAF, integrating preprocessing, ISBCS for cross-subject augmentation, and domain-adversarial training to mitigate variability and bias.

Result: SAF outperformed baselines in cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings, demonstrating strong generalization to EEG data.

Conclusion: The new dataset and SAF provide a reproducible and effective solution for PD prediction, with applications beyond ECoG to EEG-based BCIs.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (ECoG) offers a promising alternative to conventional electrocorticography (EEG) for the early prediction of Parkinson's disease (PD), providing higher spatial resolution and a broader frequency range. However, reproducible comparisons has been limited by ethical constraints in human studies and the lack of open benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset, the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction. It is constructed from long-term ECoG recordings of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat models and annotated with neural responses measured before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that mitigates high inter-subject variability and the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) problem in ECoG data, while achieving robust domain generalization across ECoG and EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) datasets. The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings. Our method consistently outperformed all baselines across all settings, showing the most significant improvements in highly variable environments. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved superior cross-dataset performance between public EEG benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization capability not only within ECoG but to EEG data. The new dataset and source code will be made publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for efficiently upscaling neural networks and tuning hyperparameters without costly direct tuning, backed by theory and practical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency in training large-scale neural networks by leveraging knowledge from smaller models while avoiding the prohibitive costs of hyperparameter tuning at larger scales.

Method: Proposes a general upscaling method inspired by μP and any-dimensional architectures, ensuring model equivalence across widths and supporting infinite-width analysis. Extends μTransfer theory for hyperparameter tuning in upscaled models.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on realistic datasets and architectures, showing the method's practical applicability.

Conclusion: The approach provides a principled and efficient way to upscale models and tune hyperparameters, addressing prior limitations.

Abstract: Modern large-scale neural networks are often trained and released in multiple sizes to accommodate diverse inference budgets. To improve efficiency, recent work has explored model upscaling: initializing larger models from trained smaller ones in order to transfer knowledge and accelerate convergence. However, this method can be sensitive to hyperparameters that need to be tuned at the target upscaled model size, which is prohibitively costly to do directly. It remains unclear whether the most common workaround -- tuning on smaller models and extrapolating via hyperparameter scaling laws -- is still sound when using upscaling. We address this with principled approaches to upscaling with respect to model widths and efficiently tuning hyperparameters in this setting. First, motivated by $μ$P and any-dimensional architectures, we introduce a general upscaling method applicable to a broad range of architectures and optimizers, backed by theory guaranteeing that models are equivalent to their widened versions and allowing for rigorous analysis of infinite-width limits. Second, we extend the theory of $μ$Transfer to a hyperparameter transfer technique for models upscaled using our method and empirically demonstrate that this method is effective on realistic datasets and architectures.

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing services has fundamentally transformed urban mobility patterns, making accurate ride-hailing forecasting crucial for optimizing passenger experience and urban transportation efficiency. However, ride-hailing forecasting faces significant challenges due to geospatial heterogeneity and high susceptibility to external events. This paper proposes MVGR-Net(Multi-View Geospatial Representation Learning), a novel framework that addresses these challenges through a two-stage approach. In the pretraining stage, we learn comprehensive geospatial representations by integrating Points-of-Interest and temporal mobility patterns to capture regional characteristics from both semantic attribute and temporal mobility pattern views. The forecasting stage leverages these representations through a prompt-empowered framework that fine-tunes Large Language Models while incorporating external events. Extensive experiments on DiDi's real-world datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance.

*Sho Sonoda,Shunta Akiyama,Yuya Uezato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes LLM-guided theorem proving in interactive assistants like Lean, using stochastic policies in MDPs. It introduces problem distributions with reusable proof structures (DAGs) and shows that hierarchical learners outperform flat ones under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between theoretical hardness and empirical success in automated theorem proving by modeling tactic proposal as a stochastic policy and analyzing reusable proof structures.

Method: Model tactic proposal as a stochastic policy in a deterministic MDP, treat state/action spaces as compact metric spaces, and introduce problem distributions with latent-variable models (proof DAGs). Analyze learning under top-k search and margin conditions.

Result: Hierarchical learners (cut-aware) require exponentially less data than flat learners (cut-free) under conditions where cut elimination expands proof DAGs significantly.

Conclusion: The study justifies subgoal decomposition in theorem provers, showing hierarchical methods are more data-efficient.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical analysis of LLM-guided formal theorem proving in interactive proof assistants (e.g., Lean) by modeling tactic proposal as a stochastic policy in a finite-horizon deterministic MDP. To capture modern representation learning, we treat the state and action spaces as general compact metric spaces and assume Lipschitz policies. To explain the gap between worst-case hardness and empirical success, we introduce problem distributions generated by a reference policy $q$, including a latent-variable model in which proofs exhibit reusable cut/lemma/sketch structure represented by a proof DAG. Under a top-$k$ search protocol and Tsybakov-type margin conditions, we derive lower bounds on finite-horizon success probability that decompose into search and learning terms, with learning controlled by sequential Rademacher/covering complexity. Our main separation result shows that when cut elimination expands a DAG of depth $D$ into a cut-free tree of size $Ω(Λ^D)$ while the cut-aware hierarchical process has size $O(λ^D)$ with $λ\llΛ$, a flat (cut-free) learner provably requires exponentially more data than a cut-aware hierarchical learner. This provides a principled justification for subgoal decomposition in recent agentic theorem provers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLTT improves LoopLM reasoning by rewarding the full latent reasoning trajectory, outperforming GRPO on math and non-math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard reinforcement learning objectives like GRPO only reward the final latent state, misaligning with LoopLM's multi-step reasoning.

Method: Introduces RLTT, a framework distributing reward across latent reasoning trajectories without external verifiers.

Result: RLTT improves accuracy by +14.4% on MATH-500, +16.6% on AIME24, and +10.0% on BeyondAIME, and transfers well to non-math tasks.

Conclusion: RLTT's trajectory-level credit assignment is effective for reinforcement learning in LoopLMs, enhancing performance across reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Looped Language Models (LoopLMs) perform multi-step latent reasoning prior to token generation and outperform conventional LLMs on reasoning benchmarks at smaller parameter budgets. However, attempts to further improve LoopLM reasoning with reinforcement learning have failed - standard objectives such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) only assign credit to the final latent state, creating a fundamental mismatch with the model's internal computation. To resolve this, we introduce RLTT (Reward Latent Thought Trajectories), a reinforcement learning framework which distributes reward across the full latent reasoning trajectory. RLTT provides dense, trajectory-level credit assignment without relying on external verifiers and can directly replace GRPO with negligible overhead. Across extensive experiments with Ouro-2.6B-Thinking under identical training and inference conditions, RLTT yields substantial improvements over GRPO on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, improving accuracy by +14.4% on MATH-500, +16.6% on AIME24, and +10.0% on BeyondAIME. Despite being trained exclusively on mathematics, RLTT also transfers effectively to non-mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of trajectory-level credit assignment for reinforcement learning in LoopLMs.

TL;DR: PiT-PO enhances symbolic regression by dynamically adapting LLMs via reinforcement learning, ensuring physically valid and parsimonious equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat LLMs as static generators, lacking feedback integration, leading to inconsistent or redundant equations.

Method: PiT-PO uses reinforcement learning with dual constraints for hierarchical physical validity and token-level redundancy suppression.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and discovers novel turbulence models, even with smaller models.

Conclusion: PiT-PO democratizes high-performance scientific discovery by dynamically optimizing LLMs for symbolic regression.

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to distill mathematical equations from observational data. Recent approaches have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate equation hypotheses, capitalizing on their vast pre-trained scientific priors. However, existing frameworks predominantly treat the LLM as a static generator, relying on prompt-level guidance to steer exploration. This paradigm fails to update the model's internal representations based on search feedback, often yielding physically inconsistent or mathematically redundant expressions. In this work, we propose PiT-PO (Physics-informed Token-regularized Policy Optimization), a unified framework that evolves the LLM into an adaptive generator via reinforcement learning. Central to PiT-PO is a dual-constraint mechanism that rigorously enforces hierarchical physical validity while simultaneously applying fine-grained, token-level penalties to suppress redundant structures. Consequently, PiT-PO aligns LLM to produce equations that are both scientifically consistent and structurally parsimonious. Empirically, PiT-PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and successfully discovers novel turbulence models for challenging fluid dynamics problems. We also demonstrate that PiT-PO empowers small-scale models to outperform closed-source giants, democratizing access to high-performance scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Residual RL faces challenges in value learning due to cold start pathology and structural scale mismatch, which hinder performance.

Method: DAWN uses base-policy transitions for implicit warmup and critic normalization to enhance representation sensitivity.

Result: DAWN achieves significant efficiency gains in diverse benchmarks, policy architectures, and observation modalities.

Conclusion: Simple, principled solutions like DAWN effectively tackle residual RL's value learning bottlenecks.

Abstract: Residual reinforcement learning (RL) enables stable online refinement of expressive pretrained policies by freezing the base and learning only bounded corrections. However, value learning in residual RL poses unique challenges that remain poorly understood. In this work, we identify two key bottlenecks: cold start pathology, where the critic lacks knowledge of the value landscape around the base policy, and structural scale mismatch, where the residual contribution is dwarfed by the base action. Through systematic investigation, we uncover the mechanisms underlying these bottlenecks, revealing that simple yet principled solutions suffice: base-policy transitions serve as an essential value anchor for implicit warmup, and critic normalization effectively restores representation sensitivity for discerning value differences. Based on these insights, we propose DAWN (Data-Anchored Warmup and Normalization), a minimal approach targeting efficient value learning in residual RL. By addressing these bottlenecks, DAWN demonstrates substantial efficiency gains across diverse benchmarks, policy architectures, and observation modalities.

TL;DR: Neural Additive Experts (NAEs) balance interpretability and accuracy by combining additive models with feature interactions using a mixture of experts framework and targeted regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the trade-off between interpretability (clear feature attributions) and predictive accuracy in machine learning models, particularly Generalized Additive Models (GAMs).

Method: The method involves NAEs, which use a mixture of experts framework with specialized networks per feature and a dynamic gating mechanism. Targeted regularization is applied to manage expert prediction variance.

Result: NAEs demonstrate flexibility in synthetic data experiments and achieve an optimal balance between accuracy and interpretability on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: NAEs successfully bridge the gap between interpretability and accuracy, offering transparent feature-level explanations without sacrificing predictive performance.

Abstract: The trade-off between interpretability and accuracy remains a core challenge in machine learning. Standard Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) offer clear feature attributions but are often constrained by their strictly additive nature, which can limit predictive performance. Introducing feature interactions can boost accuracy yet may obscure individual feature contributions. To address these issues, we propose Neural Additive Experts (NAEs), a novel framework that seamlessly balances interpretability and accuracy. NAEs employ a mixture of experts framework, learning multiple specialized networks per feature, while a dynamic gating mechanism integrates information across features, thereby relaxing rigid additive constraints. Furthermore, we propose targeted regularization techniques to mitigate variance among expert predictions, facilitating a smooth transition from an exclusively additive model to one that captures intricate feature interactions while maintaining clarity in feature attributions. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on synthetic data illustrate the model's flexibility, and extensive evaluations on real-world datasets confirm that NAEs achieve an optimal balance between predictive accuracy and transparent, feature-level explanations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid architecture for automated EEG monitoring that separates signal processing from text generation, ensuring clinical accuracy in seizure detection and reporting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated EEG systems using LLMs suffer from extreme compression and lack of time-series comprehension, leading to clinically incorrect measurements.

Method: The proposed hybrid architecture uses signal processing for exact clinical values, a cross-modal bridge for EEG-to-language translation, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning with constrained decoding. Multirate sampling preserves long-range context and event-level precision.

Result: The system achieves 60% fewer false alarms, 50% faster detection, and sub-clinical measurement precision on TUH and CHB-MIT datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid architecture is the first to guarantee clinical measurement accuracy in automated EEG reports, overcoming limitations of LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Automated EEG monitoring requires clinician-level precision for seizure detection and reporting. Clinical EEG recordings exceed LLM context windows, requiring extreme compression (400:1+ ratios) that destroys fine-grained temporal precision. A 0.5 Hz error distinguishes absence epilepsy from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. LLMs lack inherent time-series comprehension and rely on statistical associations from compressed representations. This dual limitation causes systems to hallucinate clinically incorrect measurement values.
  We separate measurement extraction from text generation. Our hybrid architecture computes exact clinical values via signal processing before compression, employs a cross-modal bridge for EEG-to-language translation, and uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning with constrained decoding around frozen slots. Multirate sampling maintains long-range context while preserving event-level precision. Evaluation on TUH and CHB-MIT datasets achieves 60% fewer false alarms, 50% faster detection, and sub-clinical measurement precision. This is the first system guaranteeing clinical measurement accuracy in automated EEG reports.

TL;DR: HZO optimization reduces query complexity in deep networks while maintaining numerical stability and competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational complexity of traditional zeroth-order optimization in deep neural networks.

Method: Propose Hierarchical Zeroth-Order (HZO) optimization, a divide-and-conquer strategy decomposing network depth.

Result: HZO reduces query complexity from $O(ML^2)$ to $O(ML \log L)$ and maintains stability.

Conclusion: HZO achieves competitive accuracy compared to backpropagation, advancing zeroth-order optimization.

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has long been favored for its biological plausibility and its capacity to handle non-differentiable objectives, yet its computational complexity has historically limited its application in deep neural networks. Challenging the conventional paradigm that gradients propagate layer-by-layer, we propose Hierarchical Zeroth-Order (HZO) optimization, a novel divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the depth dimension of the network. We prove that HZO reduces the query complexity from $O(ML^2)$ to $O(ML \log L)$ for a network of width $M$ and depth $L$, representing a significant leap over existing ZO methodologies. Furthermore, we provide a detailed error analysis showing that HZO maintains numerical stability by operating near the unitary limit ($L_{lip} \approx 1$). Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate that HZO achieves competitive accuracy compared to backpropagation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SnapMLA introduces FP8 optimizations for MLA decoding, addressing challenges like numerical heterogeneity and quantization misalignment, achieving up to 1.91x throughput improvement with minimal performance risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of FP8 into MLA decoding faces challenges like numerical heterogeneity and misaligned quantization scales, necessitating optimized solutions for efficiency.

Method: SnapMLA employs RoPE-aware per-token KV quantization, a quantized PV computation pipeline, and end-to-end dataflow optimization to enhance FP8 MLA decoding.

Result: Experiments show SnapMLA improves throughput by up to 1.91x without significant performance degradation in long-context tasks.

Conclusion: SnapMLA effectively addresses FP8 MLA decoding challenges, offering notable efficiency gains for long-context tasks.

Abstract: While FP8 attention has shown substantial promise in innovations like FlashAttention-3, its integration into the decoding phase of the DeepSeek Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) architecture presents notable challenges. These challenges include numerical heterogeneity arising from the decoupling of positional embeddings, misalignment of quantization scales in FP8 PV GEMM, and the need for optimized system-level support. In this paper, we introduce SnapMLA, an FP8 MLA decoding framework optimized to improve long-context efficiency through the following hardware-aware algorithm-kernel co-optimization techniques: (i) RoPE-Aware Per-Token KV Quantization, where the RoPE part is maintained in high precision, motivated by our comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneous quantization sensitivity inherent to the MLA KV cache. Furthermore, per-token granularity is employed to align with the autoregressive decoding process and maintain quantization accuracy. (ii) Quantized PV Computation Pipeline Reconstruction, which resolves the misalignment of quantization scale in FP8 PV computation stemming from the shared KV structure of the MLA KV cache. (iii) End-to-End Dataflow Optimization, where we establish an efficient data read-and-write workflow using specialized kernels, ensuring efficient data flow and performance gains. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLA LLMs show that SnapMLA achieves up to a 1.91x improvement in throughput, with negligible risk of performance degradation in challenging long-context tasks, including mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks.

*Abhijeet Vyas,Brian Bullins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an online min-max optimization framework using cumulative saddle points, explores limitations of Nash equilibrium in non-convex-concave settings, proposes new performance measures (SDual-Gap$_T$ and DSP-Reg$_T$), and provides algorithmic solutions with bounds under strong convexity-strong concavity, min-max exponential concavity, and Polyak-Łojasiewicz conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of traditional Nash equilibrium in online min-max optimization, especially for non-convex-concave functions, by proposing new performance measures compatible with individual regrets.

Method: The authors introduce SDual-Gap$_T$ and DSP-Reg$_T$ as alternative performance measures. They use reductions to classic OCO problems to derive algorithms with bounds under various conditions (strong convexity-strong concavity, min-max EC, and PL conditions).

Result: The paper provides theoretical bounds for SDual-Gap$_T$ and DSP-Reg$_T$ under different assumptions, including strong convexity-strong concavity and min-max EC. It also identifies a class of functions fitting min-max EC, illustrated by a two-player portfolio selection problem.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the limitations of Nash equilibrium in online min-max optimization, offering robust performance measures and algorithmic solutions under diverse functional assumptions.

Abstract: We propose and study an online version of min-max optimization based on cumulative saddle points under a variety of performance measures beyond convex-concave settings. After first observing the incompatibility of (static) Nash equilibrium (SNE-Reg$_T$) with individual regrets even for strongly convex-strongly concave functions, we propose an alternate \emph{static} duality gap (SDual-Gap$_T$) inspired by the online convex optimization (OCO) framework. We provide algorithms that, using a reduction to classic OCO problems, achieve bounds for SDual-Gap$_T$~and a novel \emph{dynamic} saddle point regret (DSP-Reg$_T$), which we suggest naturally represents a min-max version of the dynamic regret in OCO. We derive our bounds for SDual-Gap$_T$~and DSP-Reg$_T$~under strong convexity-strong concavity and a min-max notion of exponential concavity (min-max EC), and in addition we establish a class of functions satisfying min-max EC~that captures a two-player variant of the classic portfolio selection problem. Finally, for a dynamic notion of regret compatible with individual regrets, we derive bounds under a two-sided Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition.

### [198] [Rotary Positional Embeddings as Phase Modulation: Theoretical Bounds on the RoPE Base for Long-Context Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10959)
*Feilong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) as phase modulation in complex oscillators, deriving lower and upper bounds for the RoPE base parameter to ensure positional coherence in long-context transformers. These bounds define a 'Goldilocks zone' for effective scaling, validated through case studies of models like LLaMA and Mistral.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The behavior of RoPE at long context lengths is poorly understood. The paper aims to characterize this behavior using signal processing theory to derive practical bounds for maintaining positional coherence.

Method: Reinterpret RoPE as phase modulation in complex oscillators. Derive lower bounds (aliasing and stability) and an upper bound (floating-point precision) for the RoPE base parameter. Extend the analysis to deep transformers and validate with case studies of state-of-the-art models.

Result: Lower bounds prevent loss of positional coherence, while the upper bound avoids positional erasure due to numerical limitations. Violations of these bounds lead to attention collapse or long-range degradation.

Conclusion: The derived bounds define a feasible region (Goldilocks zone) for RoPE parameters in long-context transformers, validated by real-world model behaviors. Scaling beyond this zone is constrained by precision limits.

Abstract: Rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) are widely used in large language models to encode token positions through multiplicative rotations, yet their behavior at long context lengths remains poorly characterized. In this work, we reinterpret RoPE as phase modulation applied to a bank of complex oscillators, enabling analysis through classical signal processing theory.
  Under this formulation, we derive principled lower bounds on the RoPE base parameter that are necessary to preserve positional coherence over a target context length. These include a fundamental aliasing bound, analogous to a Nyquist limit, and a DC-component stability bound that constrains phase drift in low-frequency positional modes. We further extend this analysis to deep transformers, showing that repeated rotary modulation across layers compounds angular misalignment, tightening the base requirement as depth increases.
  Complementing these results, we derive a precision-dependent upper bound on the RoPE base arising from finite floating-point resolution. Beyond this limit, incremental phase updates become numerically indistinguishable, leading to positional erasure even in the absence of aliasing. Together, the lower and upper bounds define a precision- and depth-dependent feasibility region a Goldilocks zone for long-context transformers.
  We validate the framework through a comprehensive case study of state-of-the-art models, including LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek variants, showing that observed successes, failures, and community retrofits align closely with the predicted bounds. Notably, models that violate the stability bound exhibit attention collapse and long-range degradation, while attempts to scale beyond one million tokens encounter a hard precision wall independent of architecture or training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: K-FADE is a method using uphill Gauss-Newton steps with K-FAC approximations for efficient LLM unlearning, minimizing retain set impact while effectively erasing forget set outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between erasing undesirable outputs (forget set) and retaining model performance on desired distributions (retain set) in LLM unlearning.

Method: Uses forget set to compute uphill Gauss-Newton steps with K-FAC approximations, transforming retain set constraints into weight constraints for minimal behavioral changes.

Result: Suppresses forget set outputs while approximating retraining without forget set, altering retain set outputs less than previous methods.

Conclusion: K-FADE offers a simple, state-of-the-art unlearning approach that maintains retain set performance and allows reusable updates.

Abstract: Standard large language model training can create models that produce outputs their trainer deems unacceptable in deployment. The probability of these outputs can be reduced using methods such as LLM unlearning. However, unlearning a set of data (called the forget set) can degrade model performance on other distributions where the trainer wants to retain the model's behavior. To improve this trade-off, we demonstrate that using the forget set to compute only a few uphill Gauss-Newton steps provides a conceptually simple, state-of-the-art unlearning approach for LLMs. While Gauss-Newton steps adapt Newton's method to non-linear models, it is non-trivial to efficiently and accurately compute such steps for LLMs. Hence, our approach crucially relies on parametric Hessian approximations such as Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). We call this combined approach K-FADE (K-FAC for Distribution Erasure). Our evaluation on the WMDP and ToFU benchmarks demonstrates that K-FADE suppresses outputs from the forget set and approximates, in output space, the results of retraining without the forget set. Critically, our method does this while altering the outputs on the retain set less than previous methods. This is because K-FADE transforms a constraint on the model's outputs across the entire retain set into a constraint on the model's weights, allowing the algorithm to minimally change the model's behavior on the retain set at each step. Moreover, the unlearning updates computed by K-FADE can be reapplied later if the model undergoes further training, allowing unlearning to be cheaply maintained.

*Ammar Ali,Baher Mohammad,Denis Makhov,Dmitriy Shopkhoev,Magauiya Zhussip,Stamatios Lefkimmiatis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ROCKET is a training-free model compression method that optimally allocates compression levels across layers and uses sparse matrix factorization to achieve high performance retention at 20-50% compression rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of compressing large models efficiently without training overhead, aiming to minimize reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size.

Method: Formulates layer-wise compression as a multi-choice knapsack problem and introduces single-step sparse matrix factorization using activation-weights sensitivity.

Result: Outperforms baselines, retaining over 90% of original performance at 30% compression without fine-tuning. Light fine-tuning further enhances performance.

Conclusion: ROCKET offers a highly effective, training-free approach to model compression, achieving near-original performance with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: We present ROCKET, a training-free model compression method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with factorization, structured-sparsification and dynamic compression baselines. Operating under a global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size. Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\% of the original model's performance at 30\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B. The code for ROCKET is at github.com/mts-ai/ROCKET/tree/main.

### [201] [When Gradient Clipping Becomes a Control Mechanism for Differential Privacy in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10584)
*Mohammad Partohaghighi,Roummel Marcia,Bruce J. West,YangQuan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight, control-driven clipping strategy for differentially private training, adapting the clipping threshold using spectral diagnostics from model parameters to avoid computational overhead and privacy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptive clipping methods suffer from computational overhead, sensitivity to datasets/architectures, and rely on per-example gradient norms, necessitating a more efficient approach.

Method: The method uses spectral decomposition of a weight matrix at periodic probe steps to compute a heavy-tailed spectral indicator. This indicator is smoothed and fed into a feedback controller to update the clipping threshold multiplicatively in the log domain.

Result: The proposed strategy avoids systematic over-clipping or noise-dominated updates, maintaining training stability without increasing privacy loss.

Conclusion: The control-driven clipping method efficiently adapts the clipping threshold using model parameters, improving privacy-preserving training without additional computational or privacy costs.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving training on sensitive data commonly relies on differentially private stochastic optimization with gradient clipping and Gaussian noise. The clipping threshold is a critical control knob: if set too small, systematic over-clipping induces optimization bias; if too large, injected noise dominates updates and degrades accuracy. Existing adaptive clipping methods often depend on per-example gradient norm statistics, adding computational overhead and introducing sensitivity to datasets and architectures. We propose a control-driven clipping strategy that adapts the threshold using a lightweight, weight-only spectral diagnostic computed from model parameters. At periodic probe steps, the method analyzes a designated weight matrix via spectral decomposition and estimates a heavy-tailed spectral indicator associated with training stability. This indicator is smoothed over time and fed into a bounded feedback controller that updates the clipping threshold multiplicatively in the log domain. Because the controller uses only parameters produced during privacy-preserving training, the resulting threshold updates are post-processing and do not increase privacy loss beyond that of the underlying DP optimizer under standard composition accounting.

*Efe Kahraman,Giulio Tosato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines document page ordering on Dutch WOO documents using page embeddings, comparing methods like pointer networks and transformers. Best performance is achieved up to 15 pages, with unexpected failures in seq2seq transformers and curriculum learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliable semantic ordering signals in heterogeneous document collections like emails and legal texts compiled into PDFs.

Method: Five methods are compared, including pointer networks, seq2seq transformers, and pairwise ranking models, evaluated using Kendall's tau.

Result: Best performance reorders documents up to 15 pages (tau 0.95 for short, 0.72 for longer). Seq2seq transformers fail on long documents (tau drops sharply), and curriculum learning underperforms.

Conclusion: Attention patterns differ between short and long documents, explaining method failures. Model specialization improves long-document performance.

Abstract: We investigate document page ordering on 5,461 shuffled WOO documents (Dutch freedom of information releases) using page embeddings. These documents are heterogeneous collections such as emails, legal texts, and spreadsheets compiled into single PDFs, where semantic ordering signals are unreliable. We compare five methods, including pointer networks, seq2seq transformers, and specialized pairwise ranking models. The best performing approach successfully reorders documents up to 15 pages, with Kendall's tau ranging from 0.95 for short documents (2-5 pages) to 0.72 for 15 page documents. We observe two unexpected failures: seq2seq transformers fail to generalize on long documents (Kendall's tau drops from 0.918 on 2-5 pages to 0.014 on 21-25 pages), and curriculum learning underperforms direct training by 39% on long documents. Ablation studies suggest learned positional encodings are one contributing factor to seq2seq failure, though the degradation persists across all encoding variants, indicating multiple interacting causes. Attention pattern analysis reveals that short and long documents require fundamentally different ordering strategies, explaining why curriculum learning fails. Model specialization achieves substantial improvements on longer documents (+0.21 tau).

*Guobin Shen,Chenxiao Zhao,Xiang Cheng,Lei Huang,Xing Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VESPO introduces a variational approach to stabilize RL training for LLMs by reshaping sequence-level importance weights, reducing variance without length normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training stability in RL for LLMs is challenged by policy staleness, asynchronous training, and divergence between training and inference engines. Current remedies lack theoretical unity.

Method: VESPO integrates variance reduction into a variational framework, deriving a closed-form reshaping kernel for sequence-level importance weights without length normalization.

Result: VESPO maintains stable training under 64x staleness and asynchronous execution, showing consistent gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: VESPO offers a theoretically grounded and effective solution for stabilizing RL training in LLMs.

Abstract: Training stability remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs). Policy staleness, asynchronous training, and mismatches between training and inference engines all cause the behavior policy to diverge from the current policy, risking training collapse. Importance sampling provides a principled correction for this distribution shift but suffers from high variance; existing remedies such as token-level clipping and sequence-level normalization lack a unified theoretical foundation. We propose Variational sEquence-level Soft Policy Optimization (VESPO). By incorporating variance reduction into a variational formulation over proposal distributions, VESPO derives a closed-form reshaping kernel that operates directly on sequence-level importance weights without length normalization. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that VESPO maintains stable training under staleness ratios up to 64x and fully asynchronous execution, and delivers consistent gains across both dense and Mixture-of-Experts models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRACE is a framework that decomposes risk change under covariate shift into four interpretable factors, providing a diagnostic tool for model performance changes. It includes computable terms and validates well across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand unpredictable performance changes when replacing a source-trained model with one trained on shifted data, especially under covariate shift.

Method: Introduces TRACE, decomposing risk change into four factors: generalization gaps, model change penalty, and covariate shift penalty. Uses techniques like Optimal Transport, MMD, and output distance for estimation.

Result: Validated in linear regression and benchmarks, TRACE shows strong correlation with true performance degradation and enables safe model replacement via deployment gate scores.

Conclusion: TRACE effectively explains risk changes under covariate shift, offering actionable insights and practical tools for model deployment decisions.

Abstract: When a source-trained model $Q$ is replaced by a model $\tilde{Q}$ trained on shifted data, its performance on the source domain can change unpredictably. To address this, we study the two-model risk change, $ΔR := R_P(\tilde{Q}) - R_P(Q)$, under covariate shift. We introduce TRACE (Theoretical Risk Attribution under Covariate-shift Effects), a framework that decomposes $|ΔR|$ into an interpretable upper bound. This decomposition disentangles the risk change into four actionable factors: two generalization gaps, a model change penalty, and a covariate shift penalty, transforming the bound into a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding why performance has changed. To make TRACE a fully computable diagnostic, we instantiate each term. The covariate shift penalty is estimated via a model sensitivity factor (from high-quantile input gradients) and a data-shift measure; we use feature-space Optimal Transport (OT) by default and provide a robust alternative using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The model change penalty is controlled by the average output distance between the two models on the target sample. Generalization gaps are estimated on held-out data. We validate our framework in an idealized linear regression setting, showing the TRACE bound correctly captures the scaling of the true risk difference with the magnitude of the shift. Across synthetic and vision benchmarks, TRACE diagnostics are valid and maintain a strong monotonic relationship with the true performance degradation. Crucially, we derive a deployment gate score that correlates strongly with $|ΔR|$ and achieves high AUROC/AUPRC for gating decisions, enabling safe, label-efficient model replacement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning faces challenges like client drift in non-IID settings, which hampers convergence and model performance.

Method: RI-FedAvg incorporates a Roughness Index-based regularization term to penalize local updates adaptively, addressing fluctuations in loss landscapes.

Result: RI-FedAvg outperforms existing baselines (FedAvg, FedProx, etc.) in accuracy and convergence speed on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets.

Conclusion: RI-FedAvg enhances robustness and efficiency in FL for heterogeneous environments, demonstrating practical potential.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy, yet faces challenges in non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings due to client drift, which impairs convergence. We propose RI-FedAvg, a novel FL algorithm that mitigates client drift by incorporating a Roughness Index (RI)-based regularization term into the local objective, adaptively penalizing updates based on the fluctuations of local loss landscapes. This paper introduces RI-FedAvg, leveraging the RI to quantify the roughness of high-dimensional loss functions, ensuring robust optimization in heterogeneous settings. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis for non-convex objectives, establishing that RI-FedAvg converges to a stationary point under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that RI-FedAvg outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including FedAvg, FedProx, FedDyn, SCAFFOLD, and DP-FedAvg, achieving higher accuracy and faster convergence in non-IID scenarios. Our results highlight RI-FedAvg's potential to enhance the robustness and efficiency of federated learning in practical, heterogeneous environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models are computationally inefficient because many tokens stabilize early, but current methods require full denoising steps.

Method: Proposes a lightweight, training-free approach using model predictions and local context to dynamically finalize stable tokens.

Result: Achieves significant efficiency gains across benchmarks (mathematical reasoning, QA, scientific understanding) without losing generation quality.

Conclusion: The method advances diffusion model efficiency by adaptively freezing tokens early, maintaining performance while reducing computational cost.

Abstract: Diffusion language models generate text through iterative refinement, a process that is often computationally inefficient because many tokens reach stability long before the final denoising step. We introduce a training-free, token-level early stopping approach that identifies convergence independently at each position. Our method leverages lightweight signals derived from the model's predictions and local context to dynamically determine when individual tokens can be finalized. This yields adaptive per-token freezing without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the total number of diffusion steps required. Across diverse benchmarks, spanning mathematical reasoning, general question answering, and scientific understanding, our approach achieves state-of-the-art efficiency gains while preserving generation quality.

*Qiuran Zhao,Kai Ming Ting,Xinpeng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoGLAD is an interpretable unsupervised framework for graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD) that contrasts anomalies with nearest normal prototype graphs for better explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GLAD methods lack reliable explanations, either ignoring normal graphs or using abstract prototypes. ProtoGLAD addresses this by providing concrete prototype-based explanations.

Method: ProtoGLAD uses a point-set kernel to iteratively identify multiple normal prototype graphs and clusters, then flags graphs distant from these clusters as anomalies.

Result: Experiments show ProtoGLAD matches state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection while offering superior interpretable explanations.

Conclusion: ProtoGLAD improves reliability and interpretability in GLAD by leveraging concrete prototype graphs for anomaly explanations.

Abstract: The task of graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD) is to identify anomalous graphs that deviate significantly from the majority of graphs in a dataset. While deep GLAD methods have shown promising performance, their black-box nature limits their reliability and deployment in real-world applications. Although some recent methods have made attempts to provide explanations for anomaly detection results, they either provide explanations without referencing normal graphs, or rely on abstract latent vectors as prototypes rather than concrete graphs from the dataset. To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (ProtoGLAD), an interpretable unsupervised framework that provides explanation for each detected anomaly by explicitly contrasting with its nearest normal prototype graph. It employs a point-set kernel to iteratively discover multiple normal prototype graphs and their associated clusters from the dataset, then identifying graphs distant from all discovered normal clusters as anomalies. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that ProtoGLAD achieves competitive anomaly detection performance compared to state-of-the-art GLAD methods while providing better human-interpretable prototype-based explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard training with negative log-likelihood (NLL) suffers from slow convergence and mode collapse in mixture density networks. The paper aims to address these issues by integrating information geometry into optimization.

Method: The authors interpret mixture density networks as deep latent-variable models and analyze them using expectation maximization, connecting it to natural gradient descent. They derive the nGEM objective for optimization.

Result: Empirically, nGEM achieves up to 10 times faster convergence with minimal computational overhead and scales well to high-dimensional data where NLL fails.

Conclusion: The proposed nGEM objective significantly improves the optimization of mixture density networks, offering faster convergence and better scalability.

Abstract: Mixture density networks are neural networks that produce Gaussian mixtures to represent continuous multimodal conditional densities. Standard training procedures involve maximum likelihood estimation using the negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective, which suffers from slow convergence and mode collapse. In this work, we improve the optimization of mixture density networks by integrating their information geometry. Specifically, we interpret mixture density networks as deep latent-variable models and analyze them through an expectation maximization framework, which reveals surprising theoretical connections to natural gradient descent. We then exploit such connections to derive the natural gradient expectation maximization (nGEM) objective. We show that empirically nGEM achieves up to 10$\times$ faster convergence while adding almost zerocomputational overhead, and scales well to high-dimensional data where NLL otherwise fails.

TL;DR: The paper explores pretraining LLMs focusing on model plasticity (adaptability to downstream tasks), highlighting weight decay's role in improving fine-tuning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM development overlooks downstream adaptability in hyperparameter optimization. This study aims to understand pretraining from a plasticity perspective.

Method: Systematic experiments varying weight decay during pretraining to analyze its impact on model plasticity and downstream fine-tuning performance.

Result: Higher weight decay increases plasticity, leading to better fine-tuning results, despite potentially worse base model performance. It also promotes linearly separable representations and reduces overfitting.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes evaluating hyperparameters beyond validation loss and reveals weight decay's multifaceted role in model behavior.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm in large language model (LLM) development is to pretrain a base model, then perform further training to improve performance and model behavior. However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization and casts light on the multifaceted role of that a single optimization hyperparameter plays in shaping model behavior.

TL;DR: dnaHNet introduces a tokenizer-free autoregressive model for genomic sequences, balancing compression and accuracy, outperforming existing models in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the tradeoff in genomic foundation models between fragmenting biologically meaningful motifs with standard tokenizers and the high computational costs of nucleotide-level models.

Method: dnaHNet uses a differentiable dynamic chunking mechanism to adaptively compress raw nucleotides into latent tokens, achieving end-to-end modeling of genomic sequences.

Result: Pretrained on prokaryotic genomes, dnaHNet outperforms leading architectures like StripedHyena2 in scaling and efficiency, with quadratic FLOP reductions and >3x inference speedup over Transformers.

Conclusion: dnaHNet serves as a scalable, interpretable framework for genomic modeling, excelling in zero-shot tasks and unsupervised discovery of hierarchical biological structures.

Abstract: Genomic foundation models have the potential to decode DNA syntax, yet face a fundamental tradeoff in their input representation. Standard fixed-vocabulary tokenizers fragment biologically meaningful motifs such as codons and regulatory elements, while nucleotide-level models preserve biological coherence but incur prohibitive computational costs for long contexts. We introduce dnaHNet, a state-of-the-art tokenizer-free autoregressive model that segments and models genomic sequences end-to-end. Using a differentiable dynamic chunking mechanism, dnaHNet compresses raw nucleotides into latent tokens adaptively, balancing compression with predictive accuracy. Pretrained on prokaryotic genomes, dnaHNet outperforms leading architectures including StripedHyena2 in scaling and efficiency. This recursive chunking yields quadratic FLOP reductions, enabling $>3 \times$ inference speedup over Transformers. On zero-shot tasks, dnaHNet achieves superior performance in predicting protein variant fitness and gene essentiality, while automatically discovering hierarchical biological structures without supervision. These results establish dnaHNet as a scalable, interpretable framework for next-generation genomic modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to develop effective multilingual embedding models for web-scale retrieval by leveraging bidirectional context and preserving global context in long documents.

Method: The models use multi-stage contrastive learning on a diffusion-pretrained backbone, employing mean pooling and late chunking strategies for better context preservation.

Result: pplx-embed-v1 performs competitively on MTEB, MTEB(Code), MIRACL, BERGEN, and ToolRet benchmarks, while pplx-embed-context-v1 sets records on ConTEB. Both models excel in internal evaluations for large-scale search.

Conclusion: The pplx-embed models prove effective for retrieval in real-world, large-scale scenarios, validating their quality and efficiency in production environments.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce pplx-embed, a family of multilingual embedding models that employ multi-stage contrastive learning on a diffusion-pretrained language model backbone for web-scale retrieval. By leveraging bidirectional attention through diffusion-based pretraining, our models capture comprehensive bidirectional context within passages, enabling the use of mean pooling and a late chunking strategy to better preserve global context across long documents. We release two model types: pplx-embed-v1 for standard retrieval, and pplx-embed-context-v1 for contextualized embeddings that incorporate global document context into passage representations. pplx-embed-v1 achieves competitive performance on the MTEB(Multilingual, v2), MTEB(Code), MIRACL, BERGEN, and ToolRet retrieval benchmarks, while pplx-embed-context-v1 sets new records on the ConTEB benchmark. Beyond public benchmarks, pplx-embed-v1 demonstrates strong performance on our internal evaluation suite, which focuses on real-world, large-scale search scenarios over tens of millions of documents. These results validate the models' effectiveness in production environments where retrieval quality and efficiency are critical at scale.

*Nicolás Becerra-Zuniga,Lucas Lacasa,Eusebio Valero,Gonzalo Rubio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINNs mitigate data inconsistencies partially but hit a consistency barrier limiting accuracy based on data fidelity. High-fidelity data removes this barrier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how data inconsistencies (noise, errors) impact PINN accuracy and convergence in PDE surrogate modeling.

Method: Systematic analysis using the 1D viscous Burgers equation with controlled data fidelity and residual errors, testing PINNs with varying data accuracy.

Result: PINNs partially overcome low-fidelity data but accuracy saturates due to inconsistency. High-fidelity data achieves results similar to perfect data.

Conclusion: Data quality crucially affects PINN performance; high-fidelity data eliminates consistency barriers, guiding better surrogate model construction.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention as a surrogate modeling strategy for partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly in regimes where labeled data are scarce and physical constraints can be leveraged to regularize the learning process. In practice, however, PINNs are frequently trained using experimental or numerical data that are not fully consistent with the governing equations due to measurement noise, discretization errors, or modeling assumptions. The implications of such data-to-PDE inconsistencies on the accuracy and convergence of PINNs remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we systematically analyze how data inconsistency fundamentally limits the attainable accuracy of PINNs. We introduce the concept of a consistency barrier, defined as an intrinsic lower bound on the error that arises from mismatches between the fidelity of the data and the exact enforcement of the PDE residual. To isolate and quantify this effect, we consider the 1D viscous Burgers equation with a manufactured analytical solution, which enables full control over data fidelity and residual errors. PINNs are trained using datasets of progressively increasing numerical accuracy, as well as perfectly consistent analytical data. Results show that while the inclusion of the PDE residual allows PINNs to partially mitigate low-fidelity data and recover the dominant physical structure, the training process ultimately saturates at an error level dictated by the data inconsistency. When high-fidelity numerical data are employed, PINN solutions become indistinguishable from those trained on analytical data, indicating that the consistency barrier is effectively removed. These findings clarify the interplay between data quality and physics enforcement in PINNs providing practical guidance for the construction and interpretation of physics-informed surrogate models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates sparsification techniques in GNNs to reduce memory and computational costs, using methods like Erdős-Rényi for efficiency. It tests these on power grid contingency assessment, showing how sparsity tuning and adaptive rewiring can enhance performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address high memory usage and computational costs in large-scale graph applications by leveraging sparsification methods from Network Science and Machine Learning.

Method: The authors apply sparsification techniques such as Erdős-Rényi and adaptive rewiring to GNNs (GCN and GIN). They test these on N-1 contingency assessment in electrical grids across three datasets.

Result: Results show that tuned sparsity improves generalization, but excessive sparsity can hinder learning. Adaptive rewiring with early stopping is particularly effective in optimizing performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of combining insights from Network Science and Machine Learning to enhance GNN efficiency, especially in critical applications like power grid reliability.

Abstract: This paper explores sparsification methods as a form of regularization in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to address high memory usage and computational costs in large-scale graph applications. Using techniques from Network Science and Machine Learning, including Erdős-Rényi for model sparsification, we enhance the efficiency of GNNs for real-world applications. We demonstrate our approach on N-1 contingency assessment in electrical grids, a critical task for ensuring grid reliability. We apply our methods to three datasets of varying sizes, exploring Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) with different degrees of sparsification and rewiring. Comparison across sparsification levels shows the potential of combining insights from both research fields to improve GNN performance and scalability. Our experiments highlight the importance of tuning sparsity parameters: while sparsity can improve generalization, excessive sparsity may hinder learning of complex patterns. Our adaptive rewiring approach, particularly when combined with early stopping, proves promising by allowing the model to adapt its connectivity structure during training. This research contributes to understanding how sparsity can be effectively leveraged in GNNs for critical applications like power grid reliability analysis.

*Nusaibah Farrukh,Malavika Pradeep,Akshay Sasi,Rahul Venugopal,Elizabeth Sherly*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study compares EEG and pupillometry for cognitive load assessment, finding pupillometry as a practical alternative to EEG with interpretable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cognitive load measurement is crucial for adaptive learning and brain-computer interfaces, but EEG's limitations call for simpler alternatives like pupillometry.

Method: Feature-based approaches and classical machine learning models were applied to EEG and pupillometry data from the OpenNeuro 'Digit Span Task' dataset.

Result: Pupillometry alone matched EEG's performance, offering a portable and interpretable solution for cognitive load detection.

Conclusion: Pupillometry is a viable alternative to EEG for cognitive load monitoring, enabling affordable wearable systems in healthcare and education.

Abstract: Cognitive load, the mental effort required during working memory, is central to neuroscience, psychology, and human-computer interaction. Accurate assessment is vital for adaptive learning, clinical monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. Physiological signals such as pupillometry and electroencephalography are established biomarkers of cognitive load, but their comparative utility and practical integration as lightweight, wearable monitoring solutions remain underexplored. EEG provides high temporal resolution of neural activity. Although non-invasive, it is technologically demanding and limited in wearability and cost due to its resource-intensive nature, whereas pupillometry is non-invasive, portable, and scalable. Existing studies often rely on deep learning models with limited interpretability and substantial computational expense. This study integrates feature-based and model-driven approaches to advance time-series analysis. Using the OpenNeuro 'Digit Span Task' dataset, this study investigates cognitive load classification from EEG and pupillometry. Feature-based approaches using Catch-22 features and classical machine learning models outperform deep learning in both binary and multiclass tasks. The findings demonstrate that pupillometry alone can compete with EEG, serving as a portable and practical proxy for real-world applications. These results challenge the assumption that EEG is necessary for load detection, showing that pupil dynamics combined with interpretable models and SHAP based feature analysis provide physiologically meaningful insights. This work supports the development of wearable, affordable cognitive monitoring systems for neuropsychiatry, education, and healthcare.

TL;DR: LOREN is a low-rank-based neural receiver that reduces memory and power usage while maintaining performance by training small adapters instead of full networks for each code rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural receivers face challenges like high memory and power requirements due to storing separate weight sets for each code rate.

Method: LOREN uses lightweight low-rank adaptation adapters integrated into convolutional layers, freezing a shared base network and training only small adapters per code rate. Training is done end-to-end over 3GPP CDL channels.

Result: LOREN matches or outperforms fully retrained neural receivers while saving over 65% in silicon area and up to 15% in power for three code rates.

Conclusion: LOREN offers a practical, efficient solution for neural receivers by significantly reducing resource requirements without compromising performance.

Abstract: Neural network based receivers have recently demonstrated superior system-level performance compared to traditional receivers. However, their practicality is limited by high memory and power requirements, as separate weight sets must be stored for each code rate. To address this challenge, we propose LOREN, a Low Rank-Based Code-Rate Adaptation Neural Receiver that achieves adaptability with minimal overhead. LOREN integrates lightweight low rank adaptation adapters (LOREN adapters) into convolutional layers, freezing a shared base network while training only small adapters per code rate. An end-to-end training framework over 3GPP CDL channels ensures robustness across realistic wireless environments. LOREN achieves comparable or superior performance relative to fully retrained base neural receivers. The hardware implementation of LOREN in 22nm technology shows more than 65% savings in silicon area and up to 15% power reduction when supporting three code rates.

*Enrico Ahlers,Daniel Passon,Yannic Noller,Lars Grunske*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FIRE, an inference-time method to mitigate backdoor attacks in deployed machine learning models by reversing trigger effects in the model's latent spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mitigations for backdoor attacks are ineffective or inefficient once models are deployed, necessitating a new approach to neutralize triggers during inference.

Method: FIRE manipulates latent representations in the model by reversing the direction of triggers, neutralizing their effects without modifying the model or input data.

Result: FIRE shows low computational overhead and outperforms existing runtime mitigations across various attacks, datasets, and network architectures.

Conclusion: FIRE provides an efficient and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in deployed models by leveraging latent space manipulations during inference.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly present in our everyday lives; as a result, they become targets of adversarial attackers seeking to manipulate the systems we interact with. A well-known vulnerability is a backdoor introduced into a neural network by poisoned training data or a malicious training process. Backdoors can be used to induce unwanted behavior by including a certain trigger in the input. Existing mitigations filter training data, modify the model, or perform expensive input modifications on samples. If a vulnerable model has already been deployed, however, those strategies are either ineffective or inefficient. To address this gap, we propose our inference-time backdoor mitigation approach called FIRE (Feature-space Inference-time REpair). We hypothesize that a trigger induces structured and repeatable changes in the model's internal representation. We view the trigger as directions in the latent spaces between layers that can be applied in reverse to correct the inference mechanism. Therefore, we turn the backdoored model against itself by manipulating its latent representations and moving a poisoned sample's features along the backdoor directions to neutralize the trigger. Our evaluation shows that FIRE has low computational overhead and outperforms current runtime mitigations on image benchmarks across various attacks, datasets, and network architectures.

*Rustam Zhumagambetov,Niklas Giesa,Sebastian D. Boie,Stefan Haufe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines privacy risks in synthetic hospital time series data generated by AI models, finds existing privacy attacks ineffective on large datasets, and highlights limitations of differential privacy (DP) mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in sharing medical data for ML training by evaluating synthetic data generators and their vulnerabilities to privacy attacks.

Method: Auditing state-of-the-art generative hospital time series models using privacy attacks on MIMIC-IV and eICU datasets; testing DP mechanisms' impact.

Result: Privacy attacks fail on synthetic data from large training sets; DP mechanisms reduce utility without significant privacy improvements.

Conclusion: Audits remain essential for generative models; DP may not enhance privacy but compromises data utility.

Abstract: Sharing medical data for machine learning model training purposes is often impossible due to the risk of disclosing identifying information about individual patients. Synthetic data produced by generative artificial intelligence (genAI) models trained on real data is often seen as one possible solution to comply with privacy regulations. While powerful genAI models for heterogeneous hospital time series have recently been introduced, such modeling does not guarantee privacy protection, as the generated data may still reveal identifying information about individuals in the models' training cohort. Applying established privacy mechanisms to generative time series models, however, proves challenging as post-hoc data anonymization through k-anonymization or similar techniques is limited, while model-centered privacy mechanisms that implement differential privacy (DP) may lead to unstable training, compromising the utility of generated data. Given these known limitations, privacy audits for generative time series models are currently indispensable regardless of the concrete privacy mechanisms applied to models and/or data. In this work, we use a battery of established privacy attacks to audit state-of-the-art hospital time series models, trained on the public MIMIC-IV dataset, with respect to privacy preservation. Furthermore, the eICU dataset was used to mount a privacy attack against the synthetic data generator trained on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Results show that established privacy attacks are ineffective against generated multivariate clinical time series when synthetic data generators are trained on large enough training datasets. Furthermore, we discuss how the use of existing DP mechanisms for these synthetic data generators would not bring desired improvement in privacy, but only a decrease in utility for machine learning prediction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the quadratic bottleneck of edge scoring in diffusion models for Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO).

Method: CycFlow learns an instance-conditioned vector field to transport input coordinates to a canonical circular arrangement, recovering the optimal tour via angular sorting.

Result: Achieves solving speeds up to 1000x faster than diffusion baselines while maintaining competitive optimality gaps.

Conclusion: CycFlow offers a paradigm shift in NCO by accelerating solutions without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) have been dominated by diffusion models that treat the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a stochastic $N \times N$ heatmap generation task. In this paper, we propose CycFlow, a framework that replaces iterative edge denoising with deterministic point transport. CycFlow learns an instance-conditioned vector field that continuously transports input 2D coordinates to a canonical circular arrangement, where the optimal tour is recovered from this $2N$ dimensional representation via angular sorting. By leveraging data-dependent flow matching, we bypass the quadratic bottleneck of edge scoring in favor of linear coordinate dynamics. This paradigm shift accelerates solving speed by up to three orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art diffusion baselines, while maintaining competitive optimality gaps.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators (CG-BGs) combine reduced-order modeling with importance sampling for scalable and unbiased molecular sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in sampling equilibrium molecular configurations from the Boltzmann distribution efficiently, especially for larger systems. Existing methods have scalability or accuracy limitations.

Method: CG-BGs use a learned potential of mean force (PMF) in coarse-grained coordinate space, reweighting samples from a flow-based model. PMF is efficiently learned via force matching.

Result: CG-BGs successfully capture complex interactions in highly reduced representations, enabling unbiased sampling of larger molecular systems.

Conclusion: CG-BGs provide a scalable and exact framework for molecular sampling, bridging reduced-order modeling and importance sampling.

Abstract: Sampling equilibrium molecular configurations from the Boltzmann distribution is a longstanding challenge. Boltzmann Generators (BGs) address this by combining exact-likelihood generative models with importance sampling, but their practical scalability is limited. Meanwhile, coarse-grained surrogates enable the modeling of larger systems by reducing effective dimensionality, yet often lack the reweighting process required to ensure asymptotically correct statistics. In this work, we propose Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators (CG-BGs), a principled framework that unifies scalable reduced-order modeling with the exactness of importance sampling. CG-BGs act in a coarse-grained coordinate space, using a learned potential of mean force (PMF) to reweight samples generated by a flow-based model. Crucially, we show that this PMF can be efficiently learned from rapidly converged data via force matching. Our results demonstrate that CG-BGs faithfully capture complex interactions mediated by explicit solvent within highly reduced representations, establishing a scalable pathway for the unbiased sampling of larger molecular systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes metrics to evaluate temporal preservation in synthetic longitudinal patient data, highlighting that strong marginal resemblance can hide distortions in other temporal characteristics. It emphasizes the need for multidimensional assessment due to varying data quality and preprocessing impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the evaluation and creation of synthetic longitudinal patient data by assessing how well temporal structures are preserved, addressing limitations where marginal resemblance alone may be misleading.

Method: The study introduces metrics categorized into marginal, covariance, individual-level, and measurement structures to evaluate temporal preservation, considering factors like data quality and preprocessing.

Result: Marginal-level resemblance can mask distortions in other temporal characteristics. Temporal preservation depends on data quality, measurement frequency, and preprocessing, with sparse measurements reducing resemblance.

Conclusion: A multidimensional evaluation is essential for assessing synthetic data quality. The proposed metrics help clarify temporal preservation and degradation, aiding in improving generative models for realistic synthetic data.

Abstract: This study introduces a set of metrics for evaluating temporal preservation in synthetic longitudinal patient data, defined as artificially generated data that mimic real patients' repeated measurements over time. The proposed metrics assess how synthetic data reproduces key temporal characteristics, categorized into marginal, covariance, individual-level and measurement structures. We show that strong marginal-level resemblance may conceal distortions in covariance and disruptions in individual-level trajectories. Temporal preservation is influenced by factors such as original data quality, measurement frequency, and preprocessing strategies, including binning, variable encoding and precision. Variables with sparse or highly irregular measurement times provide limited information for learning temporal dependencies, resulting in reduced resemblance between the synthetic and original data. No single metric adequately captures temporal preservation; instead, a multidimensional evaluation across all characteristics provides a more comprehensive assessment of synthetic data quality. Overall, the proposed metrics clarify how and why temporal structures are preserved or degraded, enabling more reliable evaluation and improvement of generative models and supporting the creation of temporally realistic synthetic longitudinal patient data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian Optimization struggles in high-dimensional problems with coupled parameters and asymmetric landscapes. Existing methods like TuRBO often fail in such scenarios.

Method: Leverages physical insight to transform coordinates, decoupling input features and aligning active subspaces with search axes. Combined with reverse annealing exploration.

Result: Successfully optimized a challenging 12-dimensional optical system where conventional BO methods failed. Achieved reliable convergence to the global optimum.

Conclusion: Physical insight-driven coordinate transformation simplifies high-dimensional optimization, enabling robust automated tuning while retaining current algorithms.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing complex non-linear systems. However, its performance degrades in high-dimensional problems with tightly coupled parameters and highly asymmetric objective landscapes, where rewards are sparse. In such needle-in-a-haystack scenarios, even advanced methods like trust-region BO (TurBO) often lead to unsatisfactory results. We propose a domain knowledge guided Bayesian Optimization approach, which leverages physical insight to fundamentally simplify the search problem by transforming coordinates to decouple input features and align the active subspaces with the primary search axes. We demonstrate this approach's efficacy on a challenging 12-dimensional, 6-crystal Split-and-Delay optical system, where conventional approaches, including standard BO, TuRBO and multi-objective BO, consistently led to unsatisfactory results. When combined with an reverse annealing exploration strategy, this approach reliably converges to the global optimum. The coordinate transformation itself is the key to this success, significantly accelerating the search by aligning input co-ordinate axes with the problem's active subspaces. As increasingly complex scientific instruments, from large telescopes to new spectrometers at X-ray Free Electron Lasers are deployed, the demand for robust high-dimensional optimization grows. Our results demonstrate a generalizable paradigm: leveraging physical insight to transform high-dimensional, coupled optimization problems into simpler representations can enable rapid and robust automated tuning for consistent high performance while still retaining current optimization algorithms.

*Fanpu Cao,Lu Dai,Jindong Han,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GTR introduces a lightweight, plug-and-play module to extend forecasting models' temporal awareness beyond immediate history, effectively capturing global periodic patterns without significant overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTSF models struggle with capturing global periodic patterns due to limited historical context, leading to inefficiencies when extending the historical window.

Method: GTR uses adaptive global temporal embeddings, dynamically retrieves relevant global segments, and models local and global dependencies via 2D convolution and residual fusion.

Result: GTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on six datasets with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: GTR is an efficient, general solution for enhancing global periodicity modeling in MTSF tasks.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in numerous real-world applications, yet existing models remain constrained by their reliance on a limited historical context. This limitation prevents them from effectively capturing global periodic patterns that often span cycles significantly longer than the input horizon - despite such patterns carrying strong predictive signals. Naive solutions, such as extending the historical window, lead to severe drawbacks, including overfitting, prohibitive computational costs, and redundant information processing. To address these challenges, we introduce the Global Temporal Retriever (GTR), a lightweight and plug-and-play module designed to extend any forecasting model's temporal awareness beyond the immediate historical context. GTR maintains an adaptive global temporal embedding of the entire cycle and dynamically retrieves and aligns relevant global segments with the input sequence. By jointly modeling local and global dependencies through a 2D convolution and residual fusion, GTR effectively bridges short-term observations with long-term periodicity without altering the host model architecture. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across both short-term and long-term forecasting scenarios, while incurring minimal parameter and computational overhead. These results highlight GTR as an efficient and general solution for enhancing global periodicity modeling in MTSF tasks. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/macovaseas/GTR.

TL;DR: Proposes a flow-based model with stratified sampling for flexible estimation of expectations from unknown data distributions, reducing uncertainty versus traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on restrictive distributional assumptions (e.g., Gaussian), causing high estimation uncertainty when assumptions fail.

Method: Combines flow-based modeling (using neural networks) with stratified sampling to flexibly estimate expectations without strict distributional assumptions.

Result: Demonstrates reduced estimation uncertainty, outperforming Monte Carlo estimators and Gaussian mixture models, even in high-dimensional settings (30 and 128 dimensions).

Conclusion: The proposed method offers improved flexibility and accuracy for expectation estimation, especially when traditional parametric assumptions are invalid.

Abstract: Estimating the expectation of a real-valued function of a random variable from sample data is a critical aspect of statistical analysis, with far-reaching implications in various applications. Current methodologies typically assume (semi-)parametric distributions such as Gaussian or mixed Gaussian, leading to significant estimation uncertainty if these assumptions do not hold. We propose a flow-based model, integrated with stratified sampling, that leverages a parametrized neural network to offer greater flexibility in modeling unknown data distributions, thereby mitigating this limitation. Our model shows a marked reduction in estimation uncertainty across multiple datasets, including high-dimensional (30 and 128) ones, outperforming crude Monte Carlo estimators and Gaussian mixture models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a catastrophic failure mode called Meltdown in 3D diffusion transformers used for surface completion, where tiny perturbations cause fragmented outputs. Using activation-patching, the authors trace this to a specific cross-attention activation and introduce PowerRemap, a solution achieving up to 98.3% stabilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable surface completion from sparse point clouds is crucial for applications like content creation and robotics. However, existing state-of-the-art methods unexpectedly fail under minor perturbations.

Method: The authors use activation-patching to localize Meltdown to a single cross-attention activation. They analyze its spectral entropy and introduce PowerRemap for stabilization.

Result: Meltdown is shown to occur across architectures, datasets, and denoising strategies. PowerRemap effectively counters it with high stabilization rates.

Conclusion: The study links circuit-level mechanisms to diffusion dynamics, offering insights into stabilizing diffusion models through mechanistic analysis.

Abstract: Reliable surface completion from sparse point clouds underpins many applications spanning content creation and robotics. While 3D diffusion transformers attain state-of-the-art results on this task, we uncover that they exhibit a catastrophic mode of failure: arbitrarily small on-surface perturbations to the input point cloud can fracture the output into multiple disconnected pieces -- a phenomenon we call Meltdown. Using activation-patching from mechanistic interpretability, we localize Meltdown to a single early denoising cross-attention activation. We find that the singular-value spectrum of this activation provides a scalar proxy: its spectral entropy rises when fragmentation occurs and returns to baseline when patched. Interpreted through diffusion dynamics, we show that this proxy tracks a symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the reverse process. Guided by this insight, we introduce PowerRemap, a test-time control that stabilizes sparse point-cloud conditioning. We demonstrate that Meltdown persists across state-of-the-art architectures (WaLa, Make-a-Shape), datasets (GSO, SimJEB) and denoising strategies (DDPM, DDIM), and that PowerRemap effectively counters this failure with stabilization rates of up to 98.3%. Overall, this work is a case study on how diffusion model behavior can be understood and guided based on mechanistic analysis, linking a circuit-level cross-attention mechanism to diffusion-dynamics accounts of trajectory bifurcations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) are benchmarked for electricity demand forecasting, showing superior zero-shot performance over traditional methods, especially with limited context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the applicability of TSFMs in mission-critical scenarios like electricity demand forecasting, focusing on accuracy, calibration, and robustness.

Method: Evaluated four TSFMs and three baselines using ERCOT hourly load data (2020-2024) across four dimensions: context length sensitivity, probabilistic calibration, robustness to distribution shifts, and prescriptive analytics.

Result: TSFMs outperformed baselines, achieving a 47% reduction in MASE at long contexts. Prophet failed with short contexts due to its reliance on seasonal fitting, while TSFMs maintained stability. Calibration varied among models.

Conclusion: TSFMs offer robust, accurate zero-shot forecasting for electricity demand, with practical advantages over traditional methods, though calibration remains model-dependent.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have introduced zero-shot prediction capabilities that bypass the need for task-specific training. Whether these capabilities translate to mission-critical applications such as electricity demand forecasting--where accuracy, calibration, and robustness directly affect grid operations--remains an open question. We present a multi-dimensional benchmark evaluating four TSFMs (Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-2, Moirai-2, and TinyTimeMixer) alongside Prophet as an industry-standard baseline and two statistical references (SARIMA and Seasonal Naive), using ERCOT hourly load data from 2020 to 2024. All experiments run on consumer-grade hardware (AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, no GPU). The evaluation spans four axes: (1) context length sensitivity from 24 to 2048 hours, (2) probabilistic forecast calibration, (3) robustness under distribution shifts including COVID-19 lockdowns and Winter Storm Uri, and (4) prescriptive analytics for operational decision support. The top-performing foundation models achieve MASE values near 0.31 at long context lengths (C = 2048h, day-ahead horizon), a 47% reduction over the Seasonal Naive baseline. The inclusion of Prophet exposes a structural advantage of pre-trained models: Prophet fails when the fitting window is shorter than its seasonality period (MASE > 74 at 24-hour context), while TSFMs maintain stable accuracy even with minimal context because they recognise temporal patterns learned during pre-training rather than estimating them from scratch. Calibration varies substantially across models--Chronos-2 produces well-calibrated prediction intervals (95% empirical coverage at 90% nominal level) while both Moirai-2 and Prophet exhibit overconfidence (~70% coverage). We provide practical model selection guidelines and release the complete benchmark framework for reproducibility.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GENIUS, a benchmark suite to evaluate Generative Fluid Intelligence (GFI) in Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs), highlighting deficits in context comprehension rather than generative capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on crystallized intelligence, overlooking GFI—reasoning and adaptability in novel scenarios. GENIUS aims to bridge this gap.

Method: GENIUS assesses GFI through three primitives: inducing implicit patterns, executing ad-hoc constraints, and adapting to contextual knowledge. A diagnostic analysis identifies failure modes, and a training-free intervention strategy is proposed.

Result: Evaluation of 12 models shows significant deficits in GFI tasks, attributed to context comprehension limitations rather than generative ability.

Conclusion: GENIUS sets a new standard for GFI evaluation, urging progress toward dynamic, general-purpose reasoning in UMMs.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual generation. Yet, existing benchmarks predominantly assess $\textit{Crystallized Intelligence}$, which relies on recalling accumulated knowledge and learned schemas. This focus overlooks $\textit{Generative Fluid Intelligence (GFI)}$: the capacity to induce patterns, reason through constraints, and adapt to novel scenarios on the fly. To rigorously assess this capability, we introduce $\textbf{GENIUS}$ ($\textbf{GEN}$ Fluid $\textbf{I}$ntelligence Eval$\textbf{U}$ation $\textbf{S}$uite). We formalize $\textit{GFI}$ as a synthesis of three primitives. These include $\textit{Inducing Implicit Patterns}$ (e.g., inferring personalized visual preferences), $\textit{Executing Ad-hoc Constraints}$ (e.g., visualizing abstract metaphors), and $\textit{Adapting to Contextual Knowledge}$ (e.g., simulating counter-intuitive physics). Collectively, these primitives challenge models to solve problems grounded entirely in the immediate context. Our systematic evaluation of 12 representative models reveals significant performance deficits in these tasks. Crucially, our diagnostic analysis disentangles these failure modes. It demonstrates that deficits stem from limited context comprehension rather than insufficient intrinsic generative capability. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free attention intervention strategy. Ultimately, $\textbf{GENIUS}$ establishes a rigorous standard for $\textit{GFI}$, guiding the field beyond knowledge utilization toward dynamic, general-purpose reasoning. Our dataset and code will be released at: $\href{https://github.com/arctanxarc/GENIUS}{https://github.com/arctanxarc/GENIUS}$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a visual-native search framework using visual snapshots of webpages and ICA for better reinforcement learning in noisy web environments, outperforming text-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning agents struggle with low signal-to-noise feedback in web environments, as text parsers ignore layout semantics and sparse rewards obscure critical actions.

Method: The framework represents webpages as visual snapshots and uses ICA for dense credit assignment, integrated with GRPO-based training.

Result: The approach outperforms text-based baselines on information-seeking benchmarks.

Conclusion: Visual snapshot grounding with ICA effectively addresses the credit-assignment bottleneck in open-ended web environments.

Abstract: Despite the strong performance achieved by reinforcement learning-trained information-seeking agents, learning in open-ended web environments remains severely constrained by low signal-to-noise feedback. Text-based parsers often discard layout semantics and introduce unstructured noise, while long-horizon training typically relies on sparse outcome rewards that obscure which retrieval actions actually matter. We propose a visual-native search framework that represents webpages as visual snapshots, allowing agents to leverage layout cues to quickly localize salient evidence and suppress distractors. To learn effectively from these high-dimensional observations, we introduce Information-Aware Credit Assignment (ICA), a post-hoc method that estimates each retrieved snapshot's contribution to the final outcome via posterior analysis and propagates dense learning signals back to key search turns. Integrated with a GRPO-based training pipeline, our approach consistently outperforms text-based baselines on diverse information-seeking benchmarks, providing evidence that visual snapshot grounding with information-level credit assignment alleviates the credit-assignment bottleneck in open-ended web environments. The code and datasets will be released in https://github.com/pc-inno/ICA_MM_deepsearch.git.

*Xuefeng Xu,Graham Cormode*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedPS is a federated learning framework addressing distributed data preprocessing challenges like privacy and communication efficiency by using aggregated statistics and data-sketching techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL research overlooks preprocessing, yet it's critical for model performance. Privacy and communication constraints complicate distributed preprocessing in FL.

Method: FedPS uses data-sketching to summarize local datasets efficiently and designs federated algorithms for preprocessing tasks like scaling, encoding, and missing-value imputation.

Result: FedPS offers flexible, communication-efficient, and consistent preprocessing pipelines for horizontal and vertical FL settings.

Conclusion: FedPS effectively bridges the gap in FL preprocessing, enhancing practicality and performance.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple parties to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw data. However, before training, data must be preprocessed to address missing values, inconsistent formats, and heterogeneous feature scales. This preprocessing stage is critical for model performance but is largely overlooked in FL research. In practical FL systems, privacy constraints prohibit centralizing raw data, while communication efficiency introduces further challenges for distributed preprocessing. We introduce FedPS, a unified framework for federated data preprocessing based on aggregated statistics. FedPS leverages data-sketching techniques to efficiently summarize local datasets while preserving essential statistical information. Building on these summaries, we design federated algorithms for feature scaling, encoding, discretization, and missing-value imputation, and extend preprocessing-related models such as k-Means, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Bayesian Linear Regression to both horizontal and vertical FL settings. FedPS provides flexible, communication-efficient, and consistent preprocessing pipelines for practical FL deployments.

*Seockbean Song,Chenyu Gan,Youngsik Yoon,Siwei Wang,Wei Chen,Jungseul Ok*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a CURE-UCB algorithm for Rising Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) problems, which leverages horizon-dependent optimality to outperform traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RMAB models scenarios where rewards improve with repeated use (e.g., hyperparameter tuning). Existing methods often ignore the horizon (budget), limiting performance. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes CURE-UCB, a UCB-based algorithm that explicitly incorporates the horizon (budget) to optimize decision-making in RMAB settings.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows a new regret upper bound, and experiments confirm CURE-UCB's superiority over horizon-agnostic baselines in structured environments.

Conclusion: CURE-UCB effectively leverages horizon information, achieving better performance in RMAB scenarios, and highlights the importance of horizon-aware strategies.

Abstract: The Rising Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) framework models environments where expected rewards of arms increase with plays, which models practical scenarios where performance of each option improves with the repeated usage, such as in robotics and hyperparameter tuning. For instance, in hyperparameter tuning, the validation accuracy of a model configuration (arm) typically increases with each training epoch. A defining characteristic of RMAB is em horizon-dependent optimality: unlike standard settings, the optimal strategy here shifts dramatically depending on the available budget $T$. This implies that knowledge of $T$ yields significantly greater utility in RMAB, empowering the learner to align its decision-making with this shifting optimality. However, the horizon-aware setting remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a novel CUmulative Reward Estimation UCB (CURE-UCB) that explicitly integrates the horizon. We provide a rigorous analysis establishing a new regret upper bound and prove that our method strictly outperforms horizon-agnostic strategies in structured environments like ``linear-then-flat'' instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant superiority over baselines.

*Bas Maat,Peter Bloem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores predicting integer labels directly using discrete distributions instead of treating them as continuous values, focusing on neural network applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional regression treats integer labels as continuous, altering their distribution. The study aims to leverage discrete distributions' benefits for accurate integer label prediction.

Method: Investigates various discrete distributions (existing and novel) suitable for neural networks, ensuring continuous parameters for backpropagation. Focuses on Bitwise (Bernoulli on bits) and discrete Laplace distributions.

Result: Bitwise and discrete Laplace distributions outperform others in tasks like tabular learning, sequential prediction, and image generation.

Conclusion: Directly modeling integer labels with discrete distributions (especially Bitwise and discrete Laplace) improves performance while maintaining compatibility with neural network training.

Abstract: We study the problem of predicting numeric labels that are constrained to the integers or to a subrange of the integers. For example, the number of up-votes on social media posts, or the number of bicycles available at a public rental station. While it is possible to model these as continuous values, and to apply traditional regression, this approach changes the underlying distribution on the labels from discrete to continuous. Discrete distributions have certain benefits, which leads us to the question whether such integer labels can be modeled directly by a discrete distribution, whose parameters are predicted from the features of a given instance. Moreover, we focus on the use case of output distributions of neural networks, which adds the requirement that the parameters of the distribution be continuous so that backpropagation and gradient descent may be used to learn the weights of the network. We investigate several options for such distributions, some existing and some novel, and test them on a range of tasks, including tabular learning, sequential prediction and image generation. We find that overall the best performance comes from two distributions: Bitwise, which represents the target integer in bits and places a Bernoulli distribution on each, and a discrete analogue of the Laplace distribution, which uses a distribution with exponentially decaying tails around a continuous mean.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the high computational demands of search-based RL methods (e.g., AlphaZero), aiming for reproducibility and efficiency in board game AI.

Method: Develops a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm and tests it on five board games (Animal Shogi, Gardner Chess, Go, Hex, Othello). Includes ablation studies to validate core techniques.

Result: The proposed method achieves more efficient learning compared to existing search-based methods, as demonstrated across all tested games.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential of model-free RL in board games, traditionally dominated by search-based approaches, and emphasizes the importance of the algorithm's core techniques.

Abstract: Board games have long served as complex decision-making benchmarks in artificial intelligence. In this field, search-based reinforcement learning methods such as AlphaZero have achieved remarkable success. However, their significant computational demands have been pointed out as barriers to their reproducibility. In this study, we propose a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm designed for board games to achieve more efficient learning. To validate the efficiency of the proposed method, we conducted comprehensive experiments on five board games: Animal Shogi, Gardner Chess, Go, Hex, and Othello. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more efficient learning than existing methods across these environments. In addition, our extensive ablation study shows the importance of core techniques used in the proposed method. We believe that our efficient algorithm shows the potential of model-free reinforcement learning in domains traditionally dominated by search-based methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), $K$ clients jointly train a model without sharing raw data. Because each participant invests data and compute, clients need mechanisms to later prove the provenance of a jointly trained model. Model watermarking embeds a hidden signal in the weights, but naive approaches either do not scale with many clients as per-client watermarks dilute as $K$ grows, or give any individual client the ability to verify and potentially remove the watermark. We introduce $(t,K)$-threshold watermarking: clients collaboratively embed a shared watermark during training, while only coalitions of at least $t$ clients can reconstruct the watermark key and verify a suspect model. We secret-share the watermark key $τ$ so that coalitions of fewer than $t$ clients cannot reconstruct it, and verification can be performed without revealing $τ$ in the clear. We instantiate our protocol in the white-box setting and evaluate on image classification. Our watermark remains detectable at scale ($K=128$) with minimal accuracy loss and stays above the detection threshold ($z\ge 4$) under attacks including adaptive fine-tuning using up to 20% of the training data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semi-Supervised Cross-Domain Imitation Learning (SS-CDIL), a method leveraging minimal supervision (few expert demos and unlabeled trajectories) to achieve stable and efficient policy learning across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain imitation learning accelerates policy learning by transferring expert knowledge, but existing methods (supervised or unsupervised) face challenges like instability or reliance on explicit alignment. SS-CDIL addresses these limitations by combining the strengths of both approaches with minimal supervision.

Method: The proposed SS-CDIL framework uses offline data (target expert demos and unlabeled imperfect trajectories) and introduces a novel cross-domain loss function for inter-domain state-action mapping. An adaptive weight function balances source and target domain knowledge.

Result: Experiments on MuJoCo and Robosuite benchmarks show the method outperforms baselines, achieving stable and data-efficient policy learning with minimal supervision.

Conclusion: SS-CDIL provides a robust solution for cross-domain imitation learning, combining theoretical rigor with practical performance, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: Cross-domain imitation learning (CDIL) accelerates policy learning by transferring expert knowledge across domains, which is valuable in applications where the collection of expert data is costly. Existing methods are either supervised, relying on proxy tasks and explicit alignment, or unsupervised, aligning distributions without paired data, but often unstable. We introduce the Semi-Supervised CDIL (SS-CDIL) setting and propose the first algorithm for SS-CDIL with theoretical justification. Our method uses only offline data, including a small number of target expert demonstrations and some unlabeled imperfect trajectories. To handle domain discrepancy, we propose a novel cross-domain loss function for learning inter-domain state-action mappings and design an adaptive weight function to balance the source and target knowledge. Experiments on MuJoCo and Robosuite show consistent gains over the baselines, demonstrating that our approach achieves stable and data-efficient policy learning with minimal supervision.

Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous, and learning on graphs has become a cornerstone in artificial intelligence and data mining communities. Unlike pixel grids in images or sequential structures in language, graphs exhibit a typical non-Euclidean structure with complex interactions among the objects. This paper argues that Riemannian geometry provides a principled and necessary foundation for graph representation learning, and that Riemannian graph learning should be viewed as a unifying paradigm rather than a collection of isolated techniques. While recent studies have explored the integration of graph learning and Riemannian geometry, most existing approaches are limited to a narrow class of manifolds, particularly hyperbolic spaces, and often adopt extrinsic manifold formulations. We contend that the central mission of Riemannian graph learning is to endow graph neural networks with intrinsic manifold structures, which remains underexplored. To advance this perspective, we identify key conceptual and methodological gaps in existing approaches and outline a structured research agenda along three dimensions: manifold type, neural architecture, and learning paradigm. We further discuss open challenges, theoretical foundations, and promising directions that are critical for unlocking the full potential of Riemannian graph learning. This paper aims to provide a coherent viewpoint and to stimulate broader exploration of Riemannian geometry as a foundational framework for future graph learning research.

### [235] [RePO: Bridging On-Policy Learning and Off-Policy Knowledge through Rephrasing Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10819)
*Linxuan Xia,Xiaolong Yang,Yongyuan Chen,Enyue Zhao,Deng Cai,Yasheng Wang,Boxi Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePO is a new method combining off-policy knowledge absorption with on-policy stability by rephrasing off-policy knowledge into high-quality trajectories, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific data is challenging. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) reduces generality, while on-policy RL struggles with hard samples. Off-policy RL improves hard sample utilization but faces instability.

Method: RePO rephrases off-policy knowledge into trajectories matching the model's stylistic and parametric distribution, replacing low-reward rollouts dynamically to preserve on-policy training stability.

Result: RePO improves hard-sample utilization and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: RePO effectively reconciles off-policy knowledge absorption with on-policy stability, offering superior performance in aligning LLMs with domain-specific data.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific data remains a fundamental challenge. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers a straightforward way to inject domain knowledge but often degrades the model's generality. In contrast, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) preserves generality but fails to effectively assimilate hard samples that exceed the model's current reasoning level. Recent off-policy RL attempts improve hard sample utilization, yet they suffer from severe training instability due to the forced distribution shift toward off-policy knowledge. To reconcile effective off-policy knowledge absorption with the stability of on-policy RL, we propose Rephrasing Policy Optimization (RePO). In RePO, the policy model is prompted to first comprehend off-policy knowledge and then rephrase it into trajectories that conform to its own stylistic and parametric distribution. RePO dynamically replaces low-reward rollouts with these rephrased, high-quality trajectories. This strategy guides the model toward correct reasoning paths while strictly preserving on-policy training dynamics. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that RePO improves hard-sample utilization and outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

*Max Cairney-Leeming,Amartya Sanyal,Christoph H. Lampert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASC, a differentially private algorithm for worst-case group optimization, ensuring consistent privacy and improved accuracy for minority groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for improving worst-case group performance compromise privacy, especially for minority groups, due to inhomogeneous privacy guarantees. ASC addresses this issue.

Method: ASC adaptively controls the sampling rate and clipping threshold for each group, allowing harder-to-learn groups to be sampled more often while maintaining uniform privacy.

Result: ASC achieves lower-variance gradients, tighter privacy guarantees, and higher worst-case group accuracy without sacrificing average accuracy.

Conclusion: ASC provides an effective solution for differentially private worst-case group optimization, balancing performance across groups while ensuring uniform privacy.

Abstract: Models trained by minimizing the average loss often fail to be accurate on small or hard-to-learn groups of the data. Various methods address this issue by optimizing a weighted objective that focuses on the worst-performing groups. However, this approach becomes problematic when learning with differential privacy, as unequal data weighting can result in inhomogeneous privacy guarantees, in particular weaker privacy for minority groups. In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for differentially private worst-case group optimization called ASC (Adaptively Sampled and Clipped Worst-case Group Optimization). It adaptively controls both the sampling rate and the clipping threshold of each group. Thereby, it allows for harder-to-learn groups to be sampled more often while ensuring consistent privacy guarantees across all groups. Comparing ASC to prior work, we show that it results in lower-variance gradients, tighter privacy guarantees, and substantially higher worst-case group accuracy without sacrificing overall average accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OSIL is an offline safe imitation learning algorithm that infers safety from non-preferred trajectories, reformulating the problem as a CMDP to learn safe and reward-maximizing policies without explicit cost or reward annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online learning can be risky, and specifying safety costs is challenging; non-preferred trajectories provide implicit safety information.

Method: OSIL formulates safe policy learning as a CMDP, deriving a lower bound on reward maximization and learning a cost model from non-preferred demonstrations.

Result: OSIL learns safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading reward performance, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: OSIL enables effective offline safe IL by leveraging non-preferred trajectories, avoiding the need for explicit safety cost annotations.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of offline safe imitation learning (IL), where the goal is to learn safe and reward-maximizing policies from demonstrations that do not have per-timestep safety cost or reward information. In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thus outperforming several baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the underexplored capability of LLMs in accurately simulating physical scenarios via code, a gap in current research.

Method: An automatic pipeline collects data (7,659 scenarios), with human verification. Ten LLMs are evaluated, and a reinforcement learning pipeline with visual rewards is introduced for training.

Result: Even top-performing LLMs achieve only a 21.5% pass rate, indicating the task's difficulty. Training with SimuScene data improves simulation and general code generation.

Conclusion: SimuScene highlights LLMs' limitations in physical simulation and offers a promising approach to enhance performance using visual rewards.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively studied for tasks like math competitions, complex coding, and scientific reasoning, yet their ability to accurately represent and simulate physical scenarios via code remains underexplored. We propose SimuScene, the first systematic study that trains and evaluates LLMs on simulating physical scenarios across five physics domains and 52 physical concepts. We build an automatic pipeline to collect data, with human verification to ensure quality. The final dataset contains 7,659 physical scenarios with 334 human-verified examples as the test set. We evaluated 10 contemporary LLMs and found that even the strongest model achieves only a 21.5% pass rate, demonstrating the difficulty of the task. Finally, we introduce a reinforcement learning pipeline with visual rewards that uses a vision-language model as a judge to train textual models. Experiments show that training with our data improves physical simulation via code while substantially enhancing general code generation performance.

Motivation: Rapid growth in deep learning adoption for telecom tasks highlights the need for automated model design to create efficient, high-performing models for resource-constrained environments.

Method: TabGNS, a gradient-based Neural Architecture Search method tailored for tabular data, is proposed.

Result: TabGNS achieves better prediction performance, reduces model size by 51-82%, and cuts search time by up to 36x compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TabGNS enables automated neural network design, accelerating ML deployment in telecommunications networks.

Abstract: The telecommunications industry is experiencing rapid growth in adopting deep learning for critical tasks such as traffic prediction, signal strength prediction, and quality of service optimisation. However, designing neural network architectures for these applications remains challenging and time-consuming, particularly when targeting compact models suitable for resource-constrained network environments. Therefore, there is a need for automating the model design process to create high-performing models efficiently. This paper introduces TabGNS (Tabular Gated Neuron Selection), a novel gradient-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method specifically tailored for tabular data in telecommunications networks. We evaluate TabGNS across multiple telecommunications and generic tabular datasets, demonstrating improvements in prediction performance while reducing the architecture size by 51-82% and reducing the search time by up to 36x compared to state-of-the-art tabular NAS methods. Integrating TabGNS into the model lifecycle management enables automated design of neural networks throughout the lifecycle, accelerating deployment of ML solutions in telecommunications networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to extend the multivariate DKW inequality to bandit feedback settings, addressing the challenge of learning CDFs with limited feedback.

Method: The study analyzes sample complexity for uniform approximation of CDFs using one-bit feedback, focusing on minimal feedback scenarios.

Result: The main result shows a sample complexity of ε^(-3) log(1/ε)^O(n) for uniform ε-approximation, with dimensionality n affecting only logarithmic terms.

Conclusion: The findings offer tight sample complexity bounds and new regret guarantees for learning fixed-price mechanisms in small markets.

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of learning a uniform approximation of an $n$-dimensional cumulative distribution function (CDF) within an error $ε> 0$, when observations are restricted to a minimal one-bit feedback. This serves as a counterpart to the multivariate DKW inequality under ''full feedback'', extending it to the setting of ''bandit feedback''. Our main result shows a near-dimensional-invariance in the sample complexity: we get a uniform $ε$-approximation with a sample complexity $\frac{1}{ε^3}{\log\left(\frac 1 ε\right)^{\mathcal{O}(n)}}$ over a arbitrary fine grid, where the dimensionality $n$ only affects logarithmic terms. As direct corollaries, we provide tight sample complexity bounds and novel regret guarantees for learning fixed-price mechanisms in small markets, such as bilateral trade settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Activation-based data attribution traces behavioral changes in language models to specific training datapoints, outperforming gradient-based methods and being cheaper.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify training datapoints responsible for specific behaviors in post-trained language models, validating attributions causally.

Method: Compute activation-difference vectors for test prompts and preference pairs, rank by cosine similarity, and validate by retraining with modified data.

Result: Reduced harmful behavior by 63% when filtering top-ranked datapoints, and by 78% when switching labels; method is 10x cheaper than baselines.

Conclusion: The method effectively identifies and mitigates harmful behaviors, providing a realistic benchmark for safety techniques.

Abstract: We propose activation-based data attribution, a method that traces behavioral changes in post-trained language models to responsible training datapoints. By computing activation-difference vectors for both test prompts and preference pairs and ranking by cosine similarity, we identify datapoints that cause specific behaviors and validate these attributions causally by retraining with modified data. Clustering behavior-datapoint similarity matrices also enables unsupervised discovery of emergent behaviors. Applying this to OLMo 2's production DPO training, we surfaced distractor-triggered compliance: a harmful behavior where the model complies with dangerous requests when benign formatting instructions are appended. Filtering top-ranked datapoints reduces this behavior by 63% while switching their labels achieves 78%. Our method outperforms gradient-based attribution and LLM-judge baselines while being over 10 times cheaper than both. This in-the-wild model organism - emerging from contaminated preference data rather than deliberate injection - provides a realistic benchmark for safety techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature selection methods like LASSO lack robustness and interpretability in medical prediction tasks.

Method: GRASP uses Shapley values for group-level importance scoring from a pretrained tree model (via SHAP) and enforces sparsity with group L21 regularized logistic regression.

Result: GRASP achieves comparable or better accuracy than LASSO, SHAP, and deep learning methods, with fewer redundant and more stable features.

Conclusion: GRASP provides a robust and interpretable solution for feature selection in medical prediction, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Feature selection remains a major challenge in medical prediction, where existing approaches such as LASSO often lack robustness and interpretability. We introduce GRASP, a novel framework that couples Shapley value driven attribution with group $L_{21}$ regularization to extract compact and non-redundant feature sets. GRASP first distills group level importance scores from a pretrained tree model via SHAP, then enforces structured sparsity through group $L_{21}$ regularized logistic regression, yielding stable and interpretable selections. Extensive comparisons with LASSO, SHAP, and deep learning based methods show that GRASP consistently delivers comparable or superior predictive accuracy, while identifying fewer, less redundant, and more stable features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational inefficiency in hypergradient estimation caused by Hessian inverse calculations in bilevel optimization problems.

Method: NHGD leverages the empirical Fisher information matrix as a surrogate for the Hessian, updating approximations synchronously with stochastic inner optimization.

Result: NHGD achieves error bounds and sample complexity comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational overhead significantly.

Conclusion: NHGD is scalable and effective for large-scale machine learning, offering practical advantages in bilevel learning tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we propose Natural Hypergradient Descent (NHGD), a new method for solving bilevel optimization problems. To address the computational bottleneck in hypergradient estimation--namely, the need to compute or approximate Hessian inverse--we exploit the statistical structure of the inner optimization problem and use the empirical Fisher information matrix as an asymptotically consistent surrogate for the Hessian. This design enables a parallel optimize-and-approximate framework in which the Hessian-inverse approximation is updated synchronously with the stochastic inner optimization, reusing gradient information at negligible additional cost. Our main theoretical contribution establishes high-probability error bounds and sample complexity guarantees for NHGD that match those of state-of-the-art optimize-then-approximate methods, while significantly reducing computational time overhead. Empirical evaluations on representative bilevel learning tasks further demonstrate the practical advantages of NHGD, highlighting its scalability and effectiveness in large-scale machine learning settings.

### [244] [General Flexible $f$-divergence for Challenging Offline RL Datasets with Low Stochasticity and Diverse Behavior Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11087)
*Jianxun Wang,Grant C. Forbes,Leonardo Villalobos-Arias,David L. Roberts*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Offline RL algorithms balance improving behavior policies and staying within dataset support, addressing challenges like limited exploration and diverse expertise levels using adaptive $f$-divergence constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical offline datasets often lack diversity or have limited exploration, and may come from multiple behavior policies with varying expertise, necessitating a balance between RL objectives and behavior policy constraints.

Method: The paper connects $f$-divergence and optimization constraints via a Linear Programming form for RL and convex conjugate, introducing flexible $f$-divergence to adaptively constrain learning objectives based on the dataset.

Result: Experiments on MuJoCo, Fetch, and AdroitHand environments validate the proposed LP form and show improved performance with flexible $f$-divergence in constrained optimization.

Conclusion: The flexible $f$-divergence approach effectively addresses challenges in offline RL, improving performance for complex datasets.

Abstract: Offline RL algorithms aim to improve upon the behavior policy that produces the collected data while constraining the learned policy to be within the support of the dataset. However, practical offline datasets often contain examples with little diversity or limited exploration of the environment, and from multiple behavior policies with diverse expertise levels. Limited exploration can impair the offline RL algorithm's ability to estimate \textit{Q} or \textit{V} values, while constraining towards diverse behavior policies can be overly conservative. Such datasets call for a balance between the RL objective and behavior policy constraints. We first identify the connection between $f$-divergence and optimization constraint on the Bellman residual through a more general Linear Programming form for RL and the convex conjugate. Following this, we introduce the general flexible function formulation for the $f$-divergence to incorporate an adaptive constraint on algorithms' learning objectives based on the offline training dataset. Results from experiments on the MuJoCo, Fetch, and AdroitHand environments show the correctness of the proposed LP form and the potential of the flexible $f$-divergence in improving performance for learning from a challenging dataset when applied to a compatible constrained optimization algorithm.

*Julian D. Schiller,Malte Heinrich,Victor G. Lopez,Matthias A. Müller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes truncated BPTT for training RNNs on time series tasks, highlighting the impact of the burn-in phase on performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard BPTT is computationally heavy for long sequences, prompting exploration of truncated BPTT as a practical alternative.

Method: Theoretical bounds are established for accuracy and performance loss when using subsequences instead of full sequences, focusing on the burn-in phase's role.

Result: Proper tuning of the burn-in phase can reduce prediction error by over 60% in some cases, validated by experiments on system identification and forecasting benchmarks.

Conclusion: The burn-in phase is crucial in truncated BPTT training, significantly affecting performance, and its optimization can yield substantial improvements.

Abstract: Training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with standard backpropagation through time (BPTT) can be challenging, especially in the presence of long input sequences. A practical alternative to reduce computational and memory overhead is to perform BPTT repeatedly over shorter segments of the training data set, corresponding to truncated BPTT. In this paper, we examine the training of RNNs when using such a truncated learning approach for time series tasks. Specifically, we establish theoretical bounds on the accuracy and performance loss when optimizing over subsequences instead of the full data sequence. This reveals that the burn-in phase of the RNN is an important tuning knob in its training, with significant impact on the performance guarantees. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on standard benchmarks from the fields of system identification and time series forecasting. In all experiments, we observe a strong influence of the burn-in phase on the training process, and proper tuning can lead to a reduction of the prediction error on the training and test data of more than 60% in some cases.

### [246] [Near-Constant Strong Violation and Last-Iterate Convergence for Online CMDPs via Decaying Safety Margins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10917)
*Qian Zuo,Zhiyong Wang,Fengxiang He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlexDOME, a novel algorithm for safe online reinforcement learning in CMDPs, achieving near-constant strong constraint violation and sublinear strong regret with non-asymptotic convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing primal-dual methods for CMDPs suffer from growing constraint violation or limited convergence, motivating the need for a solution that balances strong regret and safety.

Method: FlexDOME incorporates time-varying safety margins and regularization into the primal-dual framework, using a term-wise asymptotic dominance strategy.

Result: The algorithm achieves near-constant strong constraint violation ($\tilde{O}(1)$), sublinear strong regret, and non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence.

Conclusion: FlexDOME successfully addresses oscillation and violation growth in existing methods, validated by theoretical analysis and experiments.

Abstract: We study safe online reinforcement learning in Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under strong regret and violation metrics, which forbid error cancellation over time. Existing primal-dual methods that achieve sublinear strong reward regret inevitably incur growing strong constraint violation or are restricted to average-iterate convergence due to inherent oscillations. To address these limitations, we propose the Flexible safety Domain Optimization via Margin-regularized Exploration (FlexDOME) algorithm, the first to provably achieve near-constant $\tilde{O}(1)$ strong constraint violation alongside sublinear strong regret and non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence. FlexDOME incorporates time-varying safety margins and regularization terms into the primal-dual framework. Our theoretical analysis relies on a novel term-wise asymptotic dominance strategy, where the safety margin is rigorously scheduled to asymptotically majorize the functional decay rates of the optimization and statistical errors, thereby clamping cumulative violations to a near-constant level. Furthermore, we establish non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees via a policy-dual Lyapunov argument. Experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.

### [247] [Direct Learning of Calibration-Aware Uncertainty for Neural PDE Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11090)
*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural PDE surrogates learn uncertainty adaptively via cross-regularization, improving calibration without per-regime tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty calibration in data-limited or partially observed regimes where traditional methods rely on fixed noise or post hoc adjustments.

Method: Cross-regularized uncertainty learns uncertainty parameters during training using gradients from a held-out regularization split, optimizing predictor fit on training data and uncertainty controls on regularization data.

Result: Learned predictive distributions are better calibrated on held-out splits, and uncertainty fields concentrate in high-error regions.

Conclusion: The framework enables regime-adaptive uncertainty learning without per-regime tuning, improving calibration and spatial diagnostics.

Abstract: Neural PDE surrogates are often deployed in data-limited or partially observed regimes where downstream decisions depend on calibrated uncertainty in addition to low prediction error. Existing approaches obtain uncertainty through ensemble replication, fixed stochastic noise such as dropout, or post hoc calibration. Cross-regularized uncertainty learns uncertainty parameters during training using gradients routed through a held-out regularization split. The predictor is optimized on the training split for fit, while low-dimensional uncertainty controls are optimized on the regularization split to reduce train-test mismatch, yielding regime-adaptive uncertainty without per-regime noise tuning. The framework can learn continuous noise levels at the output head, within hidden features, or within operator-specific components such as spectral modes. We instantiate the approach in Fourier Neural Operators and evaluate on APEBench sweeps over observed fraction and training-set size. Across these sweeps, the learned predictive distributions are better calibrated on held-out splits and the resulting uncertainty fields concentrate in high-error regions in one-step spatial diagnostics.

*Riccardo Barbano,Alexander Denker,Zeljko Kereta,Runchang Li,Francisco Vargas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel paradigm for controlling the composition of pre-trained generative models by framing it as a cooperative Stochastic Optimal Control problem, steering diffusion trajectories toward a shared objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods treat model composition as algebraic operations on probability densities, assuming explicit knowledge of the target distribution, which is impractical. The authors aim to address this limitation.

Method: The proposed approach treats pre-trained diffusion models as interacting agents, using cooperative Stochastic Optimal Control to jointly steer their diffusion trajectories toward a shared output objective.

Result: The framework is validated on conditional MNIST generation, showing improved performance over a naive baseline that uses gradient guidance instead of learned cooperative control.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that formulating compositional generation as a cooperative control problem offers a promising alternative to traditional algebraic methods, with empirical validation supporting its effectiveness.

Abstract: Continuous-time generative models have achieved remarkable success in image restoration and synthesis. However, controlling the composition of multiple pre-trained models remains an open challenge. Current approaches largely treat composition as an algebraic composition of probability densities, such as via products or mixtures of experts. This perspective assumes the target distribution is known explicitly, which is almost never the case. In this work, we propose a different paradigm that formulates compositional generation as a cooperative Stochastic Optimal Control problem. Rather than combining probability densities, we treat pre-trained diffusion models as interacting agents whose diffusion trajectories are jointly steered, via optimal control, toward a shared objective defined on their aggregated output. We validate our framework on conditional MNIST generation and compare it against a naive inference-time DPS-style baseline replacing learned cooperative control with per-step gradient guidance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Spatio-temporal models analyze spatial structures and temporal dynamics, which makes them prone to information degeneration among space and time. Prior literature has demonstrated that over-squashing in causal attention or temporal convolutions creates a bias on the first tokens. To analyze whether such a bias is present in temporal attention mechanisms, we derive sensitivity bounds on the expected value of the Jacobian of a temporal attention layer. We theoretically show how off-diagonal attention scores depend on the sequence length, and that temporal attention matrices suffer a diagonal attention sink. We suggest regularization methods, and experimentally demonstrate their effectiveness.

*Yupu Gu,Rongzhe Wei,Andy Zhu,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoEEdit introduces a routing-stable framework for knowledge editing in sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, addressing challenges of computational cost and routing shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge editing methods don't work well sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. MoEEdit addresses this by ensuring routing stability through per-expert null-space projections, achieving efficient and precise knowledge editing.

Method: MoEEdit reparameterizes expert updates using per-expert null-space projections to maintain router inputs invariant, preventing routing shifts. It employs a block coordinate descent solver for efficient optimization.

Result: MoEEdit achieves top performance in efficacy, generalization, specificity, and routing stability while being computationally and memory efficient.

Conclusion: MoEEdit provides a scalable and precise solution for knowledge editing in sparse LLMs, highlighting the importance of routing-stable methods.

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) enables precise modifications to factual content in large language models (LLMs). Existing KE methods are largely designed for dense architectures, limiting their applicability to the increasingly prevalent sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models that underpin modern scalable LLMs. Although MoEs offer strong efficiency and capacity scaling, naively adapting dense-model editors is both computationally costly and prone to routing distribution shifts that undermine stability and consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce MoEEdit, the first routing-stable framework for parameter-modifying knowledge editing in MoE LLMs. Our method reparameterizes expert updates via per-expert null-space projections that keep router inputs invariant and thereby suppress routing shifts. The resulting block-structured optimization is solved efficiently with a block coordinate descent (BCD) solver. Experiments show that MoEEdit attains state-of-the-art efficacy and generalization while preserving high specificity and routing stability, with superior compute and memory efficiency. These results establish a robust foundation for scalable, precise knowledge editing in sparse LLMs and underscore the importance of routing-stable interventions.

*Sanghwa Kim,Junghyun Lee,Se-Young Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HCW-GLB-OMD, a robust algorithm for heteroskedastic generalized linear bandits with adversarial corruptions, achieving computationally efficient and near-optimal regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address heteroskedastic generalized linear bandits (GLBs) with adversarial corruptions, a problem encompassing various stochastic contextual bandit settings like heteroskedastic linear bandits and logistic/Poisson bandits. The goal is to develop a robust and efficient algorithm.

Method: The proposed method, HCW-GLB-OMD, combines an online mirror descent (OMD)-based estimator with Hessian-based confidence weights for corruption robustness. It ensures computational efficiency with O(1) space and time complexity per iteration.

Result: Under self-concordance assumptions, the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $	ilde{O}ig(d 	extstyle{\sqrt{\sum_t g(	au_t) \. \mu_{t,\star}}} + d^2 g_{\max} \. \kappa + d \. \kappa C\big)$, matching or improving upon existing bounds. A lower bound of $	ilde{\Omega}(d \. \sqrt{\sum_t g(	au_t) \. \mu_{t,\star}} + d C)$ is also provided.

Conclusion: HCW-GLB-OMD is instance-wise minimax optimal (up to a $\. \kappa$-factor) across heteroskedastic GLBs with adversarial corruptions, unifying and advancing previous results.

Abstract: We consider the problem of heteroskedastic generalized linear bandits (GLBs) with adversarial corruptions, which subsumes various stochastic contextual bandit settings, including heteroskedastic linear bandits and logistic/Poisson bandits. We propose HCW-GLB-OMD, which consists of two components: an online mirror descent (OMD)-based estimator and Hessian-based confidence weights to achieve corruption robustness. This is computationally efficient in that it only requires ${O}(1)$ space and time complexity per iteration. Under the self-concordance assumption on the link function, we show a regret bound of $\tilde{O}\left( d \sqrt{\sum_t g(τ_t) \dotμ_{t,\star}} + d^2 g_{\max} κ+ d κC \right)$, where $\dotμ_{t,\star}$ is the slope of $μ$ around the optimal arm at time $t$, $g(τ_t)$'s are potentially exogenously time-varying dispersions (e.g., $g(τ_t) = σ_t^2$ for heteroskedastic linear bandits, $g(τ_t) = 1$ for Bernoulli and Poisson), $g_{\max} = \max_{t \in [T]} g(τ_t)$ is the maximum dispersion, and $C \geq 0$ is the total corruption budget of the adversary. We complement this with a lower bound of $\tildeΩ(d \sqrt{\sum_t g(τ_t) \dotμ_{t,\star}} + d C)$, unifying previous problem-specific lower bounds. Thus, our algorithm achieves, up to a $κ$-factor in the corruption term, instance-wise minimax optimality simultaneously across various instances of heteroskedastic GLBs with adversarial corruptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative molecular optimization faces challenges like rare candidates, costly evaluations, and surrogate model distribution shift.

Method: Introduces Joint Self-Improvement with a joint generative-predictive model and self-improving sampling scheme.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in offline and online benchmarks under limited evaluation budgets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses distribution shift and improves molecule optimization efficiency.

Abstract: Generative molecular optimization aims to design molecules with properties surpassing those of existing compounds. However, such candidates are rare and expensive to evaluate, yielding sample efficiency essential. Additionally, surrogate models introduced to predict molecule evaluations, suffer from distribution shift as optimization drives candidates increasingly out-of-distribution. To address these challenges, we introduce Joint Self-Improvement, which benefits from (i) a joint generative-predictive model and (ii) a self-improving sampling scheme. The former aligns the generator with the surrogate, alleviating distribution shift, while the latter biases the generative part of the joint model using the predictive one to efficiently generate optimized molecules at inference-time. Experiments across offline and online molecular optimization benchmarks demonstrate that Joint Self-Improvement outperforms state-of-the-art methods under limited evaluation budgets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In RL post-training of LLM agents, calls to external tools take several seconds or even minutes, leaving allocated GPUs idle and inflating post-training time and cost. While many tool invocations repeat across parallel rollouts and could in principle be cached, naively caching their outputs for reuse is incorrect since tool outputs depend on the environment state induced by prior agent interactions. We present TVCACHE, a stateful tool-value cache for LLM agent post-training. TVCACHE maintains a tree of observed tool-call sequences and performs longest-prefix matching for cache lookups: a hit occurs only when the agent's full tool history matches a previously executed sequence, guaranteeing identical environment state. On three diverse workloads-terminal-based tasks, SQL generation, and video understanding. TVCACHE achieves cache hit rates of up to 70% and reduces median tool call execution time by up to 6.9X, with no degradation in post-training reward accumulation.

*Xinyu Yuan,Yan Qiao,Zonghui Wang,Wenzhi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pram is an ML-based method using multimodal language models to solve the multi-commodity flow problem, balancing optimality and tractability. It combines local subproblem resolution via MLMs with multi-agent reinforcement learning for global consistency, achieving near-optimal results and faster runtimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid expansion of allocation systems demands optimization engines that balance optimality and tractability, which existing methods struggle with.

Method: Pram divides the MCF problem into local subproblems solved by MLM-powered agents and ensures global consistency via multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Result: Pram achieves near-optimal performance, 1-2 orders of magnitude faster runtime, and strong robustness (<10% degradation under disruptions).

Conclusion: Pram provides a scalable, practical solution for future networks, leveraging MLMs for efficient and robust MCF problem-solving.

Abstract: The multi-commodity flow (MCF) problem is a fundamental topic in network flow and combinatorial optimization, with broad applications in transportation, communication, and logistics, etc. Nowadays, the rapid expansion of allocation systems has posed challenges for existing optimization engines in balancing optimality and tractability. In this paper, we present Pram, the first ML-based method that leverages the reasoning power of multimodal language models (MLMs) for addressing the trade-off dilemma -- a great need of service providers. As part of our proposal, Pram (i) quickly computes high-quality allocations by dividing the original problem into local subproblems, which are then resolved by an MLM-powered "agent", and (ii) ensures global consistency by harmonizing these subproblems via a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. Theoretically, we show that Pram, which learns to perform gradient descent in context, provably converges to the optimum within the family of MCF problems. Empirically, on real-world datasets and public topologies, Pram achieves performance comparable to, and in some cases even surpassing, linear programming solvers (very close to the optimal solution), and substantially lower runtimes (1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster). Moreover, Pram exhibits strong robustness (<10\% performance degradation under link failures or flow bursts), demonstrating MLM's generalization ability to unforeseen events. Pram is objective-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with mainstream allocation systems, providing a practical and scalable solution for future networks.

TL;DR: MoToRec introduces a framework using discrete semantic tokenization and a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE to address cold-start recommendation challenges in GNNs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle data sparsity and the item cold-start problem in recommender systems by leveraging multimodal content effectively, avoiding noise and entanglement.

Method: MoToRec employs a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE for disentangled representations, adaptive rarity amplification for cold-start items, and a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for signal fusion.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show MoToRec's superiority in overall and cold-start scenarios compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Discrete tokenization proves effective and scalable for mitigating cold-start challenges in recommender systems.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized recommender systems by effectively modeling complex user-item interactions, yet data sparsity and the item cold-start problem significantly impair performance, particularly for new items with limited or no interaction history. While multimodal content offers a promising solution, existing methods result in suboptimal representations for new items due to noise and entanglement in sparse data. To address this, we transform multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization. We present Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation (MoToRec), a framework centered on a sparsely-regularized Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) that generates a compositional semantic code of discrete, interpretable tokens, promoting disentangled representations. MoToRec's architecture is enhanced by three synergistic components: (1) a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE that promotes disentangled representations, (2) a novel adaptive rarity amplification that promotes prioritized learning for cold-start items, and (3) a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion with collaborative signals. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios. Our work validates that discrete tokenization provides an effective and scalable alternative for mitigating the long-standing cold-start challenge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Synthetic data helps pretrain models when real data is scarce, but transfer to real-world tasks is often unreliable. This study explores synthetic pretraining for human motion models and finds mixed results, with improvements when combined with real data or scaled, but limited gains due to domain mismatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of scarce real-world data for Human Activity Recognition (HAR), synthetic data is used for pretraining, but its transferability to real-world tasks remains uncertain.

Method: Pretraining motion time-series models on synthetic motion data derived from motion-capture representations, followed by evaluation on diverse downstream HAR tasks.

Result: Synthetic pretraining improves generalisation when mixed with real data or scaled sufficiently. However, large-scale motion-capture pretraining shows marginal gains due to domain mismatch with wearable signals.

Conclusion: Synthetic motion data offers potential for transferable HAR representations but faces sim-to-real challenges and limitations due to domain mismatch.

Abstract: Synthetic data offers a compelling path to scalable pretraining when real-world data is scarce, but models pretrained on synthetic data often fail to transfer reliably to deployment settings. We study this problem in full-body human motion, where large-scale data collection is infeasible but essential for wearable-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), and where synthetic motion can be generated from motion-capture-derived representations. We pretrain motion time-series models using such synthetic data and evaluate their transfer across diverse downstream HAR tasks. Our results show that synthetic pretraining improves generalisation when mixed with real data or scaled sufficiently. We also demonstrate that large-scale motion-capture pretraining yields only marginal gains due to domain mismatch with wearable signals, clarifying key sim-to-real challenges and the limits and opportunities of synthetic motion data for transferable HAR representations.

TL;DR: B3IT is a low-cost, strict black-box method for detecting changes in LLMs using border inputs, achieving performance comparable to grey-box approaches with significantly reduced costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing change detection methods in LLMs are either costly or require access to model weights/log probabilities, making them impractical for large-scale deployment. The goal is to develop a low-cost, black-box solution.

Method: The approach uses Border Inputs (inputs with multiple top output tokens) and leverages statistical insights from the model's Jacobian and Fisher information. The proposed B3IT scheme tracks these inputs for change detection.

Result: Experiments show B3IT successfully detects changes with performance matching grey-box methods, while reducing costs by 30x in a strict black-box setting.

Conclusion: B3IT provides an effective, low-cost, and practical solution for remote change detection in LLMs without requiring model internals.

Abstract: Remote change detection in LLMs is a difficult problem. Existing methods are either too expensive for deployment at scale, or require initial white-box access to model weights or grey-box access to log probabilities. We aim to achieve both low cost and strict black-box operation, observing only output tokens.
  Our approach hinges on specific inputs we call Border Inputs, for which there exists more than one output top token. From a statistical perspective, optimal change detection depends on the model's Jacobian and the Fisher information of the output distribution. Analyzing these quantities in low-temperature regimes shows that border inputs enable powerful change detection tests.
  Building on this insight, we propose the Black-Box Border Input Tracking (B3IT) scheme. Extensive in-vivo and in-vitro experiments show that border inputs are easily found for non-reasoning tested endpoints, and achieve performance on par with the best available grey-box approaches. B3IT reduces costs by $30\times$ compared to existing methods, while operating in a strict black-box setting.

Abstract: Identifying where quantum models may offer practical benefits in near term quantum machine learning (QML) requires moving beyond isolated algorithmic proposals toward systematic and empirical exploration across models, datasets, and hardware constraints. We introduce MerLin, an open source framework designed as a discovery engine for photonic and hybrid quantum machine learning. MerLin integrates optimized strong simulation of linear optical circuits into standard PyTorch and scikit learn workflows, enabling end to end differentiable training of quantum layers. MerLin is designed around systematic benchmarking and reproducibility. As an initial contribution, we reproduce eighteen state of the art photonic and hybrid QML works spanning kernel methods, reservoir computing, convolutional and recurrent architectures, generative models, and modern training paradigms. These reproductions are released as reusable, modular experiments that can be directly extended and adapted, establishing a shared experimental baseline consistent with empirical benchmarking methodologies widely adopted in modern artificial intelligence. By embedding photonic quantum models within established machine learning ecosystems, MerLin allows practitioners to leverage existing tooling for ablation studies, cross modality comparisons, and hybrid classical quantum workflows. The framework already implements hardware aware features, allowing tests on available quantum hardware while enabling exploration beyond its current capabilities, positioning MerLin as a future proof co design tool linking algorithms, benchmarks, and hardware.

Motivation: The study aims to provide a deeper theoretical understanding of PINNs in solving IBVPs by viewing their training process through a statistical learning lens.

Method: The authors reformulate PINN parameter estimation as a statistical learning problem, minimize KL divergence between true and PINN distributions, and apply singular learning theory tools.

Abstract: We study the training and performance of physics-informed learning for initial and boundary value problems (IBVP) with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) from a statistical learning perspective. Specifically, we restrict ourselves to parameterizations with hard initial and boundary condition constraints and reformulate the problem of estimating PINN parameters as a statistical learning problem. From this perspective, the physics penalty on the IBVP residuals can be better understood not as a regularizing term bus as an infinite source of indirect data, and the learning process as fitting the PINN distribution of residuals $p(y \mid x, t, w) q(x, t) $ to the true data-generating distribution $δ(0) q(x, t)$ by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true and PINN distributions. Furthermore, this analysis show that physics-informed learning with PINNs is a singular learning problem, and we employ singular learning theory tools, namely the so-called Local Learning Coefficient (Lau et al., 2025) to analyze the estimates of PINN parameters obtained via stochastic optimization for a heat equation IBVP. Finally, we discuss implications of this analysis on the quantification of predictive uncertainty of PINNs and the extrapolation capacity of PINNs.

### [260] [From Natural Language to Materials Discovery:The Materials Knowledge Navigation Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11123)
*Genmao Zhuang,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MKNA, a language-driven system, accelerates materials discovery by translating scientific intent into actions like database retrieval and property prediction, demonstrated by identifying high-Debye-temperature ceramics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional materials discovery relies on expert intuition and costly simulations. MKNA aims to automate and accelerate this process using natural language processing.

Method: MKNA translates natural-language scientific intent into executable actions for database retrieval, property prediction, structure generation, and stability evaluation. It autonomously extracts quantitative thresholds and design motifs.

Result: MKNA identified high-Debye-temperature ceramics (Theta_D > 800 K), rediscovered known ultra-stiff materials, and proposed new Be-C-rich compounds stable in the 1500-1700 K range.

Conclusion: MKNA successfully automates materials discovery, reconstructs interpretable design heuristics, and provides a generalizable platform for language-guided exploration.

Abstract: Accelerating the discovery of high-performance materials remains a central challenge across energy, electronics, and aerospace technologies, where traditional workflows depend heavily on expert intuition and computationally expensive simulations. Here we introduce the Materials Knowledge Navigation Agent (MKNA), a language-driven system that translates natural-language scientific intent into executable actions for database retrieval, property prediction, structure generation, and stability evaluation. Beyond automating tool invocation, MKNA autonomously extracts quantitative thresholds and chemically meaningful design motifs from literature and database evidence, enabling data-grounded hypothesis formation. Applied to the search for high-Debye-temperature ceramics, the agent identifies a literature-supported screening criterion (Theta_D > 800 K), rediscovers canonical ultra-stiff materials such as diamond, SiC, SiN, and BeO, and proposes thermodynamically stable, previously unreported Be-C-rich compounds that populate the sparsely explored 1500-1700 K regime. These results demonstrate that MKNA not only finds stable candidates but also reconstructs interpretable design heuristics, establishing a generalizable platform for autonomous, language-guided materials exploration.

### [261] [The Offline-Frontier Shift: Diagnosing Distributional Limits in Generative Multi-Objective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11126)
*Stephanie Holly,Alexandru-Ciprian Zăvoianu,Siegfried Silber,Sepp Hochreiter,Werner Zellinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generative methods in offline MOO often underperform evolutionary methods due to the offline-frontier shift, highlighting the need for out-of-distribution sampling to overcome this limitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand why generative methods, despite strong hypervolume performance, fail under other MOO metrics like generational distance.

Method: The paper analyzes generative and evolutionary methods in offline MOO, focusing on the offline-frontier shift and proposing out-of-distribution sampling via an integral probability metric.

Result: Generative methods perform conservatively close to the offline objective distribution, while evolutionary methods outperform them under certain metrics.

Conclusion: Offline MOO is distribution-shift-limited, and generative methods' limitations are tied to their inability to address the offline-frontier shift effectively.

Abstract: Offline multi-objective optimization (MOO) aims to recover Pareto-optimal designs given a finite, static dataset. Recent generative approaches, including diffusion models, show strong performance under hypervolume, yet their behavior under other established MOO metrics is less understood. We show that generative methods systematically underperform evolutionary alternatives with respect to other metrics, such as generational distance. We relate this failure mode to the offline-frontier shift, i.e., the displacement of the offline dataset from the Pareto front, which acts as a fundamental limitation in offline MOO. We argue that overcoming this limitation requires out-of-distribution sampling in objective space (via an integral probability metric) and empirically observe that generative methods remain conservatively close to the offline objective distribution. Our results position offline MOO as a distribution-shift--limited problem and provide a diagnostic lens for understanding when and why generative optimization methods fail.

### [262] [Asymmetric Prompt Weighting for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11128)
*Reinhard Heckel,Mahdi Soltanolkotabi,Christos Thramboulidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores asymmetric prompt weighting in reinforcement learning for LLMs, favoring low-success prompts to improve performance in from-scratch RL scenarios, supported by theoretical analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reinforcement learning in LLMs by addressing the limitations of current algorithms that focus on ambiguous prompts, and to improve performance in low-success regimes.

Method: Introduces asymmetric prompt weightings, assigning higher weights to prompts with low or zero empirical success probability, and provides theoretical analysis for optimal weighting.

Result: Asymmetric weighting accelerates convergence in low-success regimes, especially beneficial for from-scratch RL, while showing less impact in post-SFT RL scenarios.

Conclusion: Asymmetric prompt weighting is a promising approach for improving RL in LLMs, particularly in low-success scenarios, with theoretical support for its effectiveness.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has driven recent advances in LLM post-training, in particular for reasoning. Policy optimization algorithms generate a number of responses for a given prompt and then effectively weight the corresponding gradients depending on the rewards. The most popular algorithms including GRPO, DAPO, and RLOO focus on ambiguous prompts, i.e., prompts with intermediate success probability, while downgrading gradients with very easy and very hard prompts. In this paper, we consider asymmetric prompt weightings that assign higher weights to prompts with low, or even zero, empirical success probability. We find that asymmetric weighting particularly benefits from-scratch RL (as in R1-Zero), where training traverses a wide accuracy range, and less so in post-SFT RL where the model already starts at high accuracy. We also provide theory that characterizes prompt weights which minimize the time needed to raise success probability from an initial level to a target accuracy under a fixed update budget. In low-success regimes, where informative responses are rare and response cost dominates, these optimal weights become asymmetric, upweighting low success probabilities and thereby accelerating effective-time convergence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabICLv2 is a new state-of-the-art foundation model for tabular data, outperforming previous benchmarks through synthetic data generation, architectural innovations, and optimized pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To surpass existing tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2 and TabICL by improving predictive performance, generalization, and efficiency.

Method: Developed TabICLv2 with three key innovations: (1) novel synthetic data generation for diversity, (2) architectural improvements like scalable softmax, and (3) optimized pretraining using Muon optimizer.

Result: TabICLv2 outperforms RealTabPFN-2.5 on benchmarks, generalizes well to large datasets efficiently, and requires less compute.

Conclusion: TabICLv2 sets a new standard for tabular foundation models, balancing performance, scalability, and efficiency.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models, such as TabPFNv2 and TabICL, have recently dethroned gradient-boosted trees at the top of predictive benchmarks, demonstrating the value of in-context learning for tabular data. We introduce TabICLv2, a new state-of-the-art foundation model for regression and classification built on three pillars: (1) a novel synthetic data generation engine designed for high pretraining diversity; (2) various architectural innovations, including a new scalable softmax in attention improving generalization to larger datasets without prohibitive long-sequence pretraining; and (3) optimized pretraining protocols, notably replacing AdamW with the Muon optimizer. On the TabArena and TALENT benchmarks, TabICLv2 without any tuning surpasses the performance of the current state of the art, RealTabPFN-2.5 (hyperparameter-tuned, ensembled, and fine-tuned on real data). With only moderate pretraining compute, TabICLv2 generalizes effectively to million-scale datasets under 50GB GPU memory while being markedly faster than RealTabPFN-2.5. We provide extensive ablation studies to quantify these contributions and commit to open research by first releasing inference code and model weights at https://github.com/soda-inria/tabicl, with synthetic data engine and pretraining code to follow.

### [264] [Discovering Differences in Strategic Behavior Between Humans and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10324)
*Caroline Wang,Daniel Kasenberg,Kim Stachenfeld,Pablo Samuel Castro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores differences between human and LLM strategic behavior using AlphaEvolve to analyze iterated rock-paper-scissors, finding LLMs exhibit deeper strategic capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why LLM behavior diverges from humans in social and strategic scenarios is crucial for deployment.

Method: AlphaEvolve is used to discover interpretable models of human and LLM behavior from iterated rock-paper-scissors data.

Result: Frontier LLMs display deeper strategic behavior than humans in the analyzed game.

Conclusion: The study lays groundwork for identifying structural factors behind human-LLM behavioral differences in strategic interactions.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in social and strategic scenarios, it becomes critical to understand where and why their behavior diverges from that of humans. While behavioral game theory (BGT) provides a framework for analyzing behavior, existing models do not fully capture the idiosyncratic behavior of humans or black-box, non-human agents like LLMs. We employ AlphaEvolve, a cutting-edge program discovery tool, to directly discover interpretable models of human and LLM behavior from data, thereby enabling open-ended discovery of structural factors driving human and LLM behavior. Our analysis on iterated rock-paper-scissors reveals that frontier LLMs can be capable of deeper strategic behavior than humans. These results provide a foundation for understanding structural differences driving differences in human and LLM behavior in strategic interactions.

### [265] [LiveMedBench: A Contamination-Free Medical Benchmark for LLMs with Automated Rubric Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10367)
*Zhiling Yan,Dingjie Song,Zhe Fang,Yisheng Ji,Xiang Li,Quanzheng Li,Lichao Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LiveMedBench addresses limitations of static medical benchmarks by introducing a continuously updated, contamination-free, rubric-based benchmark for evaluating LLMs in clinical settings, revealing pervasive data contamination and contextual application challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical benchmarks suffer from data contamination and temporal misalignment, and current evaluation metrics inadequately verify clinical correctness, necessitating a more rigorous and reliable benchmark.

Method: LiveMedBench is developed with a Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework to filter noise and validate clinical integrity, and an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework for granular, case-specific criteria assessment.

Result: Evaluation of 38 LLMs shows the best-performing model achieves only 39.2%, with 84% exhibiting performance degradation on post-cutoff cases, highlighting data contamination risks and contextual application bottlenecks (35-48% of failures).

Conclusion: LiveMedBench provides a robust framework for evaluating LLMs in clinical settings, uncovering significant challenges in data contamination and contextual application, and advancing reliable assessment methods.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical settings demands rigorous and reliable evaluation. However, existing medical benchmarks remain static, suffering from two critical limitations: (1) data contamination, where test sets inadvertently leak into training corpora, leading to inflated performance estimates; and (2) temporal misalignment, failing to capture the rapid evolution of medical knowledge. Furthermore, current evaluation metrics for open-ended clinical reasoning often rely on either shallow lexical overlap (e.g., ROUGE) or subjective LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, both inadequate for verifying clinical correctness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LiveMedBench, a continuously updated, contamination-free, and rubric-based benchmark that weekly harvests real-world clinical cases from online medical communities, ensuring strict temporal separation from model training data. We propose a Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework that filters raw data noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based medical principles. For evaluation, we develop an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria, achieving substantially stronger alignment with expert physicians than LLM-as-a-Judge. To date, LiveMedBench comprises 2,756 real-world cases spanning 38 medical specialties and multiple languages, paired with 16,702 unique evaluation criteria. Extensive evaluation of 38 LLMs reveals that even the best-performing model achieves only 39.2%, and 84% of models exhibit performance degradation on post-cutoff cases, confirming pervasive data contamination risks. Error analysis further identifies contextual application-not factual knowledge-as the dominant bottleneck, with 35-48% of failures stemming from the inability to tailor medical knowledge to patient-specific constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Found-RL integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) for autonomous driving, addressing inefficiency and interpretability issues via asynchronous batch inference and supervision mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL struggles with sample inefficiency and lack of semantic interpretability in complex AD scenarios, while VLMs' high latency limits their use in RL training loops.

Method: Found-RL uses asynchronous batch inference to decouple VLM reasoning from simulations. It employs Value-Margin Regularization (VMR), Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG), and CLIP-based dense reward shaping with Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment.

Result: The lightweight RL model achieves near-VLM performance (approx. 500 FPS) without the computational overhead of billion-parameter VLMs.

Conclusion: Found-RL successfully bridges RL and VLM gaps for AD, enabling efficient, interpretable, and real-time learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD). However, RL suffers from sample inefficiency and a lack of semantic interpretability in complex scenarios. Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model can achieve near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (approx. 500 FPS). Code, data, and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/ys-qu/found-rl.

*Jihwan Oh,Murad Aghazada,Yooju Shin,Se-Young Yun,Taehyeon Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgoraBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in bargaining scenarios, along with human-aligned metrics and a learning pipeline to improve LLMs' negotiation skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to capture LLMs' limitations in bargaining, which involves strategic depth and human factors.

Method: The authors propose AgoraBench with nine settings, economically grounded metrics, and a human preference dataset with a learning pipeline.

Result: Baseline LLM strategies often misalign with human preferences, but the proposed framework improves negotiation performance.

Conclusion: The framework enhances LLMs' bargaining by aligning strategies with human preferences and deepening strategic behavior.

Abstract: Bargaining is often regarded as a logical arena rather than an art or a matter of intuition, yet Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to navigate it due to limited strategic depth and difficulty adapting to complex human factors. Current benchmarks rarely capture this limitation. To bridge this gap, we present an utility feedback centric framework. Our contributions are: (i) AgoraBench, a new benchmark spanning nine challenging settings (e.g., deception, monopoly) that supports diverse strategy modeling; (ii) human-aligned, economically grounded metrics derived from utility theory. This is operationalized via agent utility, negotiation power, and acquisition ratio that implicitly measure how well the negotiation aligns with human preference and (iii) a human preference grounded dataset with learning pipeline that strengthens LLMs' bargaining ability through both prompting and finetuning. Empirical results indicate that baseline LLM strategies often diverge from human preferences, while our mechanism substantially improves negotiation performance, yielding deeper strategic behavior and stronger opponent awareness.

*Zhenhe Cui,Huaxiang Xia,Hangjun Shen,Kailun Luo,Yong He,Wei Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can generate useful Qualitative Numerical Planning (QNP) abstractions for generalized planning with automated debugging guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs can generate QNP abstractions for generalized planning and fix errors via automated debugging.

Method: A prompt protocol inputs GP domains and tasks to LLMs for QNP abstraction generation, followed by automated debugging to detect and fix errors.

Result: Experiments show that LLMs, when guided by automated debugging, can produce useful QNP abstractions.

Conclusion: Automated debugging helps LLMs generate effective QNP abstractions for generalized planning.

Abstract: Qualitative Numerical Planning (QNP) serves as an important abstraction model for generalized planning (GP), which aims to compute general plans that solve multiple instances at once. Recent works show that large language models (LLMs) can function as generalized planners. This work investigates whether LLMs can serve as QNP abstraction generators for GP problems and how to fix abstractions via automated debugging. We propose a prompt protocol: input a GP domain and training tasks to LLMs, prompting them to generate abstract features and further abstract the initial state, action set, and goal into QNP problems. An automated debugging method is designed to detect abstraction errors, guiding LLMs to fix abstractions. Experiments demonstrate that under properly guided by automated debugging, some LLMs can generate useful QNP abstractions.

*Bo Xue,Yunchong Song,Fanghao Shao,Xuekai Zhu,Lin Chen,Luoyi Fu,Xinbing Wang,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flow of SpanS (FOSS), a GFlowNets framework for span generation to overcome limitations of autoregressive models by dynamically constructing a DAG-structured state space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models and prior GFlowNets-based methods are limited by tree-structured spaces, restricting flexibility and expressiveness in text generation.

Method: FoSS dynamically segments retrieved text spans into a variable-length vocabulary, forming a DAG-structured state space for GFlowNets to explore diverse paths.

Result: FoSS improves MAUVE scores by 12.5% over Transformers in text generation and achieves 3.5% gains on knowledge-intensive tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FoSS demonstrates superior performance and scalability, benefiting from larger models, more data, and richer retrieval corpora.

Abstract: Standard autoregressive language models generate text token-by-token from a fixed vocabulary, inducing a tree-structured state space when viewing token sampling as an action, which limits flexibility and expressiveness. Recent work introduces dynamic vocabulary by sampling retrieved text spans but overlooks that the same sentence can be composed of spans of varying lengths, lacking explicit modeling of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) state space. This leads to restricted exploration of compositional paths and is biased toward the chosen path. Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful for efficient exploring and generalizing over state spaces, particularly those with a DAG structure. However, prior GFlowNets-based language models operate at the token level and remain confined to tree-structured spaces, limiting their potential. In this work, we propose Flow of SpanS (FOSS), a principled GFlowNets framework for span generation. FoSS constructs a dynamic span vocabulary by segmenting the retrieved text flexibly, ensuring a DAG-structured state space, which allows GFlowNets to explore diverse compositional paths and improve generalization. With specialized reward models, FoSS generates diverse, high-quality text. Empirically, FoSS improves MAUVE scores by up to 12.5% over Transformer on text generation and achieves 3.5% gains on knowledge-intensive tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Scaling experiments further demonstrate FoSS benefits from larger models, more data, and richer retrieval corpora, retaining its advantage over strong baselines.

*Shuai Han,Mehdi Dastani,Shihan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NSAM integrates symbolic reasoning with deep reinforcement learning to automatically learn constraints and improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRL approaches rely on manual action masking and symbolic grounding, which can be limiting. NSAM aims to automate this process.

Method: NSAM learns symbolic models of states and action masks to exclude infeasible actions, combining symbolic reasoning with deep policy optimization.

Result: NSAM enhances sample efficiency and reduces constraint violations in DRL across multiple domains.

Conclusion: NSAM provides a scalable, minimally supervised solution for integrating symbolic constraints into DRL.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) may explore infeasible actions during training and execution. Existing approaches assume a symbol grounding function that maps high-dimensional states to consistent symbolic representations and a manually specified action masking techniques to constrain actions. In this paper, we propose Neuro-symbolic Action Masking (NSAM), a novel framework that automatically learn symbolic models, which are consistent with given domain constraints of high-dimensional states, in a minimally supervised manner during the DRL process. Based on the learned symbolic model of states, NSAM learns action masks that rules out infeasible actions. NSAM enables end-to-end integration of symbolic reasoning and deep policy optimization, where improvements in symbolic grounding and policy learning mutually reinforce each other. We evaluate NSAM on multiple domains with constraints, and experimental results demonstrate that NSAM significantly improves sample efficiency of DRL agent while substantially reducing constraint violations.

*Nanxu Gong,Haotian Li,Sixun Dong,Jianxun Lian,Yanjie Fu,Xing Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study examines whether reasoning skills in Large Language Models (LLMs) transfer to Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks, finding no consistent advantage for reasoning models and identifying key limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if advancements in formal reasoning (math, coding) in LLMs also enhance socio-cognitive skills like ToM.

Method: Systematic evaluation of nine LLMs on three ToM benchmarks, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models with fine-grained analysis.

Result: Reasoning models do not outperform non-reasoning models consistently; performance drops with longer responses or larger reasoning budgets.

Conclusion: Robust ToM requires capabilities beyond current reasoning methods, highlighting the need for unique development in socio-cognitive tasks.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) assesses whether models can infer hidden mental states such as beliefs, desires, and intentions, which is essential for natural social interaction. Although recent progress in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has boosted step-by-step inference in mathematics and coding, it is still underexplored whether this benefit transfers to socio-cognitive skills. We present a systematic study of nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing reasoning models with non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks. The results show that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. A fine-grained analysis reveals three insights. First, slow thinking collapses: accuracy significantly drops as responses grow longer, and larger reasoning budgets hurt performance. Second, moderate and adaptive reasoning benefits performance: constraining reasoning length mitigates failure, while distinct success patterns demonstrate the necessity of dynamic adaptation. Third, option matching shortcut: when multiple choice options are removed, reasoning models improve markedly, indicating reliance on option matching rather than genuine deduction. We also design two intervention approaches: Slow-to-Fast (S2F) adaptive reasoning and Think-to-Match (T2M) shortcut prevention to further verify and mitigate the problems. With all results, our study highlights the advancement of LRMs in formal reasoning (e.g., math, code) cannot be fully transferred to ToM, a typical task in social reasoning. We conclude that achieving robust ToM requires developing unique capabilities beyond existing reasoning methods.

TL;DR: HARPO is an RL method addressing heterogeneity in behavioral tasks, yielding a superior foundation model (Omnisapiens-7B 2.0) with significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models isolate human behavioral dimensions, limiting generalization and increasing costs. HARPO aims to unify learning across diverse tasks.

Method: Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO) balances learning by modulating advantages to prevent disproportionate task influence.

Result: Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 outperforms existing models (+16.85% multitask, +9.37% held-out) with clearer reasoning traces. HARPO also excels against recent RL methods.

Conclusion: HARPO effectively unifies learning across heterogeneous tasks, enabling robust and generalizable AI models for social behavior.

Abstract: To develop socially intelligent AI, existing approaches typically model human behavioral dimensions (e.g., affective, cognitive, or social attributes) in isolation. Although useful, task-specific modeling often increases training costs and limits generalization across behavioral settings. Recent reasoning RL methods facilitate training a single unified model across multiple behavioral tasks, but do not explicitly address learning across different heterogeneous behavioral data. To address this gap, we introduce Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO), an RL method that balances leaning across heterogeneous tasks and samples. This is achieved by modulating advantages to ensure that no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization. Using HARPO, we develop and release Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, a foundation model for social behavior processing. Relative to existing behavioral foundation models, Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves the strongest performance across behavioral tasks, with gains of up to +16.85% and +9.37% on multitask and held-out settings respectively, while producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces. We also validate HARPO against recent RL methods, where it achieves the most consistently strong performance across behavioral tasks.

TL;DR: V-STAR addresses probability-reward mismatch in RL-fine-tuned generative recommendation models by combining Value-Guided Efficient Decoding and Sibling-GRPO, improving exploration and advantage computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-fine-tuned generative models suffer from probability-reward mismatch, leading to insufficient exploration and weak RL signals due to conventional decoding methods.

Method: V-STAR introduces Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) for selective prefix deepening and Sibling-GRPO for sibling-relative advantage computation, forming a self-evolving loop.

Result: V-STAR outperforms baselines in accuracy and diversity on offline and online datasets under strict latency constraints.

Conclusion: V-STAR successfully mitigates the probability-reward mismatch, enhancing exploration and RL signal quality in generative recommendation models.

Abstract: Generative recommendation via autoregressive models has unified retrieval and ranking into a single conditional generation framework. However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components. First, a Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) is developed to identify decisive nodes and selectively deepen high-potential prefixes. This improves exploration efficiency without exhaustive tree search. Second, we propose Sibling-GRPO, which exploits the induced tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages and concentrates learning signals on decisive branching decisions. Extensive experiments on both offline and online datasets demonstrate that V-STAR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior accuracy and candidate-set diversity under strict latency constraints.

TL;DR: The paper explores perceptions of GenAI in higher education, focusing on ITEE disciplines, revealing mixed stakeholder views and proposing a framework for responsible integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand stakeholder perceptions of GenAI in higher education, particularly in ITEE fields, amidst regulatory and practical challenges.

Method: A mixed-method approach involving surveys of 61 staff and 37 students at the University of Oulu's Faculty of ITEE was used.

Result: Findings show shared and discipline-specific themes, such as interest in programming support and concerns over privacy and academic integrity.

Conclusion: The study proposes a conceptual framework and high-level requirements for responsible GenAI integration, emphasizing stakeholder engagement.

Abstract: Many staff and students in higher education have adopted generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools in their work and study. GenAI is expected to enhance cognitive systems by enabling personalized learning and streamlining educational services. However, stakeholders perceptions of GenAI in higher education remain divided, shaped by cultural, disciplinary, and institutional contexts. In addition, the EU AI Act requires universities to ensure regulatory compliance when deploying cognitive systems. These developments highlight the need for institutions to engage stakeholders and tailor GenAI integration to their needs while addressing concerns. This study investigates how GenAI is perceived within the disciplines of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE). Using a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 61 staff and 37 students at the Faculty of ITEE, University of Oulu. The results reveal both shared and discipline-specific themes, including strong interest in programming support from GenAI and concerns over response quality, privacy, and academic integrity.

*Xingyi Zhang,Yulei Ye,Kaifeng Huang,Wenhao Li,Xiangfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ScratchWorld is a benchmark for evaluating AI agents' ability to construct Scratch programs via GUIs, using two interaction modes and an execution-based protocol. Results show challenges in fine-grained GUI manipulation despite strong reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating AI agents' capabilities in constructing programs through GUIs, like Scratch, is underexplored. ScratchWorld addresses this gap.

Method: ScratchWorld includes 83 tasks across four categories (Create, Debug, Extend, Compute) and two interaction modes (primitive and composite) to assess visuomotor control and program reasoning. An execution-based protocol ensures functional correctness.

Result: Experiments reveal a significant reasoning-acting gap, with fine-grained GUI manipulation posing persistent challenges despite strong planning abilities.

Conclusion: ScratchWorld highlights the need for improved GUI manipulation skills in AI agents, even when reasoning capabilities are advanced.

Abstract: Block-based programming environments such as Scratch play a central role in low-code education, yet evaluating the capabilities of AI agents to construct programs through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) remains underexplored. We introduce ScratchWorld, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal GUI agents on program-by-construction tasks in Scratch. Grounded in the Use-Modify-Create pedagogical framework, ScratchWorld comprises 83 curated tasks spanning four distinct problem categories: Create, Debug, Extend, and Compute. To rigorously diagnose the source of agent failures, the benchmark employs two complementary interaction modes: primitive mode requires fine-grained drag-and-drop manipulation to directly assess visuomotor control, while composite mode uses high-level semantic APIs to disentangle program reasoning from GUI execution. To ensure reliable assessment, we propose an execution-based evaluation protocol that validates the functional correctness of the constructed Scratch programs through runtime tests within the browser environment. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art multimodal language models and GUI agents reveal a substantial reasoning--acting gap, highlighting persistent challenges in fine-grained GUI manipulation despite strong planning capabilities.

*Xuecheng Zou,Yu Tang,Bingbing Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SynergyKGC addresses structural resolution mismatch in KGC by integrating pre-trained entity semantics with heterogeneous topologies using cross-attention and semantic gating, improving performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGC methods struggle with structural noise in dense clusters and representation collapse in sparse regions due to mismatched representational demands.

Method: SynergyKGC uses relation-aware cross-attention, semantic gating, a density-dependent Identity Anchoring strategy, and a Double-tower Coherent Consistency architecture.

Result: The method improves hit rates on public benchmarks, demonstrating resilient information integration in non-homogeneous structured data.

Conclusion: SynergyKGC effectively resolves structural heterogeneity and enhances KGC performance, offering a generalized solution for similar challenges.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) fundamentally hinges on the coherent fusion of pre-trained entity semantics with heterogeneous topological structures to facilitate robust relational reasoning. However, existing paradigms encounter a critical "structural resolution mismatch," failing to reconcile divergent representational demands across varying graph densities, which precipitates structural noise interference in dense clusters and catastrophic representation collapse in sparse regions. We present SynergyKGC, an adaptive framework that advances traditional neighbor aggregation to an active Cross-Modal Synergy Expert via relation-aware cross-attention and semantic-intent-driven gating. By coupling a density-dependent Identity Anchoring strategy with a Double-tower Coherent Consistency architecture, SynergyKGC effectively reconciles topological heterogeneity while ensuring representational stability across training and inference phases. Systematic evaluations on two public benchmarks validate the superiority of our method in significantly boosting KGC hit rates, providing empirical evidence for a generalized principle of resilient information integration in non-homogeneous structured data.

*Leheng Sheng,Wenchang Ma,Ruixin Hong,Xiang Wang,An Zhang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLCER is a self-evolving method for rewarding CoT in LLMs without human annotation, outperforming outcome-centric RLVR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly rewarding CoT is challenging due to the need for human labeling and issues with static reward models, prompting an autonomous solution.

Method: RLCER uses self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics to reward CoT, enhancing RLVR with outcome-centric rewards.

Result: RLCER outperforms outcome-centric RLVR and improves inference-time performance when used as in-prompt hints.

Conclusion: Self-evolving rubrics provide reliable CoT supervision, making RLCER an effective autonomous solution for CoT rewarding.

Abstract: Despite chain-of-thought (CoT) playing crucial roles in LLM reasoning, directly rewarding it is difficult: training a reward model demands heavy human labeling efforts, and static RMs struggle with evolving CoT distributions and reward hacking. These challenges motivate us to seek an autonomous CoT rewarding approach that requires no human annotation efforts and can evolve gradually. Inspired by recent self-evolving training methods, we propose \textbf{RLCER} (\textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{C}oT Supervision via Self-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{R}ubrics), which enhances the outcome-centric RLVR by rewarding CoTs with self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics. We show that self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics provide reliable CoT supervision signals even without outcome rewards, enabling RLCER to outperform outcome-centric RLVR. Moreover, when used as in-prompt hints, these self-proposed rubrics further improve inference-time performance.

### [278] [Can LLMs Cook Jamaican Couscous? A Study of Cultural Novelty in Recipe Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10964)
*F. Carichon,R. Rampa,G. Farnadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates cultural biases in LLMs using cooking recipes, finding that LLMs fail to culturally adapt recipes as humans do, due to weak cultural representation and misunderstanding of creativity and tradition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can align with diverse cultures beyond dominant ones, focusing on cooking recipes as a cultural domain.

Method: Using the GlobalFusion dataset, LLMs generate culturally adapted recipes for comparison with human recipes.

Result: LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations, lacking correlation with cultural distance and misunderstanding cultural elements.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have fundamental limitations in culturally oriented generation, impacting culturally sensitive applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and shape cultural content, ranging from narrative writing to artistic production. While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications.

### [279] [CLI-Gym: Scalable CLI Task Generation via Agentic Environment Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10999)
*Yusong Lin,Haiyang Wang,Shuzhe Wu,Lue Fan,Feiyang Pan,Sanyuan Zhao,Dandan Tu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic coding tasks are enhanced by simulating environment histories with CLI-Gym, producing 1,655 tasks and improving model performance by 21.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To scale the acquisition of environment-intensive tasks for agents, addressing gaps in existing methods.

Method: Agents simulate environment histories using Dockerfile analogies, deriving tasks from buggy states and error messages.

Result: CLI-Gym generates 1,655 tasks, and LiberCoder achieves a 21.1% improvement on Terminal-Bench.

Conclusion: The first scalable pipeline for deriving environment-intensive tasks is introduced, significantly advancing agent capabilities.

Abstract: Agentic coding requires agents to effectively interact with runtime environments, e.g., command line interfaces (CLI), so as to complete tasks like resolving dependency issues, fixing system problems, etc. But it remains underexplored how such environment-intensive tasks can be obtained at scale to enhance agents' capabilities. To address this, based on an analogy between the Dockerfile and the agentic task, we propose to employ agents to simulate and explore environment histories, guided by execution feedback. By tracing histories of a healthy environment, its state can be inverted to an earlier one with runtime failures, from which a task can be derived by packing the buggy state and the corresponding error messages. With our method, named CLI-Gym, a total of 1,655 environment-intensive tasks are derived, being the largest collection of its kind. Moreover, with curated successful trajectories, our fine-tuned model, named LiberCoder, achieves substantial absolute improvements of +21.1% (to 46.1%) on Terminal-Bench, outperforming various strong baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first public pipeline for scalable derivation of environment-intensive tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GameDevBench is introduced as the first benchmark for evaluating agents on complex game development tasks requiring deep multimodal understanding, showing current agents struggle but improve with simple feedback mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of evaluation testbeds combining software development complexity with multimodal understanding in coding agents, game development serves as an ideal challenge due to its dense codebases and multimodal assets.

Method: GameDevBench includes 132 tasks from tutorials, assessing agents' ability to handle multimodal assets and code complexity. Simple image and video-based feedback mechanisms are introduced to enhance agent performance.

Result: Agents perform poorly initially (54.5% success rate), with performance dropping further on harder tasks (31.6%). Feedback methods improve performance significantly, e.g., Claude Sonnet 4.5's success rate increases from 33.3% to 47.7%.

Conclusion: GameDevBench highlights the challenges agents face in multimodal game development and demonstrates the potential of simple feedback mechanisms to improve performance, advocating for further research in this area.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress on coding agents, progress on their multimodal counterparts has lagged behind. A key challenge is the scarcity of evaluation testbeds that combine the complexity of software development with the need for deep multimodal understanding. Game development provides such a testbed as agents must navigate large, dense codebases while manipulating intrinsically multimodal assets such as shaders, sprites, and animations within a visual game scene. We present GameDevBench, the first benchmark for evaluating agents on game development tasks. GameDevBench consists of 132 tasks derived from web and video tutorials. Tasks require significant multimodal understanding and are complex -- the average solution requires over three times the amount of lines of code and file changes compared to prior software development benchmarks. Agents still struggle with game development, with the best agent solving only 54.5% of tasks. We find a strong correlation between perceived task difficulty and multimodal complexity, with success rates dropping from 46.9% on gameplay-oriented tasks to 31.6% on 2D graphics tasks. To improve multimodal capability, we introduce two simple image and video-based feedback mechanisms for agents. Despite their simplicity, these methods consistently improve performance, with the largest change being an increase in Claude Sonnet 4.5's performance from 33.3% to 47.7%. We release GameDevBench publicly to support further research into agentic game development.

*Wenkai Fan,Shurui Zhang,Xiaolong Wang,Haowei Yang,Tsz Wai Chan,Xingyan Chen,Junquan Bi,Zirui Zhou,Jia Liu,Kani Chen*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: AIvilization v0 is a large-scale AI society with a resource-constrained economy and LLM-agent architecture, focusing on long-term autonomy. It uses hierarchical planning, adaptive memory, and human steering to balance stability and reactivity, demonstrating stable markets and structured wealth stratification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a sustainable artificial society that balances long-term goal stability with reactive adaptability in dynamic environments, addressing challenges in autonomous agent design.

Method: The approach includes: (i) a hierarchical planner for goal decomposition, (ii) an adaptive agent profile with dual-process memory, and (iii) human-in-the-loop steering. The environment features survival costs, production tiers, and a price mechanism.

Result: Stable markets emerge, replicating heavy-tailed returns and volatility clustering, with wealth stratification linked to education and access. The full architecture outperforms simplified planners in multi-objective, long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: The AIvilization v0 framework successfully combines goal stability and reactivity, proving effective for long-term autonomy and complex societal simulations, with human steering enhancing adaptability.

Abstract: AIvilization v0 is a publicly deployed large-scale artificial society that couples a resource-constrained sandbox economy with a unified LLM-agent architecture, aiming to sustain long-horizon autonomy while remaining executable under rapidly changing environment. To mitigate the tension between goal stability and reactive correctness, we introduce (i) a hierarchical branch-thinking planner that decomposes life goals into parallel objective branches and uses simulation-guided validation plus tiered re-planning to ensure feasibility; (ii) an adaptive agent profile with dual-process memory that separates short-term execution traces from long-term semantic consolidation, enabling persistent yet evolving identity; and (iii) a human-in-the-loop steering interface that injects long-horizon objectives and short commands at appropriate abstraction levels, with effects propagated through memory rather than brittle prompt overrides. The environment integrates physiological survival costs, non-substitutable multi-tier production, an AMM-based price mechanism, and a gated education-occupation system. Using high-frequency transactions from the platforms mature phase, we find stable markets that reproduce key stylized facts (heavy-tailed returns and volatility clustering) and produce structured wealth stratification driven by education and access constraints. Ablations show simplified planners can match performance on narrow tasks, while the full architecture is more robust under multi-objective, long-horizon settings, supporting delayed investment and sustained exploration.

*Hsan Sandar Win,Andrew Walters,Cheng-Chew Lim,Daniel Webber,Seth Leslie,Tan Doan*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Contextual Mission Data (DCMD) to enhance Uninhabited Ground Vehicles (UGVs) by updating their knowledge base dynamically, improving autonomy and situation awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UGVs rely on pre-mission data, which can lead to ambiguities in dynamic environments. Updating this data contextually enhances their performance.

Method: An ontology-driven dynamic knowledge base was designed, using real-time data acquisition, implemented on four UGVs in a lab surveillance mission.

Result: The method successfully provided actionable contextual updates, improving mission success and situation awareness.

Conclusion: DCMD effectively addresses UGV limitations in dynamic environments, proving its utility in enhancing autonomy and situational awareness.

Abstract: In this paper, the concept of Dynamic Contextual Mission Data (DCMD) is introduced to develop an ontology-driven dynamic knowledge base for Uninhabited Ground Vehicles (UGVs) at the tactical edge. The dynamic knowledge base with DCMD is added to the UGVs to: support enhanced situation awareness; improve autonomous decision making; and facilitate agility within complex and dynamic environments. As UGVs are heavily reliant on the a priori information added pre-mission, unexpected occurrences during a mission can cause identification ambiguities and require increased levels of user input. Updating this a priori information with contextual information can help UGVs realise their full potential. To address this, the dynamic knowledge base was designed using an ontology-driven representation, supported by near real-time information acquisition and analysis, to provide in-mission on-platform DCMD updates. This was implemented on a team of four UGVs that executed a laboratory based surveillance mission. The results showed that the ontology-driven dynamic representation of the UGV operational environment was machine actionable, producing contextual information to support a successful and timely mission, and contributed directly to the situation awareness.

### [283] [Beyond Task Performance: A Metric-Based Analysis of Sequential Cooperation in Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Destructive Foraging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10685)
*Alejandro Mendoza Barrionuevo,Samuel Yanes Luis,Daniel Gutiérrez Reina,Sergio L. Toral Marín*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces general-purpose cooperation metrics for heterogeneous multi-agent systems in partial observability and temporal role dependency settings, focusing on efficiency, coordination, fairness, and sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in existing studies that primarily focus on algorithmic task completion, this work aims to provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating cooperation in multi-agent systems, particularly in foraging-like domains.

Method: The authors propose a suite of cooperation metrics structured into three categories: primary metrics, inter-team metrics, and intra-team metrics. These are validated in a destructive foraging scenario involving specialized teams of autonomous vehicles.

Result: The metrics were tested in a realistic aquatic surface cleaning scenario, evaluating both learning-based and heuristic algorithms. The results demonstrate their applicability and effectiveness in characterizing cooperation.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics offer a systematic way to analyze cooperation in multi-agent systems beyond task completion, providing insights into coordination, fairness, and sensitivity across different domains.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of analyzing cooperation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems which operate under partial observability and temporal role dependency, framed within a destructive multi-agent foraging setting. Unlike most previous studies, which focus primarily on algorithmic performance with respect to task completion, this article proposes a systematic set of general-purpose cooperation metrics aimed at characterizing not only efficiency, but also coordination and dependency between teams and agents, fairness, and sensitivity. These metrics are designed to be transferable to different multi-agent sequential domains similar to foraging. The proposed suite of metrics is structured into three main categories that jointly provide a multilevel characterization of cooperation: primary metrics, inter-team metrics, and intra-team metrics. They have been validated in a realistic destructive foraging scenario inspired by dynamic aquatic surface cleaning using heterogeneous autonomous vehicles. It involves two specialized teams with sequential dependencies: one focused on the search of resources, and another on their destruction. Several representative approaches have been evaluated, covering both learning-based algorithms and classical heuristic paradigms.

### [284] [The emergence of numerical representations in communicating artificial agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10996)
*Daniela Mihai,Lucas Weber,Francesca Franzon*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores whether communication pressure alone can lead to neural network-based agents developing numerical representations resembling human numerals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand if artificial agents can develop numerical communication systems without predefined numeric concepts, and whether these systems resemble human-like numerals.

Method: Two neural network agents played a referential game to communicate numerosities, using either discrete tokens or continuous sketches. No pre-defined numeric concepts were provided.

Result: Agents achieved high accuracy for trained numerosities but failed to generalize to unseen ones, producing non-compositional codes (e.g., reusing symbols or collapsing sketches).

Conclusion: Communication pressure alone enables precise transmission of learned numerosities, but additional pressures are needed for compositional and generalizable codes.

Abstract: Human languages provide efficient systems for expressing numerosities, but whether the sheer pressure to communicate is enough for numerical representations to arise in artificial agents, and whether the emergent codes resemble human numerals at all, remains an open question. We study two neural network-based agents that must communicate numerosities in a referential game using either discrete tokens or continuous sketches, thus exploring both symbolic and iconic representations. Without any pre-defined numeric concepts, the agents achieve high in-distribution communication accuracy in both communication channels and converge on high-precision symbol-meaning mappings. However, the emergent code is non-compositional: the agents fail to derive systematic messages for unseen numerosities, typically reusing the symbol of the highest trained numerosity (discrete), or collapsing extrapolated values onto a single sketch (continuous). We conclude that the communication pressure alone suffices for precise transmission of learned numerosities, but additional pressures are needed to yield compositional codes and generalisation abilities.

### [285] [Learning to Compose for Cross-domain Agentic Workflow Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11114)
*Jialiang Wang,Shengxiang Xu,Hanmo Liu,Jiachuan Wang,Yuyu Luo,Shimin Di,Min-Ling Zhang,Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decompose-recompose-decide mechanism for single-pass workflow generation in LLMs, outperforming iterative methods in efficiency and adaptability across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems rely on iterative refinement for workflow generation, which is costly and unstable under domain shifts.

Method: The proposed method learns reusable workflow capabilities, maps tasks to sparse compositions of these bases, and attributes success/failure to marginal effects of capabilities.

Result: The 1-pass generator outperforms SOTA refinement baselines using 20 iterations, reducing latency and cost significantly.

Conclusion: Internalizing workflow decomposition and recomposition enables efficient, adaptable, and stable cross-domain workflow generation.

Abstract: Automatically generating agentic workflows -- executable operator graphs or codes that orchestrate reasoning, verification, and repair -- has become a practical way to solve complex tasks beyond what single-pass LLM generation can reliably handle. Yet what constitutes a good workflow depends heavily on the task distribution and the available operators. Under domain shift, current systems typically rely on iterative workflow refinement to discover a feasible workflow from a large workflow space, incurring high iteration costs and yielding unstable, domain-specific behavior. In response, we internalize a decompose-recompose-decide mechanism into an open-source LLM for cross-domain workflow generation. To decompose, we learn a compact set of reusable workflow capabilities across diverse domains. To recompose, we map each input task to a sparse composition over these bases to generate a task-specific workflow in a single pass. To decide, we attribute the success or failure of workflow generation to counterfactual contributions from learned capabilities, thereby capturing which capabilities actually drive success by their marginal effects. Across stringent multi-domain, cross-domain, and unseen-domain evaluations, our 1-pass generator surpasses SOTA refinement baselines that consume 20 iterations, while substantially reducing generation latency and cost.
