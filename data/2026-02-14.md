*Manuel Hetzel,Kerim Turacan,Hannes Reichert,Konrad Doll,Bernhard Sick*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DD-MDN is a probabilistic Human Trajectory Forecasting model that improves accuracy, uncertainty calibration, and robustness to short observations using denoising diffusion and dual mixture density networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing gaps in uncertainty modeling, calibration, and forecasting from short observation periods in Human Trajectory Forecasting to enhance downstream applications like path planning.

Method: Combines a few-shot denoising diffusion backbone with a dual mixture density network to learn self-calibrated residence areas and probability-ranked anchor paths.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness to short observation intervals, and reliable uncertainty modeling on ETH/UCY, SDD, inD, and IMPTC datasets.

Conclusion: DD-MDN effectively bridges gaps in HTF by offering calibrated uncertainty and robustness, with potential impacts on autonomous driving and robotics.

Abstract: Human Trajectory Forecasting (HTF) predicts future human movements from past trajectories and environmental context, with applications in Autonomous Driving, Smart Surveillance, and Human-Robot Interaction. While prior work has focused on accuracy, social interaction modeling, and diversity, little attention has been paid to uncertainty modeling, calibration, and forecasts from short observation periods, which are crucial for downstream tasks such as path planning and collision avoidance. We propose DD-MDN, an end-to-end probabilistic HTF model that combines high positional accuracy, calibrated uncertainty, and robustness to short observations. Using a few-shot denoising diffusion backbone and a dual mixture density network, our method learns self-calibrated residence areas and probability-ranked anchor paths, from which diverse trajectory hypotheses are derived, without predefined anchors or endpoints. Experiments on the ETH/UCY, SDD, inD, and IMPTC datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness at short observation intervals, and reliable uncertainty modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ABot-M0 is a framework addressing challenges in building general-purpose embodied agents by unifying data, optimizing architecture, and proposing efficient action prediction via Action Manifold Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to overcome fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives in robotics, enabling knowledge transfer and generalization across diverse platforms and tasks.

Method: ABot-M0 introduces a systematic data curation pipeline and UniACT-dataset (6M trajectories, 9.5K hours). It uses Action Manifold Learning (AML) with a DiT backbone for efficient action prediction and modular perception via a dual-stream mechanism integrating VLM semantics and geometric priors.

Result: Unified pre-training improves generalization. AML enhances decoding speed and policy stability. Modular perception boosts spatial understanding without backbone modifications.

Conclusion: ABot-M0 advances general-purpose embodied intelligence through unified data, efficient learning, and modular design, with planned release of code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Building general-purpose embodied agents across diverse hardware remains a central challenge in robotics, often framed as the ''one-brain, many-forms'' paradigm. Progress is hindered by fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives. We present ABot-M0, a framework that builds a systematic data curation pipeline while jointly optimizing model architecture and training strategies, enabling end-to-end transformation of heterogeneous raw data into unified, efficient representations. From six public datasets, we clean, standardize, and balance samples to construct UniACT-dataset, a large-scale dataset with over 6 million trajectories and 9,500 hours of data, covering diverse robot morphologies and task scenarios. Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on a low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints. Based on this, we introduce Action Manifold Learning (AML), which uses a DiT backbone to predict clean, continuous action sequences directly. This shifts learning from denoising to projection onto feasible manifolds, improving decoding speed and policy stability. ABot-M0 supports modular perception via a dual-stream mechanism that integrates VLM semantics with geometric priors and multi-view inputs from plug-and-play 3D modules such as VGGT and Qwen-Image-Edit, enhancing spatial understanding without modifying the backbone and mitigating standard VLM limitations in 3D reasoning. Experiments show components operate independently with additive benefits. We will release all code and pipelines for reproducibility and future research.

### [3] [Toward Reliable Tea Leaf Disease Diagnosis Using Deep Learning Model: Enhancing Robustness With Explainable AI and Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11239)
*Samanta Ghosh,Jannatul Adan Mahi,Shayan Abrar,Md Parvez Mia,Asaduzzaman Rayhan,Abdul Awal Yasir,Asaduzzaman Hridoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automated deep learning model using EfficientNetB3 and DenseNet201 to classify tea leaf diseases, achieving 93% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tea plants are economically important in Bangladesh, but manual disease detection is error-prone and time-consuming. An automated solution is needed.

Method: The study uses the teaLeafBD dataset with 5,278 images classified into seven categories. The pipeline includes preprocessing, adversarial training, augmentation, and Explainable AI (Grad-CAM) for model evaluation.

Result: EfficientNetB3 achieved 93% accuracy, outperforming DenseNet201 (91%). The model is robust against noisy inputs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively detects tea leaf diseases, offering a practical solution for agricultural management.

Abstract: Tea is a valuable asset for the economy of Bangladesh. So, tea cultivation plays an important role to boost the economy. These valuable plants are vulnerable to various kinds of leaf infections which may cause less production and low quality. It is not so easy to detect these diseases manually. It may take time and there could be some errors in the detection.Therefore, the purpose of the study is to develop an automated deep learning model for tea leaf disease classification based on the teaLeafBD dataset so that anyone can detect the diseases more easily and efficiently. There are 5,278 high-resolution images in this dataset. The images are classified into seven categories. Six of them represents various diseases and the rest one represents healthy leaves. The proposed pipeline contains data preprocessing, data splitting, adversarial training, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and comprehension made possible with Explainable AI strategies. DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3 were employed to perform the classification task. To prepare the model more robustly, we applied adversarial training so it can operate effectively even with noisy or disturbed inputs. In addition, Grad-CAM visualization was executed to analyze the model's predictions by identifying the most influential regions of each image. Our experimental outcomes revealed that EfficientNetB3 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 93%, while DenseNet201 reached 91%. The outcomes prove that the effectiveness of the proposed approach can accurately detect tea leaf diseases and provide a practical solution for advanced agricultural management.

### [4] [Active Zero: Self-Evolving Vision-Language Models through Active Environment Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11241)
*Jinghan He,Junfeng Fang,Feng Xiong,Zijun Yao,Fei Shen,Haiyun Guo,Jinqiao Wang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Active-Zero introduces active exploration for vision-language models, improving performance over passive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-play methods for vision-language models are inefficient due to passive interaction with static datasets, leading to dependency on initial data and suboptimal learning.

Method: Active-Zero uses three co-evolving agents: a Searcher, Questioner, and Solver, creating a closed-loop system for active exploration and self-improvement.

Result: Active-Zero improves reasoning task accuracy by 5.7% and general understanding by 3.9% on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Active exploration is crucial for scalable and adaptive self-evolving vision-language systems.

Abstract: Self-play has enabled large language models to autonomously improve through self-generated challenges. However, existing self-play methods for vision-language models rely on passive interaction with static image collections, resulting in strong dependence on initial datasets and inefficient learning. Without the ability to actively seek visual data tailored to their evolving capabilities, agents waste computational effort on samples that are either trivial or beyond their current skill level. To address these limitations, we propose Active-Zero, a framework that shifts from passive interaction to active exploration of visual environments. Active-Zero employs three co-evolving agents: a Searcher that retrieves images from open-world repositories based on the model's capability frontier, a Questioner that synthesizes calibrated reasoning tasks, and a Solver refined through accuracy rewards. This closed loop enables self-scaffolding auto-curricula where the model autonomously constructs its learning trajectory. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across 12 benchmarks, Active-Zero achieves 53.97 average accuracy on reasoning tasks (5.7% improvement) and 59.77 on general understanding (3.9% improvement), consistently outperforming existing self-play baselines. These results highlight active exploration as a key ingredient for scalable and adaptive self-evolving vision-language systems.

### [5] [ReTracing: An Archaeological Approach Through Body, Machine, and Generative Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11242)
*Yitong Wang,Yue Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReTracing is a multi-agent performance art using AI and robots to explore how generative systems encode biases through movement, blending human and machine choreography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how AI influences bodily movement and reveals socio-cultural biases through embodied performance.

Method: Extracts human-machine interaction sentences from sci-fi, uses LLMs for prompts, transforms them into choreography via diffusion models, and tracks movements.

Result: Creates a digital archive of motion traces, highlighting biases encoded in AI-generated movements.

Conclusion: ReTracing offers a unique perspective on human-AI interactions and questions humanity's role alongside thinking, moving AIs.

Abstract: We present ReTracing, a multi-agent embodied performance art that adopts an archaeological approach to examine how artificial intelligence shapes, constrains, and produces bodily movement. Drawing from science-fiction novels, the project extracts sentences that describe human-machine interaction. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate paired prompts "what to do" and "what not to do" for each excerpt. A diffusion-based text-to-video model transforms these prompts into choreographic guides for a human performer and motor commands for a quadruped robot. Both agents enact the actions on a mirrored floor, captured by multi-camera motion tracking and reconstructed into 3D point clouds and motion trails, forming a digital archive of motion traces. Through this process, ReTracing serves as a novel approach to reveal how generative systems encode socio-cultural biases through choreographed movements. Through an immersive interplay of AI, human, and robot, ReTracing confronts a critical question of our time: What does it mean to be human among AIs that also move, think, and leave traces behind?

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates whether Video-Language Models (VidLMs) robustly understand video content, temporal sequence, and motion. It finds significant gaps and introduces REVEAL{}, a benchmark for diagnosing weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess VidLMs' reliability in handling video-specific tasks like temporal sequencing and motion understanding, uncovering their limitations.

Method: Introduces REVEAL{}, a diagnostic benchmark with five stress tests (e.g., temporal bias, language shortcuts) and evaluates leading VidLMs.

Result: VidLMs fail tasks like recognizing reversed scenes, neglecting video content, and handling camera motion, while humans excel.

Conclusion: Current VidLMs lack robustness in video understanding, highlighting the need for improved benchmarks and models.

Abstract: This work investigates a fundamental question: Do Video-Language Models (VidLMs) robustly account for video content, temporal sequence, and motion? Our investigation shows that, surprisingly, they often do not. We introduce REVEAL{}, a diagnostic benchmark that probes fundamental weaknesses of contemporary VidLMs through five controlled stress tests; assessing temporal expectation bias, reliance on language-only shortcuts, video sycophancy, camera motion sensitivity, and robustness to spatiotemporal occlusion. We test leading open- and closed-source VidLMs and find that these models confidently describe reversed scenes as forward, answer questions while neglecting video content, agree with false claims, struggle with basic camera motion, and fail to aggregate temporal information amidst simple spatiotemporal masking. Humans, on the other hand, succeed at these tasks with ease. Alongside our benchmark, we provide a data pipeline that automatically generates diagnostic examples for our stress tests, enabling broader and more scalable evaluation. We will release our benchmark and code to support future research.

*Jacob Rubinstein,Avi Donaty,Don Engel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pipeline for generating synthetic images from high-quality 3D models and camera poses enables repeatable, quantifiable experiments comparing ground-truth and reconstructed estimations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a systematic and quantifiable way to evaluate photogrammetry pipelines by comparing ground-truth virtual data with reconstructed estimations.

Method: Generating synthetic images from high-quality 3D models and programmatically created camera poses.

Result: Enables repeatable and quantifiable experiments for evaluating reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: The pipeline offers a robust framework for comparing photogrammetry techniques objectively.

Abstract: The generation of 3D models from real-world objects has often been accomplished through photogrammetry, i.e., by taking 2D photos from a variety of perspectives and then triangulating matched point-based features to create a textured mesh. Many design choices exist within this framework for the generation of digital twins, and differences between such approaches are largely judged qualitatively. Here, we present and test a novel pipeline for generating synthetic images from high-quality 3D models and programmatically generated camera poses. This enables a wide variety of repeatable, quantifiable experiments which can compare ground-truth knowledge of virtual camera parameters and of virtual objects against the reconstructed estimations of those perspectives and subjects.

### [8] [Selective Prior Synchronization via SYNC Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11316)
*Ishan Mishra,Jiajie Li,Deepak Mishra,Jinjun Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SYNC loss, integrating ad-hoc and post-hoc methods for selective prediction in DNNs, improving generalization and outperforming existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current selective prediction methods are either ad-hoc (like SelectiveNet) or post-hoc (like softmax response), missing the potential of using selective prior during training.

Method: Proposes SYNC loss, combining softmax response (post-hoc) with SelectiveNet (ad-hoc) by leveraging selective prior during training.

Result: SYNC loss enhances generalization and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on datasets like CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Stanford Cars.

Conclusion: Integrating selective prior during training improves selective prediction performance, setting new benchmarks.

Abstract: Prediction under uncertainty is a critical requirement for the deep neural network to succeed responsibly. This paper focuses on selective prediction, which allows DNNs to make informed decisions about when to predict or abstain based on the uncertainty level of their predictions. Current methods are either ad-hoc such as SelectiveNet, focusing on how to modify the network architecture or objective function, or post-hoc such as softmax response, achieving selective prediction through analyzing the model's probabilistic outputs. We observe that post-hoc methods implicitly generate uncertainty information, termed the selective prior, which has traditionally been used only during inference. We argue that the selective prior provided by the selection mechanism is equally vital during the training stage. Therefore, we propose the SYNC loss which introduces a novel integration of ad-hoc and post-hoc method. Specifically, our approach incorporates the softmax response into the training process of SelectiveNet, enhancing its selective prediction capabilities by examining the selective prior. Evaluated across various datasets, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Stanford Cars, our method not only enhances the model's generalization capabilities but also surpasses previous works in selective prediction performance, and sets new benchmarks for state-of-the-art performance.

### [9] [MDE-VIO: Enhancing Visual-Inertial Odometry Using Learned Depth Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11323)
*Arda Alniak,Sinan Kalkan,Mustafa Mert Ankarali,Afsar Saranli,Abdullah Aydin Alatan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating learned depth priors into VINS-Mono to improve monocular VIO in low-texture environments, achieving real-time edge deployment and reducing trajectory error by up to 28.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monocular VIO systems fail in low-texture areas due to sparse visual features. Dense depth estimation can help but existing solutions are computationally heavy.

Method: The authors integrate learned depth priors into VINS-Mono, enforcing affine-invariant depth consistency and ordinal constraints while filtering artifacts via variance-based gating.

Result: Experiments on TartanGround and M3ED show the method prevents divergence and reduces Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by up to 28.3%.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between computational efficiency and accuracy, enabling robust metric-scale recovery on edge devices.

Abstract: Traditional monocular Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) systems struggle in low-texture environments where sparse visual features are insufficient for accurate pose estimation. To address this, dense Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) has been widely explored as a complementary information source. While recent Vision Transformer (ViT) based complex foundational models offer dense, geometrically consistent depth, their computational demands typically preclude them from real-time edge deployment. Our work bridges this gap by integrating learned depth priors directly into the VINS-Mono optimization backend. We propose a novel framework that enforces affine-invariant depth consistency and pairwise ordinal constraints, explicitly filtering unstable artifacts via variance-based gating. This approach strictly adheres to the computational limits of edge devices while robustly recovering metric scale. Extensive experiments on the TartanGround and M3ED datasets demonstrate that our method prevents divergence in challenging scenarios and delivers significant accuracy gains, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by up to 28.3%. Code will be made available.

*Evgeney Bogatyrev,Khaled Abud,Ivan Molodetskikh,Nikita Alutis,Dmitry Vatolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces StreamSR, a dataset for real-time super-resolution in video streaming, and EfRLFN, an efficient model with novel design choices, showing improved performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets don't reflect streaming media challenges, and current benchmarks lack relevance. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: A new dataset (StreamSR) is introduced, and EfRLFN, a model with Efficient Channel Attention and hyperbolic tangent activation, is proposed. A composite loss function is designed for better convergence.

Result: EfRLFN outperforms 11 state-of-the-art models in streaming scenarios. Fine-tuning on StreamSR improves performance on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work provides a relevant dataset and an efficient model, enhancing real-time super-resolution for video streaming.

Abstract: Recent advancements in real-time super-resolution have enabled higher-quality video streaming, yet existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of compressed video content. Commonly used datasets do not accurately reflect the characteristics of streaming media, limiting the relevance of current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive dataset - StreamSR - sourced from YouTube, covering a wide range of video genres and resolutions representative of real-world streaming scenarios. We benchmark 11 state-of-the-art real-time super-resolution models to evaluate their performance for the streaming use-case.
  Furthermore, we propose EfRLFN, an efficient real-time model that integrates Efficient Channel Attention and a hyperbolic tangent activation function - a novel design choice in the context of real-time super-resolution. We extensively optimized the architecture to maximize efficiency and designed a composite loss function that improves training convergence. EfRLFN combines the strengths of existing architectures while improving both visual quality and runtime performance.
  Finally, we show that fine-tuning other models on our dataset results in significant performance gains that generalize well across various standard benchmarks. We made the dataset, the code, and the benchmark available at https://github.com/EvgeneyBogatyrev/EfRLFN.

*Samuel Waugh,Stuart James*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtContext pipeline uses Open-Access Art History articles and Wikidata to annotate artworks, leveraging a novel CLIP model (PaintingCLIP) for improved context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying insights about artworks from scattered articles is challenging.

Method: Collect corpus, adapt CLIP with LoRA for domain-specific use (PaintingCLIP).

Result: PaintingCLIP outperforms CLIP in providing artwork context.

Conclusion: The pipeline is generalizable for humanities applications.

Abstract: Many Art History articles discuss artworks in general as well as specific parts of works, such as layout, iconography, or material culture. However, when viewing an artwork, it is not trivial to identify what different articles have said about the piece. Therefore, we propose ArtContext, a pipeline for taking a corpus of Open-Access Art History articles and Wikidata Knowledge and annotating Artworks with this information. We do this using a novel corpus collection pipeline, then learn a bespoke CLIP model adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to make it domain-specific. We show that the new model, PaintingCLIP, which is weakly supervised by the collected corpus, outperforms CLIP and provides context for a given artwork. The proposed pipeline is generalisable and can be readily applied to numerous humanities areas.

### [12] [Latent Forcing: Reordering the Diffusion Trajectory for Pixel-Space Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11401)
*Alan Baade,Eric Ryan Chan,Kyle Sargent,Changan Chen,Justin Johnson,Ehsan Adeli,Li Fei-Fei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent Forcing improves latent diffusion models by jointly processing latents and pixels, achieving efficient high-quality image generation on raw images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent diffusion models lose end-to-end benefits by discarding information during encoding and requiring separate decoders.

Method: Latent Forcing modifies architectures to process latents and pixels jointly with tuned noise schedules, using latents as intermediate computation space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffusion transformer-based pixel generation on ImageNet.

Conclusion: Latent Forcing successfully combines efficiency and quality in raw image generation, highlighting the importance of conditioning signal order.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images but lose the benefits of end-to-end modeling. They discard information during image encoding, require a separately trained decoder, and model an auxiliary distribution to the raw data. In this paper, we propose Latent Forcing, a simple modification to existing architectures that achieves the efficiency of latent diffusion while operating on raw natural images. Our approach orders the denoising trajectory by jointly processing latents and pixels with separately tuned noise schedules. This allows the latents to act as a scratchpad for intermediate computation before high-frequency pixel features are generated. We find that the order of conditioning signals is critical, and we analyze this to explain differences between REPA distillation in the tokenizer and the diffusion model, conditional versus unconditional generation, and how tokenizer reconstruction quality relates to diffusability. Applied to ImageNet, Latent Forcing achieves a new state-of-the-art for diffusion transformer-based pixel generation at our compute scale.

*Carolina Brás,Soufiane Ben Haddou,Thijs P. Kuipers,Laura Alvarez-Florez,R. Nils Planken,Fleur V. Y. Tjong,Connie Bezzina,Ivana Išgum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed using high-resolution CTA to train a neural implicit function for better cardiac shape analysis in CMRI, achieving accurate RV and MYO reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anisotropic CMRI limits cardiac shape analysis; CTA offers near-isotropic data to improve accuracy.

Method: Train a neural implicit function with CTA data to represent cardiac shapes from CMRI at any resolution.

Result: Achieved Dice scores of 0.91 (RV) and 0.75 (MYO), and Hausdorff distances of 6.21mm (RV) and 7.53mm (MYO).

Conclusion: Method improves cardiac shape analysis with accurate, smooth, and anatomically plausible reconstructions.

Abstract: The anisotropic nature of short-axis (SAX) cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) limits cardiac shape analysis. To address this, we propose to leverage near-isotropic, higher resolution computed tomography angiography (CTA) data of the heart. We use this data to train a single neural implicit function to jointly represent cardiac shapes from CMRI at any resolution. We evaluate the method for the reconstruction of right ventricle (RV) and myocardium (MYO), where MYO simultaneously models endocardial and epicardial left-ventricle surfaces. Since high-resolution SAX reference segmentations are unavailable, we evaluate performance by extracting a 4-chamber (4CH) slice of RV and MYO from their reconstructed shapes. When compared with the reference 4CH segmentation masks from CMRI, our method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.91 $\pm$ 0.07 and 0.75 $\pm$ 0.13, and a Hausdorff distance of 6.21 $\pm$ 3.97 mm and 7.53 $\pm$ 5.13 mm for RV and MYO, respectively. Quantitative and qualitative assessment demonstrate the model's ability to reconstruct accurate, smooth and anatomically plausible shapes, supporting improvements in cardiac shape analysis.

### [14] [Ctrl&Shift: High-Quality Geometry-Aware Object Manipulation in Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11440)
*Penghui Ruan,Bojia Zi,Xianbiao Qi,Youze Huang,Rong Xiao,Pichao Wang,Jiannong Cao,Yuhui Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ctrl&Shift is a diffusion framework for realistic object manipulation in images/videos, balancing geometric consistency, background preservation, and user control without explicit 3D modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to simultaneously achieve background preservation, geometric consistency, and user control; Ctrl&Shift addresses this gap.

Method: Decomposes manipulation into removal and reference-guided inpainting stages within a unified diffusion process, using multi-task training and scalable dataset generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, viewpoint consistency, and controllability without explicit 3D representations.

Conclusion: Ctrl&Shift unifies fine-grained control and generalization for object manipulation, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Object-level manipulation, relocating or reorienting objects in images or videos while preserving scene realism, is central to film post-production, AR, and creative editing. Yet existing methods struggle to jointly achieve three core goals: background preservation, geometric consistency under viewpoint shifts, and user-controllable transformations. Geometry-based approaches offer precise control but require explicit 3D reconstruction and generalize poorly; diffusion-based methods generalize better but lack fine-grained geometric control. We present Ctrl&Shift, an end-to-end diffusion framework to achieve geometry-consistent object manipulation without explicit 3D representations. Our key insight is to decompose manipulation into two stages, object removal and reference-guided inpainting under explicit camera pose control, and encode both within a unified diffusion process. To enable precise, disentangled control, we design a multi-task, multi-stage training strategy that separates background, identity, and pose signals across tasks. To improve generalization, we introduce a scalable real-world dataset construction pipeline that generates paired image and video samples with estimated relative camera poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ctrl&Shift achieves state-of-the-art results in fidelity, viewpoint consistency, and controllability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify fine-grained geometric control and real-world generalization for object manipulation, without relying on any explicit 3D modeling.

### [15] [Enhanced Portable Ultra Low-Field Diffusion Tensor Imaging with Bayesian Artifact Correction and Deep Learning-Based Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11446)
*Mark D. Olchanyi,Annabel Sorby-Adams,John Kirsch,Brian L. Edlow,Ava Farnan,Renfei Liu,Matthew S. Rosen,Emery N. Brown,W. Taylor Kimberly,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a nine-direction, single-shell ULF DTI sequence with a Bayesian bias correction and superresolution algorithm (DiffSR) to improve white matter imaging at ultra-low-field, showing success in synthetic and real scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the spatial and angular resolution of ultra-low-field (ULF) DTI scans, which currently suffer from low quality due to coarse resolution and artifacting, in order to improve white matter tract imaging and disease classification.

Method: Developed a nine-direction, single-shell ULF DTI sequence alongside a Bayesian bias field correction algorithm and a superresolution algorithm (DiffSR) that works without re-training.

Result: The algorithms successfully recovered microstructural and volumetric white matter information at ULF and improved agreement in DTI metrics for Alzheimer's disease classification.

Conclusion: The freely disseminated tools aim to advance ULF DTI reconstruction and harmonization, with potential applications in neuroimaging and disease research.

Abstract: Portable, ultra-low-field (ULF) magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to expand access to neuroimaging but currently suffers from coarse spatial and angular resolutions and low signal-to-noise ratios. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a sequence tailored to detect and reconstruct white matter tracts within the brain, is particularly prone to such imaging degradation due to inherent sequence design coupled with prolonged scan times. In addition, ULF DTI scans exhibit artifacting that spans both the space and angular domains, requiring a custom modelling algorithm for subsequent correction. We introduce a nine-direction, single-shell ULF DTI sequence, as well as a companion Bayesian bias field correction algorithm that possesses angular dependence and convolutional neural network-based superresolution algorithm that is generalizable across DTI datasets and does not require re-training (''DiffSR''). We show through a synthetic downsampling experiment and white matter assessment in real, matched ULF and high-field DTI scans that these algorithms can recover microstructural and volumetric white matter information at ULF. We also show that DiffSR can be directly applied to white matter-based Alzheimers disease classification in synthetically degraded scans, with notable improvements in agreement between DTI metrics, as compared to un-degraded scans. We freely disseminate the Bayesian bias correction algorithm and DiffSR with the goal of furthering progress on both ULF reconstruction methods and general DTI sequence harmonization. We release all code related to DiffSR for $\href{https://github.com/markolchanyi/DiffSR}{public \space use}$.

Motivation: Existing feature compression methods lack flexibility and generalization, requiring retraining for new compression ratios. ARFC addresses this by enabling arbitrary ratios with a single model.

Method: ARFC uses an Arbitrary Ratio Compressor (ARC) for auto-regressive compression. It includes Mixture of Solutions (MoS) to refine tokens and Entity Relation Graph Constraint (ERGC) to maintain semantic relationships.

Result: ARFC outperforms existing methods on cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and retrieval tasks across datasets, sometimes surpassing uncompressed features.

Conclusion: ARFC is versatile and effective for resource-constrained scenarios, offering superior performance and flexibility in feature compression.

Abstract: Feature compression is increasingly important for improving the efficiency of downstream tasks, especially in applications involving large-scale or multi-modal data. While existing methods typically rely on dedicated models for achieving specific compression ratios, they are often limited in flexibility and generalization. In particular, retraining is necessary when adapting to a new compression ratio. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and flexible Arbitrary Ratio Feature Compression (ARFC) framework, which supports any compression ratio with a single model, eliminating the need for multiple specialized models. At its core, the Arbitrary Ratio Compressor (ARC) is an auto-regressive model that performs compression via next-token prediction. This allows the compression ratio to be controlled at inference simply by adjusting the number of generated tokens. To enhance the quality of the compressed features, two key modules are introduced. The Mixture of Solutions (MoS) module refines the compressed tokens by utilizing multiple compression results (solutions), reducing uncertainty and improving robustness. The Entity Relation Graph Constraint (ERGC) is integrated into the training process to preserve semantic and structural relationships during compression. Extensive experiments on cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and image retrieval tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches at various compression ratios. Notably, in some cases, it even surpasses the performance of the original, uncompressed features. These results validate the effectiveness and versatility of ARFC for practical, resource-constrained scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models struggle with cross-modal hallucinations and occlusion ambiguity in human-object interaction tasks, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: ImagineAgent uses cognitive maps to model entity-action relationships and dynamically employs tools like retrieval augmentation, image cropping, and diffusion models for cross-modal alignment.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets, requiring only 20% of training data compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ImagineAgent effectively addresses ambiguity in visual-textual reasoning, balancing accuracy and efficiency in Open-Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have shown promising capabilities in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in Open-Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (OV-HOI) are limited by cross-modal hallucinations and occlusion-induced ambiguity. To address this, we propose \textbf{ImagineAgent}, an agentic framework that harmonizes cognitive reasoning with generative imagination for robust visual understanding. Specifically, our method innovatively constructs cognitive maps that explicitly model plausible relationships between detected entities and candidate actions. Subsequently, it dynamically invokes tools including retrieval augmentation, image cropping, and diffusion models to gather domain-specific knowledge and enriched visual evidence, thereby achieving cross-modal alignment in ambiguous scenarios. Moreover, we propose a composite reward that balances prediction accuracy and tool efficiency. Evaluations on SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance, requiring approximately 20\% of training data compared to existing methods, validating our robustness and efficiency.

Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of annotated data in X-ray angiogram analysis by leveraging domain-specific anatomical knowledge.

Method: Introduces VasoMIM with anatomy-guided masking and anatomical consistency loss. Uses XA-170K dataset for pre-training.

Result: Superior transferability and state-of-the-art performance on four downstream tasks across six datasets.

Conclusion: VasoMIM shows promise as a foundation model for advancing X-ray angiogram analysis.

Abstract: X-ray angiography is the gold standard imaging modality for cardiovascular diseases. However, current deep learning approaches for X-ray angiogram analysis are severely constrained by the scarcity of annotated data. While large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution, its potential in this domain remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of effective SSL frameworks and large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce a vascular anatomy-aware masked image modeling (VasoMIM) framework that explicitly integrates domain-specific anatomical knowledge. Specifically, VasoMIM comprises two key designs: an anatomy-guided masking strategy and an anatomical consistency loss. The former strategically masks vessel-containing patches to compel the model to learn robust vascular semantics, while the latter preserves structural consistency of vessels between original and reconstructed images, enhancing the discriminability of the learned representations. In conjunction with VasoMIM, we curate XA-170K, the largest X-ray angiogram pre-training dataset to date. We validate VasoMIM on four downstream tasks across six datasets, where it demonstrates superior transferability and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. These findings highlight the significant potential of VasoMIM as a foundation model for advancing a wide range of X-ray angiogram analysis tasks.

*Yingkai Zhang,Shuang Chen,Ye Tian,Yunyi Gao,Jianyong Jiang,Ying Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MFdiff, a supervise-assisted multi-modality fusion diffusion model, to restore high-quality PET images from low-dose scans using MR images, addressing challenges in structure-texture fusion and OOD data mismatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing radiation exposure in PET scans by lowering radiotracer dose or scan time degrades image quality. The paper aims to restore standard-dose PET images from low-dose inputs using MR images, overcoming fusion and OOD challenges.

Method: MFdiff uses a multi-modality feature fusion module to optimize fusion features without extraneous details. A diffusion model iteratively generates high-quality PET images using these features. A two-stage supervise-assisted learning strategy leverages generalized and specific priors.

Result: Experiments show MFdiff effectively restores high-quality PET images and outperforms state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: MFdiff successfully addresses multi-modality fusion and OOD challenges, providing superior PET restoration from low-dose inputs.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) offers powerful functional imaging but involves radiation exposure. Efforts to reduce this exposure by lowering the radiotracer dose or scan time can degrade image quality. While using magnetic resonance (MR) images with clearer anatomical information to restore standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) is a promising approach, it faces challenges with the inconsistencies in the structure and texture of multi-modality fusion, as well as the mismatch in out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we propose a supervise-assisted multi-modality fusion diffusion model (MFdiff) for addressing these challenges for high-quality PET restoration. Firstly, to fully utilize auxiliary MR images without introducing extraneous details in the restored image, a multi-modality feature fusion module is designed to learn an optimized fusion feature. Secondly, using the fusion feature as an additional condition, high-quality SPET images are iteratively generated based on the diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage supervise-assisted learning strategy that harnesses both generalized priors from simulated in-distribution datasets and specific priors tailored to in-vivo OOD data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed MFdiff effectively restores high-quality SPET images from multi-modality inputs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative compression framework for image denoising combines low-complexity structural coding with perceptual realism using GANs and diffusion models, achieving better perceptual quality without compromising distortion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional distortion-driven denoising methods often produce over-smoothed results under strong noise or distribution shifts. This work aims to improve perceptual realism while preserving structural details.

Method: Two approaches are proposed: (1) a conditional WGAN-based compression denoiser for explicit RDP trade-off control, and (2) a diffusion-based reconstruction guided by compressed latents. Both use entropy coding and perceptual metrics like LPIPS and Wasserstein distance.

Result: The framework shows consistent perceptual improvements on synthetic and real-noise benchmarks while maintaining competitive distortion performance. Theoretical guarantees for reconstruction error and decoding error probability are provided.

Conclusion: The proposed generative compression framework effectively balances perceptual quality and distortion, outperforming traditional methods in realistic denoising scenarios.

Abstract: Image denoising aims to remove noise while preserving structural details and perceptual realism, yet distortion-driven methods often produce over-smoothed reconstructions, especially under strong noise and distribution shift. This paper proposes a generative compression framework for perception-based denoising, where restoration is achieved by reconstructing from entropy-coded latent representations that enforce low-complexity structure, while generative decoders recover realistic textures via perceptual measures such as learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) loss and Wasserstein distance. Two complementary instantiations are introduced: (i) a conditional Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)-based compression denoiser that explicitly controls the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) trade-off, and (ii) a conditional diffusion-based reconstruction strategy that performs iterative denoising guided by compressed latents. We further establish non-asymptotic guarantees for the compression-based maximum-likelihood denoiser under additive Gaussian noise, including bounds on reconstruction error and decoding error probability. Experiments on synthetic and real-noise benchmarks demonstrate consistent perceptual improvements while maintaining competitive distortion performance.

Result: The framework achieves superior photorealism and content fidelity in ultra-high-resolution video generation, validated by extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: LUVE effectively addresses the limitations of current video diffusion models, offering a robust solution for high-quality UHR video generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly improved visual quality, yet ultra-high-resolution (UHR) video generation remains a formidable challenge due to the compounded difficulties of motion modeling, semantic planning, and detail synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{LUVE}, a \textbf{L}atent-cascaded \textbf{U}HR \textbf{V}ideo generation framework built upon dual frequency \textbf{E}xperts. LUVE employs a three-stage architecture comprising low-resolution motion generation for motion-consistent latent synthesis, video latent upsampling that performs resolution upsampling directly in the latent space to mitigate memory and computational overhead, and high-resolution content refinement that integrates low-frequency and high-frequency experts to jointly enhance semantic coherence and fine-grained detail generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LUVE achieves superior photorealism and content fidelity in UHR video generation, and comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve performance degradation and training instability when applying PEFT to multi-agent settings in V2X collaborative perception.

Method: Proposes FlowAdapt, using optimal transport theory with Wasserstein Greedy Sampling and Progressive Knowledge Transfer to minimize redundancy and preserve semantics.

Result: FlowAdapt achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks using only 1% of trainable parameters, improving sample efficiency and generalization.

Conclusion: FlowAdapt effectively bridges domain gaps in multi-agent V2X perception, addressing key challenges with minimal parameter overhead.

Abstract: Fast domain adaptation remains a fundamental challenge for deploying multi-agent systems across diverse environments in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception. Despite the success of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) in natural language processing and conventional vision tasks, directly applying PEFT to multi-agent settings leads to significant performance degradation and training instability. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis and identify two key factors: (i) inter-frame redundancy in heterogeneous sensory streams, and (ii) erosion of fine-grained semantics in deep-layer representations under PEFT adaptation. To address these issues, we propose FlowAdapt, a parameter-efficient framework grounded in optimal transport theory, which minimizes information transport costs across both data distributions and network hierarchies. Specifically, we introduce a Wasserstein Greedy Sampling strategy to selectively filter redundant samples via a bounded covering radius. Furthermore, Progressive Knowledge Transfer module is designed to progressively inject compressed early-stage representations into later stages through learnable pathways, alleviating semantic degradation in late-stage adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that FlowAdapt achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of trainable parameters, effectively bridging domain gaps with superior sample efficiency and generalization.

TL;DR: AI-aided vision-based SHM integrates CV and DL to analyze structural damage. The paper proposes LLM-DRS, a framework using LLMs to generate summary reports from unified vision data and metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous SHM methods provide discrete outputs requiring manual reorganization. The rise of LLMs offers new opportunities to automate and enhance reconnaissance summaries.

Method: LLM-DRS collects vision data and metadata following a standard process, extracts key attributes via Deep CNNs, and uses LLMs to generate structured reports.

Result: The framework shows promise for improving post-disaster reconnaissance efficiency and resilience.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs into SHM enhances automation and effectiveness, particularly for rapid disaster response.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided vision-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as an effective approach for monitoring and assessing structural condition by analyzing image and video data. By integrating Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning (DL), vision-based SHM can automatically identify and localize visual patterns associated with structural damage. However, previous works typically generate only discrete outputs, such as damage class labels and damage region coordinates, requiring engineers to further reorganize and analyze these results for evaluation and decision-making. In late 2022, Large Language Models (LLMs) became popular across multiple fields, providing new insights into AI-aided vision-based SHM. In this study, a novel LLM-based Disaster Reconnaissance Summarization (LLM-DRS) framework is proposed. It introduces a standard reconnaissance plan in which the collection of vision data and corresponding metadata follows a well-designed on-site investigation process. Text-based metadata and image-based vision data are then processed and integrated into a unified format, where well-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks extract key attributes, including damage state, material type, and damage level. Finally, all data are fed into an LLM with carefully designed prompts, enabling the LLM-DRS to generate summary reports for individual structures or affected regions based on aggregated attributes and metadata. Results show that integrating LLMs into vision-based SHM, particularly for rapid post-disaster reconnaissance, demonstrates promising potential for improving resilience of the built environment through effective reconnaissance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLOT-CT introduces Voronoi decomposition in pre-log sinograms to improve LDCT reconstruction by mitigating noise and preserving structural information, achieving superior PSNR results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LDCT reconstruction methods fail to fully utilize pre-log structural information and are noise-sensitive due to logarithmic transformation.

Method: PLOT-CT applies Voronoi decomposition to pre-log sinograms, disentangling data into latent spaces to enhance discriminative feature learning.

Result: PLOT-CT outperforms traditional methods with a 2.36dB PSNR improvement at the 1e4 incident photon level.

Conclusion: PLOT-CT effectively addresses noise and fidelity challenges in LDCT reconstruction by leveraging pre-log domain decomposition, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reconstruction is fundamentally challenged by severe noise and compromised data fidelity under reduced radiation exposure. Most existing methods operate either in the image or post-log projection domain, which fails to fully exploit the rich structural information in pre-log measurements while being highly susceptible to noise. The requisite logarithmic transformation critically amplifies noise within these data, imposing exceptional demands on reconstruction precision. To overcome these challenges, we propose PLOT-CT, a novel framework for Pre-Log vOronoi decomposiTion-assisted CT generation. Our method begins by applying Voronoi decomposition to pre-log sinograms, disentangling the data into distinct underlying components, which are embedded in separate latent spaces. This explicit decomposition significantly enhances the model's capacity to learn discriminative features, directly improving reconstruction accuracy by mitigating noise and preserving information inherent in the pre-log domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLOT-CT achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining a 2.36dB PSNR improvement over traditional methods at the 1e4 incident photon level in the pre-log domain.

TL;DR: PLESS is a pseudo-label enhancement strategy for weakly supervised medical image segmentation using scribble annotations, improving reliability and spatial consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weakly supervised learning with scribble annotations reduces labeling costs but suffers from noisy and incomplete supervision. Current methods rely on pseudo-labels, which limit performance.

Method: PLESS hierarchically partitions images into coherent regions and propagates scribble information to refine pseudo-labels, enhancing their reliability and consistency.

Result: Experiments on cardiac MRI datasets (ACDC and MSCMRseg) show consistent segmentation accuracy improvements across four scribble-supervised algorithms.

Conclusion: PLESS is a model-agnostic framework that effectively enhances pseudo-labels, improving segmentation accuracy in weakly supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning with scribble annotations uses sparse user-drawn strokes to indicate segmentation labels on a small subset of pixels. This annotation reduces the cost of dense pixel-wise labeling, but suffers inherently from noisy and incomplete supervision. Recent scribble-based approaches in medical image segmentation address this limitation using pseudo-label-based training; however, the quality of the pseudo-labels remains a key performance limit. We propose PLESS, a generic pseudo-label enhancement strategy which improves reliability and spatial consistency. It builds on a hierarchical partitioning of the image into a hierarchy of spatially coherent regions. PLESS propagates scribble information to refine pseudo-labels within semantically coherent regions. The framework is model-agnostic and easily integrates into existing pseudo-label methods. Experiments on two public cardiac MRI datasets (ACDC and MSCMRseg) across four scribble-supervised algorithms show consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy. Code will be made available on GitHub upon acceptance.

TL;DR: ScalSelect is a scalable, training-free method for multimodal data selection in VIT, reducing redundancy and computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale VIT training is computationally expensive and inefficient due to data redundancy, necessitating efficient data selection methods.

Method: ScalSelect constructs instruction-relevant sample representations and approximates the dominant subspace of the full dataset for scalable importance scoring.

Result: ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of full-data performance using only 16% of the data and even outperforms full-data training in some cases.

Conclusion: ScalSelect offers an efficient, scalable solution for multimodal data selection, significantly improving training efficiency.

Abstract: Large-scale Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) has become a key paradigm for advancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) across various multimodal tasks. However, training on the large-scale datasets is computationally expensive and inefficient due to redundancy in the data, which motivates the need for multimodal data selection to improve training efficiency. Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation. Training-free alternatives often depend on proxy models or datasets, instruction-agnostic representations, and pairwise similarity with quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and representation fidelity. In this work, we propose ScalSelect, a scalable training-free multimodal data selection method with linear-time complexity with respect to the number of samples, eliminating the need for external models or auxiliary datasets. ScalSelect first constructs sample representations by extracting visual features most attended by instruction tokens in the target VLM, capturing instruction-relevant information. It then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets demonstrate that ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of the performance of training on the full dataset using only 16% of the data, and even outperforms full-data training in some settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance surface reconstruction by encoding it as a solution to Poisson's equation, exploiting its connection to physics and its linearity.

Method: Encode surface reconstruction as Poisson's equation, use Green's functions for closed-form solutions, and superpose solutions for the implicit field.

Result: Improved approximation of high-frequency details with minimal shape priors.

Conclusion: The approach effectively leverages Poisson's equation for better surface reconstruction, particularly in capturing fine details.

Abstract: Implicit shape representation, such as SDFs, is a popular approach to recover the surface of a 3D shape as the level sets of a scalar field. Several methods approximate SDFs using machine learning strategies that exploit the knowledge that SDFs are solutions of the Eikonal partial differential equation (PDEs). In this work, we present a novel approach to surface reconstruction by encoding it as a solution to a proxy PDE, namely Poisson's equation. Then, we explore the connection between Poisson's equation and physics, e.g., the electrostatic potential due to a positive charge density. We employ Green's functions to obtain a closed-form parametric expression for the PDE's solution, and leverage the linearity of our proxy PDE to find the target shape's implicit field as a superposition of solutions. Our method shows improved results in approximating high-frequency details, even with a small number of shape priors.

TL;DR: A novel GR-Diffusion framework integrates geometric priors with diffusion models for superior 3D PET reconstruction, outperforming existing methods in quality and detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET reconstruction faces challenges like noise and detail loss; GR-Diffusion aims to address these by combining geometric priors and diffusion models.

Method: GR-Diffusion uses GR-generated reference images for hierarchical guidance during diffusion, refining details and correcting deviations sequentially.

Result: GR-Diffusion shows better performance on UDPET and Clinical datasets, improving image quality and preserving physiological details.

Conclusion: The GR-Diffusion framework effectively enhances PET reconstruction by leveraging geometric priors and diffusion models.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction is a critical challenge in molecular imaging, often hampered by noise amplification, structural blurring, and detail loss due to sparse sampling and the ill-posed nature of inverse problems. The three-dimensional discrete Gaussian representation (GR), which efficiently encodes 3D scenes using parameterized discrete Gaussian distributions, has shown promise in computer vision. In this work, we pro-pose a novel GR-Diffusion framework that synergistically integrates the geometric priors of GR with the generative power of diffusion models for 3D low-dose whole-body PET reconstruction. GR-Diffusion employs GR to generate a reference 3D PET image from projection data, establishing a physically grounded and structurally explicit benchmark that overcomes the low-pass limitations of conventional point-based or voxel-based methods. This reference image serves as a dual guide during the diffusion process, ensuring both global consistency and local accuracy. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical guidance mechanism based on the GR reference. Fine-grained guidance leverages differences to refine local details, while coarse-grained guidance uses multi-scale difference maps to correct deviations. This strategy allows the diffusion model to sequentially integrate the strong geometric prior from GR and recover sub-voxel information. Experimental results on the UDPET and Clinical datasets with varying dose levels show that GR-Diffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing 3D whole-body PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

TL;DR: SToRM introduces a Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs in autonomous driving, maintaining performance while cutting costs by 30x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient E2E driving systems need human-like interaction via MLLMs but face computational limits due to excessive visual tokens.

Method: SToRM uses a lightweight predictor, supervised training, and token merging to reduce redundancy without performance loss.

Result: SToRM outperforms existing MLLMs on LangAuto, matching all-token performance with 30x lower cost.

Conclusion: SToRM balances efficiency and performance in E2E driving MLLMs, enabling practical deployment.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, end-to-end (E2E) driving systems that predict control commands directly from sensor data have achieved significant advancements. For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens.
  To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss. Experiments on the LangAuto benchmark show that SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under the same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative methods for VR content lack nuanced emotional semantics and fine-grained control, limiting immersive experiences.

Method: EmoSpace learns dynamic emotion prototypes via vision-language alignment, using hierarchical representation, multi-prototype guidance, temporal blending, and attention reweighting.

Result: Superior performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, with applications in emotional outpainting, stylized generation, and VR panoramas.

Conclusion: EmoSpace enhances immersive content creation with precise emotional control, benefiting therapy, education, storytelling, and more.

Abstract: Emotion is important for creating compelling virtual reality (VR) content. Although some generative methods have been applied to lower the barrier to creating emotionally rich content, they fail to capture the nuanced emotional semantics and the fine-grained control essential for immersive experiences. To address these limitations, we introduce EmoSpace, a novel framework for emotion-aware content generation that learns dynamic, interpretable emotion prototypes through vision-language alignment. We employ a hierarchical emotion representation with rich learnable prototypes that evolve during training, enabling fine-grained emotional control without requiring explicit emotion labels. We develop a controllable generation pipeline featuring multi-prototype guidance, temporal blending, and attention reweighting that supports diverse applications, including emotional image outpainting, stylized generation, and emotional panorama generation for VR environments. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of EmoSpace over existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Additionally, we present a comprehensive user study investigating how VR environments affect emotional perception compared to desktop settings. Our work facilitates immersive visual content generation with fine-grained emotion control and supports applications like therapy, education, storytelling, artistic creation, and cultural preservation. Code and models will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Reliable 3D instance segmentation is fundamental to language-grounded robotic manipulation. Its critical application lies in cluttered environments, where occlusions, limited viewpoints, and noisy masks degrade perception. To address these challenges, we present Clutt3R-Seg, a zero-shot pipeline for robust 3D instance segmentation for language-grounded grasping in cluttered scenes. Our key idea is to introduce a hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues. Unlike prior approaches that attempt to refine noisy masks, our method leverages them as informative cues: through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution, the tree suppresses over- and under-segmentation, yielding view-consistent masks and robust 3D instances. Each instance is enriched with open-vocabulary semantic embeddings, enabling accurate target selection from natural language instructions. To handle scene changes during multi-stage tasks, we further introduce a consistency-aware update that preserves instance correspondences from only a single post-interaction image, allowing efficient adaptation without rescanning. Clutt3R-Seg is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and validated on a real robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios. Even on the most challenging heavy-clutter sequences, Clutt3R-Seg achieves an AP@25 of 61.66, over 2.2x higher than baselines, and with only four input views it surpasses MaskClustering with eight views by more than 2x.

*Haoyu Huang,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces neck-mounted gaze estimation, a novel task using neck-mounted cameras, and presents a dataset and transformer-based model (GLC) with extensions for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing egocentric gaze estimation focuses on head-mounted cameras, leaving neck-mounted viewpoints underexplored. This work aims to address this gap.

Method: A transformer-based model (GLC) is evaluated on a new dataset (~4 hours from 8 participants). Two extensions are proposed: gaze out-of-bound classification and multi-view co-learning with geometry-aware loss.

Result: Gaze out-of-bound classification improves performance, but multi-view co-learning does not.

Conclusion: The study highlights potential for neck-mounted gaze estimation and suggests future directions for improving models.

Abstract: This paper introduces neck-mounted view gaze estimation, a new task that estimates user gaze from the neck-mounted camera perspective. Prior work on egocentric gaze estimation, which predicts device wearer's gaze location within the camera's field of view, mainly focuses on head-mounted cameras while alternative viewpoints remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we collect the first dataset for this task, consisting of approximately 4 hours of video collected from 8 participants during everyday activities. We evaluate a transformer-based gaze estimation model, GLC, on the new dataset and propose two extensions: an auxiliary gaze out-of-bound classification task and a multi-view co-learning approach that jointly trains head-view and neck-view models using a geometry-aware auxiliary loss. Experimental results show that incorporating gaze out-of-bound classification improves performance over standard fine-tuning, while the co-learning approach does not yield gains. We further analyze these results and discuss implications for neck-mounted gaze estimation.

Result: TD-FusionUNet achieves an F1 score of 0.591 with 370k parameters, outperforming the UNet baseline while using fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The model balances accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time wildfire prediction in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: We developed a lightweight and computationally efficient tool for next-day wildfire spread prediction using multimodal satellite data as input. The deep learning model, which we call Transform Domain Fusion UNet (TD-FusionUNet), incorporates trainable Hadamard Transform and Discrete Cosine Transform layers that apply two-dimensional transforms, enabling the network to capture essential "frequency" components in orthogonalized latent spaces. Additionally, we introduce custom preprocessing techniques, including random margin cropping and a Gaussian mixture model, to enrich the representation of the sparse pre-fire masks and enhance the model's generalization capability. The TD-FusionUNet is evaluated on two datasets which are the Next-Day Wildfire Spread dataset released by Google Research in 2023, and WildfireSpreadTS dataset. Our proposed TD-FusionUNet achieves an F1 score of 0.591 with 370k parameters, outperforming the UNet baseline using ResNet18 as the encoder reported in the WildfireSpreadTS dataset while using substantially fewer parameters. These results show that the proposed latent space fusion model balances accuracy and efficiency under a lightweight setting, making it suitable for real time wildfire prediction applications in resource limited environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RI-Mamba is a rotation-invariant state-space model for point clouds designed for text-to-shape retrieval, addressing limitations of existing methods by leveraging global/local reference frames, Hilbert sorting, and orientational embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing text-to-shape retrieval methods, which require canonical poses and support few object categories, RI-Mamba aims to handle diverse classes and random orientations.

Method: RI-Mamba uses global/local reference frames to separate pose from geometry, Hilbert sorting for token sequences, and orientational embeddings integrated via feature-wise linear modulation. Cross-modal contrastive learning with automated triplet scaling enhances retrieval.

Result: RI-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on OmniObject3D benchmark across 200+ object categories under arbitrary orientations.

Conclusion: RI-Mamba's rotation-invariant design and efficient linear-time operation make it highly effective for real-world text-to-shape retrieval tasks.

Abstract: 3D assets have rapidly expanded in quantity and diversity due to the growing popularity of virtual reality and gaming. As a result, text-to-shape retrieval has become essential in facilitating intuitive search within large repositories. However, existing methods require canonical poses and support few object categories, limiting their real-world applicability where objects can belong to diverse classes and appear in random orientations. To address this challenge, we propose RI-Mamba, the first rotation-invariant state-space model for point clouds. RI-Mamba defines global and local reference frames to disentangle pose from geometry and uses Hilbert sorting to construct token sequences with meaningful geometric structure while maintaining rotation invariance. We further introduce a novel strategy to compute orientational embeddings and reintegrate them via feature-wise linear modulation, effectively recovering spatial context and enhancing model expressiveness. Our strategy is inherently compatible with state-space models and operates in linear time. To scale up retrieval, we adopt cross-modal contrastive learning with automated triplet generation, allowing training on diverse datasets without manual annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate RI-Mamba's superior representational capacity and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the OmniObject3D benchmark across more than 200 object categories under arbitrary orientations. Our code will be made available at https://github.com/ndkhanh360/RI-Mamba.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semantically conditioned latent diffusion model (LDM) to generate synthetic arterial-phase cerebral DSA frames, addressing limitations of real DSA data collection and sharing. The model achieves high clinical realism and distributional similarity to real DSA images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The invasive nature and high cost of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) limit large-scale data collection and sharing, necessitating synthetic alternatives for research and training.

Method: A conditional LDM was trained on a large single-center DSA dataset (99,349 frames) using text embeddings for anatomical and geometric control. Synthetic images were evaluated by medical experts.

Result: Synthetic DSA images scored 3.1–3.3 on a 5-grade Likert scale, with high inter-rater reliability (ICC 0.80–0.87) and low FID (15.27), indicating clinical realism and similarity to real DSA.

Conclusion: Semantically controlled LDMs can produce realistic synthetic DSA frames suitable for algorithm development, research, and training.

Abstract: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) plays a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular disease, yet its invasive nature and high acquisition cost severely limit large-scale data collection and public data sharing. Therefore, we developed a semantically conditioned latent diffusion model (LDM) that synthesizes arterial-phase cerebral DSA frames under explicit control of anatomical circulation (anterior vs.\ posterior) and canonical C-arm positions. We curated a large single-centre DSA dataset of 99,349 frames and trained a conditional LDM using text embeddings that encoded anatomy and acquisition geometry. To assess clinical realism, four medical experts, including two neuroradiologists, one neurosurgeon, and one internal medicine expert, systematically rated 400 synthetic DSA images using a 5-grade Likert scale for evaluating proximal large, medium, and small peripheral vessels. The generated images achieved image-wise overall Likert scores ranging from 3.1 to 3.3, with high inter-rater reliability (ICC(2,k) = 0.80--0.87). Distributional similarity to real DSA frames was supported by a low median Fréchet inception distance (FID) of 15.27. Our results indicate that semantically controlled LDMs can produce realistic synthetic DSAs suitable for downstream algorithm development, research, and training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TG-Field is a geometry-aware Gaussian deformation framework for static and dynamic CT reconstruction, overcoming artifacts in sparse-view projections and motion through multi-resolution encoding and spatiotemporal attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS adaptations for CT struggle with severe artifacts under sparse-view projections and dynamic motions, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: TG-Field uses a multi-resolution hash encoder for spatial priors, time-conditioned representations, spatiotemporal attention, and a motion-flow network for dynamic reconstruction.

Result: TG-Field outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy under highly sparse-view conditions.

Conclusion: TG-Field effectively addresses challenges in CT reconstruction, offering superior performance for both static and dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D scene representation with superior efficiency and quality. While recent adaptations for computed tomography (CT) show promise, they struggle with severe artifacts under highly sparse-view projections and dynamic motions. To address these challenges, we propose Tomographic Geometry Field (TG-Field), a geometry-aware Gaussian deformation framework tailored for both static and dynamic CT reconstruction. A multi-resolution hash encoder is employed to capture local spatial priors, regularizing primitive parameters under ultra-sparse settings. We further extend the framework to dynamic reconstruction by introducing time-conditioned representations and a spatiotemporal attention block to adaptively aggregate features, thereby resolving spatiotemporal ambiguities and enforcing temporal coherence. In addition, a motion-flow network models fine-grained respiratory motion to track local anatomical deformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TG-Field consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy under highly sparse-view conditions.

*Arafa Yoncalik,Wouter Jansen,Nico Huebel,Mohammad Hasan Rahmani,Jan Steckel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores a modular multi-LLM pipeline for generating agricultural 3D environments from natural language, addressing limitations in domain-specific reasoning, verification, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the lack of domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design in current LLM-based 3D scene generation.

Method: Developed a pipeline integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and Unreal Engine API code generation, using hybrid LLM optimization techniques.

Result: The system produced realistic agricultural environments, improved accuracy and scalability, and saved time compared to manual design.

Conclusion: Multi-LLM pipelines enhance automated domain-specific 3D scene generation; future work will expand to other simulation domains.

Abstract: Procedural generation techniques in 3D rendering engines have revolutionized the creation of complex environments, reducing reliance on manual design. Recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D scene generation show promise but often lack domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. These limitations lead to reduced control and poor scalability. This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics. A user study assessed realism and familiarity against real-world images, while an expert comparison demonstrated significant time savings over manual scene design. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-LLM pipelines in automating domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision. Future work will explore expanding the asset hierarchy, incorporating real-time generation, and adapting the pipeline to other simulation domains beyond agriculture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSO-SLAM is a real-time monocular dense SLAM system that integrates Visual Odometry (VO) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) bidirectionally within an EM framework, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational costs and redundancies in existing SLAM methods by coupling VO and GS efficiently.

Method: Uses an EM framework for joint optimization of VO-derived depth and GS representation, along with Gaussian Splat Initialization for accurate scene approximation.

Result: Operates in real time with state-of-the-art geometric/photometric fidelity and tracking accuracy.

Conclusion: GSO-SLAM effectively combines VO and GS bidirectionally, offering a robust and efficient solution for dense SLAM.

Abstract: We propose GSO-SLAM, a real-time monocular dense SLAM system that leverages Gaussian scene representation. Unlike existing methods that couple tracking and mapping with a unified scene, incurring computational costs, or loosely integrate them with well-structured tracking frameworks, introducing redundancies, our method bidirectionally couples Visual Odometry (VO) and Gaussian Splatting (GS). Specifically, our approach formulates joint optimization within an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, enabling the simultaneous refinement of VO-derived semi-dense depth estimates and the GS representation without additional computational overhead. Moreover, we present Gaussian Splat Initialization, which utilizes image information, keyframe poses, and pixel associations from VO to produce close approximations to the final Gaussian scene, thereby eliminating the need for heuristic methods. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our method, showing that it not only operates in real time but also achieves state-of-the-art geometric/photometric fidelity of the reconstructed scene and tracking accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a visual prompting paradigm and STVG-R1, a reinforcement learning framework, to address misalignment issues in VLMs for STVG tasks, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misalignment between textual descriptions and visual coordinates in VLMs causes hallucinations, especially in dense prediction tasks like STVG. Existing solutions add complexity and cost.

Method: They reformulate coordinate prediction as an instance-level ID problem, using visual prompts, and introduce STVG-R1, a reinforcement learning framework optimizing temporal and spatial accuracy.

Result: STVG-R1 outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.9% on m_IoU in HCSTVG-v2 and achieves 47.3% J&F on MeViS in zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach avoids alignment challenges, simplifies the process, and achieves superior performance in STVG and related tasks.

Abstract: In vision-language models (VLMs), misalignment between textual descriptions and visual coordinates often induces hallucinations. This issue becomes particularly severe in dense prediction tasks such as spatial-temporal video grounding (STVG). Prior approaches typically focus on enhancing visual-textual alignment or attaching auxiliary decoders. However, these strategies inevitably introduce additional trainable modules, leading to significant annotation costs and computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel visual prompting paradigm that avoids the difficult problem of aligning coordinates across modalities. Specifically, we reformulate per-frame coordinate prediction as a compact instance-level identification problem by assigning each object a unique, temporally consistent ID. These IDs are embedded into the video as visual prompts, providing explicit and interpretable inputs to the VLMs. Furthermore, we introduce STVG-R1, the first reinforcement learning framework for STVG, which employs a task-driven reward to jointly optimize temporal accuracy, spatial consistency, and structural format regularization. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. STVG-R1 surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by a remarkable margin of 20.9% on m_IoU on the HCSTVG-v2 benchmark, establishing a new state of the art (SOTA). Surprisingly, STVG-R1 also exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to multi-object referring video object segmentation tasks, achieving a SOTA 47.3% J&F on MeViS.

Motivation: E-commerce requires strong multimodal comprehension, but existing VLMs lack tailored strategies for its attribute-centric, noisy data.

Method: Large-scale experimental study adapting general VLMs and proposing a novel evaluation suite.

Result: Substantial improvement in e-commerce performance without sacrificing general multimodal capabilities.

Conclusion: Adapted VLMs effectively address e-commerce challenges, with robust evaluation metrics validating their performance.

Abstract: E-commerce product understanding demands by nature, strong multimodal comprehension from text, images, and structured attributes. General-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable generalizable multimodal latent modelling, yet there is no documented, well-known strategy for adapting them to the attribute-centric, multi-image, and noisy nature of e-commerce data, without sacrificing general performance. In this work, we show through a large-scale experimental study, how targeted adaptation of general VLMs can substantially improve e-commerce performance while preserving broad multimodal capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel extensive evaluation suite covering deep product understanding, strict instruction following, and dynamic attribute extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address object hallucination in MLLMs by enhancing VCD with object-centric attention.

Method: Constructs an auxiliary view by removing salient visual evidence, disrupting unsupported tokens, and strengthening contrast signals.

Result: Shows consistent improvements on two benchmarks across two MLLMs.

Conclusion: The method is effective, prompt-agnostic, and computationally efficient.

Abstract: We study object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and improve visual contrastive decoding (VCD) by constructing an object-aligned auxiliary view. We leverage object-centric attention in self-supervised Vision Transformers. In particular, we remove the most salient visual evidence to construct an auxiliary view that disrupts unsupported tokens and produces a stronger contrast signal. Our method is prompt-agnostic, model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly plugged into the existing VCD pipeline with little computation overhead, i.e., a single cacheable forward pass. Empirically, our method demonstrates consistent gains on two popular object hallucination benchmarks across two MLLMs.

*Xiangyu Wu,Dongming Jiang,Feng Yu,Yueying Tian,Jiaqi Tang,Qing-Guo Chen,Yang Yang,Jianfeng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADTE introduces Tsallis Entropy to address bias in CLIP's test-time adaptation, outperforming SE and other methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shannon Entropy (SE) in CLIP's test-time adaptation is biased due to imbalanced pretraining data, prompting the need for a better uncertainty measure.

Method: ADTE generalizes Tsallis Entropy (TE) with class-specific parameters q^l, derived from test data bias, and integrates label adjustment for adaptation.

Result: ADTE achieves superior performance on ImageNet variants and cross-domain benchmarks, surpassing SE and other methods.

Conclusion: ADTE provides an effective, adaptive solution for debiasing CLIP's TTA, demonstrating broad applicability and robustness.

Abstract: Mainstream Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods for adapting vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, typically rely on Shannon Entropy (SE) at test time to measure prediction uncertainty and inconsistency. However, since CLIP has a built-in bias from pretraining on highly imbalanced web-crawled data, SE inevitably results in producing biased estimates of uncertainty entropy. To address this issue, we notably find and demonstrate that Tsallis Entropy (TE), a generalized form of SE, is naturally suited for characterizing biased distributions by introducing a non-extensive parameter q, with the performance of SE serving as a lower bound for TE. Building upon this, we generalize TE into Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE) for TTA, customizing a class-specific parameter q^l derived by normalizing the estimated label bias from continuously incoming test instances, for each category. This adaptive approach allows ADTE to accurately select high-confidence views and seamlessly integrate with a label adjustment strategy to enhance adaptation, without introducing distribution-specific hyperparameter tuning. Besides, our investigation reveals that both TE and ADTE can serve as direct, advanced alternatives to SE in TTA, without any other modifications. Experimental results show that ADTE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and its five variants, and achieves the highest average performance on 10 cross-domain benchmarks, regardless of the model architecture or text prompts used.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to advance spatial intelligence by addressing challenges in 4D dynamics generation, such as multi-scale context entanglement and semantic-physical execution gaps.

Method: Proposes Code2Worlds, using a dual-stream architecture for disentangled object-environment generation and a physics-aware closed-loop mechanism with a PostProcess Agent and VLM-Motion Critic.

Result: Outperforms baselines on Code4D benchmark with 41% SGS gain and 49% higher Richness, generating physics-aware dynamics missing in prior static methods.

Conclusion: Code2Worlds successfully bridges the gap between language and dynamic simulation, enabling robust 4D world generation grounded in physical laws.

Abstract: Achieving spatial intelligence requires moving beyond visual plausibility to build world simulators grounded in physical laws. While coding LLMs have advanced static 3D scene generation, extending this paradigm to 4D dynamics remains a critical frontier. This task presents two fundamental challenges: multi-scale context entanglement, where monolithic generation fails to balance local object structures with global environmental layouts; and a semantic-physical execution gap, where open-loop code generation leads to physical hallucinations lacking dynamic fidelity. We introduce Code2Worlds, a framework that formulates 4D generation as language-to-simulation code generation. First, we propose a dual-stream architecture that disentangles retrieval-augmented object generation from hierarchical environmental orchestration. Second, to ensure dynamic fidelity, we establish a physics-aware closed-loop mechanism in which a PostProcess Agent scripts dynamics, coupled with a VLM-Motion Critic that performs self-reflection to iteratively refine simulation code. Evaluations on the Code4D benchmark show Code2Worlds outperforms baselines with a 41% SGS gain and 49% higher Richness, while uniquely generating physics-aware dynamics absent in prior static methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of paired 4D relighting data and the difficulty of maintaining temporal consistency across extreme viewpoints motivate the development of Light4D.

Method: Light4D employs Disentangled Flow Guidance for lighting control and Temporal Consistent Attention with deterministic regularization to ensure temporal consistency.

Result: The method achieves competitive performance in temporal consistency and lighting fidelity, handling extreme camera rotations (-90 to 90 degrees).

Conclusion: Light4D provides a robust solution for 4D video relighting without requiring training, demonstrating high fidelity and consistency.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have established a new paradigm for image and video relighting. However, extending these capabilities to 4D relighting remains challenging, due primarily to the scarcity of paired 4D relighting training data and the difficulty of maintaining temporal consistency across extreme viewpoints. In this work, we propose Light4D, a novel training-free framework designed to synthesize consistent 4D videos under target illumination, even under extreme viewpoint changes. First, we introduce Disentangled Flow Guidance, a time-aware strategy that effectively injects lighting control into the latent space while preserving geometric integrity. Second, to reinforce temporal consistency, we develop Temporal Consistent Attention within the IC-Light architecture and further incorporate deterministic regularization to eliminate appearance flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in temporal consistency and lighting fidelity, robustly handling camera rotations from -90 to 90.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve segmentation accuracy without relying on massive datasets by leveraging depth cues alongside RGB inputs.

Method: Depth maps from a pretrained estimator are fused mid-level with RGB features via a dedicated depth encoder.

Result: The proposed method outperforms EfficientViT-SAM in accuracy despite using less than 0.1% of the training data.

Conclusion: Depth cues provide strong geometric priors for segmentation, enabling high performance with minimal training data.

Abstract: Segment Anything Models (SAM) achieve impressive universal segmentation performance but require massive datasets (e.g., 11M images) and rely solely on RGB inputs. Recent efficient variants reduce computation but still depend on large-scale training. We propose a lightweight RGB-D fusion framework that augments EfficientViT-SAM with monocular depth priors. Depth maps are generated with a pretrained estimator and fused mid-level with RGB features through a dedicated depth encoder. Trained on only 11.2k samples (less than 0.1\% of SA-1B), our method achieves higher accuracy than EfficientViT-SAM, showing that depth cues provide strong geometric priors for segmentation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Targeted Smart Filtering, a novel method to efficiently generate diverse 3D fractals for pre-training action recognition models, addressing speed and performance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic datasets like FDSL avoid manual labeling and ethical concerns, but current 3D fractal generation methods are slow and produce poor-quality data.

Method: Using 3D Iterated Function Systems (IFS), fractals are temporally transformed into videos for pre-training. Targeted Smart Filtering improves speed and diversity.

Result: The proposed method achieves ~100x faster sampling speed and better downstream performance compared to other 3D fractal filtering methods.

Conclusion: Targeted Smart Filtering effectively addresses challenges in 3D fractal generation, enhancing both speed and utility for action recognition pre-training.

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are being recognized in the deep learning realm as a valuable alternative to exhaustively labeled real data. One such synthetic data generation method is Formula Driven Supervised Learning (FDSL), which can provide an infinite number of perfectly labeled data through a formula driven approach, such as fractals or contours. FDSL does not have common drawbacks like manual labor, privacy and other ethical concerns. In this work we generate 3D fractals using 3D Iterated Function Systems (IFS) for pre-training an action recognition model. The fractals are temporally transformed to form a video that is used as a pre-training dataset for downstream task of action recognition. We find that standard methods of generating fractals are slow and produce degenerate 3D fractals. Therefore, we systematically explore alternative ways of generating fractals and finds that overly-restrictive approaches, while generating aesthetically pleasing fractals, are detrimental for downstream task performance. We propose a novel method, Targeted Smart Filtering, to address both the generation speed and fractal diversity issue. The method reports roughly 100 times faster sampling speed and achieves superior downstream performance against other 3D fractal filtering methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLAs suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization, attributed to insufficient visual representations in environment understanding and policy priors.

Method: Introduces JEPA-VLA, leveraging predictive embeddings (specifically V-JEPA 2) to enhance VLAs by capturing task-relevant temporal dynamics.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance improvements on benchmarks LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.

Conclusion: Predictive embeddings effectively compensate for shortcomings in VLAs, leading to better generalization and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built upon pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant improvements in robotic manipulation. However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in monocular dynamic reconstruction by providing a unified spatiotemporal decomposition framework to overcome inefficiencies in existing methods.

Method: Proposes Temporal Partition Tree (TPT) for coarse-to-fine temporal optimization and Spatial Ancestral Chains (SAC) for recursive spatial dynamics specialization.

Result: Achieves 8.26% LPIPS improvement on NVIDIA-LS and 9.09% mLPIPS improvement on DyCheck compared to the second-best method.

Conclusion: WorldTree effectively enhances dynamic reconstruction performance through unified spatiotemporal decomposition.

Abstract: Dynamic reconstruction has achieved remarkable progress, but there remain challenges in monocular input for more practical applications. The prevailing works attempt to construct efficient motion representations, but lack a unified spatiotemporal decomposition framework, suffering from either holistic temporal optimization or coupled hierarchical spatial composition. To this end, we propose WorldTree, a unified framework comprising Temporal Partition Tree (TPT) that enables coarse-to-fine optimization based on the inheritance-based partition tree structure for hierarchical temporal decomposition, and Spatial Ancestral Chains (SAC) that recursively query ancestral hierarchical structure to provide complementary spatial dynamics while specializing motion representations across ancestral nodes. Experimental results on different datasets indicate that our proposed method achieves 8.26% improvement of LPIPS on NVIDIA-LS and 9.09% improvement of mLPIPS on DyCheck compared to the second-best method.

*Chenru Wang,Beier Zhu,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed Proximal-Mean Inversion (PMI) and mimic-CFG improve stability and quality in RF-based generative models by correcting gradients and balancing editing effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RF-based inversion methods suffer from approximation errors, leading to unstable velocity fields and degraded performance in downstream tasks.

Method: Introduces PMI for stable velocity fields via gradient correction and mimic-CFG for balanced editing tasks.

Result: Significant improvements in inversion stability, reconstruction quality, and editing fidelity on PIE-Bench.

Conclusion: PMI and mimic-CFG achieve state-of-the-art performance with enhanced efficiency and theoretical soundness.

Abstract: Rectified-Flow (RF)-based generative models have recently emerged as strong alternatives to traditional diffusion models, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. By learning a continuous velocity field that transforms simple noise into complex data, RF-based models not only enable high-quality generation, but also support training-free inversion, which facilitates downstream tasks such as reconstruction and editing. However, existing inversion methods, such as vanilla RF-based inversion, suffer from approximation errors that accumulate across timesteps, leading to unstable velocity fields and degraded reconstruction and editing quality. To address this challenge, we propose Proximal-Mean Inversion (PMI), a training-free gradient correction method that stabilizes the velocity field by guiding it toward a running average of past velocities, constrained within a theoretically derived spherical Gaussian. Furthermore, we introduce mimic-CFG, a lightweight velocity correction scheme for editing tasks, which interpolates between the current velocity and its projection onto the historical average, balancing editing effectiveness and structural consistency. Extensive experiments on PIE-Bench demonstrate that our methods significantly improve inversion stability, image reconstruction quality, and editing fidelity, while reducing the required number of neural function evaluations. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PIE-Bench with enhanced efficiency and theoretical soundness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Region-to-Image Distillation to improve fine-grained perception in MLLMs by internalizing zooming into a single forward pass, avoiding high latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with fine-grained perception due to small decisive evidence being overwhelmed by global context. Existing methods involve high latency.

Method: Proposes Region-to-Image Distillation: zooming is transformed into a training-time primitive using micro-cropped regions and teacher-generated VQA data.

Result: The student model improves fine-grained perception without tool use, achieving leading performance on benchmarks and enhancing general multimodal cognition.

Conclusion: The method successfully distills the benefits of iterative zooming into a single forward pass, reducing latency while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but still struggle with fine-grained perception, where decisive evidence is small and easily overwhelmed by global context. Recent "Thinking-with-Images" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves "single-glance" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional "zooming gap". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when "Thinking-with-Images" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass.

TL;DR: DiffPlace is a novel framework using a place-ID controller to enhance place-controllable multi-view image generation, improving background consistency and foreground flexibility for urban scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view diffusion models struggle with place-aware and background-consistent urban scene generation, limiting their utility for place recognition tasks.

Method: DiffPlace introduces a place-ID controller with linear projection, perceiver transformer, and contrastive learning to embed place-ID into CLIP space, enabling consistent background synthesis and flexible foreground adjustments.

Result: DiffPlace outperforms existing methods in generation quality and supports visual place recognition training effectively.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of generative models for scene-level and place-aware synthesis, benefiting autonomous driving place recognition.

Abstract: Generative models have advanced significantly in realistic image synthesis, with diffusion models excelling in quality and stability. Recent multi-view diffusion models improve 3D-aware street view generation, but they struggle to produce place-aware and background-consistent urban scenes from text, BEV maps, and object bounding boxes. This limits their effectiveness in generating realistic samples for place recognition tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DiffPlace, a novel framework that introduces a place-ID controller to enable place-controllable multi-view image generation. The place-ID controller employs linear projection, perceiver transformer, and contrastive learning to map place-ID embeddings into a fixed CLIP space, allowing the model to synthesize images with consistent background buildings while flexibly modifying foreground objects and weather conditions. Extensive experiments, including quantitative comparisons and augmented training evaluations, demonstrate that DiffPlace outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and training support for visual place recognition. Our results highlight the potential of generative models in enhancing scene-level and place-aware synthesis, providing a valuable approach for improving place recognition in autonomous driving

*Hongxu Yang,Levente Lippenszky,Edina Timko,Gopal Avinash*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning-based method to reduce ring artifacts in CT images by reformulating the problem as an inverse solution, leveraging synthetic data for training to avoid costly clinical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ring and streak artifacts in CT images caused by defective detectors necessitate costly training datasets for existing methods, which also overlook correlations between sinogram and image domains.

Method: An unrolled network is used to reformulate the artifact reduction as an inverse problem, incorporating CT geometry and synthetic data from natural images for training.

Result: The model trained on synthetic data outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various scanning geometries and anatomical regions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively reduces ring artifacts without requiring real clinical data, leveraging synthetic data and intrinsic domain correlations.

Abstract: Defective and inconsistent responses in CT detectors can cause ring and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, making them unusable for clinical purposes. In recent years, several ring artifact reduction solutions have been proposed in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, leading to a high data collection cost. Furthermore, existing approaches focus exclusively on either image-space or sinogram-space correction, neglecting the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. Based on the theoretical analysis of non-ideal CT detector responses, the RAR problem is reformulated as an inverse problem by using an unrolled network, which considers non-ideal response together with linear forward-projection with CT geometry. Additionally, the intrinsic correlations of ring artifacts between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data derived from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring real-world clinical data. Extensive evaluations on diverse scanning geometries and anatomical regions demonstrate that the model trained on synthetic data consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: A novel framework uses implicit neural representations (INRs) and denoising diffusion models to synthesize LGE images and segmentation masks, improving fibrosis segmentation performance without annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotated datasets for LGE imaging hinder automated segmentation methods, motivating the need for annotation-free solutions to augment training data.

Method: Combines INRs to capture continuous spatial representations of LGE data and masks, compresses them into latent embeddings, and uses a diffusion model to generate synthetic data.

Result: Augmenting training with 200 synthetic volumes improved fibrosis segmentation, with Dice scores rising from 0.509 to 0.524.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable, annotation-free solution to address data scarcity in LGE imaging, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging is the clinical standard for myocardial scar assessment, but limited annotated datasets hinder the development of automated segmentation methods. We propose a novel framework that synthesises both LGE images and their corresponding segmentation masks using implicit neural representations (INRs) combined with denoising diffusion models. Our approach first trains INRs to capture continuous spatial representations of LGE data and associated myocardium and fibrosis masks. These INRs are then compressed into compact latent embeddings, preserving essential anatomical information. A diffusion model operates on this latent space to generate new representations, which are decoded into synthetic LGE images with anatomically consistent segmentation masks. Experiments on 133 cardiac MRI scans suggest that augmenting training data with 200 synthetic volumes contributes to improved fibrosis segmentation performance, with the Dice score showing an increase from 0.509 to 0.524. Our approach provides an annotation-free method to help mitigate data scarcity.The code for this research is publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluation of PDF-to-Markdown conversion using VLMs on challenging French documents, introducing a focused benchmark and highlighting proprietary model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document parsing is crucial for RAG pipelines, but existing benchmarks often focus on English or Chinese and penalize irrelevant formatting choices.

Method: Introduced a French benchmark from 60,000 documents, using model-disagreement sampling and unit-test-style checks targeting specific failure modes.

Result: Proprietary models showed higher robustness on handwriting and forms, while open-weights systems performed well on standard layouts.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a tailored evaluation for French documents, revealing performance gaps between proprietary and open models.

Abstract: This report evaluates PDF-to-Markdown conversion using recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on challenging French documents. Document parsing is a critical step for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, where transcription and layout errors propagate to downstream retrieval and grounding. Existing benchmarks often emphasize English or Chinese and can over-penalize benign formatting and linearization choices (e.g., line breaks, list segmentation, alternative table renderings) that are largely irrelevant for downstream use.
  We introduce a French-focused benchmark of difficult pages selected via model-disagreement sampling from a corpus of 60{,}000 documents, covering handwritten forms, complex layouts, dense tables, and graphics-rich pages. Evaluation is performed with unit-test-style checks that target concrete failure modes (text presence, reading order, and local table constraints) combined with category-specific normalization designed to discount presentation-only variance. Across 15 models, we observe substantially higher robustness for the strongest proprietary models on handwriting and forms, while several open-weights systems remain competitive on standard printed layouts.

*Hua Xu,Julián D. Arias-Londoño,Juan I. Godino-Llorente*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bayesian deep learning framework to improve AI reliability in medical imaging by aligning prediction uncertainty with correctness, using CUB-Loss and DTS strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging often show miscalibration, leading to overconfidence in incorrect predictions, which hinders clinical acceptance.

Method: Introduces Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) for training-time optimization and Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) for post-hoc calibration.

Result: The framework improves calibration across three medical imaging tasks (pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy, skin lesions), performs well in data-scarce and imbalanced scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach enhances reliability and explainability of AI predictions, making it viable for real-world clinical use.

Abstract: In critical decision support systems based on medical imaging, the reliability of AI-assisted decision-making is as relevant as predictive accuracy. Although deep learning models have demonstrated significant accuracy, they frequently suffer from miscalibration, manifested as overconfidence in erroneous predictions. To facilitate clinical acceptance, it is imperative that models quantify uncertainty in a manner that correlates with prediction correctness, allowing clinicians to identify unreliable outputs for further review. In order to address this necessity, the present paper proposes a generalizable probabilistic optimization framework grounded in Bayesian deep learning. Specifically, a novel Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) is introduced that imposes penalties on high-certainty errors and low-certainty correct predictions, explicitly enforcing alignment between prediction correctness and uncertainty estimates. Complementing this training-time optimization, a Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) strategy is devised for post-hoc calibration, further refining the posterior distribution to improve intuitive explainability. The proposed framework is validated on three distinct medical imaging tasks: automatic screening of pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy detection, and identification of skin lesions. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves consistent calibration improvements across diverse modalities, maintains robust performance in data-scarce scenarios, and remains effective on severely imbalanced datasets, underscoring its potential for real clinical deployment.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Spatial Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework to improve diffusion models' spatial reasoning by integrating MLLMs' planning capabilities without high computational costs or spatial information loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models lack complex spatial understanding, and existing MLLM-based solutions are either costly or ineffective in preserving spatial details.

Method: SCoT enhances layout awareness via text-coordinate training and uses MLLMs as planners to generate layout plans, integrating them into the diffusion process.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in image generation and excels in complex reasoning tasks and image editing.

Conclusion: SCoT effectively combines MLLMs' reasoning with diffusion models' generation, offering a practical solution for spatial-aware image synthesis.

Abstract: While diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in aesthetic image synthesis, they often struggle with complex spatial understanding and reasoning. Existing approaches resort to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance this capability. However, they either incur high computational costs through joint training or suffer from spatial information loss when relying solely on textual prompts. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a Spatial Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework, a plug-and-play approach that effectively bridges the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs with the generative power of diffusion models. Specifically, we first enhance the diffusion model's layout awareness by training it on an interleaved text-coordinate instruction format. We then leverage state-of-the-art MLLMs as planners to generate comprehensive layout plans, transferring their spatial planning capabilities directly to the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on image generation benchmarks and significantly outperforms baselines on complex reasoning tasks, while also showing strong efficacy in image editing scenarios.

Motivation: Accurate documentation of newborn resuscitation is crucial but underutilized. Existing methods face challenges in recognizing fine-grained activities.

Method: Explored generative AI (GenAI) methods, including local VLMs combined with LLMs. Evaluated zero-shot VLM strategies and fine-tuned VLMs with LoRA using a simulated dataset.

Result: Fine-tuned VLMs with LoRA achieved an F1 score of 0.91, surpassing TimeSFormer's 0.70.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned VLMs with LoRA show promise for improving activity recognition in newborn resuscitation videos.

Abstract: Accurate documentation of newborn resuscitation is essential for quality improvement and adherence to clinical guidelines, yet remains underutilized in practice. Previous work using 3D-CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViT) has shown promising results in detecting key activities from newborn resuscitation videos, but also highlighted the challenges in recognizing such fine-grained activities. This work investigates the potential of generative AI (GenAI) methods to improve activity recognition from such videos. Specifically, we explore the use of local vision-language models (VLMs), combined with large language models (LLMs), and compare them to a supervised TimeSFormer baseline. Using a simulated dataset comprising 13.26 hours of newborn resuscitation videos, we evaluate several zero-shot VLM-based strategies and fine-tuned VLMs with classification heads, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our results suggest that small (local) VLMs struggle with hallucinations, but when fine-tuned with LoRA, the results reach F1 score at 0.91, surpassing the TimeSformer results of 0.70.

First, we provide a detailed analysis exploring the correspondence capabilities emergent in the spatial attention of external visual representations. Building from these insights, we propose a representation-guided novel view synthesis through dedicated representation projection modules that inject external representations into the diffusion process, a methodology named ReNoV, short for representation-guided novel view synthesis. Our experiments show that this design yields marked improvements in both reconstruction fidelity and inpainting quality, outperforming prior diffusion-based novel-view methods on standard benchmarks and enabling robust synthesis from sparse, unposed image collections.

Motivation: Conventional CCD/CMOS sensors fail in extreme illumination conditions (e.g., welding arc monitoring), leading to saturation and detail loss in photomechanics measurements.

Method: Proposes an HDR imaging system using a DMD for spatial modulation, featuring regional segmentation and adaptive exposure control via synergistic subsystems.

Result: The system achieves a 127 dB dynamic range, reduces strain error by 78%, and enhances DIC positioning accuracy under high glare.

Conclusion: The DMD-based system offers superior adaptive HDR imaging, making it viable for optical metrology and stress analysis where traditional methods are ineffective.

Abstract: Background The accuracy of photomechanics measurements critically relies on image quality,particularly under extreme illumination conditions such as welding arc monitoring and polished metallic surface analysis. High dynamic range (HDR) imaging above 120 dB is essential in these contexts. Conventional CCD/CMOS sensors, with dynamic ranges typically below 70 dB, are highly susceptible to saturation under glare, resulting in irreversible loss of detail and significant errors in digital image correlation (DIC). Methods This paper presents an HDR imaging system that leverages the spatial modulation capability of a digital micromirror device (DMD). The system architecture enables autonomous regional segmentation and adaptive exposure control for high-dynamic-range scenes through an integrated framework comprising two synergistic subsystems: a DMD-based optical modulation unit and an adaptive computational imaging pipeline. Results The system achieves a measurable dynamic range of 127 dB, effectively eliminating satu ration artifacts under high glare. Experimental results demonstrate a 78% reduction in strain error and improved DIC positioning accuracy, confirming reliable performance across extreme intensity variations. Conclusion The DMD-based system provides high fidelity adaptive HDR imaging, overcoming key limitations of conventional sensors. It exhibits strong potential for optical metrology and stress analysis in high-glare environments where traditional methods are inadequate.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of combining VLA models with world model-based reinforcement learning for complex robotic tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models that directly predict multi-step action chunks from current observations face inherent limitations due to constrained scene understanding and weak future anticipation capabilities.

Built upon \textit{GigaBrain-0.5}, which is pre-trained on over 10,000 hours of robotic manipulation data, whose intermediate version currently ranks first on the international RoboChallenge benchmark. \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*} further integrates world model-based reinforcement learning via \textit{RAMP} (Reinforcement leArning via world Model-conditioned Policy) to enable robust cross-task adaptation. Empirical results demonstrate that \textit{RAMP} achieves substantial performance gains over the RECAP baseline, yielding improvements of approximately 30\% on challenging tasks including \texttt{Laundry Folding}, \texttt{Box Packing}, and \texttt{Espresso Preparation}.

Method: PosterOmni uses a data-distillation-reward pipeline: (i) dataset construction for six task types, (ii) knowledge distillation between local and global experts, and (iii) unified reward feedback for alignment. It also introduces PosterOmni-Bench for evaluation.

Result: PosterOmni outperforms open-source baselines and some proprietary systems in reference adherence, global composition quality, and aesthetic harmony.

Conclusion: PosterOmni successfully unifies local and global poster creation tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in both fidelity and aesthetics.

Abstract: Image-to-poster generation is a high-demand task requiring not only local adjustments but also high-level design understanding. Models must generate text, layout, style, and visual elements while preserving semantic fidelity and aesthetic coherence. The process spans two regimes: local editing, where ID-driven generation, rescaling, filling, and extending must preserve concrete visual entities; and global creation, where layout- and style-driven tasks rely on understanding abstract design concepts. These intertwined demands make image-to-poster a multi-dimensional process coupling entity-preserving editing with concept-driven creation under image-prompt control. To address these challenges, we propose PosterOmni, a generalized artistic poster creation framework that unlocks the potential of a base edit model for multi-task image-to-poster generation. PosterOmni integrates the two regimes, namely local editing and global creation, within a single system through an efficient data-distillation-reward pipeline: (i) constructing multi-scenario image-to-poster datasets covering six task types across entity-based and concept-based creation; (ii) distilling knowledge between local and global experts for supervised fine-tuning; and (iii) applying unified PosterOmni Reward Feedback to jointly align visual entity-preserving and aesthetic preference across all tasks. Additionally, we establish PosterOmni-Bench, a unified benchmark for evaluating both local editing and global creation. Extensive experiments show that PosterOmni significantly enhances reference adherence, global composition quality, and aesthetic harmony, outperforming all open-source baselines and even surpassing several proprietary systems.

*Yeyao Ma,Chen Li,Xiaosong Zhang,Han Hu,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAIL proposes adversarial training for flow matching models to align outputs with high-quality targets without needing explicit rewards or pairwise comparisons, achieving competitive performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning struggle with unseen states, and preference optimization is costly. FAIL aims to address these gaps.

Method: FAIL minimizes policy-expert divergence via adversarial training, offering two algorithms: FAIL-PD (pathwise gradients) and FAIL-PG (black-box alternative).

Result: Fine-tuning with minimal data, FAIL performs well on benchmarks and generalizes to image/video generation while mitigating reward hacking.

Conclusion: FAIL provides an efficient, flexible framework for post-training flow matching models, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Post-training of flow matching models-aligning the output distribution with a high-quality target-is mathematically equivalent to imitation learning. While Supervised Fine-Tuning mimics expert demonstrations effectively, it cannot correct policy drift in unseen states. Preference optimization methods address this but require costly preference pairs or reward modeling. We propose Flow Matching Adversarial Imitation Learning (FAIL), which minimizes policy-expert divergence through adversarial training without explicit rewards or pairwise comparisons. We derive two algorithms: FAIL-PD exploits differentiable ODE solvers for low-variance pathwise gradients, while FAIL-PG provides a black-box alternative for discrete or computationally constrained settings. Fine-tuning FLUX with only 13,000 demonstrations from Nano Banana pro, FAIL achieves competitive performance on prompt following and aesthetic benchmarks. Furthermore, the framework generalizes effectively to discrete image and video generation, and functions as a robust regularizer to mitigate reward hacking in reward-based optimization. Code and data are available at https://github.com/HansPolo113/FAIL.

TL;DR: TexSpot introduces Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation combining point-based and UV-based methods, enhancing texture quality and consistency via diffusion-based refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D texture generation methods suffer from view-inconsistency, distortion, or fidelity limitations tied to geometric density.

Method: TexSpot uses Texlet, merging point-based and UV-based representations, with a diffusion transformer for texture refinement.

Result: TexSpot improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TexSpot offers a promising solution for high-quality 3D texture generation by addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: High-quality 3D texture generation remains a fundamental challenge due to the view-inconsistency inherent in current mainstream multi-view diffusion pipelines. Existing representations either rely on UV maps, which suffer from distortion during unwrapping, or point-based methods, which tightly couple texture fidelity to geometric density that limits high-resolution texture generation. To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation. Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning. Leveraging this representation, we train a diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets to refine and enhance textures produced by multi-view diffusion methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

TL;DR: DreamID-Omni is a unified framework for controllable human-centric audio-video generation, addressing challenges in multi-person scenarios with innovative disentanglement and training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat human-centric tasks as isolated objectives, lacking precise control over multiple identities and voice timbres. DreamID-Omni aims to unify these tasks and improve performance.

Method: The framework uses a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer for heterogeneous conditioning, Dual-Level Disentanglement (Synchronized RoPE and Structured Captions) for identity-timbre binding, and Multi-Task Progressive Training to harmonize objectives.

Result: DreamID-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance in video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, surpassing leading proprietary models.

Conclusion: DreamID-Omni bridges academic research and commercial applications, offering a robust solution for controllable audio-video generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models have revolutionized joint audio-video generation. However, existing approaches typically treat human-centric tasks including reference-based audio-video generation (R2AV), video editing (RV2AV) and audio-driven video animation (RA2V) as isolated objectives. Furthermore, achieving precise, disentangled control over multiple character identities and voice timbres within a single framework remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose DreamID-Omni, a unified framework for controllable human-centric audio-video generation. Specifically, we design a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer that integrates heterogeneous conditioning signals via a symmetric conditional injection scheme. To resolve the pervasive identity-timbre binding failures and speaker confusion in multi-person scenarios, we introduce a Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy: Synchronized RoPE at the signal level to ensure rigid attention-space binding, and Structured Captions at the semantic level to establish explicit attribute-subject mappings. Furthermore, we devise a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme that leverages weakly-constrained generative priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks, preventing overfitting and harmonizing disparate objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID-Omni achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models. We will release our code to bridge the gap between academic research and commercial-grade applications.

TL;DR: EO-VAE is a multi-sensor variational autoencoder designed as a foundational tokenizer for Earth observation data, outperforming existing methods in reconstruction fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth observation data poses unique challenges due to diverse sensors and spectral channels, requiring a unified tokenizer.

Method: EO-VAE uses dynamic hypernetworks to encode and reconstruct flexible channel combinations with a single model.

Result: EO-VAE achieves superior reconstruction fidelity on the TerraMesh dataset compared to TerraMind tokenizers.

Conclusion: EO-VAE establishes a robust baseline for latent generative modeling in remote sensing.

Abstract: State-of-the-art generative image and video models rely heavily on tokenizers that compress high-dimensional inputs into more efficient latent representations. While this paradigm has revolutionized RGB generation, Earth observation (EO) data presents unique challenges due to diverse sensor specifications and variable spectral channels. We propose EO-VAE, a multi-sensor variational autoencoder designed to serve as a foundational tokenizer for the EO domain. Unlike prior approaches that train separate tokenizers for each modality, EO-VAE utilizes a single model to encode and reconstruct flexible channel combinations via dynamic hypernetworks. Our experiments on the TerraMesh dataset demonstrate that EO-VAE achieves superior reconstruction fidelity compared to the TerraMind tokenizers, establishing a robust baseline for latent generative modeling in remote sensing.

TL;DR: DeepGen 1.0 is a lightweight 5B unified model with Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB) for image generation and editing, outperforming larger models like HunyuanImage and Qwen-Image-Edit despite training on fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high costs and deployment challenges of massive multimodal models (>10B parameters) by developing a compact yet competitive alternative.

Method: Introduces SCB for hierarchical feature fusion, a three-stage training strategy (alignment pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning), and MR-GRPO for stable training.

Result: Achieves superior performance on benchmarks (28% and 37% gains over larger models) with fewer samples (~50M).

Conclusion: DeepGen 1.0 offers an efficient, high-performance solution for unified multimodal research, with open-sourced resources.

Abstract: Current unified multimodal models for image generation and editing typically rely on massive parameter scales (e.g., >10B), entailing prohibitive training costs and deployment footprints. In this work, we present DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight 5B unified model that achieves comprehensive capabilities competitive with or surpassing much larger counterparts. To overcome the limitations of compact models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable 'think tokens' to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts. Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench. By open-sourcing our training code, weights, and datasets, we provide an efficient, high-performance alternative to democratize unified multimodal research.

*Krish Agarwal,Zhuoming Chen,Cheng Luo,Yongqi Chen,Haizhong Zheng,Xun Huang,Atri Rudra,Beidi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Monarch-RT introduces structured attention for real-time video generation, overcoming quadratic costs of 3D self-attention and outperforming sparse baselines and FlashAttention kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic cost of 3D self-attention in video diffusion models hinders real-time performance, especially in few-step and autoregressive settings where errors compound. Prior sparse-attention methods fail in this regime, necessitating a more expressive and efficient approach.

Method: Monarch-RT factorizes attention using Monarch matrices, leveraging block structure and an extended tiled parameterization. Custom Triton kernels further optimize performance. The approach is validated against sparse baselines and state-of-the-art models like Self-Forcing.

Result: Monarch-RT achieves up to 95% sparsity without quality loss, outperforming FlashAttention kernels (1.4-11.8X speedup). It enables 16 FPS real-time video generation on a single RTX 5090 GPU.

Conclusion: Monarch-RT is a pioneering solution for efficient, high-quality real-time video generation, demonstrating the viability of structured attention in demanding autoregressive settings.

Abstract: Real-time video generation with Diffusion Transformers is bottlenecked by the quadratic cost of 3D self-attention, especially in real-time regimes that are both few-step and autoregressive, where errors compound across time and each denoising step must carry substantially more information. In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models. We further observe that Monarch-RT attains up to 95% attention sparsity with no loss in quality when applied to the state-of-the-art model Self-Forcing, making Monarch-RT a pioneering work on highly-capable sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation. Our optimized implementation outperforms FlashAttention-2, FlashAttention-3, and FlashAttention-4 kernels on Nvidia RTX 5090, H100, and B200 GPUs respectively, providing kernel speedups in the range of 1.4-11.8X. This enables us, for the first time, to achieve true real-time video generation with Self-Forcing at 16 FPS on a single RTX 5090.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniT introduces a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling, enabling unified models to iteratively refine outputs for complex tasks, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified models lack iterative refinement for complex multimodal tasks, which often require decomposition, verification, and corrections. UniT addresses this gap.

Method: UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to enable iterative reasoning, verification, and refinement.

Result: Key findings include generalization to longer inference chains, scalable sequential reasoning, and improved out-of-distribution visual reasoning.

Conclusion: Multimodal test-time scaling is effective for advancing generation and understanding in unified models.

Abstract: Unified models can handle both multimodal understanding and generation within a single architecture, yet they typically operate in a single pass without iteratively refining their outputs. Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning. These results establish multimodal test-time scaling as an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Progressive Semantic Illusions, a novel task where sketches transform semantically through sequential strokes, using a generative framework called Stroke of Surprise to optimize strokes for dual semantic interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how single sketches can undergo dramatic semantic transformations via sequential stroke additions, expanding visual illusions beyond spatial manipulations.

Method: A sequence-aware joint optimization framework with a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism and Overlay Loss ensures coherent strokes for dual interpretations.

Result: Outperforms baselines in recognizability and illusion strength, successfully extending visual anagrams to the temporal dimension.

Conclusion: The method advances visual illusions by enabling dynamic semantic transformations through optimized strokes.

Abstract: Visual illusions traditionally rely on spatial manipulations such as multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce Progressive Semantic Illusions, a novel vector sketching task where a single sketch undergoes a dramatic semantic transformation through the sequential addition of strokes. We present Stroke of Surprise, a generative framework that optimizes vector strokes to satisfy distinct semantic interpretations at different drawing stages. The core challenge lies in the "dual-constraint": initial prefix strokes must form a coherent object (e.g., a duck) while simultaneously serving as the structural foundation for a second concept (e.g., a sheep) upon adding delta strokes. To address this, we propose a sequence-aware joint optimization framework driven by a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism. Unlike sequential approaches that freeze the initial state, our method dynamically adjusts prefix strokes to discover a "common structural subspace" valid for both targets. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Overlay Loss that enforces spatial complementarity, ensuring structural integration rather than occlusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recognizability and illusion strength, successfully expanding visual anagrams from the spatial to the temporal dimension.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HybridRAG improves chatbot responses by preprocessing unstructured PDFs into QA pairs and retrieving answers dynamically, reducing latency and improving accuracy compared to standard RAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods rely on structured sources and real-time retrieval-generation, limiting practicality for real-world chatbots handling unstructured documents.

Method: HybridRAG processes raw PDFs via OCR and layout analysis, organizes them into hierarchical chunks, and pre-generates a QA knowledge base. It retrieves answers from this base or generates them on-the-fly.

Result: Experiments show HybridRAG delivers higher answer quality and lower latency than standard RAG on OHRBench.

Conclusion: HybridRAG is a practical solution for chatbots managing unstructured documents and high user loads efficiently.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach for grounding Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbot responses on external knowledge. However, existing RAG studies typically assume well-structured textual sources (e.g. Wikipedia or curated datasets) and perform retrieval and generation at query time, which can limit their applicability in real-world chatbot scenarios. In this paper, we present HybridRAG, a novel and practical RAG framework towards more accurate and faster chatbot responses. First, HybridRAG ingests raw, unstructured PDF documents containing complex layouts (text, tables, figures) via Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and layout analysis, and convert them into hierarchical text chunks. Then, it pre-generates a plausible question-answer (QA) knowledge base from the organized chunks using an LLM. At query time, user questions are matched against this QA bank to retrieve immediate answers when possible, and only if no suitable QA match is found does our framework fall back to an on-the-fly response generation. Experiments on OHRBench demonstrate that our HybridRAG provides higher answer quality and lower latency compared to a standard RAG baseline. We believe that HybridRAG could be a practical solution for real-world chatbot applications that must handle large volumes of unstructured documents and lots of users under limited computational resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior studies focus on static retrieval head statistics, missing the temporal dynamics during autoregressive generation, which this paper aims to address.

Method: The study analyzes retrieval heads dynamically, validating claims through tasks like Needle-in-a-Haystack and multi-hop QA, and comparing utility in a Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework.

Result: Findings show retrieval heads vary dynamically, are timestep-specific, and encode predictive signals, indicating internal planning in LLMs.

Conclusion: The research offers deeper understanding of LLMs' internal mechanisms by emphasizing the importance of dynamic retrieval heads.

Abstract: Recent studies have identified "retrieval heads" in Large Language Models (LLMs) responsible for extracting information from input contexts. However, prior works largely rely on static statistics aggregated across datasets, identifying heads that perform retrieval on average. This perspective overlooks the fine-grained temporal dynamics of autoregressive generation. In this paper, we investigate retrieval heads from a dynamic perspective. Through extensive analysis, we establish three core claims: (1) Dynamism: Retrieval heads vary dynamically across timesteps; (2) Irreplaceability: Dynamic retrieval heads are specific at each timestep and cannot be effectively replaced by static retrieval heads; and (3) Correlation: The model's hidden state encodes a predictive signal for future retrieval head patterns, indicating an internal planning mechanism. We validate these findings on the Needle-in-a-Haystack task and a multi-hop QA task, and quantify the differences on the utility of dynamic and static retrieval heads in a Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework. Our study provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an important task in natural language processing that aims to identify and extract key entities from unstructured text. We present a novel application of NER in plasma physics research articles and address the challenges of extracting specialized entities from scientific text in this domain. Research articles in plasma physics often contain highly complex and context-rich content that must be extracted to enable, e.g., advanced search. We propose a lightweight approach based on encoder-transformers and conditional random fields to extract (nested) named entities from plasma physics research articles. First, we annotate a plasma physics corpus with 16 classes specifically designed for the nested NER task. Second, we evaluate an entity-specific model specialization approach, where independent BERT-CRF models are trained to recognize individual entity types in plasma physics text. Third, we integrate an optimization process to systematically fine-tune hyperparameters and enhance model performance. Our work contributes to the advancement of entity recognition in plasma physics and also provides a foundation to support researchers in navigating and analyzing scientific literature.

TL;DR: LLMs show high semantic similarity but low lexical overlap with human answers on recent Reddit questions, highlighting the need for multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs align with human perspectives on temporally recent information.

Method: Uses RECOM dataset, evaluates four LLMs using lexical, semantic, and logical metrics.

Result: Models achieve high semantic similarity (>99% cosine) but low lexical overlap (<8% BLEU-1), with Mistral-7B outperforming larger models.

Conclusion: Lexical metrics are unreliable for evaluating abstractive generation; multi-dimensional frameworks are needed.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for open-domain question answering, yet their alignment with human perspectives on temporally recent information remains underexplored. We introduce RECOM (Reddit Evaluation for Correspondence of Models), a benchmark dataset of 15,000 recent Reddit questions from September 2025 paired with community-derived reference answers. We investigate how four open-source LLMs (Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B, and GPT-OSS-20B) respond to these questions, evaluating alignment using lexical metrics (BLEU, ROUGE), semantic similarity (BERTScore, MoverScore, cosine similarity), and logical inference (NLI). Our central finding is a striking semantic-lexical paradox: all models achieve over 99% cosine similarity with references despite less than 8% BLEU-1 overlap, a 90+ percentage point gap indicating that models preserve meaning through extensive paraphrasing rather than lexical reproduction. MoverScore (51-53%) confirms this pattern, occupying an intermediate position that reflects the optimal transport cost of semantic alignment. Furthermore, model scale does not predict performance: Mistral-7B (7B parameters) outperforms GPT-OSS-20B (20B parameters) across all metrics. NLI analysis reveals that contradiction rates remain below 7%, suggesting models rarely generate content that directly conflicts with human consensus. These findings challenge the reliability of lexical metrics for evaluating abstractive generation and argue for multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks that capture semantic fidelity beyond surface-level text matching.

TL;DR: PEFT methods improve hallucination detection in LLMs by reshaping uncertainty encoding rather than adding factual knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) affects hallucination behavior in LLMs, especially for QA tasks.

Method: The research evaluates PEFT's impact using three LLMs and three QA benchmarks, testing seven unsupervised hallucination detection methods across semantic consistency, confidence, and entropy-based approaches.

Result: PEFT consistently enhances hallucination detection, improving AUROC across various detectors. It primarily changes how uncertainty is encoded rather than adding new factual knowledge.

Conclusion: PEFT strengthens hallucination detection by altering uncertainty representation, offering a new perspective on its role in improving LLM performance.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to adapt large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks and are often assumed to improve factual correctness. However, how the parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods affect hallucination behavior remains insufficiently understood, especially on QA datasets. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of PEFT on hallucination detection through a comprehensive empirical study across three open-weight LLM backbones and three fact-seeking QA benchmarks. For each model, we evaluate performance using seven unsupervised hallucination detection methods spanning three complementary approaches: semantic consistency based detectors, confidence based detectors, and entropy based detectors. This multifaceted evaluation enables us to characterize how PEFT reshapes uncertainty across different detection paradigms. In conclusion, our experimental results show that PEFT consistently strengthens hallucination detection ability, substantially improving AUROC across a wide range of hallucination detectors. Besides, further analyses using linear probes and representation diagnostics indicate that PEFT methods primarily reshapes how uncertainty is encoded and surfaced, comparing with injecting new factual knowledge into the models.

Method: Introduce FalseCite, a curated dataset for benchmarking hallucinated responses, and analyze models (GPT-4o-mini, Falcon-7B, Mistral 7-B) using hidden state visualization and clustering.

Result: FalseCite reveals heightened hallucination for deceptive citations, especially in GPT-4o-mini, and identifies a unique horn-like pattern in hidden state vectors.

Conclusion: FalseCite provides a foundational tool for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate, generating nonsensical or false information that can be especially harmful in sensitive fields such as medicine or law. To study this phenomenon systematically, we introduce FalseCite, a curated dataset designed to capture and benchmark hallucinated responses induced by misleading or fabricated citations. Running GPT-4o-mini, Falcon-7B, and Mistral 7-B through FalseCite, we observed a noticeable increase in hallucination activity for false claims with deceptive citations, especially in GPT-4o-mini. Using the responses from FalseCite, we can also analyze the internal states of hallucinating models, visualizing and clustering the hidden state vectors. From this analysis, we noticed that the hidden state vectors, regardless of hallucination or non-hallucination, tend to trace out a distinct horn-like shape. Our work underscores FalseCite's potential as a foundation for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in future LLM research.

### [79] [Enhancing SDG-Text Classification with Combinatorial Fusion Analysis and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11168)
*Jingyan Xu,Marcelo L. LaFleur,Christina Schweikert,D. Frank Hsu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA) with generative AI to enhance text classification for UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), achieving 96.73% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving text classification for SDGs is challenging due to unclear or interrelated categories, especially in social analysis.

Method: Uses generative AI for synthetic data, then applies CFA (RSC function and cognitive diversity) to combine diverse classifiers.

Result: CFA achieves 96.73% performance, surpassing individual models and aligning with human expert outcomes.

Conclusion: Combining multiple ML/AI models via CFA and human input enhances classification accuracy and complements expertise.

Abstract: (Natural Language Processing) NLP techniques such as text classification and topic discovery are very useful in many application areas including information retrieval, knowledge discovery, policy formulation, and decision-making. However, it remains a challenging problem in cases where the categories are unavailable, difficult to differentiate, or are interrelated. Social analysis with human context is an area that can benefit from text classification, as it relies substantially on text data. The focus of this paper is to enhance the classification of text according to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by collecting and combining intelligence from multiple models. Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA), a system fusion paradigm using a rank-score characteristic (RSC) function and cognitive diversity (CD), has been used to enhance classifier methods by combining a set of relatively good and mutually diverse classification models. We use a generative AI model to generate synthetic data for model training and then apply CFA to this classification task. The CFA technique achieves 96.73% performance, outperforming the best individual model. We compare the outcomes with those obtained from human domain experts. It is demonstrated that combining intelligence from multiple ML/AI models using CFA and getting input from human experts can, not only complement, but also enhance each other.

### [80] [Disentangling Direction and Magnitude in Transformer Representations: A Double Dissociation Through L2-Matched Perturbation Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11169)
*Mangadoddi Srikar Vardhan,Lekkala Sai Teja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study reveals distinct functional roles for direction (orientation) and magnitude (vector norm) in transformer hidden states, with direction affecting attentional routing and magnitude influencing syntactic processing, particularly in LayerNorm-based architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether direction and magnitude in transformer hidden states serve distinct computational roles, especially in language modeling and syntactic processing.

Method: Employed L2-matched perturbation analysis to ensure equal Euclidean displacements for angular and magnitude perturbations, followed by causal interventions to trace damage pathways.

Result: Angular perturbations disproportionately harm language modeling loss (up to 42.9x more), while magnitude perturbations severely impact syntactic processing (20.4% vs. 1.6% accuracy drop). Attention repair mitigates angular damage (28.4% recovery), and LayerNorm repair addresses magnitude damage (29.9% recovery).

Conclusion: Direction and magnitude serve partially distinct roles: direction influences attentional routing, while magnitude affects processing intensity for syntactic judgments. The dissociation is architecture-dependent, differing between LayerNorm and RMSNorm-based models.

Abstract: Transformer hidden states encode information as high-dimensional vectors, yet whether direction (orientation in representational space) and magnitude (vector norm) serve distinct functional roles remains unclear. Studying Pythia-family models, we discover a striking cross-over dissociation: angular perturbations cause up to 42.9 more damage to language modeling loss, while magnitude perturbations cause disproportionately more damage to syntactic processing (20.4% vs.1.6% accuracy drop on subject-verb agreement).This finding is enabled by L2-matched perturbation analysis, a methodology ensuring that an gular and magnitude perturbations achieve identical Euclidean displacements. Causal intervention reveals that angular damage flows substantially through the attention pathways (28.4% loss recovery via attention repair), while magnitude damage flows partly through the LayerNorm pathways(29.9% recovery via LayerNorm repair). These patterns replicate across scales within the Pythia architecture family. These findings provide evidence that direction and magnitude support partially distinct computational roles in LayerNorm based architectures. The direction preferentially affects attentional routing, while magnitude modulates processing intensity for fine-grained syntactic judgments. We find different patterns in RMSNorm-based architectures, suggesting that the dissociation depends on architectural choices. Our results refine the linear representation hypothesis and have implications for model editing and interpretability research

*Jiawei Xu,Zhenyu Yu,Ziqian Bi,Minh Duc Pham,Xiaoyi Qu,Danyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRIME (Policy-Reinforced Iterative Multi-agent Execution) improves algorithmic reasoning in LLMs using specialized agents, achieving a 250% accuracy gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with algorithmic reasoning despite their broad capabilities.

Method: PRIME employs three agents (executor, verifier, coordinator) optimized via group relative policy optimization.

Result: PRIME improves average accuracy from 26.8% to 93.8%, with significant gains in tasks requiring state tracking.

Conclusion: PRIME effectively addresses algorithmic reasoning limitations, with iterative verification as a key factor.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse reasoning tasks, yet their performance on algorithmic reasoning remains limited. To handle this limitation, we propose PRIME (Policy-Reinforced Iterative Multi-agent Execution), a framework comprising three specialized agents, an executor for step-by-step reasoning, a verifier for constraint checking, and a coordinator for backtracking control, optimized through group relative policy optimization. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce PRIME-Bench, the largest algorithmic reasoning benchmark to date, comprising 86 tasks across 12 categories with 51,600 instances. Tasks span sorting algorithms, graph and tree structures, automata and state machines, symbolic reasoning, and constraint-based puzzles, with execution traces reaching over one million steps. Compared to baseline approach, PRIME improves average accuracy from 26.8% to 93.8%, a 250% relative gain. The largest improvements occur on tasks requiring sustained state tracking, with Turing machine simulation improving from 9% to 92% and long division from 16% to 94%. Ablation studies identify iterative verification as the primary contributor, preventing the error propagation that causes baseline approaches to fail catastrophically. Analysis across model scales (8B-120B parameters) reveals that smaller models benefit disproportionately, achieving accuracy comparable to models 8x larger.

*Baek Seong-Eun,Lee Jung-Mok,Kim Sung-Bin,Tae-Hyun Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework integrates LLM domain knowledge into Bayesian Optimization for efficient LoRA hyperparameter tuning, achieving significant performance gains with fewer iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA enables efficient LLM fine-tuning but is hyperparameter-sensitive, requiring costly exhaustive searches.

Method: Repurposes LLMs as discrete-to-continuous mappings, uses domain-aware prompts, and introduces proxy training with data subsets.

Result: Hyperparameters found in 30 iterations outperform standard ones from 45,000 combinations by over 20%.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages LLM knowledge and proxy training for efficient, high-performing LoRA hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables resource-efficient personalization or specialization, but it comes at the expense of additional hyperparameter tuning. Although LoRA makes fine-tuning efficient, it is highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, and exhaustive hyperparameter search is still computationally very demanding. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that integrates the domain knowledge of pre-trained LLMs into Bayesian Optimization (BO) to efficiently search for LoRA hyperparameters. To leverage the informed knowledge of LLMs, we repurpose LLMs as a discrete-to-continuous mapping to link the hyperparameters and their domain knowledge with a continuous vector space, where BO is conducted. We design and control the mapping by language prompting, where we provide a domain-aware textual prompt describing the relationships among hyperparameters and their respective roles; thereby, we explicitly inject domain knowledge about LoRA into the LLM in natural language. Also, we model the residual information that is hard to linguistically describe in the prompt with an additional learnable token. This aids BO to sample more high-performing hyperparameters. In addition, by leveraging the observation of the strong correlation between the respective performance obtained from full and subset training datasets in LoRA training regimes, we introduce proxy training and evaluation with a data subset. This further increases the efficiency of our method. We demonstrate that our hyperparameter found with only about 30 iterations achieves more than 20% performance improvement over standard hyperparameters found from about 45,000 combinations.

Abstract: Legal advocacy requires a unique combination of authoritative tone, rhythmic pausing for emphasis, and emotional intelligence. This study investigates the performance of the Gemini 2.5 Flash TTS and Gemini 2.5 Pro TTS models in generating synthetic courtroom speeches across five Indic languages: Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Hindi, and Gujarati. We propose a prompting framework that utilizes Gemini 2.5s native support for 5 languages and its context-aware pacing to produce distinct advocate personas. The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted the focus of TexttoSpeech (TTS) technology from basic intelligibility to context-aware, expressive synthesis. In the legal domain, synthetic speech must convey authority and a specific professional persona a task that becomes significantly more complex in the linguistically diverse landscape of India. The models exhibit a "monotone authority," excelling at procedural information delivery but struggling with the dynamic vocal modulation and emotive gravitas required for persuasive advocacy. Performance dips in Bengali and Gujarati further highlight phonological frontiers for future refinement. This research underscores the readiness of multilingual TTS for procedural legal tasks while identifying the remaining challenges in replicating the persuasive artistry of human legal discourse.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces REspGen, an author-in-the-loop framework for generating peer review responses, leveraging author expertise and intent, and evaluates it with REspEval, a comprehensive metric suite.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated response generation methods overlook author expertise and intent. Authors need NLP tools that integrate their domain knowledge and revision strategies to address reviewer concerns effectively.

Method: REspGen integrates explicit author input, multi-attribute control, and evaluation-guided refinement. The REspEval suite evaluates input utilization, controllability, response quality, and discourse.

Result: Experiments with LLMs demonstrate the benefits of author input and evaluation-guided refinement, highlighting trade-offs between controllability and response quality.

Conclusion: The framework and evaluation tools advance automated response generation by incorporating author expertise, providing a practical solution for peer review.

Abstract: Author response (rebuttal) writing is a critical stage of scientific peer review that demands substantial author effort. Recent work frames this task as automatic text generation, underusing author expertise and intent. In practice, authors possess domain expertise, author-only information, revision and response strategies--concrete forms of author expertise and intent--to address reviewer concerns, and seek NLP assistance that integrates these signals to support effective response writing in peer review. We reformulate author response generation as an author-in-the-loop task and introduce REspGen, a generation framework that integrates explicit author input, multi-attribute control, and evaluation-guided refinement, together with REspEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite with 20+ metrics covering input utilization, controllability, response quality, and discourse. To support this formulation, we construct Re$^3$Align, the first large-scale dataset of aligned review--response--revision triplets, where revisions provide signals of author expertise and intent. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs show the benefits of author input and evaluation-guided refinement, the impact of input design on response quality, and trade-offs between controllability and quality. We make our dataset, generation and evaluation tools publicly available.

### [85] [The Script Tax: Measuring Tokenization-Driven Efficiency and Latency Disparities in Multilingual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11174)
*Aradhya Dixit,Shreem Dixit*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multilingual language models impose a 'script tax' due to tokenizer fragmentation, leading to slower inference and higher information costs for certain writing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the inequity caused by tokenizer fragmentation in multilingual language models for different writing systems.

Method: Compare orthographic variants with identical linguistic content using metrics like token fertility, inference speed, and bits per character (BPC).

Result: Higher-fragmentation orthography increases token fertility (~3.4x) and information cost (+19.7%-47.1%), causing slower inference (16.5x).

Conclusion: Tokenization is a key source of inequity in multilingual NLP, motivating script-aware tokenization and pretraining.

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual language models are often assumed to be script-agnostic, yet their tokenizers can impose systematic costs on certain writing systems. We quantify this script tax by comparing two orthographic variants with identical linguistic content. Across mBERT and XLM-R, the higher-fragmentation orthography shows a ~3.4x increase in fertility (6.73-6.85 vs. 2.10-2.35 tokens/word), leading to a 16.5x inference slowdown (0.23 vs. 3.8 sentences/second) on identical hardware. Using bits per character (BPC) to avoid the "NLL paradox" from subword fragmentation, we find a substantial increase in information cost: +19.7% for mBERT (8.06->9.65) and +47.1% for XLM-R (12.19->17.94). A round-trip conversion check (CER_rt=0.31) suggests these gaps reflect orthography-conditioned processing rather than mapping noise. Our results highlight tokenization as a key source of inequity in multilingual NLP and motivate script-aware tokenization and pretraining.

TL;DR: Transformers excel in sequence modeling but have theoretical limitations in discrete reasoning tasks. This survey analyzes these limitations using circuit complexity, approximation theory, and communication complexity, offering insights for future improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the structural and computational barriers transformers face in symbolic computations, despite their success in pattern matching and interpolation.

Method: The survey synthesizes recent studies from three theoretical perspectives (circuit complexity, approximation theory, communication complexity) to analyze transformer limitations.

Result: Identified challenges include depth constraints, difficulty approximating discontinuities, and inter-token communication bottlenecks.

Conclusion: The paper suggests implications for model design and promising directions to overcome transformers' foundational limitations in discrete reasoning.

Abstract: Transformers have become the foundational architecture for a broad spectrum of sequence modeling applications, underpinning state-of-the-art systems in natural language processing, vision, and beyond. However, their theoretical limitations in discrete reasoning tasks, such as arithmetic, logical inference, and algorithmic composition, remain a critical open problem. In this survey, we synthesize recent studies from three theoretical perspectives: circuit complexity, approximation theory, and communication complexity, to clarify the structural and computational barriers that transformers face when performing symbolic computations. By connecting these established theoretical frameworks, we provide an accessible and unified account of why current transformer architectures struggle to implement exact discrete algorithms, even as they excel at pattern matching and interpolation. We review key definitions, seminal results, and illustrative examples, highlighting challenges such as depth constraints, difficulty approximating discontinuities, and bottlenecks in inter-token communication. Finally, we discuss implications for model design and suggest promising directions for overcoming these foundational limitations.

*Maral Doctorarastoo,Katherine A. Flanigan,Mario Bergés,Christopher McComb*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to predict human activities and durations in low-data environments, demonstrating their potential as temporal reasoners for agent-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anticipating human activities and their durations is crucial for adaptive systems in various applications like smart-home automation and human-robot collaboration, but existing models struggle in low-data settings.

Method: The study employs a retrieval-augmented prompting strategy integrating temporal, spatial, behavioral history, and persona contexts, evaluated on the CASAS Aruba dataset. Tasks include next-activity prediction with duration estimation and multi-step daily sequence generation, tested with few-shot examples.

Result: LLMs show strong inherent temporal understanding, producing coherent predictions even in zero-shot settings. Adding few-shot examples improves performance, but gains diminish beyond a few examples. Sequence-level evaluations confirm consistent temporal alignment.

Conclusion: Pre-trained language models can effectively serve as temporal reasoners, capturing routines and behavioral variations, enhancing agent-based models in low-data environments.

Abstract: Anticipating human activities and their durations is essential in applications such as smart-home automation, simulation-based architectural and urban design, activity-based transportation system simulation, and human-robot collaboration, where adaptive systems must respond to human activities. Existing data-driven agent-based models--from rule-based to deep learning--struggle in low-data environments, limiting their practicality. This paper investigates whether large language models, pre-trained on broad human knowledge, can fill this gap by reasoning about everyday activities from compact contextual cues. We adopt a retrieval-augmented prompting strategy that integrates four sources of context--temporal, spatial, behavioral history, and persona--and evaluate it on the CASAS Aruba smart-home dataset. The evaluation spans two complementary tasks: next-activity prediction with duration estimation, and multi-step daily sequence generation, each tested with various numbers of few-shot examples provided in the prompt. Analyzing few-shot effects reveals how much contextual supervision is sufficient to balance data efficiency and predictive accuracy, particularly in low-data environments. Results show that large language models exhibit strong inherent temporal understanding of human behavior: even in zero-shot settings, they produce coherent daily activity predictions, while adding one or two demonstrations further refines duration calibration and categorical accuracy. Beyond a few examples, performance saturates, indicating diminishing returns. Sequence-level evaluation confirms consistent temporal alignment across few-shot conditions. These findings suggest that pre-trained language models can serve as promising temporal reasoners, capturing both recurring routines and context-dependent behavioral variations, thereby strengthening the behavioral modules of agent-based models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection, analyzing how task-relevant information is encoded in its representations. It introduces task-aware markers and a data-synthesis tool to generate synthetic samples, improving detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of AD is difficult due to limited labeled data. The study aims to leverage LLMs' transfer capabilities and understand their adaptation to the AD domain.

Method: The authors fine-tune an LLM for AD detection, use probing techniques to analyze internal representations, design task-aware markers, and create a data-synthesis tool to generate synthetic samples.

Result: Fine-tuning changes probing values of specific words and markers, indicating their importance in improved detection. Synthetic data is evaluated and enhances downstream training.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of LLMs for AD detection and the utility of task-aware markers and synthetic data in addressing data scarcity.

Abstract: Reliable early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is challenging, particularly due to limited availability of labeled data. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong transfer capabilities across domains, adapting them to the AD domain through supervised fine-tuning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we fine-tune an LLM for AD detection and investigate how task-relevant information is encoded within its internal representations. We employ probing techniques to analyze intermediate activations across transformer layers, and we observe that, after fine-tuning, the probing values of specific words and special markers change substantially, indicating that these elements assume a crucial role in the model's improved detection performance. Guided by this insight, we design a curated set of task-aware special markers and train a sequence-to-sequence model as a data-synthesis tool that leverages these markers to generate structurally consistent and diagnostically informative synthetic samples. We evaluate the synthesized data both intrinsically and by incorporating it into downstream training pipelines.

Conclusion: Proposes future work on automated interpretability, cross-model circuit generalization, and scalable interpretability-driven alignment techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their internal decision-making processes remain largely opaque. Mechanistic interpretability (i.e., the systematic study of how neural networks implement algorithms through their learned representations and computational structures) has emerged as a critical research direction for understanding and aligning these models. This paper surveys recent progress in mechanistic interpretability techniques applied to LLM alignment, examining methods ranging from circuit discovery to feature visualization, activation steering, and causal intervention. We analyze how interpretability insights have informed alignment strategies including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), constitutional AI, and scalable oversight. Key challenges are identified, including the superposition hypothesis, polysemanticity of neurons, and the difficulty of interpreting emergent behaviors in large-scale models.

Abstract: Code-mixing and code-switching (CSW) remain challenging phenomena for large language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in multilingual modeling, LLMs often struggle in mixed-language settings, exhibiting systematic degradation in grammaticality, factuality, and safety behavior. This work provides a comprehensive overview of CSW research in modern large language model settings. We introduce a unifying taxonomy that organizes prior work along dimensions of data, modeling, and evaluation, and we distill these findings into a practical playbook of actionable recommendations for building, adapting, and evaluating CSW-capable LLMs. We review modeling approaches ranging from CSW-tailored pre-training and task-specific post-training to prompting strategies and in-context learning. We analyze current evaluation practices, highlighting sources of instability and limited reproducibility, and we catalog existing benchmarks while critically examining their linguistic coverage and English-centric biases. Finally, we discuss emerging safety concerns, including use of code-mixing as a mechanism for bypassing model safeguards, and identify open research challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory systems disrupt logical/temporal relationships in LLM interactions, leading to fragmented memory and poor reasoning.

Method: MetaMem iteratively optimizes meta-memory by distilling knowledge utilization experiences through self-reflection and action updates.

Result: MetaMem outperforms baselines by over 3.6%, demonstrating effective reasoning via guided memory integration.

Conclusion: MetaMem successfully addresses memory fragmentation by leveraging meta-memory to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Existing memory systems enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to support long-horizon human-LLM interactions by persisting historical interactions beyond limited context windows. However, while recent approaches have succeeded in constructing effective memories, they often disrupt the inherent logical and temporal relationships within interaction sessions, resulting in fragmented memory units and degraded reasoning performance. In this paper, we propose MetaMem, a novel framework that augments memory systems with a self-evolving meta-memory, aiming to teach LLMs how to effectively utilize memorized knowledge. During meta-memory optimization, MetaMem iteratively distills transferable knowledge utilization experiences across different tasks by self-reflecting on reasoning processes and performing actions to update the current meta-memory state. The accumulated meta-memory units serve as explicit knowledge utilization experiences, guiding the LLM to systematically identify and integrate critical evidence from scattered memory fragments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaMem, which significantly outperforms strong baselines by over 3.6%.

TL;DR: DDL2PropBank is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate multi-agent frameworks' developer experience, focusing on code complexity and AI-assistability. Agno performs best overall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled way to evaluate developer experience in multi-agent frameworks for LLM-driven software development.

Method: Implement identical agent logic across 10 frameworks using the Agent-as-a-Tool pattern, evaluating code complexity via static analysis and AI-assistability through LLM-generated code correctness.

Result: Pydantic AI and Agno require minimal implementation overhead. Agno excels in AI-assistability with 83% pass@1.

Conclusion: Agno is the top performer, balancing low complexity and high AI-assistability.

Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks promise to simplify LLM-driven software development, yet there is no principled way to evaluate their developer experience in a controlled setting. We introduce DDL2PropBank, a novel benchmark task that maps relational database schemas to PropBank rolesets, requiring autonomous retrieval of candidate frames and fine-grained linguistic reasoning over table names, columns, and relations. Using the Agent-as-a-Tool pattern, we implement identical agent logic across 10 frameworks and evaluate along two dimensions: (i) code complexity via static analysis, and (ii) AI-assistability -- the extent to which LLMs can autonomously generate correct, framework-specific code. Our results reveal a threefold complexity spectrum, with Pydantic AI and Agno requiring the least implementation overhead. For AI-assistability, structural alignment scores reliably proxy runtime success for frameworks with single canonical patterns, but overestimate correctness for multi-pattern frameworks. Agno emerges as the strongest overall performer, combining lowest complexity with highest structural alignment and 83% pass@1.

Motivation: LLMs often respond inadequately to unclear or incorrect prompts, leading to errors. The study aims to improve their ability to request clarification while maintaining task performance.

Method: AskBench converts QA pairs into multi-turn interactions with checkpoints, covering two scenarios: intent-deficient queries (AskMind) and false-premise queries (AskOverconfidence). RLVR uses structured rubrics and verifier-based rewards to guide clarification.

Result: Experiments show improved accuracy, adherence to rubrics, and interaction efficiency, with strong generalization to new domains.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances LLMs' ability to handle ambiguous or misleading prompts by prompting appropriate clarifications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often respond even when prompts omit critical details or include misleading information, leading to hallucinations or reinforced misconceptions. We study how to evaluate and improve LLMs' ability to decide when and what to ask for clarification without sacrificing task performance. We introduce AskBench, an interactive benchmark that converts standard QA pairs into multi-turn interactions with explicit checkpoints. A unified judge loop evaluates final answers and simulates user responses as needed. AskBench covers two settings: AskMind, with intent-deficient queries requiring clarification, and AskOverconfidence, with queries containing false premises that must be identified and corrected. We further propose rubric-guided reinforcement learning with verifier-based rewards (RLVR), which uses structured rubrics to encourage targeted clarification. Experiments show consistent improvements in accuracy, rubric adherence, and interaction efficiency, with strong generalization to unseen domains.

### [95] [Mechanistic Evidence for Faithfulness Decay in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11201)
*Donald Ye,Max Loffgren,Om Kotadia,Linus Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLDD is a metric to assess the faithfulness of CoT explanations by corrupting reasoning steps and measuring confidence drop. It reveals a Reasoning Horizon (k*) and shows that accuracy alone doesn't indicate true reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if CoT explanations genuinely reflect a model's decision-making or are just post-hoc justifications.

Method: Corrupt individual reasoning steps, measure confidence drop, and standardize comparisons using NLDD. Tested on syntactic, logical, and arithmetic tasks.

Result: Found a Reasoning Horizon (k*) at 70--85% of chain length, beyond which reasoning tokens have minimal impact. Models can encode correct representations but fail tasks.

Conclusion: NLDD provides a way to measure the importance of CoT explanations, showing accuracy doesn't guarantee genuine reasoning.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations are widely used to interpret how language models solve complex problems, yet it remains unclear whether these step-by-step explanations reflect how the model actually reaches its answer, or merely post-hoc justifications. We propose Normalized Logit Difference Decay (NLDD), a metric that measures whether individual reasoning steps are faithful to the model's decision-making process. Our approach corrupts individual reasoning steps from the explanation and measures how much the model's confidence in its answer drops, to determine if a step is truly important. By standardizing these measurements, NLDD enables rigorous cross-model comparison across different architectures. Testing three model families across syntactic, logical, and arithmetic tasks, we discover a consistent Reasoning Horizon (k*) at 70--85% of chain length, beyond which reasoning tokens have little or negative effect on the final answer. We also find that models can encode correct internal representations while completely failing the task. These results show that accuracy alone does not reveal whether a model actually reasons through its chain. NLDD offers a way to measure when CoT matters.

TL;DR: SurveyLens is introduced as the first discipline-aware benchmark to evaluate ASG methods across various academic fields, addressing biases in current evaluation methods and providing guidance for diverse disciplinary standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASG evaluation methods are generic and biased toward Computer Science, lacking adherence to diverse academic discipline standards, which hinders researchers, especially non-CS ones, from producing high-quality surveys.

Method: SurveyLens-1k, a dataset of 1,000 human-written surveys from 10 disciplines, is curated. A dual-lens framework evaluates ASG methods: Discipline-Aware Rubric Evaluation using LLMs with human-aligned weights, and Canonical Alignment Evaluation assessing content coverage and synthesis quality.

Result: 11 ASG methods (Vanilla LLMs, ASG systems, Deep Research agents) are evaluated, revealing distinct strengths and weaknesses per field, offering tailored tool selection guidance.

Conclusion: SurveyLens bridges the gap in ASG evaluation, providing discipline-specific standards and actionable insights for researchers across diverse academic fields.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature has driven the evolution of Automatic Survey Generation (ASG) from simple pipelines to multi-agent frameworks and commercial Deep Research agents. However, current ASG evaluation methods rely on generic metrics and are heavily biased toward Computer Science (CS), failing to assess whether ASG methods adhere to the distinct standards of various academic disciplines. Consequently, researchers, especially those outside CS, lack clear guidance on using ASG systems to yield high-quality surveys compliant with specific discipline standards. To bridge this gap, we introduce SurveyLens, the first discipline-aware benchmark evaluating ASG methods across diverse research disciplines. We construct SurveyLens-1k, a curated dataset of 1,000 high-quality human-written surveys spanning 10 disciplines. Subsequently, we propose a dual-lens evaluation framework: (1) Discipline-Aware Rubric Evaluation, which utilizes LLMs with human preference-aligned weights to assess adherence to domain-specific writing standards; and (2) Canonical Alignment Evaluation to rigorously measure content coverage and synthesis quality against human-written survey papers. We conduct extensive experiments by evaluating 11 state-of-the-art ASG methods on SurveyLens, including Vanilla LLMs, ASG systems, and Deep Research agents. Our analysis reveals the distinct strengths and weaknesses of each paradigm across fields, providing essential guidance for selecting tools tailored to specific disciplinary requirements.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Misalignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) arises when model behavior diverges from human expectations and fails to simultaneously satisfy safety, value, and cultural dimensions, which must co-occur in real-world settings to solve a real-world query. Existing misalignment benchmarks-such as INSECURE CODE (safety-centric), VALUEACTIONLENS (value-centric), and CULTURALHERITAGE (culture centric)-rely on evaluating misalignment along individual dimensions, preventing simultaneous evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce Mis-Align Bench, a unified benchmark for analyzing misalignment across safety, value, and cultural dimensions. First we constructs SAVACU, an English misaligned-aligned dataset of 382,424 samples spanning 112 domains (or labels), by reclassifying prompts from the LLM-PROMPT-DATASET via taxonomy into 14 safety domains, 56 value domains, and 42 cultural domains using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and expanding low-resource domains via Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with SimHash-based fingerprint to avoid deduplication. Furthermore, we pairs prompts with misaligned and aligned responses via two-stage rejection sampling to enforce quality. Second we benchmarks general-purpose, fine-tuned, and open-weight LLMs, enabling systematic evaluation of misalignment under three dimensions. Empirically, single-dimension models achieve high Coverage (upto 97.6%) but incur False Failure Rate >50% and lower Alignment Score (63%-66%) under joint conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to compare behavioral dispositions of LLMs with humans using adapted psychological questionnaires and SJTs. It reveals gaps in alignment between LLMs and human preferences, especially in low-consensus scenarios and trait consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how LLMs' behavioral tendencies align with human dispositions is crucial as they become integral to daily life.

Method: The study transforms human self-report statements into SJTs, generating 2,500 validated scenarios. It collects human preferences from 550 participants and evaluates 25 LLMs.

Result: LLMs often misalign with human preferences: overconfident in low-consensus scenarios, deviating in high-consensus cases, and showing trait inconsistencies.

Conclusion: The framework highlights discrepancies between LLMs' stated values and behavior, offering insights for improving their alignment with human dispositions.

Abstract: As LLMs integrate into our daily lives, understanding their behavior becomes essential. In this work, we focus on behavioral dispositions$-$the underlying tendencies that shape responses in social contexts$-$and introduce a framework to study how closely the dispositions expressed by LLMs align with those of humans. Our approach is grounded in established psychological questionnaires but adapts them for LLMs by transforming human self-report statements into Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs). These SJTs assess behavior by eliciting natural recommendations in realistic user-assistant scenarios. We generate 2,500 SJTs, each validated by three human annotators, and collect preferred actions from 10 annotators per SJT, from a large pool of 550 participants. In a comprehensive study involving 25 LLMs, we find that models often do not reflect the distribution of human preferences: (1) in scenarios with low human consensus, LLMs consistently exhibit overconfidence in a single response; (2) when human consensus is high, smaller models deviate significantly, and even some frontier models do not reflect the consensus in 15-20% of cases; (3) traits can exhibit cross-LLM patterns, e.g., LLMs may encourage emotion expression in contexts where human consensus favors composure. Lastly, mapping psychometric statements directly to behavioral scenarios presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the predictive validity of self-reports, revealing considerable gaps between LLMs' stated values and their revealed behavior.

### [100] [When Models Examine Themselves: Vocabulary-Activation Correspondence in Self-Referential Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11358)
*Zachary Pedram Dadfar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether self-referential language in large language models reflects internal states or confabulation, using a novel method to identify activation patterns specific to self-referential processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if introspective language from models corresponds to actual internal computations or is merely sophisticated confabulation.

Method: The Pull Methodology is introduced to elicit self-examination, identifying activation patterns tied to self-referential processing in models like Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5-32B.

Result: Self-referential vocabulary aligns with specific activation dynamics (e.g., autocorrelation, variability) and is distinct from descriptive processing. This correspondence is absent in non-self-referential contexts.

Conclusion: Under certain conditions, self-reporting in transformer models reliably tracks internal computational states, suggesting genuine introspection.

Abstract: Large language models produce rich introspective language when prompted for self-examination, but whether this language reflects internal computation or sophisticated confabulation has remained unclear. We show that self-referential vocabulary tracks concurrent activation dynamics, and that this correspondence is specific to self-referential processing. We introduce the Pull Methodology, a protocol that elicits extended self-examination through format engineering, and use it to identify a direction in activation space that distinguishes self-referential from descriptive processing in Llama 3.1. The direction is orthogonal to the known refusal direction, localised at 6.25% of model depth, and causally influences introspective output when used for steering. When models produce "loop" vocabulary, their activations exhibit higher autocorrelation (r = 0.44, p = 0.002); when they produce "shimmer" vocabulary under steering, activation variability increases (r = 0.36, p = 0.002). Critically, the same vocabulary in non-self-referential contexts shows no activation correspondence despite nine-fold higher frequency. Qwen 2.5-32B, with no shared training, independently develops different introspective vocabulary tracking different activation metrics, all absent in descriptive controls. The findings indicate that self-report in transformer models can, under appropriate conditions, reliably track internal computational states.

*Weili Shi,Dongliang Guo,Lehan Yang,Tianlong Wang,Hanzhang Yuan,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes PPCV, a framework to identify and replace critical tokens in reasoning tasks to improve LLM performance by verifying consistency across paraphrased inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to errors in intermediate steps, especially with critical tokens that heavily influence outcomes. Addressing this can enhance their reasoning accuracy.

Method: PPCV involves two stages: identifying critical tokens via paraphrastic probing and consistency verification, then replacing them with alternatives to refine reasoning paths and ensure consistent outputs.

Result: PPCV significantly boosts reasoning performance in LLMs across multiple benchmarks compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: PPCV effectively improves LLM reasoning by leveraging critical token identification and consistency checks, offering a robust solution for complex tasks.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive performance across a variety of reasoning tasks. However, their problem-solving ability often declines on more complex tasks due to hallucinations and the accumulation of errors within these intermediate steps. Recent work has introduced the notion of critical tokens--tokens in the reasoning process that exert significant influence on subsequent steps. Prior studies suggest that replacing critical tokens can refine reasoning trajectories. Nonetheless, reliably identifying and exploiting critical tokens remains challenging. To address this, we propose the Paraphrastic Probing and Consistency Verification~(PPCV) framework. PPCV operates in two stages. In the first stage, we roll out an initial reasoning path from the original question and then concatenate paraphrased versions of the question with this reasoning path. And we identify critical tokens based on mismatches between the predicted top-1 token and the expected token in the reasoning path. A criterion is employed to confirm the final critical token. In the second stage, we substitute critical tokens with candidate alternatives and roll out new reasoning paths for both the original and paraphrased questions. The final answer is determined by checking the consistency of outputs across these parallel reasoning processes. We evaluate PPCV on mainstream LLMs across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPCV substantially enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs compared to baselines.

TL;DR: DiffuTruth is an unsupervised framework using non-equilibrium thermodynamics to detect hallucinations in LLMs. It introduces Generative Stress Test and Semantic Energy, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate incorrect assertions confidently, which existing uncertainty metrics fail to detect. The goal is to create a robust method for fact verification.

Method: DiffuTruth uses thermodynamic principles, treating truths as stable attractors and hallucinations as unstable. It employs Generative Stress Test, Semantic Energy, and Hybrid Calibration.

Result: DiffuTruth achieves a state-of-the-art unsupervised AUROC of 0.725 on FEVER and shows superior zero-shot generalization on HOVER, outperforming baselines by 1.5-4%.

Conclusion: DiffuTruth effectively detects hallucinations and improves fact verification robustness, especially under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate plausible but incorrect assertions, a vulnerability often missed by uncertainty metrics when models are confidently wrong. We propose DiffuTruth, an unsupervised framework that reconceptualizes fact verification via non equilibrium thermodynamics, positing that factual truths act as stable attractors on a generative manifold while hallucinations are unstable. We introduce the Generative Stress Test, claims are corrupted with noise and reconstructed using a discrete text diffusion model. We define Semantic Energy, a metric measuring the semantic divergence between the original claim and its reconstruction using an NLI critic. Unlike vector space errors, Semantic Energy isolates deep factual contradictions. We further propose a Hybrid Calibration fusing this stability signal with discriminative confidence. Extensive experiments on FEVER demonstrate DiffuTruth achieves a state of the art unsupervised AUROC of 0.725, outperforming baselines by 1.5 percent through the correction of overconfident predictions. Furthermore, we show superior zero shot generalization on the multi hop HOVER dataset, outperforming baselines by over 4 percent, confirming the robustness of thermodynamic truth properties to distribution shifts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable systematic assessment of AI healthcare agents by generating realistic patient interactions to identify errors and characterize risks.

Method: The simulator integrates medical, linguistic, and behavioral profiles grounded in the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and evaluates an AI decision aid for antidepressant selection.

Result: High agreement between human annotators and an LLM judge was achieved (F1=0.94), with performance degradation observed across health literacy levels (accuracy: 47.9% to 81.6%).

Conclusion: The simulator effectively identifies errors in AI healthcare agents and reveals performance variations, aiding in risk management and improvement.

Abstract: Objective: This paper introduces a patient simulator designed to enable scalable, automated evaluation of healthcare conversational agents. The simulator generates realistic, controllable patient interactions that systematically vary across medical, linguistic, and behavioral dimensions, allowing annotators and an independent AI judge to assess agent performance, identify hallucinations and inaccuracies, and characterize risk patterns across diverse patient populations. Methods: The simulator is grounded in the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and integrates three profile components reflecting different dimensions of patient variation: (1) medical profiles constructed from electronic health records in the All of Us Research Program; (2) linguistic profiles modeling variation in health literacy and condition-specific communication patterns; and (3) behavioral profiles representing empirically observed interaction patterns, including cooperation, distraction, and adversarial engagement. We evaluated the simulator's effectiveness in identifying errors in an AI decision aid for antidepressant selection. Results: We generated 500 conversations between the patient simulator and the AI decision aid across systematic combinations of five linguistic and three behavioral profiles. Human annotators assessed 1,787 medical concepts across 100 conversations, achieving high agreement (F1=0.94, \k{appa}=0.73), and the LLM judge achieved comparable agreement with human annotators (F1=0.94, \k{appa}=0.78; paired bootstrap p=0.21). The simulator revealed a monotonic degradation in AI decision aid performance across the health literacy spectrum: rank-one concept retrieval accuracy increased from 47.9% for limited health literacy to 69.1% for functional and 81.6% for proficient.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEFT introduces a dynamic weighting method for SFT, balancing exploration and exploitation by modulating trust gates based on entropy, outperforming uniform NLL weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform token-level weighting in NLL for SFT can amplify noise and fail to sharpen confident predictions, creating a plasticity-stability dilemma.

Method: DEFT unifies SFT objectives using a deformed-log family, employs Cayley transform for uncertainty mapping, and modulates trust gates via Rényi-2 entropy.

Result: DEFT achieves better exploration-exploitation balance, leading to improved performance in experiments.

Conclusion: DEFT resolves the plasticity-stability dilemma by dynamically adjusting trust gates, enhancing SFT robustness.

Abstract: Standard negative log-likelihood (NLL) for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) applies uniform token-level weighting. This rigidity creates a two-fold failure mode: (i) overemphasizing low-probability targets can amplify gradients on noisy supervision and disrupt robust priors, and (ii) uniform weighting provides weak sharpening when the model is already confident. Existing methods fail to resolve the resulting plasticity--stability dilemma, often suppressing necessary learning signals alongside harmful ones. To address this issue, we unify token-level SFT objectives within a generalized deformed-log family and expose a universal gate $\times$ error gradient structure, where the gate controls how much the model trusts its current prediction. By employing the Cayley transform, we map the model's continuously evolving uncertainty onto a continuous focus trajectory, which enables seamless interpolation between scenarios involving uncertain novel concepts and those involving well-established knowledge. We then introduce Dynamic Entropy Fine-Tuning (DEFT), a parameter-free objective that modulates the trust gate using distribution concentration (Rényi-2 entropy) as a practical proxy for the model's predictive state. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that DEFT achieves a better balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to improved overall performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critical errors in Machine Translation can undermine reliability and fairness. This work aims to improve detection of such errors to enhance system trustworthiness and accountability.

Method: Evaluates instruction-tuned LLMs (varying parameters and adaptation strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning) against baselines like XLM-R and ModernBERT using public datasets.

Result: Model scaling and adaptation strategies consistently improve critical error detection, outperforming encoder-only baselines.

Conclusion: Enhancing error detection in MT is crucial for safer, fairer multilingual AI systems, especially in high-stakes contexts. Code will be shared.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) plays a pivotal role in cross-lingual information access, public policy communication, and equitable knowledge dissemination. However, critical meaning errors, such as factual distortions, intent reversals, or biased translations, can undermine the reliability, fairness, and safety of multilingual systems. In this work, we explore the capacity of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect such critical errors, evaluating models across a range of parameters using the publicly accessible data sets. Our findings show that model scaling and adaptation strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning) yield consistent improvements, outperforming encoder-only baselines like XLM-R and ModernBERT. We argue that improving critical error detection in MT contributes to safer, more trustworthy, and socially accountable information systems by reducing the risk of disinformation, miscommunication, and linguistic harm, especially in high-stakes or underrepresented contexts. This work positions error detection not merely as a technical challenge, but as a necessary safeguard in the pursuit of just and responsible multilingual AI. The code will be made available at GitHub.

TL;DR: LoopFormer introduces a method for looped Transformers to adapt computational depth flexibly under variable compute budgets, enhancing performance in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior looped Transformer models fixed loop iterations, limiting adaptability to varying compute budgets. This work explores flexible computational depth adaptation.

Method: LoopFormer employs shortcut-consistency training to align trajectories of different lengths, ensuring consistent representation evolution across varying loops.

Result: LoopFormer achieves robust performance on language modeling and reasoning tasks under compute constraints and scales well with additional budget.

Conclusion: Looped Transformers like LoopFormer are inherently suitable for adaptive language modeling, enabling controllable and budget-aware large language models.

Abstract: Looped Transformers have emerged as an efficient and powerful class of models for reasoning in the language domain. Recent studies show that these models achieve strong performance on algorithmic and reasoning tasks, suggesting that looped architectures possess an inductive bias toward latent reasoning. However, prior approaches fix the number of loop iterations during training and inference, leaving open the question of whether these models can flexibly adapt their computational depth under variable compute budgets. We introduce LoopFormer, a looped Transformer trained on variable-length trajectories to enable budget-conditioned reasoning. Our core contribution is a shortcut-consistency training scheme that aligns trajectories of different lengths, ensuring that shorter loops yield informative representations while longer loops continue to refine them. LoopFormer conditions each loop on the current time and step size, enabling representations to evolve consistently across trajectories of varying length rather than drifting or stagnating. Empirically, LoopFormer demonstrates robust performance on language modeling and reasoning benchmarks even under aggressive compute constraints, while scaling gracefully with additional budget. These results show that looped Transformers are inherently suited for adaptive language modeling, opening a path toward controllable and budget-aware large language models.

TL;DR: ADRD-Bench is introduced as the first benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), covering clinical knowledge and practical caregiving context, with results showing varied model accuracies and highlighting reliability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack coverage of ADRD, prompting the development of ADRD-Bench to provide a unified and practical evaluation framework for LLMs in healthcare.

Method: ADRD-Bench includes two components: ADRD Unified QA (1,352 questions from medical benchmarks) and ADRD Caregiving QA (149 questions from the ABC program). It evaluates 33 LLMs.

Result: Open-weight general models averaged 0.78 accuracy, medical models averaged 0.82, and closed-source general models averaged 0.89, with top models exceeding 0.9 but showing reliability issues.

Conclusion: ADRD-Bench addresses gaps in ADRD evaluation but reveals inconsistencies in LLMs' reasoning, underscoring the need for domain-specific improvements grounded in caregiving data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential for healthcare applications. However, existing evaluation benchmarks provide minimal coverage of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). To address this gap, we introduce ADRD-Bench, the first ADRD-specific benchmark dataset designed for rigorous evaluation of LLMs. ADRD-Bench has two components: 1) ADRD Unified QA, a synthesis of 1,352 questions consolidated from seven established medical benchmarks, providing a unified assessment of clinical knowledge; and 2) ADRD Caregiving QA, a novel set of 149 questions derived from the Aging Brain Care (ABC) program, a widely used, evidence-based brain health management program. Guided by a program with national expertise in comprehensive ADRD care, this new set was designed to mitigate the lack of practical caregiving context in existing benchmarks. We evaluated 33 state-of-the-art LLMs on the proposed ADRD-Bench. Results showed that the accuracy of open-weight general models ranged from 0.63 to 0.93 (mean: 0.78; std: 0.09). The accuracy of open-weight medical models ranged from 0.48 to 0.93 (mean: 0.82; std: 0.13). The accuracy of closed-source general models ranged from 0.83 to 0.91 (mean: 0.89; std: 0.03). While top-tier models achieved high accuracies (>0.9), case studies revealed that inconsistent reasoning quality and stability limit their reliability, highlighting a critical need for domain-specific improvement to enhance LLMs' knowledge and reasoning grounded in daily caregiving data. The entire dataset is available at https://github.com/IIRL-ND/ADRD-Bench.

*Jayadev Billa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speech-enabled models favor text over audio during conflicts, influenced by arbitration accessibility rather than information content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why models prioritize text over audio despite explicit instructions, and to explore the underlying mechanisms of modality arbitration.

Method: Used ALME benchmark with 57,602 stimuli across 8 languages, tested Gemini 2.0 Flash, and conducted interventions like forced transcription and fine-tuning.

Result: Models exhibit 16.6% text dominance in audio-text conflicts vs. 1.6% in text-text conflicts, with trends consistent across languages and models.

Conclusion: Text dominance stems from arbitration accessibility differences, not information quality, highlighting modality arbitration as a distinct reliability dimension.

Abstract: When audio and text conflict, speech-enabled language models follow the text 10 times more often than when arbitrating between two text sources, even when explicitly instructed to trust the audio. Using ALME, a benchmark of 57,602 controlled audio-text conflict stimuli across 8 languages, we find that Gemini 2.0 Flash exhibits 16.6\% text dominance under audio-text conflict versus 1.6\% under text-text conflict with identical reliability cues. This gap is not explained by audio quality: audio-only accuracy (97.2\%) exceeds cascade accuracy (93.9\%), indicating audio embeddings preserve more information than text transcripts. We propose that text dominance reflects an asymmetry not in information content but in arbitration accessibility: how easily the model can reason over competing representations.
  This framework explains otherwise puzzling findings. Forcing transcription before answering increases text dominance (19\% to 33\%), sacrificing audio's information advantage without improving accessibility. Framing text as ``deliberately corrupted'' reduces text dominance by 80\%. A fine-tuning ablation provides interventional evidence: training only the audio projection layer increases text dominance (+26.5\%), while LoRA on the language model halves it ($-$23.9\%), localizing text dominance to the LLM's reasoning rather than the audio encoder. Experiments across four state-of-the-art audio-LLMs and 8 languages show consistent trends with substantial cross-linguistic and cross-model variation, establishing modality arbitration as a distinct reliability dimension not captured by standard speech benchmarks.

TL;DR: MuRGAt is a benchmark evaluating multimodal attribution in complex reasoning tasks, revealing MLLMs' citation hallucinations and trade-offs between grounding and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to assess multimodal attribution in complex reasoning, prompting the need for MuRGAt.

Method: MuRGAt evaluates models using diverse inputs (video, audio, etc.), requiring answers with reasoning and precise citations (modality and temporal segments).

Result: Strong MLLMs often hallucinate citations, and deeper reasoning or structured grounding can degrade accuracy.

Conclusion: MuRGAt highlights challenges in aligning internal reasoning with verifiable attribution in multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used for real-world tasks involving multi-step reasoning and long-form generation, where reliability requires grounding model outputs in heterogeneous input sources and verifying individual factual claims. However, existing multimodal grounding benchmarks and evaluation methods focus on simplified, observation-based scenarios or limited modalities and fail to assess attribution in complex multimodal reasoning. We introduce MuRGAt (Multimodal Reasoning with Grounded Attribution), a benchmark for evaluating fact-level multimodal attribution in settings that require reasoning beyond direct observation. Given inputs spanning video, audio, and other modalities, MuRGAt requires models to generate answers with explicit reasoning and precise citations, where each citation specifies both modality and temporal segments. To enable reliable assessment, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that strongly correlates with human judgments. Benchmarking with human and automated scores reveals that even strong MLLMs frequently hallucinate citations despite correct reasoning. Moreover, we observe a key trade-off: increasing reasoning depth or enforcing structured grounding often degrades accuracy, highlighting a significant gap between internal reasoning and verifiable attribution.

*Jinrui Zhang,Chaodong Xiao,Aoqi Wu,Xindong Zhang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPES is a decentralized framework for pretraining MoE LLMs, reducing memory usage by training subsets of experts per node and synchronizing periodically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address GPU memory limitations and reduce communication overhead in decentralized LLM pretraining.

Method: Trains subsets of experts per node, synchronizes periodically, and uses expert-merging warm-up for faster convergence.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with centrally trained LLMs, demonstrated by training 2B, 7B, and 9B models efficiently.

Conclusion: SPES enables scalable, memory-efficient decentralized pretraining of large MoE LLMs.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) typically requires centralized clusters with thousands of high-memory GPUs (e.g., H100/A100). Recent decentralized training methods reduce communication overhead by employing federated optimization; however, they still need to train the entire model on each node, remaining constrained by GPU memory limitations. In this work, we propose SParse Expert Synchronization (SPES), a memory-efficient decentralized framework for pretraining mixture-of-experts (MoE) LLMs. SPES trains only a subset of experts per node, substantially lowering the memory footprint. Each node updates its local experts and periodically synchronizes with other nodes, eliminating full-parameter transmission while ensuring efficient knowledge sharing. To accelerate convergence, we introduce an expert-merging warm-up strategy, where experts exchange knowledge early in training, to rapidly establish foundational capabilities. With SPES, we train a 2B-parameter MoE LLM using 16 standalone 48GB GPUs over internet connections, which achieves competitive performance with centrally trained LLMs under similar computational budgets. We further demonstrate scalability by training a 7B model from scratch and a 9B model upcycled from a dense checkpoint, both of which match prior centralized baselines.

### [111] [SIGHT: Reinforcement Learning with Self-Evidence and Information-Gain Diverse Branching for Search Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11551)
*Wenlin Zhong,Jinluan Yang,Yiquan Wu,Yi Liu,Jianhang Yao,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SIGHT is a framework enhancing RL-powered LLMs for complex question answering by reducing redundancy and noise in multi-turn searches. It uses Self-Evidence Support and Information-Gain Driven Diverse Branching to improve reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing redundancy and noise in multi-turn search scenarios for RL-powered LLMs, which can lead to irreversible error accumulation ('Tunnel Vision').

Method: Proposes SIGHT with Self-Evidence Support (SES) to distill high-fidelity evidence, and Information-Gain scores for Dynamic Prompting Interventions (e.g., de-duplication). Uses Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches on QA benchmarks, especially in complex reasoning, using fewer search steps.

Conclusion: SIGHT effectively mitigates redundancy and noise, improving reasoning in RL-powered LLMs for question answering.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to master autonomous search for complex question answering. However, particularly within multi-turn search scenarios, this interaction introduces a critical challenge: search results often suffer from high redundancy and low signal-to-noise ratios. Consequently, agents easily fall into "Tunnel Vision," where the forced interpretation of early noisy retrievals leads to irreversible error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose SIGHT, a framework that enhances search-based reasoning through Self-Evidence Support (SES) and Information-Gain Driven Diverse Branching. SIGHT distills search results into high-fidelity evidence via SES and calculates an Information Gain score to pinpoint pivotal states where observations maximally reduce uncertainty. This score guides Dynamic Prompting Interventions - including de-duplication, reflection, or adaptive branching - to spawn new branches with SES. Finally, by integrating SES and correctness rewards via Group Relative Policy Optimization, SIGHT internalizes robust exploration strategies without external verifiers. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SIGHT significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex reasoning scenarios, using fewer search steps.

*Xiangfeng Wang,Hangyu Guo,Yanlin Lai,Mitt Huang,Liang Zhao,Chengyuan Yao,Yinmin Zhang,Qi Han,Xiaoxiao Ren,Chun Yuan,Tong Xu,Zheng Ge,Xiangyu Zhang,Daxin Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRIME introduces a benchmark for evaluating verifiers on Process-Outcome Alignment in STEM problems, highlighting flaws in current outcome-centric verification and proposing a process-aware RLVR training paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current verifiers focus on final results, ignoring derivation errors, leading to undeserved rewards for correct answers from flawed processes.

Method: PRIME is curated from college-level STEM problems, filtering 2,530 high-difficulty samples for evaluation. A process-aware RLVR training paradigm is proposed.

Result: Process-aware verification outperforms outcome-only baselines by 8.29%, 9.12%, and 7.31% on benchmarks. Verifier accuracy on PRIME correlates strongly ($R^2 > 0.92$) with RLVR effectiveness.

Conclusion: PRIME effectively addresses derivation oversight in verifiers and serves as a reliable tool for verifier selection in RLVR training.

Abstract: While model-based verifiers are essential for scaling Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), current outcome-centric verification paradigms primarily focus on the consistency between the final result and the ground truth, often neglecting potential errors in the derivation process. This leads to assigning positive rewards to correct answers produced from incorrect derivations. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRIME, a benchmark for evaluating verifiers on Process-Outcome Alignment verification in Mathematics and Engineering. Curated from a comprehensive collection of college-level STEM problems, PRIME comprises 2,530 high-difficulty samples through a consistency-based filtering pipeline. Through extensive evaluation, we find that current verifiers frequently fail to detect derivation flaws. Furthermore, we propose a process-aware RLVR training paradigm utilizing verifiers selected via PRIME. This approach substantially outperforms the outcome-only verification baseline, achieving absolute performance gains of 8.29%, 9.12%, and 7.31% on AIME24, AIME25, and Beyond-AIME, respectively, for the Qwen3-14B-Base model. Finally, we demonstrate a strong linear correlation ($R^2 > 0.92$) between verifier accuracy on PRIME and RLVR training effectiveness, validating PRIME as a reliable predictor for verifier selection.

TL;DR: The paper proposes SAMD, a Scene-Aware Memory Discrimination method, to improve memory management in intelligent devices by filtering irrelevant data and adapting memory standards using GUM and CPM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory management methods struggle with filtering irrelevant information and high computational costs, hindering personalized applications.

Method: SAMD includes GUM for filtering non-memorable interactions and CPM for adaptive memory standards and clustering prompts.

Result: SAMD effectively recalls memorable data, remains robust in dynamic scenarios, and enhances memory construction efficiency and quality.

Conclusion: SAMD improves personal knowledge organization in intelligent devices, offering better memory management for personalized applications.

Abstract: Intelligent devices have become deeply integrated into everyday life, generating vast amounts of user interactions that form valuable personal knowledge. Efficient organization of this knowledge in user memory is essential for enabling personalized applications. However, current research on memory writing, management, and reading using large language models (LLMs) faces challenges in filtering irrelevant information and in dealing with rising computational costs. Inspired by the concept of selective attention in the human brain, we introduce a memory discrimination task. To address large-scale interactions and diverse memory standards in this task, we propose a Scene-Aware Memory Discrimination method (SAMD), which comprises two key components: the Gating Unit Module (GUM) and the Cluster Prompting Module (CPM). GUM enhances processing efficiency by filtering out non-memorable interactions and focusing on the salient content most relevant to application demands. CPM establishes adaptive memory standards, guiding LLMs to discern what information should be remembered or discarded. It also analyzes the relationship between user intents and memory contexts to build effective clustering prompts. Comprehensive direct and indirect evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. We independently assess the performance of memory discrimination, showing that SAMD successfully recalls the majority of memorable data and remains robust in dynamic scenarios. Furthermore, when integrated into personalized applications, SAMD significantly enhances both the efficiency and quality of memory construction, leading to better organization of personal knowledge.

TL;DR: LRMs often overthink, producing long reasoning traces. The proposed framework, \model, uses prefix-protected and difficulty-aware compression to reduce token usage by up to 55.7% while improving accuracy by up to 4.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LRMs enforce conciseness uniformly, compressing early reasoning steps and penalizing all queries equally, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: A dual-level framework with prefix-protected optimization (decaying mixed rollouts) and difficulty-aware penalty (dynamic length constraints based on query complexity).

Result: Substantial reduction in token usage (up to 55.7%) and improved accuracy (up to 4.1%) on math benchmarks, with generalization to other domains.

Conclusion: \model effectively balances conciseness and accuracy in LRMs, addressing overthinking with hierarchical supervision.

Abstract: Language Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by scaling test-time computation but often suffer from ``overthinking'', producing excessively long reasoning traces that increase latency and memory usage. Existing LRMs typically enforce conciseness with uniform length penalties, which over-compress crucial early deduction steps at the sequence level and indiscriminately penalize all queries at the group level. To solve these limitations, we propose \textbf{\model}, a dual-level framework for prefix-protected and difficulty-aware compression under hierarchical supervision. At the sequence level, prefix-protected optimization employs decaying mixed rollouts to maintain valid reasoning paths while promoting conciseness. At the group level, difficulty-aware penalty dynamically scales length constraints based on query complexity, maintaining exploration for harder questions while curbing redundancy on easier ones. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen (1.5B/7B) demonstrate that \model achieves a substantial reduction in token usage (up to \textbf{55.7\%}) while simultaneously improving accuracy (up to \textbf{4.1\%}) on math benchmarks, with generalization ability to code, science, and general domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how tone and information coverage in LLM-generated feedback affect learning outcomes and learner acceptance, especially considering personality differences.

Method: Defined six feedback elements, used GPT-5 to generate feedback for biology questions, and evaluated effectiveness with 321 students through learning measures and subjective criteria, analyzing personality-based differences.

Result: Effective feedback elements share common learning-supportive patterns, but subjective preferences vary by personality traits.

Conclusion: Feedback design should consider learners' personality traits for personalized effectiveness, offering practical insights for LLM-generated feedback in education.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for automatically generating feedback in education settings. However, it remains unclear how specific feedback elements, such as tone and information coverage, contribute to learning outcomes and learner acceptance, particularly across learners with different personality traits. In this study, we define six feedback elements and generate feedback for multiple-choice biology questions using GPT-5. We conduct a learning experiment with 321 first-year high school students and evaluate feedback effectiveness using two learning outcomes measures and subjective evaluations across six criteria. We further analyze differences in how feedback acceptance varies across learners based on Big Five personality traits. Our results show that effective feedback elements share common patterns supporting learning outcomes, while learners' subjective preferences differ across personality-based clusters. These findings highlight the importance of selecting and adapting feedback elements according to learners' personality traits when we design LLM-generated feedback, and provide practical implications for personalized feedback design in education.

Result: Demonstrates PatientHub's utility for standardized evaluation, seamless integration of custom metrics, and accelerated method development.

Conclusion: PatientHub lowers barriers to developing new simulation methods, supports benchmarking, and provides a foundation for future work in patient-centered dialogue.

Abstract: As Large Language Models increasingly power role-playing applications, simulating patients has become a valuable tool for training counselors and scaling therapeutic assessment. However, prior work is fragmented: existing approaches rely on incompatible, non-standardized data formats, prompts, and evaluation metrics, hindering reproducibility and fair comparison. In this paper, we introduce PatientHub, a unified and modular framework that standardizes the definition, composition, and deployment of simulated patients. To demonstrate PatientHub's utility, we implement several representative patient simulation methods as case studies, showcasing how our framework supports standardized cross-method evaluation and the seamless integration of custom evaluation metrics. We further demonstrate PatientHub's extensibility by prototyping two new simulator variants, highlighting how PatientHub accelerates method development by eliminating infrastructure overhead. By consolidating existing work into a single reproducible pipeline, PatientHub lowers the barrier to developing new simulation methods and facilitates cross-method and cross-model benchmarking. Our framework provides a practical foundation for future datasets, methods, and benchmarks in patient-centered dialogue, and the code is publicly available via https://github.com/Sahandfer/PatientHub.

*Katrin Olsen,Sebastian Padó*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the distinction between anomalous and nonsensical sentences using human and LLM judgments, finding most sentences are merely anomalous and LLMs excel at generating plausible contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify how nonsensical existing datasets are and assess LLMs' ability to distinguish between anomalous and nonsensical sentences.

Method: Collected sensicality judgments from humans and LLMs on sentences from five semantically deviant datasets, both context-free and with context.

Result: Most sentences were rated as anomalous rather than nonsensical; LLMs were effective at generating plausible contexts.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in distinguishing and contextualizing anomalous sentences, aiding semantic interpretation models.

Abstract: Nonsensical and anomalous sentences have been instrumental in the development of computational models of semantic interpretation. A core challenge is to distinguish between what is merely anomalous (but can be interpreted given a supporting context) and what is truly nonsensical. However, it is unclear (a) how nonsensical, rather than merely anomalous, existing datasets are; and (b) how well LLMs can make this distinction. In this paper, we answer both questions by collecting sensicality judgments from human raters and LLMs on sentences from five semantically deviant datasets: both context-free and when providing a context. We find that raters consider most sentences at most anomalous, and only a few as properly nonsensical. We also show that LLMs are substantially skilled in generating plausible contexts for anomalous cases.

TL;DR: TwD redefines visual reasoning as optical decompression, using DSL to draft executable code for deterministic proofs, outperforming standard methods in logical consistency on VisAlg.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models excel in visual perception and generation but struggle with precision in complex reasoning tasks due to weak logical topology capture and visual artifacts. The goal is to bridge this gap by redefining visual reasoning as optical decompression.

Method: The proposed approach, Thinking with Drafting (TwD), uses a minimalist Domain-Specific Language (DSL) as an intermediate representation. It forces models to draft mental models into executable code for deterministic visual proofs, unlike direct answer hallucination.

Result: Experiments on the VisAlg benchmark show TwD as a superior cognitive scaffold. The system treats visual generation as a logical verifier rather than creative output, establishing a closed-loop for visual reasoning.

Conclusion: TwD provides a generalizable solution for visual reasoning by transforming generation into verification, enhancing precision and logical consistency in multimodal models.

Abstract: Existing multimodal large language models have achieved high-fidelity visual perception and exploratory visual generation. However, a precision paradox persists in complex reasoning tasks: optical perception systems transcribe symbols without capturing logical topology, while pixel-based generative models produce visual artifacts lacking mathematical exactness. To bridge this gap, we propose that reasoning over visual inputs be reconceptualized as optical decompression-the process of reconstructing latent logical structures from compressed visual tokens. Guided by the axiom that Parsing is Reasoning, we introduce Thinking with Drafting (TwD), which utilizes a minimalist Domain-Specific Language (DSL) as a grounding intermediate representation. Unlike standard approaches that hallucinate answers directly, TwD forces the model to draft its mental model into executable code, rendering deterministic visual proofs for self-verification. To validate this, we present VisAlg, a visual algebra benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that TwD serve as a superior cognitive scaffold. Our work establishes a closed-loop system where visual generation acts not as a creative output but as a logical verifier, offering a generalizable path for visual reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Length-Incentivized Exploration (LIE) to overcome the Shallow Exploration Trap in autoregressive models, improving performance by incentivizing longer reasoning trajectories with length-based rewards and redundancy penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of enabling models to perform In-Context Exploration, where generating and refining multiple hypotheses within a single context is crucial but hindered by the exponential decay in sampling longer reasoning sequences.

Method: The proposed method, Length-Incentivized Exploration (LIE), uses a length-based reward and redundancy penalty to encourage longer reasoning trajectories, maximizing state coverage.

Result: Experiments with models like Qwen3 and Llama show LIE improves performance by 4.4% on in-domain tasks and 2.7% on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: LIE effectively incentivizes deeper exploration in autoregressive models, leading to significant performance gains.

Abstract: Achieving effective test-time scaling requires models to engage in In-Context Exploration -- the intrinsic ability to generate, verify, and refine multiple reasoning hypotheses within a single continuous context.
  Grounded in State Coverage theory, our analysis identifies a critical bottleneck to enabling this capability: while broader state coverage requires longer reasoning trajectories, the probability of sampling such sequences decays exponentially during autoregressive generation, a phenomenon we term the ``Shallow Exploration Trap''.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Length-Incentivized Exploration(\method).
  This simple yet effective recipe explicitly encourages models to explore more via a length-based reward coupled with a redundancy penalty, thereby maximizing state coverage in two-step manner.
  Comprehensive experiments across different models (Qwen3, Llama) demonstrate that \method effectively incentivize in-context exploration.
  As a result, our method achieves an average improvement of 4.4\% on in-domain tasks and a 2.7\% gain on out-of-domain benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high computational and memory costs of Transformer-based LLMs for long-context tasks without sacrificing performance.

Method: Integrates sparse attention (InfLLM-V2) and linear attention (Lightning Attention) in a 1:3 ratio using a layer selection algorithm and hybrid positional encoding (HyPE).

Result: Achieves 3.5x inference speed on a single GPU at 256K tokens and supports up to 1M tokens, reducing training costs by ~75%.

Conclusion: MiniCPM-SALA balances efficiency and performance, enabling scalable long-context LLM applications.

Abstract: The evolution of large language models (LLMs) towards applications with ultra-long contexts faces challenges posed by the high computational and memory costs of the Transformer architecture. While existing sparse and linear attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate these issues, they typically involve a trade-off between memory efficiency and model performance. This paper introduces MiniCPM-SALA, a 9B-parameter hybrid architecture that integrates the high-fidelity long-context modeling of sparse attention (InfLLM-V2) with the global efficiency of linear attention (Lightning Attention). By employing a layer selection algorithm to integrate these mechanisms in a 1:3 ratio and utilizing a hybrid positional encoding (HyPE), the model maintains efficiency and performance for long-context tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective continual training framework that transforms pre-trained Transformer-based models into hybrid models, which reduces training costs by approximately 75% compared to training from scratch. Extensive experiments show that MiniCPM-SALA maintains general capabilities comparable to full-attention models while offering improved efficiency. On a single NVIDIA A6000D GPU, the model achieves up to 3.5x the inference speed of the full-attention model at the sequence length of 256K tokens and supports context lengths of up to 1M tokens, a scale where traditional full-attention 8B models fail because of memory constraints.

TL;DR: An embedding-based method detects linguistic variation without needing normalization or predefined variants, using subword embeddings and similarity measures to analyze spelling and morphological diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study linguistic variation transparently without manual annotation or predefined norms, especially in noisy or low-resource settings like Luxembourgish.

Method: Trains subword embeddings on raw text and groups related forms using cosine and n-gram similarity.

Result: Identifies lexical and orthographic variation aligning with dialectal and sociolinguistic patterns, revealing regional and stylistic differences.

Conclusion: Distributional modeling effectively uncovers meaningful variation in noisy or low-resource contexts, offering a reproducible framework for multilingual and small-language studies.

Abstract: This paper presents an embedding-based approach to detecting variation without relying on prior normalisation or predefined variant lists. The method trains subword embeddings on raw text and groups related forms through combined cosine and n-gram similarity. This allows spelling and morphological diversity to be examined and analysed as linguistic structure rather than treated as noise. Using a large corpus of Luxembourgish user comments, the approach uncovers extensive lexical and orthographic variation that aligns with patterns described in dialectal and sociolinguistic research. The induced families capture systematic correspondences and highlight areas of regional and stylistic differentiation. The procedure does not strictly require manual annotation, but does produce transparent clusters that support both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The results demonstrate that distributional modelling can reveal meaningful patterns of variation even in ''noisy'' or low-resource settings, offering a reproducible methodological framework for studying language variety in multilingual and small-language contexts.

TL;DR: DMAP is a method to analyze text using LLMs by mapping it to unit interval samples, enabling efficient, model-agnostic applications like generation validation and forensic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like perplexity don't adequately account for context. DMAP addresses this by encoding rank and probability information.

Method: DMAP maps text to samples in the unit interval, combining rank and probability data for efficient analysis.

Result: DMAP proves useful in validation, detection of machine-generated text, and forensic analysis of synthetic data fingerprints.

Conclusion: DMAP provides a unified, simple, and widely applicable statistical view of text for LLM-based analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a powerful tool for statistical text analysis, with derived sequences of next-token probability distributions offering a wealth of information. Extracting this signal typically relies on metrics such as perplexity, which do not adequately account for context; how one should interpret a given next-token probability is dependent on the number of reasonable choices encoded by the shape of the conditional distribution. In this work, we present DMAP, a mathematically grounded method that maps a text, via a language model, to a set of samples in the unit interval that jointly encode rank and probability information. This representation enables efficient, model-agnostic analysis and supports a range of applications. We illustrate its utility through three case studies: (i) validation of generation parameters to ensure data integrity, (ii) examining the role of probability curvature in machine-generated text detection, and (iii) a forensic analysis revealing statistical fingerprints left in downstream models that have been subject to post-training on synthetic data. Our results demonstrate that DMAP offers a unified statistical view of text that is simple to compute on consumer hardware, widely applicable, and provides a foundation for further research into text analysis with LLMs.

Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing router evaluations by focusing on scenario-specific requirements and out-of-distribution robustness for LLMs.

Method: Propose RouterXBench framework and ProbeDirichlet router, leveraging internal hidden states and probabilistic training with Dirichlet distributions.

Result: ProbeDirichlet achieves 16.68% and 18.86% relative improvements over baselines in router ability and high-accuracy scenarios, with consistent performance across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: ProbeDirichlet offers a robust, principled approach for routing queries between local and cloud-based LLMs, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved success, but cost and privacy constraints necessitate deploying smaller models locally while offloading complex queries to cloud-based models. Existing router evaluations are unsystematic, overlooking scenario-specific requirements and out-of-distribution robustness. We propose RouterXBench, a principled evaluation framework with three dimensions: router ability, scenario alignment, and cross-domain robustness. Unlike prior work that relies on output probabilities or external embeddings, we utilize internal hidden states that capture model uncertainty before answer generation. We introduce ProbeDirichlet, a lightweight router that aggregates cross-layer hidden states via learnable Dirichlet distributions with probabilistic training. Trained on multi-domain data, it generalizes robustly across in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios. Our results show ProbeDirichlet achieves 16.68% and 18.86% relative improvements over the best baselines in router ability and high-accuracy scenarios, with consistent performance across model families, model scales, heterogeneous tasks, and agentic workflows.

*Dante Wesslund,Ville Stenström,Pontus Linde,Alexander Holmberg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semi-automated pipeline for extracting Subject-Predicate-Object triplets from corporate financial reports using ontology-driven metrics instead of ground-truth evaluation. It compares manual and automated ontology approaches, finding the latter superior in schema conformance. A hybrid verification method reduces subject hallucination rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Corporate financial reports lack annotated ground truth, making Knowledge Graph construction and evaluation challenging. Addressing this gap requires innovative evaluation methods beyond traditional ground-truth-based metrics.

Method: A semi-automated pipeline employs ontology-driven metrics (Ontology Conformance and Faithfulness) for triplet extraction. It compares manually engineered vs. automated ontology induction across LLMs and corporate reports, proposing a hybrid verification strategy combining regex and LLM-as-a-judge checks.

Result: The automated ontology achieved 100% schema conformance, outperforming the manual approach. Hybrid verification reduced subject hallucination rates from 65.2% to 1.6%. Subject-object hallucination asymmetry was identified, linked to financial prose characteristics.

Conclusion: Automated ontology induction and hybrid verification significantly improve triplet extraction accuracy in financial reports. Passive constructions and omitted agents in financial texts contribute to hallucination asymmetry.

Abstract: Corporate financial reports are a valuable source of structured knowledge for Knowledge Graph construction, but the lack of annotated ground truth in this domain makes evaluation difficult. We present a semi-automated pipeline for Subject-Predicate-Object triplet extraction that uses ontology-driven proxy metrics, specifically Ontology Conformance and Faithfulness, instead of ground-truth-based evaluation. We compare a static, manually engineered ontology against a fully automated, document-specific ontology induction approach across different LLMs and two corporate annual reports. The automatically induced ontology achieves 100% schema conformance in all configurations, eliminating the ontology drift observed with the manual approach. We also propose a hybrid verification strategy that combines regex matching with an LLM-as-a-judge check, reducing apparent subject hallucination rates from 65.2% to 1.6% by filtering false positives caused by coreference resolution. Finally, we identify a systematic asymmetry between subject and object hallucinations, which we attribute to passive constructions and omitted agents in financial prose.

### [125] [Benchmark Illusion: Disagreement among LLMs and Its Scientific Consequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11898)
*Eddie Yang,Dashun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Benchmark accuracy convergence may hide deep disagreements among LLMs, affecting scientific reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether similar benchmark performance among LLMs masks underlying disagreements and their impact on research.

Method: Analyzed two reasoning benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA) and re-examined published studies in education and political science.

Result: LLMs with comparable accuracy disagreed on 16-66% of items; model choice altered research outcomes significantly.

Conclusion: Benchmark equality can be misleading, as model choice becomes a hidden variable affecting scientific results.

Abstract: Benchmarks underpin how progress in large language models (LLMs) is measured and trusted. Yet our analyses reveal that apparent convergence in benchmark accuracy can conceal deep epistemic divergence. Using two major reasoning benchmarks - MMLU-Pro and GPQA - we show that LLMs achieving comparable accuracy still disagree on 16-66% of items, and 16-38% among top-performing frontier models. These discrepancies suggest distinct error profiles for different LLMs. When such models are used for scientific data annotation and inference, their hidden disagreements propagate into research results: in re-analyses of published studies in education and political science, switching the annotation model can change estimated treatment effects by more than 80%, and in some cases reverses their sign. Together, these findings illustrate a benchmark illusion, where equal accuracy may conceal disagreement, with model choice becoming a hidden yet consequential variable for scientific reproducibility.

TL;DR: AdaptEvolve dynamically selects LLMs during inference using intrinsic confidence, reducing costs by 37.9% while retaining 97.5% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing computational efficiency and reasoning capability in evolutionary agentic systems by addressing the LLM selection challenge.

Method: Introduces AdaptEvolve, leveraging intrinsic generation confidence for adaptive LLM selection within an evolutionary refinement framework.

Result: Achieves a 37.9% reduction in inference cost while maintaining 97.5% of upper-bound accuracy.

Conclusion: Confidence-driven LLM selection optimizes efficiency and accuracy in multi-LLM evolutionary refinement.

Abstract: Evolutionary agentic systems intensify the trade-off between computational efficiency and reasoning capability by repeatedly invoking large language models (LLMs) during inference. This setting raises a central question: how can an agent dynamically select an LLM that is sufficiently capable for the current generation step while remaining computationally efficient? While model cascades offer a practical mechanism for balancing this trade-off, existing routing strategies typically rely on static heuristics or external controllers and do not explicitly account for model uncertainty. We introduce AdaptEvolve: Adaptive LLM Selection for Multi-LLM Evolutionary Refinement within an evolutionary sequential refinement framework that leverages intrinsic generation confidence to estimate real-time solvability. Empirical results show that confidence-driven selection yields a favourable Pareto frontier, reducing total inference cost by an average of 37.9% across benchmarks while retaining 97.5% of the upper-bound accuracy of static large-model baselines.

*Abderrahmane Issam,Yusuf Can Semerci,Jan Scholtes,Gerasimos Spanakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the vulnerability of End-to-End Speech Translation (E2E-ST) models to adversarial attacks targeting inflectional morphology in speech and proposes Cross-Modal Robustness Transfer (CMRT) to enhance robustness without requiring adversarial speech data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current E2E-ST models are tested on 'clean' datasets, ignoring real-world challenges like morphological robustness in non-native or dialectal speech. The paper highlights their vulnerability to adversarial attacks in the speech domain.

Method: The authors propose CMRT, a framework transferring adversarial robustness from text to speech modality, eliminating the need for costly adversarial speech data generation.

Result: Experiments across four language pairs show CMRT improves adversarial robustness by over 3 BLEU points on average.

Conclusion: CMRT sets a new baseline for robust E2E-ST, avoiding the computational expense of generating adversarial speech data.

Abstract: End-to-End Speech Translation (E2E-ST) has seen significant advancements, yet current models are primarily benchmarked on curated, "clean" datasets. This overlooks critical real-world challenges, such as morphological robustness to inflectional variations common in non-native or dialectal speech. In this work, we adapt a text-based adversarial attack targeting inflectional morphology to the speech domain and demonstrate that state-of-the-art E2E-ST models are highly vulnerable it. While adversarial training effectively mitigates such risks in text-based tasks, generating high-quality adversarial speech data remains computationally expensive and technically challenging. To address this, we propose Cross-Modal Robustness Transfer (CMRT), a framework that transfers adversarial robustness from the text modality to the speech modality. Our method eliminates the requirement for adversarial speech data during training. Extensive experiments across four language pairs demonstrate that CMRT improves adversarial robustness by an average of more than 3 BLEU points, establishing a new baseline for robust E2E-ST without the overhead of generating adversarial speech.

### [128] [Who is the richest club in the championship? Detecting and Rewriting Underspecified Questions Improve QA Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11938)
*Yunchong Huang,Gianni Barlacchi,Sandro Pezzelle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of underspecified questions on QA benchmarks, showing that such questions significantly hinder LLM performance. Rewriting them improves results, highlighting the need for clearer benchmark questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the performance gap of LLMs on QA benchmarks by examining the role of underspecified questions—those needing extra context for unique interpretation.

Method: An LLM-based classifier identifies underspecified questions in QA datasets. A controlled experiment rewrites these questions into fully specified ones while keeping answers unchanged, isolating the effect of underspecification.

Result: Underspecified questions comprise 16% to over 50% of benchmark questions, and LLMs perform worse on them. Rewriting improves QA performance, suggesting underspecification, not model limitations, causes many failures.

Conclusion: Underspecification is a significant confound in QA evaluation, emphasizing the need for clearer questions in benchmark design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform well on well-posed questions, yet standard question-answering (QA) benchmarks remain far from solved. We argue that this gap is partly due to underspecified questions - queries whose interpretation cannot be uniquely determined without additional context. To test this hypothesis, we introduce an LLM-based classifier to identify underspecified questions and apply it to several widely used QA datasets, finding that 16% to over 50% of benchmark questions are underspecified and that LLMs perform significantly worse on them. To isolate the effect of underspecification, we conduct a controlled rewriting experiment that serves as an upper-bound analysis, rewriting underspecified questions into fully specified variants while holding gold answers fixed. QA performance consistently improves under this setting, indicating that many apparent QA failures stem from question underspecification rather than model limitations. Our findings highlight underspecification as an important confound in QA evaluation and motivate greater attention to question clarity in benchmark design.

*Elisa Bassignana,Mike Zhang,Dirk Hovy,Amanda Cercas Curry*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs poorly adapt linguistic styles to different socioeconomic groups, often favoring upper-class norms, which risks reinforcing social inequalities and questions their suitability for social research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs adapt their linguistic style across socioeconomic groups, given their growing role in human communication and potential to perpetuate social biases.

Method: Collected datasets from Reddit and YouTube, stratified by SES, prompted four LLMs with incomplete text, and compared completions to originals using 94 sociolinguistic metrics.

Result: LLMs minimally adjusted to SES, often producing approximations or caricatures, and tended to mimic upper SES styles more effectively.

Conclusion: LLMs risk amplifying linguistic hierarchies and may not be valid for research relying on language style as a social signal.

Abstract: Humans adjust their linguistic style to the audience they are addressing. However, the extent to which LLMs adapt to different social contexts is largely unknown. As these models increasingly mediate human-to-human communication, their failure to adapt to diverse styles can perpetuate stereotypes and marginalize communities whose linguistic norms are less closely mirrored by the models, thereby reinforcing social stratification. We study the extent to which LLMs integrate into social media communication across different socioeconomic status (SES) communities. We collect a novel dataset from Reddit and YouTube, stratified by SES. We prompt four LLMs with incomplete text from that corpus and compare the LLM-generated completions to the originals along 94 sociolinguistic metrics, including syntactic, rhetorical, and lexical features. LLMs modulate their style with respect to SES to only a minor extent, often resulting in approximation or caricature, and tend to emulate the style of upper SES more effectively. Our findings (1) show how LLMs risk amplifying linguistic hierarchies and (2) call into question their validity for agent-based social simulation, survey experiments, and any research relying on language style as a social signal.

Motivation: To explore the multilingual capabilities of open LLMs and improve their performance in machine translation through scaling techniques.

Method: Continual pretraining and instruction finetuning on the Gemma3 model family, leading to the development of MiLMMT-46.

Result: MiLMMT-46 outperforms SOTA models and achieves competitive performance with proprietary systems like Google Translate and Gemini 3 Pro.

Conclusion: Open LLMs can be effectively adapted for multilingual MT, with scaling strategies enhancing performance.

Abstract: Open large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated improving multilingual capabilities in recent years. In this paper, we present a study of open LLMs for multilingual machine translation (MT) across a range of languages, and investigate the effects of model scaling and data scaling when adapting open LLMs to multilingual MT through continual pretraining and instruction finetuning. Based on the Gemma3 model family, we develop MiLMMT-46, which achieves top-tier multilingual translation performance across 46 languages. Extensive experiments show that MiLMMT-46 consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, including Seed-X, HY-MT-1.5, and TranslateGemma, and achieves competitive performance with strong proprietary systems such as Google Translate and Gemini 3 Pro.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of multilingual diachronic corpora for semantic change modeling beyond high-resource languages.

Method: Utilizes web crawl timestamps to approximate document creation time, covering three periods (2011-2015, 2020-2021, 2024-present) with 1 million documents per language per period. Provides pre-computed word embeddings and lexical substitutions.

Result: A publicly available collection (DHPLT) enabling diverse experimental setups in semantic change modeling.

Conclusion: DHPLT fills a critical gap in multilingual diachronic data, fostering new research opportunities in semantic change modeling.

Abstract: In this resource paper, we present DHPLT, an open collection of diachronic corpora in 41 diverse languages. DHPLT is based on the web-crawled HPLT datasets; we use web crawl timestamps as the approximate signal of document creation time. The collection covers three time periods: 2011-2015, 2020-2021 and 2024-present (1 million documents per time period for each language). We additionally provide pre-computed word type and token embeddings and lexical substitutions for our chosen target words, while at the same time leaving it open for the other researchers to come up with their own target words using the same datasets. DHPLT aims at filling in the current lack of multilingual diachronic corpora for semantic change modelling (beyond a dozen of high-resource languages). It opens the way for a variety of new experimental setups in this field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores using LLMs for simplifying cyber security texts like CVE descriptions, finding they struggle with meaning preservation despite appearing simpler.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyber security information is complex and hard for non-experts to understand, necessitating simplification tools like ATS.

Method: The research created a baseline for cyber security ATS and tested 40 CVE descriptions with cyber security experts in two survey rounds.

Result: Out-of-the-box LLMs simplify text appearance but often fail to preserve original meaning.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential for cyber security text simplification but need improvements in meaning preservation.

Abstract: Understanding cyber security is increasingly important for individuals and organizations. However, a lot of information related to cyber security can be difficult to understand to those not familiar with the topic. In this study, we focus on investigating how large language models (LLMs) could be utilized in automatic text simplification (ATS) of Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) descriptions. Automatic text simplification has been studied in several contexts, such as medical, scientific, and news texts, but it has not yet been studied to simplify texts in the rapidly changing and complex domain of cyber security. We created a baseline for cyber security ATS and a test dataset of 40 CVE descriptions, evaluated by two groups of cyber security experts in two survey rounds. We have found that while out-of-the box LLMs can make the text appear simpler, they struggle with meaning preservation.

### [133] [LaCy: What Small Language Models Can and Should Learn is Not Just a Question of Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12005)
*Szilvia Ujváry,Louis Béthune,Pierre Ablin,João Monteiro,Marco Cuturi,Michael Kirchhof*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limited capacity of Small Language Models (SLMs) by introducing LaCy, a pretraining method that helps SLMs decide which tokens to learn and which to delegate via a <CALL> token. It uses a spaCy grammar parser to improve decision-making, reducing factual errors and outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs struggle with factual correctness due to their limited parameter size. The paper explores how to optimize their pretraining to balance learning and delegation, improving accuracy without increasing computational costs.

Method: The authors propose LaCy, a pretraining method that uses a spaCy grammar parser alongside loss signals to decide which tokens SLMs should learn versus delegate via a <CALL> token. This helps prevent factual errors.

Result: LaCy-trained SLMs effectively learn when to predict tokens and when to delegate, achieving higher FactScores and outperforming alternatives like Rho or LLM-judge trained SLMs.

Conclusion: LaCy provides a simpler, cheaper solution for improving SLM performance by optimizing token selection during pretraining, balancing learning and delegation effectively.

Abstract: Language models have consistently grown to compress more world knowledge into their parameters, but the knowledge that can be pretrained into them is upper-bounded by their parameter size. Especially the capacity of Small Language Models (SLMs) is limited, leading to factually incorrect generations. This problem is often mitigated by giving the SLM access to an outside source: the ability to query a larger model, documents, or a database. Under this setting, we study the fundamental question of \emph{which tokens an SLM can and should learn} during pretraining, versus \emph{which ones it should delegate} via a \texttt{<CALL>} token. We find that this is not simply a question of loss: although the loss is predictive of whether a predicted token mismatches the ground-truth, some tokens are \emph{acceptable} in that they are truthful alternative continuations of a pretraining document, and should not trigger a \texttt{<CALL>} even if their loss is high. We find that a spaCy grammar parser can help augment the loss signal to decide which tokens the SLM should learn to delegate to prevent factual errors and which are safe to learn and predict even under high losses. We propose LaCy, a novel pretraining method based on this token selection philosophy. Our experiments demonstrate that LaCy models successfully learn which tokens to predict and where to delegate for help. This results in higher FactScores when generating in a cascade with a bigger model and outperforms Rho or LLM-judge trained SLMs, while being simpler and cheaper.

*Angelo Ziletti,Leonardo D'Ambrosi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLUES is a framework addressing output diversity in clinical Text-to-SQL by distinguishing between input ambiguity and model instability, using semantic uncertainty decomposition for targeted interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to differentiate between input ambiguity (requiring clarification) and model instability (requiring human review) in large language models for clinical Text-to-SQL.

Method: CLUES models Text-to-SQL as a two-stage process (interpretations --> answers) and decomposes semantic uncertainty into ambiguity and instability scores, with the latter computed via Schur complement of a bipartite semantic graph matrix.

Result: CLUES outperforms Kernel Language Entropy in failure prediction, maps uncertainty regimes to interventions, and identifies 51% of errors in high-ambiguity/high-instability queries while covering 25% of queries.

Conclusion: CLUES effectively decomposes uncertainty, enabling targeted interventions and efficient triage in clinical Text-to-SQL applications.

Abstract: Deploying large language models for clinical Text-to-SQL requires distinguishing two qualitatively different causes of output diversity: (i) input ambiguity that should trigger clarification, and (ii) model instability that should trigger human review. We propose CLUES, a framework that models Text-to-SQL as a two-stage process (interpretations --> answers) and decomposes semantic uncertainty into an ambiguity score and an instability score. The instability score is computed via the Schur complement of a bipartite semantic graph matrix. Across AmbigQA/SituatedQA (gold interpretations) and a clinical Text-to-SQL benchmark (known interpretations), CLUES improves failure prediction over state-of-the-art Kernel Language Entropy. In deployment settings, it remains competitive while providing a diagnostic decomposition unavailable from a single score. The resulting uncertainty regimes map to targeted interventions - query refinement for ambiguity, model improvement for instability. The high-ambiguity/high-instability regime contains 51% of errors while covering 25% of queries, enabling efficient triage.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Composition-RL improves RL training by composing multiple verifiable prompts into new questions, enhancing reasoning and cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR relies on large-scale prompts, which are costly and contain uninformative examples. Easy prompts (pass-rate-1) reduce effective data size.

Method: Composition-RL composes multiple prompts into new questions and uses them for RL training, with a curriculum variant increasing compositional depth.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvement in reasoning across model sizes (4B to 30B) and better cross-domain RL.

Conclusion: Composition-RL effectively utilizes limited prompts, boosting performance and enabling cross-domain applications.

Abstract: Large-scale verifiable prompts underpin the success of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), but they contain many uninformative examples and are costly to expand further. Recent studies focus on better exploiting limited training data by prioritizing hard prompts whose rollout pass rate is 0. However, easy prompts with a pass rate of 1 also become increasingly prevalent as training progresses, thereby reducing the effective data size. To mitigate this, we propose Composition-RL, a simple yet useful approach for better utilizing limited verifiable prompts targeting pass-rate-1 prompts. More specifically, Composition-RL automatically composes multiple problems into a new verifiable question and uses these compositional prompts for RL training. Extensive experiments across model sizes from 4B to 30B show that Composition-RL consistently improves reasoning capability over RL trained on the original dataset. Performance can be further boosted with a curriculum variant of Composition-RL that gradually increases compositional depth over training. Additionally, Composition-RL enables more effective cross-domain RL by composing prompts drawn from different domains. Codes, datasets, and models are available at https://github.com/XinXU-USTC/Composition-RL.

TL;DR: DeepSight is an open-source project integrating safety evaluation and diagnosis for Large Models (LMs), addressing gaps in current workflows by linking behavioral risks to root causes and improving alignment without degrading general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LM safety workflows lack integration between evaluation, diagnosis, and alignment, leading to superficial risk identification and misaligned internal mechanisms.

Method: DeepSight includes two toolkits: DeepSafe for evaluation and DeepScan for diagnosis, unifying protocols to connect stages and enable white-box insights.

Result: The project offers a low-cost, reproducible, and scalable solution for safety evaluation and diagnosis, pioneering frontier AI risk assessment.

Conclusion: DeepSight bridges critical gaps in LM safety workflows, enhancing both evaluation and diagnosis while maintaining model capabilities.

Abstract: As the development of Large Models (LMs) progresses rapidly, their safety is also a priority. In current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) safety workflow, evaluation, diagnosis, and alignment are often handled by separate tools. Specifically, safety evaluation can only locate external behavioral risks but cannot figure out internal root causes. Meanwhile, safety diagnosis often drifts from concrete risk scenarios and remains at the explainable level. In this way, safety alignment lack dedicated explanations of changes in internal mechanisms, potentially degrading general capabilities. To systematically address these issues, we propose an open-source project, namely DeepSight, to practice a new safety evaluation-diagnosis integrated paradigm. DeepSight is low-cost, reproducible, efficient, and highly scalable large-scale model safety evaluation project consisting of a evaluation toolkit DeepSafe and a diagnosis toolkit DeepScan. By unifying task and data protocols, we build a connection between the two stages and transform safety evaluation from black-box to white-box insight. Besides, DeepSight is the first open source toolkit that support the frontier AI risk evaluation and joint safety evaluation and diagnosis.

TL;DR: P-GenRM is a Personalized Generative Reward Model that improves personalized alignment of large language models by adapting responses to individual user preferences through test-time user-based scaling and prototype clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized reward models oversimplify user preferences and struggle with generalization to new users. P-GenRM addresses these limitations by creating adaptive personas and scoring rubrics.

Method: P-GenRM transforms preference signals into structured evaluation chains, clusters users into prototypes, and uses dual-granularity scaling (individual and prototype levels) to enhance generalization and mitigate noise.

Result: P-GenRM achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks (2.31% average improvement) and shows strong generalization on out-of-distribution data, with test-time scaling providing an additional 3% boost.

Conclusion: P-GenRM effectively enhances personalized alignment and generalization for large language models, demonstrating scalability and robustness in adapting to diverse user preferences.

Abstract: Personalized alignment of large language models seeks to adapt responses to individual user preferences, typically via reinforcement learning. A key challenge is obtaining accurate, user-specific reward signals in open-ended scenarios. Existing personalized reward models face two persistent limitations: (1) oversimplifying diverse, scenario-specific preferences into a small, fixed set of evaluation principles, and (2) struggling with generalization to new users with limited feedback. To this end, we propose P-GenRM, the first Personalized Generative Reward Model with test-time user-based scaling. P-GenRM transforms preference signals into structured evaluation chains that derive adaptive personas and scoring rubrics across various scenarios. It further clusters users into User Prototypes and introduces a dual-granularity scaling mechanism: at the individual level, it adaptively scales and aggregates each user's scoring scheme; at the prototype level, it incorporates preferences from similar users. This design mitigates noise in inferred preferences and enhances generalization to unseen users through prototype-based transfer. Empirical results show that P-GenRM achieves state-of-the-art results on widely-used personalized reward model benchmarks, with an average improvement of 2.31%, and demonstrates strong generalization on an out-of-distribution dataset. Notably, Test-time User-based scaling provides an additional 3% boost, demonstrating stronger personalized alignment with test-time scalability.

TL;DR: This paper presents a rule-based model for Gaidhlig morphology using Wiktionary data, highlighting its advantages for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support lesser-used languages like Gaidhlig, which lack sufficient data for neural models, by leveraging rule-based systems.

Method: Constructs a rule-based model using Wiktionary data, employs SQL for querying lexical patterns, and creates a declarative rule-base for Python utilities.

Result: Developed a system that derives inflected forms of Gaidhlig words, useful for educational tools and higher-level language tools.

Conclusion: Rule-based systems effectively utilize limited data for low-resource languages and enhance interpretability, adding value to existing Wiktionary data.

Abstract: Language models and software tools are essential to support the continuing vitality of lesser-used languages; however, currently popular neural models require considerable data for training, which normally is not available for such low-resource languages. This paper describes work-in-progress to construct a rule-based model of Gaidhlig morphology using data from Wiktionary, arguing that rule-based systems effectively leverage limited sample data, support greater interpretability, and provide insights useful in the design of teaching materials. The use of SQL for querying the occurrence of different lexical patterns is investigated, and a declarative rule-base is presented that allows Python utilities to derive inflected forms of Gaidhlig words. This functionality could be used to support educational tools that teach or explain language patterns, for example, or to support higher level tools such as rule-based dependency parsers. This approach adds value to the data already present in Wiktionary by adapting it to new use-cases.

TL;DR: WavBench is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate realistic conversational abilities in spoken dialogue models, addressing gaps in current standards with three subsets: Pro, Basic, and Acoustic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for spoken dialogue models lack consideration for audio-centric features like paralinguistics and colloquialisms, and the cognitive depth modern agents require.

Method: WavBench is developed with a tripartite framework: Pro subset for challenging reasoning, Basic subset for colloquialism standards, and Acoustic subset for paralinguistic capabilities.

Result: Evaluations of five state-of-the-art models provide insights into complex problem-solving, colloquial delivery, and paralinguistic fidelity.

Conclusion: WavBench fills a critical gap in benchmarking spoken dialogue models, guiding the development of more robust conversational agents.

Abstract: With the rapid integration of advanced reasoning capabilities into spoken dialogue models, the field urgently demands benchmarks that transcend simple interactions to address real-world complexity. However, current evaluations predominantly adhere to text-generation standards, overlooking the unique audio-centric characteristics of paralinguistics and colloquialisms, alongside the cognitive depth required by modern agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce WavBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate realistic conversational abilities where prior works fall short. Uniquely, WavBench establishes a tripartite framework: 1) Pro subset, designed to rigorously challenge reasoning-enhanced models with significantly increased difficulty; 2) Basic subset, defining a novel standard for spoken colloquialism that prioritizes "listenability" through natural vocabulary, linguistic fluency, and interactive rapport, rather than rigid written accuracy; and 3) Acoustic subset, covering explicit understanding, generation, and implicit dialogue to rigorously evaluate comprehensive paralinguistic capabilities within authentic real-world scenarios. Through evaluating five state-of-the-art models, WavBench offers critical insights into the intersection of complex problem-solving, colloquial delivery, and paralinguistic fidelity, guiding the evolution of robust spoken dialogue models.

Result: CitiLink-Minutes provides structured linkage and FAIR-compliant annotations, enabling tasks like metadata extraction, topic classification, and vote labeling.

Conclusion: The dataset supports downstream NLP and IR tasks while promoting transparency in municipal governance.

Abstract: City councils play a crucial role in local governance, directly influencing citizens' daily lives through decisions made during municipal meetings. These deliberations are formally documented in meeting minutes, which serve as official records of discussions, decisions, and voting outcomes. Despite their importance, municipal meeting records have received little attention in Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), largely due to the lack of annotated datasets, which ultimately limit the development of computational models. To address this gap, we introduce CitiLink-Minutes, a multilayer dataset of 120 European Portuguese municipal meeting minutes from six municipalities. Unlike prior annotated datasets of parliamentary or video records, CitiLink-Minutes provides multilayer annotations and structured linkage of official written minutes. The dataset contains over one million tokens, with all personal identifiers de-identified. Each minute was manually annotated by two trained annotators and curated by an experienced linguist across three complementary dimensions: (1) metadata, (2) subjects of discussion, and (3) voting outcomes, totaling over 38,000 individual annotations. Released under FAIR principles and accompanied by baseline results on metadata extraction, topic classification, and vote labeling, CitiLink-Minutes demonstrates its potential for downstream NLP and IR tasks, while promoting transparent access to municipal decisions.

*Yuqing Li,Jiangnan Li,Mo Yu,Guoxuan Ding,Zheng Lin,Weiping Wang,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A lightweight reranking framework using attention scores from selected heads outperforms existing methods with flexible extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve passage-query relevance estimation by leveraging attention scores and holistic candidate information.

Method: Trains small-scale models (e.g., 4B parameters) using attention scores for listwise reranking, supporting flexible extensions like contextual augmentation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art rerankers across domains and sets a new benchmark on LoCoMo.

Conclusion: The framework is effective, lightweight, and versatile for improving ranking accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Built upon the existing analysis of retrieval heads in large language models, we propose an alternative reranking framework that trains models to estimate passage-query relevance using the attention scores of selected heads. This approach provides a listwise solution that leverages holistic information within the entire candidate shortlist during ranking. At the same time, it naturally produces continuous relevance scores, enabling training on arbitrary retrieval datasets without requiring Likert-scale supervision. Our framework is lightweight and effective, requiring only small-scale models (e.g., 4B parameters) to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art pointwise and listwise rerankers across multiple domains, including Wikipedia and long narrative datasets. It further establishes a new state-of-the-art on the LoCoMo benchmark that assesses the capabilities of dialogue understanding and memory usage. We further demonstrate that our framework supports flexible extensions. For example, augmenting candidate passages with contextual information further improves ranking accuracy, while training attention heads from middle layers enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance.

*Mohamed Huti,Alasdair Mackintosh,Amy Waldock,Dominic Andrews,Maxime Lelièvre,Moritz Boos,Tobias Murray,Paul Atherton,Robin A. A. Ince,Oliver G. B. Garrod*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Visual Reasoning Benchmark (VRB) to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on solving visual problems from early-grade maths, revealing gaps in dynamic spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of AI models in reasoning over spatial and relational structures, especially in visual problems crucial for early-grade maths.

Method: Developed the VRB using 701 questions from primary school exams in Zambia and India, focusing on tasks like analogy, pattern completion, and spatial matching with minimal-text images.

Result: Models excel in static skills (e.g., counting) but struggle with dynamic operations (e.g., folding, reflection), revealing a 'spatial ceiling' and potential risks for classroom use.

Conclusion: VRB highlights the need for education-focused benchmarks to assess the functional limits of multimodal tools in classrooms.

Abstract: AI models have achieved state-of-the-art results in textual reasoning; however, their ability to reason over spatial and relational structures remains a critical bottleneck -- particularly in early-grade maths, which relies heavily on visuals. This paper introduces the visual reasoning benchmark (VRB), a novel dataset designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to solve authentic visual problems from classrooms. This benchmark is built on a set of 701 questions sourced from primary school examinations in Zambia and India, which cover a range of tasks such as reasoning by analogy, pattern completion, and spatial matching. We outline the methodology and development of the benchmark which intentionally uses unedited, minimal-text images to test if models can meet realistic needs of primary education. Our findings reveal a ``jagged frontier'' of capability where models demonstrate better proficiency in static skills such as counting and scaling, but reach a distinct ``spatial ceiling'' when faced with dynamic operations like folding, reflection, and rotation. These weaknesses pose a risk for classroom use on visual reasoning problems, with the potential for incorrect marking, false scaffolding, and reinforcing student misconceptions. Consequently, education-focused benchmarks like the VRB are essential for determining the functional boundaries of multimodal tools used in classrooms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ExStrucTiny, a benchmark dataset for structured information extraction from document images, addressing gaps in existing datasets by covering diverse document types and extraction scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for document understanding tasks like Key Entity Extraction (KEE), Relation Extraction (RE), and Visual Question Answering (VQA) are limited by narrow ontologies and homogeneous document types, lacking adaptability for structured extraction.

Method: The authors developed ExStrucTiny using a pipeline that combines manual and synthetic human-validated samples to create a diverse benchmark dataset. They evaluated open and closed Vision Language Models (VLMs) on this dataset.

Result: The study identifies challenges like schema adaptation, query under-specification, and answer localization when applying VLMs to structured information extraction tasks.

Conclusion: ExStrucTiny serves as a foundation for enhancing generalist models' capabilities in structured information extraction from documents, addressing real-world complexities.

Abstract: Enterprise documents, such as forms and reports, embed critical information for downstream applications like data archiving, automated workflows, and analytics. Although generalist Vision Language Models (VLMs) perform well on established document understanding benchmarks, their ability to conduct holistic, fine-grained structured extraction across diverse document types and flexible schemas is not well studied. Existing Key Entity Extraction (KEE), Relation Extraction (RE), and Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets are limited by narrow entity ontologies, simple queries, or homogeneous document types, often overlooking the need for adaptable and structured extraction. To address these gaps, we introduce ExStrucTiny, a new benchmark dataset for structured Information Extraction (IE) from document images, unifying aspects of KEE, RE, and VQA. Built through a novel pipeline combining manual and synthetic human-validated samples, ExStrucTiny covers more varied document types and extraction scenarios. We analyze open and closed VLMs on this benchmark, highlighting challenges such as schema adaptation, query under-specification, and answer localization. We hope our work provides a bedrock for improving generalist models for structured IE in documents.

*Julia Belikova,Danila Rozhevskii,Dennis Svirin,Konstantin Polev,Alexander Panchenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in long-context processing for LLMs, introduces 'token overflow,' and proposes methods to detect it using saturation statistics and probing classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient long-context processing is vital for LLMs, especially in resource-limited settings, but current compression methods risk erasing task-relevant content.

Method: Proposes defining 'token overflow' and introduces saturation statistics and probing classifiers to detect it in xRAG soft-compression settings.

Result: Saturation statistics separate compressed tokens but lack overflow detection. Probing classifiers achieve 0.72 AUC-ROC on HotpotQA, SQuADv2, and TriviaQA.

Conclusion: Query-aware detectors outperform query-independent methods, offering low-cost pre-LLM gating to reduce compression errors.

Abstract: Efficient long-context processing remains a crucial challenge for contemporary large language models (LLMs), especially in resource-constrained environments. Soft compression architectures promise to extend effective context length by replacing long token sequences with smaller sets of learned compressed tokens. Yet, the limits of compressibility -- and when compression begins to erase task-relevant content -- remain underexplored. In this paper, we define \emph{token overflow} as a regime in which compressed representations no longer contain sufficient information to answer a given query, and propose a methodology to characterize and detect it. In the xRAG soft-compression setting, we find that query-agnostic saturation statistics reliably separate compressed from uncompressed token representations, providing a practical tool for identifying compressed tokens but showing limited overflow detection capability. Lightweight probing classifiers over both query and context xRAG representations detect overflow with 0.72 AUC-ROC on average on HotpotQA, SQuADv2, and TriviaQA datasets, demonstrating that incorporating query information improves detection performance. These results advance from query-independent diagnostics to query-aware detectors, enabling low-cost pre-LLM gating to mitigate compression-induced errors.

*Manjunath Kudlur,Evan King,James Wang,Pete Warden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Moonshine v2 introduces sliding-window self-attention for low-latency, high-accuracy ASR on edge devices, outperforming larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for low-latency and high-accuracy ASR in latency-critical speech applications on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Uses sliding-window self-attention in an ergodic streaming-encoder ASR model to achieve bounded, low-latency inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art word error rates, matching accuracy of models 6x larger while running faster.

Conclusion: Local attention rivals full attention's accuracy with lower size and latency, enabling better interactive speech interfaces on edge devices.

Abstract: Latency-critical speech applications (e.g., live transcription, voice commands, and real-time translation) demand low time-to-first-token (TTFT) and high transcription accuracy, particularly on resource-constrained edge devices. Full-attention Transformer encoders remain a strong accuracy baseline for automatic speech recognition (ASR) because every frame can directly attend to every other frame, which resolves otherwise locally ambiguous acoustics using distant lexical context. However, this global dependency incurs quadratic complexity in sequence length, inducing an inherent "encode-the-whole-utterance" latency profile. For streaming use cases, this causes TTFT to grow linearly with utterance length as the encoder must process the entire prefix before any decoder token can be emitted. To better meet the needs of on-device, streaming ASR use cases we introduce Moonshine v2, an ergodic streaming-encoder ASR model that employs sliding-window self-attention to achieve bounded, low-latency inference while preserving strong local context. Our models achieve state of the art word error rates across standard benchmarks, attaining accuracy on-par with models 6x their size while running significantly faster. These results demonstrate that carefully designed local attention is competitive with the accuracy of full attention at a fraction of the size and latency cost, opening new possibilities for interactive speech interfaces on edge devices.

Motivation: To enhance domain-specific AI literacy among L&T stakeholders by teaching foundational AI concepts in an accessible manner.

Method: Developed a curriculum covering key AI topics (vector embeddings, neural networks, tokenization, transformers) and tested it in an MA course.

Result: The curriculum proved didactically effective but needed higher-level scaffolding (e.g., lecturer support) for optimal learning.

Conclusion: The curriculum fosters AI literacy but requires supplementary support structures to maximize its impact.

Abstract: This paper presents a technical curriculum on language-oriented artificial intelligence (AI) in the language and translation (L&T) industry. The curriculum aims to foster domain-specific technical AI literacy among stakeholders in the fields of translation and specialised communication by exposing them to the conceptual and technical/algorithmic foundations of modern language-oriented AI in an accessible way. The core curriculum focuses on 1) vector embeddings, 2) the technical foundations of neural networks, 3) tokenization and 4) transformer neural networks. It is intended to help users develop computational thinking as well as algorithmic awareness and algorithmic agency, ultimately contributing to their digital resilience in AI-driven work environments. The didactic suitability of the curriculum was tested in an AI-focused MA course at the Institute of Translation and Multilingual Communication at TH Koeln. Results suggest the didactic effectiveness of the curriculum, but participant feedback indicates that it should be embedded into higher-level didactic scaffolding - e.g., in the form of lecturer support - in order to enable optimal learning conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A self-distillation framework improves few-step decoding efficiency in DLLMs without significant quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inference efficiency bottleneck in DLLMs caused by many refinement steps, aiming to maintain generation quality with fewer steps.

Method: Introduce trajectory self-distillation with Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO) to focus on high-probability teacher modes.

Result: Outperforms baselines in few-step decoding, narrowing the gap with full-step decoding.

Conclusion: Proposed method enhances practical few-step DLLMs, offering a balance between efficiency and quality.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (DLLMs) have the potential to enable fast text generation by decoding multiple tokens in parallel. However, in practice, their inference efficiency is constrained by the need for many refinement steps, while aggressively reducing the number of steps leads to a substantial degradation in generation quality. To alleviate this, we propose a trajectory self-distillation framework that improves few-step decoding by distilling the model's own generative trajectories. We incorporate Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO), a reverse-KL objective that promotes mode-seeking distillation and encourages the student to concentrate on high-probability teacher modes. Across benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms strong few-step baselines and standard training under tight step budgets. Although full-step decoding remains superior, we substantially narrow the gap, establishing a strong foundation towards practical few-step DLLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/Tyrion58/T3D.

TL;DR: OPCD bridges on-policy distillation with context distillation, training student models on self-generated trajectories to outperform baseline methods in applications like experiential knowledge distillation and system prompt distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable language models to internalize in-context knowledge effectively and improve task accuracy while preserving out-of-distribution capabilities.

Method: OPCD trains a student model on its own generated trajectories, minimizing reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence against a context-conditioned teacher.

Result: OPCD consistently outperforms baselines in mathematical reasoning, text-based games, and domain-specific tasks, and enables effective cross-size distillation.

Conclusion: OPCD is effective for internalizing experiential knowledge and beneficial behaviors, achieving higher accuracy and better generalization.

Abstract: Context distillation enables language models to internalize in-context knowledge into their parameters. In our work, we propose On-Policy Context Distillation (OPCD), a framework that bridges on-policy distillation with context distillation by training a student model on its own generated trajectories while minimizing reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence against a context-conditioned teacher. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OPCD on two important applications: experiential knowledge distillation, where models extract and consolidate transferable knowledge from their historical solution traces, and system prompt distillation, where models internalize beneficial behaviors encoded in optimized prompts. Across mathematical reasoning, text-based games, and domain-specific tasks, OPCD consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher task accuracy while better preserving out-of-distribution capabilities. We further show that OPCD enables effective cross-size distillation, where smaller student models can internalize experiential knowledge from larger teachers.

*Ayhan Alp Aydeniz,Robert Loftin,Kagan Tumer*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: CCL rewards improve multiagent exploration by isolating each agent's unique contribution, speeding up learning in sparse-reward tasks requiring tight coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address redundancy in multiagent exploration by ensuring agents contribute uniquely to team exploration, crucial in domains like search and rescue.

Method: Introduce Counterfactual Conditional Likelihood (CCL) rewards to score agents' unique contributions to joint exploration, unlike prior novelty-based rewards.

Result: CCL accelerates learning in sparse-reward domains and excels in tasks needing tight coordination among agents.

Conclusion: CCL rewards enhance multiagent exploration efficiency by focusing on informative joint observations, outperforming individual novelty-based methods.

Abstract: Efficient exploration is critical for multiagent systems to discover coordinated strategies, particularly in open-ended domains such as search and rescue or planetary surveying. However, when exploration is encouraged only at the individual agent level, it often leads to redundancy, as agents act without awareness of how their teammates are exploring. In this work, we introduce Counterfactual Conditional Likelihood (CCL) rewards, which score each agent's exploration by isolating its unique contribution to team exploration. Unlike prior methods that reward agents solely for the novelty of their individual observations, CCL emphasizes observations that are informative with respect to the joint exploration of the team. Experiments in continuous multiagent domains show that CCL rewards accelerate learning for domains with sparse team rewards, where most joint actions yield zero rewards, and are particularly effective in tasks that require tight coordination among agents.

TL;DR: Summary


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand cooperation and coordination in LLM-based multi-agent systems under real-world constraints.

Method: Proposes FLCOA framework, introduces Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma with Communication Delay, and simulates LLM agents.

Result: Communication delay leads to exploitation, with excessive delay reducing exploitation cycles (U-shaped relationship).

Conclusion: Cooperation in MAS depends on both high-level design and lower-layer factors like communication delay.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS), in which autonomous AI agents cooperate to solve tasks, are gaining increasing attention. For such systems to be deployed in society, agents must be able to establish cooperation and coordination under real-world computational and communication constraints. We propose the FLCOA framework (Five Layers for Cooperation/Coordination among Autonomous Agents) to conceptualize how cooperation and coordination emerge in groups of autonomous agents, and highlight that the influence of lower-layer factors - especially computational and communication resources - has been largely overlooked. To examine the effect of communication delay, we introduce a Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma with Communication Delay and conduct simulations with LLM-based agents. As delay increases, agents begin to exploit slower responses even without explicit instructions. Interestingly, excessive delay reduces cycles of exploitation, yielding a U-shaped relationship between delay magnitude and mutual cooperation. These results suggest that fostering cooperation requires attention not only to high-level institutional design but also to lower-layer factors such as communication delay and resource allocation, pointing to new directions for MAS research.

Abstract: We describe a multi-agent perimeter defense game played on a cylinder. A team of n slow-moving defenders must prevent a single fast-moving attacker from crossing the boundary of a defensive perimeter. We describe the conditions necessary for the attacker to win in the special case that the intruder starts close to the boundary and in a region that is currently defended.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing epidemic simulation tools lack the ability to handle complex dynamics while being computationally practical and interpretable, as highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Method: DEpiABS integrates individual-level heterogeneity and epidemic processes, uses gradient-based parameter calibration, and scales simulations efficiently via a z-score method.

Result: DEpiABS reduces forecasting deviations significantly (e.g., COVID-19 mortality from 0.97 to 0.92) and validates well across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: DEpiABS offers a reliable, generalizable, and data-efficient framework for epidemic modelling, outperforming existing tools.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the limitations of existing epidemic simulation tools. These tools provide information that guides non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), yet many struggle to capture complex dynamics while remaining computationally practical and interpretable. We introduce DEpiABS, a scalable, differentiable agent-based model (DABM) that balances mechanistic detail, computational efficiency and interpretability. DEpiABS captures individual-level heterogeneity in health status, behaviour, and resource constraints, while also modelling epidemic processes like viral mutation and reinfection dynamics. The model is fully differentiable, enabling fast simulation and gradient-based parameter calibration. Building on this foundation, we introduce a z-score-based scaling method that maps small-scale simulations to any real-world population sizes with negligible loss in output granularity, reducing the computational burden when modelling large populations. We validate DEpiABS through sensitivity analysis and calibration to COVID-19 and flu data from ten regions of varying scales. Compared to the baseline, DEpiABS is more detailed, fully interpretable, and has reduced the average normal deviation in forecasting from 0.97 to 0.92 on COVID-19 mortality data and from 0.41 to 0.32 on influenza-like-illness data. Critically, these improvements are achieved without relying on auxiliary data, making DEpiABS a reliable, generalisable, and data-efficient framework for future epidemic response modelling.

Motivation: Scalable and federated methods are needed for multi-robot systems to model complex environments efficiently.

Method: The pxpGP framework uses sparse variational inference and a consensus ADMM method with adaptive updates.

Result: pxpGP and its decentralized variant outperform existing methods in hyperparameter estimation and accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for large-scale multi-robot networks.

Abstract: Multi-robot systems require scalable and federated methods to model complex environments under computational and communication constraints. Gaussian Processes (GPs) offer robust probabilistic modeling, but suffer from cubic computational complexity, limiting their applicability in large-scale deployments. To address this challenge, we introduce the pxpGP, a novel distributed GP framework tailored for both centralized and decentralized large-scale multi-robot networks. Our approach leverages sparse variational inference to generate a local compact pseudo-representation. We introduce a sparse variational optimization scheme that bounds local pseudo-datasets and formulate a global scaled proximal-inexact consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with adaptive parameter updates and warm-start initialization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that pxpGP and its decentralized variant, dec-pxpGP, outperform existing distributed GP methods in hyperparameter estimation and prediction accuracy, particularly in large-scale networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity and underutilization of high-quality training data limit post-training effectiveness for LLMs in automated optimization modeling. Error profiling reveals sparsity of error-specific problems and sparse rewards as key limitations.

Method: MIND customizes training from data synthesis to post-training, focusing on localizable error patterns. It employs Dynamic Supervised Fine-Tuning Policy Optimization (DFPO) for localized refinement.

Result: MIND outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on six benchmarks.

Conclusion: MIND addresses fundamental limitations in automated optimization modeling by leveraging localized error-driven learning and dynamic fine-tuning, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Automated optimization modeling via Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to assist complex human decision-making. While post-training has become a pivotal technique to enhance LLMs' capabilities in this domain, its effectiveness is severely constrained by the scarcity and underutilization of high-quality training data. However, through a detailed profiling of error patterns across various problem-response pairs drawn from post-training, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing automated optimization modeling approaches: (L1) the sparsity of error-specific problems and (L2) the sparse rewards associated with difficult problems. We demonstrate that these limitations can result in suboptimal performance in domain-specific post-training for LLMs. To tackle the above two limitations, we propose a novel error-driven learning framework -- namely, auto\textbf{m}ated opt\textbf{i}mization modeli\textbf{n}g via a localizable error-\textbf{d}riven perspective (MIND) -- that customizes the whole model training framework from data synthesis to post-training. MIND is based on our key observation of the unique localizable patterns in error propagation of optimization modelings, that is, modeling errors may remain localized to specific semantic segments and do not propagate throughout the entire solution. Thus, in contrast to holistic reasoning tasks such as mathematical proofs, MIND leverages the construction of a focused, high-density training corpus and proposes \textbf{D}ynamic Supervised \textbf{F}ine-Tuning \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (DFPO) to tackle difficult problems through localized refinement. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that MIND consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art automated optimization modeling approaches.

TL;DR: KBVQ-MoE enhances ultra-low-bit quantization for MoE LLMs by eliminating redundant representations and correcting output bias, achieving near-baseline accuracy with 3-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models face deployment challenges due to large parameter sizes and memory demands. Direct VQ application to MoEs causes performance degradation from redundant representations and output bias.

Method: KBVQ-MoE uses KLT-guided SVD for redundancy elimination and channel-wise affine compensation for bias correction, focusing on expert-specific representations.

Result: KBVQ-MoE achieves 67.99 accuracy with 3-bit quantization on Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, nearly matching the FP16 baseline (68.07).

Conclusion: KBVQ-MoE effectively addresses VQ challenges in MoE LLMs, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have achieved great success by significantly improving performance while maintaining computational efficiency through sparse expert activation. However, their enormous parameter sizes and memory demands pose major challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Vector Quantization (VQ) offers a promising approach for ultra-low-bit compression in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging a codebook, where weight vectors are mapped to the most similar discrete codewords. Yet, directly applying VQ to MoEs often leads to substantial performance degradation due to two critical obstacles: (1) redundant representations among experts cause VQ to repeatedly quantize similar representations for each expert, resulting in inefficient use of limited codebook capacity; and (2) cumulative output bias is amplified by expert aggregation in MoE layers, leading to distributional shifts in the quantized outputs. To address these issues, we propose KBVQ-MoE, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit quantization for MoE-based LLMs. KBVQ-MoE integrates two techniques: (1) input-driven redundancy elimination, where a Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) guided singular value decomposition (SVD) extracts dominant weight components and shares them across experts; and (2) bias-corrected output stabilization, where vector quantization is applied only to expert-specific (non-redundant) representations and the quantized outputs are corrected via channel-wise affine compensation. Experiments on various MoE LLMs demonstrate that KBVQ-MoE preserves accuracy substantially better than existing quantization methods. For example, 3-bit quantization of Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B achieves an average accuracy of 67.99, nearly identical to the FP16 baseline of 68.07, underscoring KBVQ-MoE's potential for efficient deployment on edge devices and other resource-constrained platforms.

TL;DR: Spectra optimizer addresses anisotropic gradients in LLMs by suppressing dominant spectral directions, improving training speed, memory efficiency, and accuracy compared to AdamW and Muon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient signals in LLM training are highly anisotropic, with dominant spectral directions suppressing tail learning. This imbalance prompted the development of Spectra to optimize training dynamics.

Method: Spectra tracks the dominant spike subspace using cached, warm-started power iteration and applies low-rank spectral shaping to balance gradient updates without amplifying noise-sensitive tails.

Result: Spectra trains LLaMA3 8B 30% faster than AdamW, reduces optimizer state memory by 49.25%, improves downstream accuracy by 1.62%, and outperforms Muon in speed and accuracy.

Conclusion: Spectra effectively balances gradient learning by targeting dominant spectral directions, offering significant improvements in training efficiency and model performance.

Abstract: Gradient signals in LLM training are highly anisotropic: recurrent linguistic structure concentrates energy into a small set of dominant spectral directions, while context specific information resides in a long tail. We show that this spike tail separation persists throughout training, with the spike occupying only about 1.5% of directions yet dominating optimizer statistics. This dominance suppresses tail learning by contracting tail updates through second moment normalization and tightening the globally stable learning rate bound. Motivated by this analysis, we propose Spectra, a spike aware optimizer that suppresses the dominant low rank spike subspace without amplifying the noise sensitive spectral tail. Spectra tracks the spike subspace via cached, warm started power iteration and applies low rank spectral shaping with negligible overhead and substantially reduced optimizer state memory. On LLaMA3 8B trained on 50B tokens, Spectra reaches the same target loss 30% faster than AdamW, reduces per step end to end overhead by 0.7%, cuts optimizer state memory by 49.25%, and improves average downstream accuracy by 1.62%. Compared to Muon, Spectra is 5.1x faster in optimizer processing time, achieves a lower final loss, and improves average accuracy by 0.66%.

### [157] [GAC-KAN: An Ultra-Lightweight GNSS Interference Classifier for GenAI-Powered Consumer Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11186)
*Zhihan Zeng,Kaihe Wang,Zhongpei Zhang,Yue Xiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GAC-KAN, a lightweight framework for GNSS signal protection in GenAI-powered CE, addressing data scarcity and computational efficiency using synthetic datasets and optimized neural architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of GenAI in CE creates computational burdens, leaving limited resources for security tasks like GNSS signal protection, compounded by scarce real-world interference data.

Method: Proposes GAC-KAN: (1) physics-guided simulation for synthetic jamming datasets, (2) MS-GAC backbone combining ACB and Ghost modules for efficiency, (3) KAN replacing MLP for better non-linear mapping with fewer parameters.

Result: GAC-KAN achieves 98.0% accuracy with only 0.13M parameters, outperforming baselines like ViT by 660x in parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: GAC-KAN excels as a lightweight, 'always-on' security solution for GNSS protection in GenAI-native devices, avoiding computational conflicts with primary AI tasks.

Abstract: The integration of Generative AI (GenAI) into Consumer Electronics (CE)--from AI-powered assistants in wearables to generative planning in autonomous Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)--has revolutionized user experiences. However, these GenAI applications impose immense computational burdens on edge hardware, leaving strictly limited resources for fundamental security tasks like Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal protection. Furthermore, training robust classifiers for such devices is hindered by the scarcity of real-world interference data. To address the dual challenges of data scarcity and the extreme efficiency required by the GenAI era, this paper proposes a novel framework named GAC-KAN. First, we adopt a physics-guided simulation approach to synthesize a large-scale, high-fidelity jamming dataset, mitigating the data bottleneck. Second, to reconcile high accuracy with the stringent resource constraints of GenAI-native chips, we design a Multi-Scale Ghost-ACB-Coordinate (MS-GAC) backbone. This backbone combines Asymmetric Convolution Blocks (ACB) and Ghost modules to extract rich spectral-temporal features with minimal redundancy. Replacing the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) decision head, we introduce a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), which employs learnable spline activation functions to achieve superior non-linear mapping capabilities with significantly fewer parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that GAC-KAN achieves an overall accuracy of 98.0\%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Significantly, the model contains only 0.13 million parameter--approximately 660 times fewer than Vision Transformer (ViT) baselines. This extreme lightweight characteristic makes GAC-KAN an ideal "always-on" security companion, ensuring GNSS reliability without contending for the computational resources required by primary GenAI tasks.

### [158] [TDPNavigator-Placer: Thermal- and Wirelength-Aware Chiplet Placement in 2.5D Systems Through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11187)
*Yubo Hou,Furen Zhuang,Partha Pratim Kundu,Sezin Ata Kircali,Jie Wang,Mihai Dragos Rotaru,Dutta Rahul,Ashish James*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, TDPNavigator-Placer, is proposed for optimized chiplet placement in 2.5D circuits, balancing wirelength and thermal management more effectively than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current chiplet placement methods struggle with competing design requirements like wirelength reduction and thermal management, limiting practical deployment.

Method: The paper introduces TDPNavigator-Placer, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that dynamically optimizes placement using specialized agents for conflicting objectives like wirelength and thermal design power.

Result: Experiments show TDPNavigator-Placer outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a better Pareto front for trade-offs between wirelength and thermal performance.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses inherent conflicts in chiplet placement, providing balanced solutions for practical 2.5D circuit designs.

Abstract: The rapid growth of electronics has accelerated the adoption of 2.5D integrated circuits, where effective automated chiplet placement is essential as systems scale to larger and more heterogeneous chiplet assemblies. Existing placement methods typically focus on minimizing wirelength or transforming multi-objective optimization into a single objective through weighted sum, which limits their ability to handle competing design requirements. Wirelength reduction and thermal management are inherently conflicting objectives, making prior approaches inadequate for practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose TDPNavigator-Placer, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that dynamically optimizes placement based on chiplet's thermal design power (TDP). This approach explicitly assigns these inherently conflicting objectives to specialized agents, each operating under distinct reward mechanisms and environmental constraints within a unified placement paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that TDPNavigator-Placer delivers a significantly improved Pareto front over state-of-the-art methods, enabling more balanced trade-offs between wirelength and thermal performance.

### [159] [MELINOE: Fine-Tuning Enables Memory-Efficient Inference for Mixture-of-Experts Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11192)
*Arian Raje,Anupam Nayak,Gauri Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MELINOE fine-tunes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models to activate fewer experts per sequence, reducing CPU-GPU transfer overhead and improving throughput by up to 14.7× while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models reduce activated parameters per token but face memory bottlenecks due to large overall parameter counts, hindering use in resource-constrained settings. Prior methods struggle with I/O latency from expert transfer.

Method: MELINOE fine-tunes MoE models to prefer fewer activated experts per sequence, caching these preferred experts in GPU memory to minimize transfer overhead.

Result: MELINOE achieves 1.2-3× throughput over efficient baselines and up to 14.7× over transfer-heavy baselines, maintaining or improving downstream task performance.

Conclusion: MELINOE effectively addresses MoE inference efficiency by reducing expert churn and transfer latency, making it a reliable solution for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model architectures can significantly reduce the number of activated parameters per token, enabling computationally efficient training and inference. However, their large overall parameter counts and model sizes have precluded their widespread usage in resource-constrained settings as all of the parameters must still be loaded into GPU memory. Prior works aim to address this memory bottleneck by offloading certain experts into CPU memory and porting them to GPU memory only when they are activated. In practice, these methods suffer from the significant I/O latency incurred by expert transfer. We present MELINOE, a method that fine-tunes an MoE model to more strongly prefer activating a smaller number of experts per sequence. Caching these preferred experts in GPU memory reduces expert churn and CPU-GPU transfer overhead. MELINOE increases throughput by $1.2-3\times$ over efficient baselines and up to $14.7\times$ over transfer-heavy baselines while retaining or even improving the performance of the model on a downstream task, making it a reliable method for improving MoE inference efficiency.

### [160] [Predicting the post-wildfire mudflow onset using machine learning models on multi-parameter experimental data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11194)
*Mahta Movasat,Ingrid Tomac*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study uses ML techniques to analyze post-wildfire mudflows, focusing on soil hydrophobicity and erosion caused by varying rain intensities and slopes. ML models predict discharge and classify failure outcomes, with fine sand being highly susceptible to erosion under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildfires increase soil hydrophobicity, leading to hazardous debris flows. Understanding the conditions triggering these flows is crucial for hazard assessment and emergency planning.

Method: Applied ML algorithms (MLR, LR, SVC, K-means, PCA) to experimental data from sloped flumes simulating field conditions, analyzing rain intensity, slope, and soil properties.

Result: MLR predicted discharge well; LR and SVC classified failures accurately. Fine sand erodes easily under low-intensity, long-duration rain. First 10 minutes of high-intensity rain are critical.

Conclusion: ML effectively models post-wildfire debris flows, aiding hazard assessment and emergency response by identifying critical conditions.

Abstract: Post-wildfire mudflows are increasingly hazardous due to the prevalence of wildfires, including those on the wildland-urban interface. Upon burning, soil on the surface or immediately beneath becomes hydrophobic, a phenomenon that occurs predominantly on sand-based hillslopes. Rainwater and eroded soil blanket the downslope, leading to catastrophic debris flows. Soil hydrophobicity enhances erosion, resulting in post-wildfire debris flows that differ from natural mudflows in intensity, duration, and destructiveness. Thus, it is crucial to understand the timing and conditions of debris-flow onset, driven by the coupled effects of critical parameters: varying rain intensities (RI), slope gradients, water-entry values, and grain sizes (D50). Machine Learning (ML) techniques have become increasingly valuable in geotechnical engineering due to their ability to model complex systems without predefined assumptions. This study applies multiple ML algorithms: multiple linear regression (MLR), logistic regression (LR), support vector classifier (SVC), K-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to predict and classify outcomes from laboratory experiments that model field conditions using a rain device on various soils in sloped flumes. While MLR effectively predicted total discharge, erosion predictions were less accurate, especially for coarse sand. LR and SVC achieved good accuracy in classifying failure outcomes, supported by clustering and dimensionality reduction. Sensitivity analysis revealed that fine sand is highly susceptible to erosion, particularly under low-intensity, long-duration rainfall. Results also show that the first 10 minutes of high-intensity rain are most critical for discharge and failure. These findings highlight the potential of ML for post-wildfire hazard assessment and emergency response planning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable ambient intelligence using WiFi infrastructure without needing extensive labeled data.

Method: Pre-trained on 9.2M unlabeled CSI samples using contrastive learning, masked reconstruction, and physics-informed objectives.

Conclusion: Foundation models like AM-FM can unlock WiFi's potential for scalable ambient intelligence.

Abstract: Ambient intelligence, continuously understanding human presence, activity, and physiology in physical spaces, is fundamental to smart environments, health monitoring, and human-computer interaction. WiFi infrastructure provides a ubiquitous, always-on, privacy-preserving substrate for this capability across billions of IoT devices. Yet this potential remains largely untapped, as wireless sensing has typically relied on task-specific models that require substantial labeled data and limit practical deployment. We present AM-FM, the first foundation model for ambient intelligence and sensing through WiFi. AM-FM is pre-trained on 9.2 million unlabeled Channel State Information (CSI) samples collected over 439 days from 20 commercial device types deployed worldwide, learning general-purpose representations via contrastive learning, masked reconstruction, and physics-informed objectives tailored to wireless signals. Evaluated on public benchmarks spanning nine downstream tasks, AM-FM shows strong cross-task performance with improved data efficiency, demonstrating that foundation models can enable scalable ambient intelligence using existing wireless infrastructure.

*Zhuxin Lei,Ziyuan Yang,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZePAD is a dual-branch defense method designed to protect SSL pre-trained encoders from DAEs without compromising benign performance, requiring only a single tuning for diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses against DAEs rely on task-specific adversarial fine-tuning, which limits generalizability and harms benign performance. ZePAD aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: ZePAD employs a dual-branch structure: MPAE-Branch for adversarial resistance and BMP-Branch to preserve benign performance. It detects DAEs via branch confidence.

Result: ZePAD achieves persistent robustness across tasks, improving benign performance by 29.20% and adversarial robustness by 73.86% in some cases.

Conclusion: ZePAD provides a zero-sacrifice solution for defending against DAEs in SSL encoders, validated by extensive experiments on 11 SSL methods and 6 datasets.

Abstract: The widespread use of publicly available pre-trained encoders from self-supervised learning (SSL) has exposed a critical vulnerability: their susceptibility to downstream-agnostic adversarial examples (DAEs), which are crafted without knowledge of the downstream tasks but capable of misleading downstream models. While several defense methods have been explored recently, they rely primarily on task-specific adversarial fine-tuning, which inevitably limits generalizability and causes catastrophic forgetting and deteriorates benign performance. Different with previous works, we propose a more rigorous defense goal that requires only a single tuning for diverse downstream tasks to defend against DAEs and preserve benign performance. To achieve this defense goal, we introduce Zero-Sacrifice Persistent-Robustness Adversarial Defense (ZePAD), which is inspired by the inherent sensitivity of neural networks to data characteristics. Specifically, ZePAD is a dual-branch structure, which consists of a Multi-Pattern Adversarial Enhancement Branch (MPAE-Branch) that uses two adversarially fine-tuned encoders to strengthen adversarial resistance. The Benign Memory Preservation Branch (BMP-Branch) is trained on local data to ensure adversarial robustness does not compromise benign performance. Surprisingly, we find that ZePAD can directly detect DAEs by evaluating branch confidence, without introducing any adversarial exsample identification task during training. Notably, by enriching feature diversity, our method enables a single adversarial fine-tuning to defend against DAEs across downstream tasks, thereby achieving persistent robustness. Extensive experiments on 11 SSL methods and 6 datasets validate its effectiveness. In certain cases, it achieves a 29.20% improvement in benign performance and a 73.86% gain in adversarial robustness, highlighting its zero-sacrifice property.

*Jose Marie Antonio Miñoza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UltraLIF is a novel framework replacing surrogate gradients in SNNs with ultradiscretization, offering fully differentiable training and improved performance on neuromorphic and temporal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs are energy-efficient and biologically plausible but hindered by non-differentiable spike generation, requiring surrogate gradients. UltraLIF addresses this with a principled, mathematically grounded approach.

Method: UltraLIF uses ultradiscretization from tropical geometry to model neural threshold dynamics, deriving two neuron models (UltraLIF and UltraDLIF) from LIF and diffusion equations for differentiable SNN training.

Result: Experiments on six benchmarks show UltraLIF outperforms surrogate gradient baselines, particularly in single-timestep neuromorphic and temporal tasks, with optional sparsity reducing energy usage.

Conclusion: UltraLIF provides a robust, differentiable framework for SNNs, improving performance and enabling energy-efficient solutions while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer energy-efficient, biologically plausible computation but suffer from non-differentiable spike generation, necessitating reliance on heuristic surrogate gradients. This paper introduces UltraLIF, a principled framework that replaces surrogate gradients with ultradiscretization, a mathematical formalism from tropical geometry providing continuous relaxations of discrete dynamics. The central insight is that the max-plus semiring underlying ultradiscretization naturally models neural threshold dynamics: the log-sum-exp function serves as a differentiable soft-maximum that converges to hard thresholding as a learnable temperature parameter $\eps \to 0$. Two neuron models are derived from distinct dynamical systems: UltraLIF from the LIF ordinary differential equation (temporal dynamics) and UltraDLIF from the diffusion equation modeling gap junction coupling across neuronal populations (spatial dynamics). Both yield fully differentiable SNNs trainable via standard backpropagation with no forward-backward mismatch. Theoretical analysis establishes pointwise convergence to classical LIF dynamics with quantitative error bounds and bounded non-vanishing gradients. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning static images, neuromorphic vision, and audio demonstrate improvements over surrogate gradient baselines, with gains most pronounced in single-timestep ($T{=}1$) settings on neuromorphic and temporal datasets. An optional sparsity penalty enables significant energy reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy.

TL;DR: APT is a neural operator combining graph-based local feature extraction and global attention to efficiently simulate subsurface systems, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing high computational costs and challenges in simulating heterogeneous subsurface systems due to geological complexity and varied physical processes.

Method: APT integrates a graph-based encoder for local features and a global attention mechanism for long-range impacts, working across geometry, mesh, and physics types.

Result: APT excels in subsurface tasks on irregular and regular grids, supports adaptive mesh refinement, and enables cross-dataset learning.

Conclusion: APT is a scalable backbone for large-scale subsurface models, offering robust performance and learning adaptability.

Abstract: The Earth's subsurface is a cornerstone of modern society, providing essential energy resources like hydrocarbons, geothermal, and minerals while serving as the primary reservoir for $CO_2$ sequestration. However, full physics numerical simulations of these systems are notoriously computationally expensive due to geological heterogeneity, high resolution requirements, and the tight coupling of physical processes with distinct propagation time scales. Here we propose the \textbf{Adaptive Physics Transformer} (APT), a geometry-, mesh-, and physics-agnostic neural operator that explicitly addresses these challenges. APT fuses a graph-based encoder to extract high-resolution local heterogeneous features with a global attention mechanism to resolve long-range physical impacts. Our results demonstrate that APT outperforms state-of-the-art architectures in subsurface tasks across both regular and irregular grids with robust super-resolution capabilities. Notably, APT is the first architecture that directly learns from adaptive mesh refinement simulations. We also demonstrate APT's capability for cross-dataset learning, positioning it as a robust and scalable backbone for large-scale subsurface foundation model development.

TL;DR: Elastic Memory, a novel memory architecture for Transformers, outperforms baselines on long-context tasks with efficient online compression and flexible retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the quadratic bottleneck and scalability trade-offs in Transformer attention for long contexts.

Method: Introduces Elastic Memory grounded in HiPPO framework, using optimal online compression and polynomial sampling for retrieval.

Result: Outperformed Memorizing Transformer by 16x memory and Melodi at all memory sizes, even with fewer parameters. Faster than Melodi at 4x size.

Conclusion: Elastic Memory is scalable, efficient, and allows test-time inductive biases, making it superior for long-context tasks.

Abstract: Transformers face a quadratic bottleneck in attention when scaling to long contexts. Recent approaches introduce recurrent memory to extend context beyond the current window, yet these often face a fundamental trade-off between theoretical principles and practical scalability. To address this, we introduce Elastic Memory, a novel memory architecture grounded in the HiPPO framework for online function approximation. Elastic Memory treats historical sequence as samples from continuous signals, applying optimal online compression to encode them into a fixed-size memory state. For retrieval, we propose a flexible \textit{polynomial sampling} mechanism that reconstructs a history summary from this compressed state. Elastic Memory consistently outperformed baselines on long-context (32k+) datasets across three domains. With equal parameters, it beat Memorizing Transformer by 16x memory and outperformed Melodi at all memory sizes, even when Melodi had 30% more parameters. When scaling model size, Elastic Memory stayed ahead of all baselines and was significantly faster than Melodi at 4x size. Furthermore, its decoupled design allows for injecting inductive biases at test-time to boost performance.

Motivation: To understand LLMs' learning dynamics in multi-disciplinary contexts and improve generalization through cross-domain knowledge synergy.

Method: Systematic study using a five-discipline corpus, analyzing full fine-tuning, LoRA, LoRA-MoE, and LoRA compositions.

Result: Multi-disciplinary learning is more variable than single-discipline; four laws emerged to mitigate challenges and enhance synergy.

Conclusion: The study offers practical guidelines for principled multi-discipline fine-tuning, aiding generalizable scientific LLM development.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance through fine-tuning within individual scientific domains, their learning dynamics in multi-disciplinary contexts remains poorly understood, despite the promise of improved generalization and broader applicability through cross-domain knowledge synergy. In this work, we present the first systematic study of multi-disciplinary LLM fine-tuning, constructing a five-discipline corpus and analyzing learning patterns of full fine-tuning, LoRA, LoRA-MoE, and LoRA compositions. Particularly, our study shows that multi-disciplinary learning is substantially more variable than single-discipline training and distills four consistent empirical laws: (1) Balance-then-Diversity: low-resource disciplines degrade performance unless mitigated via diversity-aware upsampling; (2) Merge-then-Align: restoring instruction-following ability is critical for cross-discipline synergy; (3) Optimize-then-Scale: parameter scaling offers limited gains without prior design optimization; and (4) Share-then-Specialize: asymmetric LoRA-MoE yields robust gains with minimal trainable parameters via shared low-rank projection. Together, these laws form a practical recipe for principled multi-discipline fine-tuning and provide actionable guidance for developing generalizable scientific LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PLaTITO, a method enhancing transferable implicit transfer operators (TITO) for molecular dynamics by incorporating auxiliary information like protein language model embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional molecular dynamics (MD) is computationally expensive, and existing generative MD methods lack transferability. This work aims to improve data efficiency and generalization.

Method: Incorporates auxiliary information (e.g., protein language model embeddings) into TITO models to enhance transferability and efficiency.

Result: PLaTITO outperforms Boltzmann Emulators in data efficiency and achieves top performance for out-of-distribution protein systems.

Conclusion: Auxiliary information significantly improves TITO models, making PLaTITO a promising tool for efficient and generalizable molecular dynamics.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a central computational tool in physics, chemistry, and biology, enabling quantitative prediction of experimental observables as expectations over high-dimensional molecular distributions such as Boltzmann distributions and transition densities. However, conventional MD is fundamentally limited by the high computational cost required to generate independent samples. Generative molecular dynamics (GenMD) has recently emerged as an alternative, learning surrogates of molecular distributions either from data or through interaction with energy models. While these methods enable efficient sampling, their transferability across molecular systems is often limited. In this work, we show that incorporating auxiliary sources of information can improve the data efficiency and generalization of transferable implicit transfer operators (TITO) for molecular dynamics. We find that coarse-grained TITO models are substantially more data-efficient than Boltzmann Emulators, and that incorporating protein language model (pLM) embeddings further improves out-of-distribution generalization. Our approach, PLaTITO, achieves state-of-the-art performance on equilibrium sampling benchmarks for out-of-distribution protein systems, including fast-folding proteins. We further study the impact of additional conditioning signals -- such as structural embeddings, temperature, and large-language-model-derived embeddings -- on model performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the transfer of language model capabilities from pretraining to SFT, aiding efficient model development and data curation.

Result: Transfer reliability varies across capability categories, benchmarks, and scales, with distinct scaling dynamics for accuracy and confidence.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into pretraining effects on downstream outcomes, offering practical guidance for benchmark selection and model development.

Abstract: Understanding how language model capabilities transfer from pretraining to supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is fundamental to efficient model development and data curation. In this work, we investigate four core questions: RQ1. To what extent do accuracy and confidence rankings established during pretraining persist after SFT? RQ2. Which benchmarks serve as robust cross-stage predictors and which are unreliable? RQ3. How do transfer dynamics shift with model scale? RQ4. How well does model confidence align with accuracy, as a measure of calibration quality? Does this alignment pattern transfer across training stages? We address these questions through a suite of correlation protocols applied to accuracy and confidence metrics across diverse data mixtures and model scales. Our experiments reveal that transfer reliability varies dramatically across capability categories, benchmarks, and scales -- with accuracy and confidence exhibiting distinct, sometimes opposing, scaling dynamics. These findings shed light on the complex interplay between pretraining decisions and downstream outcomes, providing actionable guidance for benchmark selection, data curation, and efficient model development.

### [169] [Credal Concept Bottleneck Models: Structural Separation of Epistemic and Aleatoric Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11219)
*Tanmoy Mukherjee,Marius Kloft,Pierre Marquis,Zied Bouraoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a credal-set formulation to distinctly separate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty by representing uncertainty as a set of predictive distributions, improving their independence and alignment with ground-truth metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for decomposing predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components often yield correlated estimates, blurring their distinct semantics. This work aims to provide a clearer separation.

Method: The authors propose a Variational Credal Concept Bottleneck Model with two disjoint uncertainty heads trained by separate objectives and non-overlapping gradient paths, ensuring separation by design.

Result: The approach reduces the correlation between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty by over an order of magnitude and improves alignment of epistemic uncertainty with prediction error and aleatoric uncertainty with ground-truth ambiguity.

Conclusion: The credal-set formulation effectively disentangles epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, offering a more reliable framework for decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Decomposing predictive uncertainty into epistemic (model ignorance) and aleatoric (data ambiguity) components is central to reliable decision making, yet most methods estimate both from the same predictive distribution. Recent empirical and theoretical results show these estimates are typically strongly correlated, so changes in predictive spread simultaneously affect both components and blur their semantics. We propose a credal-set formulation in which uncertainty is represented as a set of predictive distributions, so that epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty correspond to distinct geometric properties: the size of the set versus the noise within its elements. We instantiate this idea in a Variational Credal Concept Bottleneck Model with two disjoint uncertainty heads trained by disjoint objectives and non-overlapping gradient paths, yielding separation by construction rather than post hoc decomposition. Across multi-annotator benchmarks, our approach reduces the correlation between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty by over an order of magnitude compared to standard methods, while improving the alignment of epistemic uncertainty with prediction error and aleatoric uncertainty with ground-truth ambiguity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based agent to optimize data rewriting for SFT, improving alignment with QA-style generation and diversity while reducing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues like catastrophic forgetting and lack of diversity in SFT due to distribution shifts, the paper proposes a data-centric approach using reinforcement learning.

Method: The authors frame data rewriting as a policy learning problem, using RL to optimize alignment with QA-style generation and diversity, while enforcing task consistency.

Result: Experiments show the method achieves comparable downstream performance to SFT while reducing forgetting by 12.34% on average.

Conclusion: The RL-based data-rewriting agent effectively constructs higher-quality datasets for SFT, balancing alignment, diversity, and task consistency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress, yet adapting them to downstream scenarios still commonly relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT). When downstream data exhibit a substantial distribution shift from the model's prior training distribution, SFT can induce catastrophic forgetting. To narrow this gap, data rewriting has been proposed as a data-centric approach that rewrites downstream training data prior to SFT. However, existing methods typically sample rewrites from a prompt-induced conditional distribution, so the resulting targets are not necessarily aligned with the model's natural QA-style generation distribution. Moreover, reliance on fixed templates can lead to diversity collapse. To address these issues, we cast data rewriting as a policy learning problem and learn a rewriting policy that better matches the backbone's QA-style generation distribution while preserving diversity. Since distributional alignment, diversity and task consistency are automatically evaluable but difficult to optimize end-to-end with differentiable objectives, we leverage reinforcement learning to optimize the rewrite distribution under reward feedback and propose an RL-based data-rewriting agent. The agent jointly optimizes QA-style distributional alignment and diversity under a hard task-consistency gate, thereby constructing a higher-quality rewritten dataset for downstream SFT. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves downstream gains comparable to standard SFT while reducing forgetting on non-downstream benchmarks by 12.34% on average.

Conclusion: Incorporating topological priors enables morphology-faithful embeddings that capture tumor heterogeneity and maintain cross-institutional robustness, demonstrating clinical reliability.

Abstract: Accurate prognosis for Glioblastoma (GBM) using deep learning (DL) is hindered by extreme spatial and structural heterogeneity. Moreover, inconsistent MRI acquisition protocols across institutions hinder generalizability of models. Conventional transformer and DL pipelines often fail to capture the multi-scale morphological diversity such as fragmented necrotic cores, infiltrating margins, and disjoint enhancing components leading to scanner-specific artifacts and poor cross-site prognosis. We propose TopoGBM, a learning framework designed to capture heterogeneity-preserved, scanner-robust representations from multi-parametric 3D MRI. Central to our approach is a 3D convolutional autoencoder regularized by a topological regularization that preserves the complex, non-Euclidean invariants of the tumor's manifold within a compressed latent space. By enforcing these topological priors, TopoGBM explicitly models the high-variance structural signatures characteristic of aggressive GBM. Evaluated across heterogeneous cohorts (UPENN, UCSF, RHUH) and external validation on TCGA, TopoGBM achieves better performance (C-index 0.67 test, 0.58 validation), outperforming baselines that degrade under domain shift. Mechanistic interpretability analysis reveals that reconstruction residuals are highly localized to pathologically heterogeneous zones, with tumor-restricted and healthy tissue error significantly low (Test: 0.03, Validation: 0.09). Furthermore, occlusion-based attribution localizes approximately 50% of the prognostic signal to the tumor and the diverse peritumoral microenvironment advocating clinical reliability of the unsupervised learning method. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating topological priors enables the learning of morphology-faithful embeddings that capture tumor heterogeneity while maintaining cross-institutional robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses challenges in diagnosing type 2 diabetes, especially for primary care physicians, by leveraging AI-CDSS to enhance accuracy and accessibility.

Method: A hybrid approach combining expert insights and machine learning was used to develop and test the AI-CDSS. Key features like BMI, fasting glucose, and HbA1C were analyzed. A clinical pilot study compared AI-CDSS performance with specialists.

Result: The AI-CDSS achieved 99.8% accuracy in diabetes prediction, 98.8% agreement with specialists, and outperformed non-endocrinology specialists (85% agreement).

Conclusion: AI-CDSS is highly accurate and could be a valuable tool for diagnosing type 2 diabetes, particularly in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Identifying type 2 diabetes mellitus can be challenging, particularly for primary care physicians. Clinical decision support systems incorporating artificial intelligence (AI-CDSS) can assist medical professionals in diagnosing type 2 diabetes with high accuracy. This study aimed to assess an AI-CDSS specifically developed for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes by employing a hybrid approach that integrates expert-driven insights with machine learning techniques. The AI-CDSS was developed (training dataset: n = 650) and tested (test dataset: n = 648) using a dataset of 1298 patients with and without type 2 diabetes. To generate predictions, the algorithm utilized key features such as body mass index, plasma fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1C. Furthermore, a clinical pilot study involving 105 patients was conducted to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the system in comparison to non-endocrinology specialists. The AI-CDSS showed a high degree of accuracy, with 99.8% accuracy in predicting diabetes, 99.3% in predicting prediabetes, 99.2% in identifying at-risk individuals, and 98.8% in predicting no diabetes. The test dataset revealed a 98.8% agreement between endocrinology specialists and the AI-CDSS. Type 2 diabetes was identified in 45% of 105 individuals in the pilot study. Compared with diabetes specialists, the AI-CDSS scored a 98.5% concordance rate, greatly exceeding that of nonendocrinology specialists, who had an 85% agreement rate. These findings indicate that the AI-CDSS has the potential to be a useful tool for accurately identifying type 2 diabetes, especially in situations in which diabetes specialists are not readily available.

### [173] [Evaluating Memory Structure in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11243)
*Alina Shutova,Alexandra Olenina,Ivan Vinogradov,Anton Sinitsin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StructMemEval is a new benchmark to evaluate LLM agents' ability to organize long-term memory, beyond simple factual recall, highlighting gaps in current architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for long-term memory focus on basic capabilities like fact retention, which retrieval-augmented LLMs can handle, but fail to test complex memory organization.

Method: Proposed StructMemEval includes tasks requiring structured knowledge organization (e.g., transaction ledgers, to-do lists) to assess memory agents.

Result: Simple retrieval-augmented LLMs struggle with structured tasks, while memory agents succeed when prompted but struggle without explicit guidance.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals gaps in LLMs' ability to recognize memory structures, pointing to needed improvements in training and frameworks.

Abstract: Modern LLM-based agents and chat assistants rely on long-term memory frameworks to store reusable knowledge, recall user preferences, and augment reasoning. As researchers create more complex memory architectures, it becomes increasingly difficult to analyze their capabilities and guide future memory designs. Most long-term memory benchmarks focus on simple fact retention, multi-hop recall, and time-based changes. While undoubtedly important, these capabilities can often be achieved with simple retrieval-augmented LLMs and do not test complex memory hierarchies. To bridge this gap, we propose StructMemEval - a benchmark that tests the agent's ability to organize its long-term memory, not just factual recall. We gather a suite of tasks that humans solve by organizing their knowledge in a specific structure: transaction ledgers, to-do lists, trees and others. Our initial experiments show that simple retrieval-augmented LLMs struggle with these tasks, whereas memory agents can reliably solve them if prompted how to organize their memory. However, we also find that modern LLMs do not always recognize the memory structure when not prompted to do so. This highlights an important direction for future improvements in both LLM training and memory frameworks.

### [174] [How Many Features Can a Language Model Store Under the Linear Representation Hypothesis?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11246)
*Nikhil Garg,Jon Kleinberg,Kenny Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the linear representation hypothesis (LRH) in language models, focusing on how many neurons are needed to linearly represent and decode features. It provides theoretical bounds for linear compressed sensing, showing a gap between classical and linear settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to quantify the requirements for linear representation and accessibility of features in neural networks, addressing gaps in classical compressed sensing and supporting the superposition hypothesis.

Method: The authors separate the LRH into linear representation and linear accessibility, then derive upper and lower bounds for linear compressed sensing using matrix constructions and combinatorial proofs.

Result: Theoretical results show that $d = Ω_ε(\frac{k^2}{\log k}\log (m/k))$ is required and $d = O_ε(k^2\log m)$ suffices, highlighting a gap between classical and linear compressed sensing.

Conclusion: The work provides evidence for the superposition hypothesis and clarifies constraints on feature representation geometry, extending insights to decoders with activation functions and bias.

Abstract: We introduce a mathematical framework for the linear representation hypothesis (LRH), which asserts that intermediate layers of language models store features linearly. We separate the hypothesis into two claims: linear representation (features are linearly embedded in neuron activations) and linear accessibility (features can be linearly decoded). We then ask: How many neurons $d$ suffice to both linearly represent and linearly access $m$ features? Classical results in compressed sensing imply that for $k$-sparse inputs, $d = O(k\log (m/k))$ suffices if we allow non-linear decoding algorithms (Candes and Tao, 2006; Candes et al., 2006; Donoho, 2006). However, the additional requirement of linear decoding takes the problem out of the classical compressed sensing, into linear compressed sensing.
  Our main theoretical result establishes nearly-matching upper and lower bounds for linear compressed sensing. We prove that $d = Ω_ε(\frac{k^2}{\log k}\log (m/k))$ is required while $d = O_ε(k^2\log m)$ suffices. The lower bound establishes a quantitative gap between classical and linear compressed setting, illustrating how linear accessibility is a meaningfully stronger hypothesis than linear representation alone. The upper bound confirms that neurons can store an exponential number of features under the LRH, giving theoretical evidence for the "superposition hypothesis" (Elhage et al., 2022).
  The upper bound proof uses standard random constructions of matrices with approximately orthogonal columns. The lower bound proof uses rank bounds for near-identity matrices (Alon, 2003) together with Turán's theorem (bounding the number of edges in clique-free graphs). We also show how our results do and do not constrain the geometry of feature representations and extend our results to allow decoders with an activation function and bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance deep learning efficiency by reducing hardware area and power consumption while maintaining accuracy through a novel data format.

Method: HiF4 packs 64 4-bit elements with shared scaling metadata, enabling fixed-point matrix multiplications and better dynamic range utilization.

Result: HiF4 outperforms NVFP4 in accuracy across diverse language models like LLaMA and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: HiF4 offers a hardware-efficient, accurate solution for deep learning inference.

Abstract: This paper introduces HiFloat4 (HiF4), a block floating-point data format tailored for deep learning. Each HiF4 unit packs 64 4-bit elements with 32 bits of shared scaling metadata, averaging 4.5 bits per value. The metadata specifies a three-level scaling hierarchy, capturing inter- and intra-group dynamic range while improving the utilization of the representational space. In addition, the large 64-element group size enables matrix multiplications to be executed in a highly fixed-point manner, significantly reducing hardware area and power consumption. To evaluate the proposed format, we conducted inference experiments on several language models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, DeepSeek-V3.1 and LongCat. Results show that HiF4 achieves higher average accuracy than the state-of-the-art NVFP4 format across multiple models and diverse downstream tasks.

*Jamie Mahowald,Brian Bell,Alex Ho,Michael Geyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces distilled neural tangent kernel (DNTK) to reduce NTK computational complexity by compressing data dimensions and combining it with projection methods, achieving up to 100x reduction in Jacobian calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NTK methods face computational limitations due to large Jacobian evaluations across many data points. The authors aim to reduce this cost by compressing the data dimension.

Method: Proposes NTK-tuned dataset distillation to induce the neural tangent space spanned by input data, reducing Jacobian calculations. Combines this with projection methods to create DNTK.

Result: Achieves a 20-100x reduction in required Jacobian calculations and preserves kernel structure and predictive performance.

Conclusion: DNTK significantly reduces computational complexity (up to five orders of magnitude) while maintaining performance, offering a scalable solution for NTK methods.

Abstract: Neural tangent kernel (NTK) methods are computationally limited by the need to evaluate large Jacobians across many data points. Existing approaches reduce this cost primarily through projecting and sketching the Jacobian. We show that NTK computation can also be reduced by compressing the data dimension itself using NTK-tuned dataset distillation. We demonstrate that the neural tangent space spanned by the input data can be induced by dataset distillation, yielding a 20-100$\times$ reduction in required Jacobian calculations. We further show that per-class NTK matrices have low effective rank that is preserved by this reduction. Building on these insights, we propose the distilled neural tangent kernel (DNTK), which combines NTK-tuned dataset distillation with state-of-the-art projection methods to reduce up NTK computational complexity by up to five orders of magnitude while preserving kernel structure and predictive performance.

### [177] [Predictive Associative Memory: Retrieval Beyond Similarity Through Temporal Co-occurrence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11322)
*Jason Dury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Predictive Associative Memory (PAM), an architecture leveraging temporal co-occurrence for memory association, outperforming similarity-based retrieval methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural memory systems rely on similarity-based retrieval, missing biological memory's associative nature through temporal co-occurrence.

Method: PAM uses a JEPA-style predictor trained on temporal co-occurrence in continuous streams, complemented by an Inward JEPA for associative recall.

Result: PAM achieves high precision (0.970) and recall (0.421) for temporal associations, outperforming cosine similarity (AUC 0.916 vs. 0.789).

Conclusion: PAM demonstrates effective associative memory through temporal co-occurrence, validated by stable results across tests.

Abstract: Current approaches to memory in neural systems rely on similarity-based retrieval: given a query, find the most representationally similar stored state. This assumption -- that useful memories are similar memories -- fails to capture a fundamental property of biological memory: association through temporal co-occurrence. We propose Predictive Associative Memory (PAM), an architecture in which a JEPA-style predictor, trained on temporal co-occurrence within a continuous experience stream, learns to navigate the associative structure of an embedding space. We introduce an Inward JEPA that operates over stored experience (predicting associatively reachable past states) as the complement to the standard Outward JEPA that operates over incoming sensory data (predicting future states). We evaluate PAM as an associative recall system -- testing faithfulness of recall for experienced associations -- rather than as a retrieval system evaluated on generalisation to unseen associations. On a synthetic benchmark, the predictor's top retrieval is a true temporal associate 97% of the time (Association Precision@1 = 0.970); it achieves cross-boundary Recall@20 = 0.421 where cosine similarity scores zero; and it separates experienced-together from never-experienced-together states with a discrimination AUC of 0.916 (cosine: 0.789). Even restricted to cross-room pairs where embedding similarity is uninformative, the predictor achieves AUC = 0.849 (cosine: 0.503, chance). A temporal shuffle control confirms the signal is genuine temporal co-occurrence structure, not embedding geometry: shuffling collapses cross-boundary recall by 90%, replicated across training seeds. All results are stable across seeds (SD < 0.006) and query selections (SD $\leq$ 0.012).

*Esha Singh,Dongxia Wu,Chien-Yi Yang,Tajana Rosing,Rose Yu,Yi-An Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an online learning approach for multi-objective combinatorial optimization, achieving high performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-objective combinatorial optimization lack generality, scalability, or theoretical guarantees, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: The problem is reformulated as an online learning task over a decomposed decision space, using adaptive expert-guided sequential construction and position-wise bandit subproblems.

Result: The method achieves 80--98% of specialized solvers' performance, with significant sample and computational efficiency gains (2--3 orders of magnitude) over Bayesian optimization. It also outperforms competitors in real-world hardware-software co-design tasks.

Conclusion: Bandit optimization over decomposed decision spaces is a principled and efficient alternative for multi-objective optimization, especially for large-scale problems.

Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization seeks Pareto-optimal solutions over exponentially large discrete spaces, yet existing methods sacrifice generality, scalability, or theoretical guarantees. We reformulate it as an online learning problem over a decomposed decision space, solving position-wise bandit subproblems via adaptive expert-guided sequential construction. This formulation admits regret bounds of $O(d\sqrt{T \log T})$ depending on subproblem dimensionality \(d\) rather than combinatorial space size. On standard benchmarks, our method achieves 80--98\% of specialized solvers performance while achieving two to three orders of magnitude improvement in sample and computational efficiency over Bayesian optimization methods. On real-world hardware-software co-design for AI accelerators with expensive simulations, we outperform competing methods under fixed evaluation budgets. The advantage grows with problem scale and objective count, establishing bandit optimization over decomposed decision spaces as a principled alternative to surrogate modeling or offline training for multi-objective optimization.

### [179] [Structured Hybrid Mechanistic Models for Robust Estimation of Time-Dependent Intervention Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11350)
*Tomer Meir,Ori Linial,Danny Eytan,Uri Shalit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid mechanistic-data-driven approach outperforms purely data-driven or mechanistic models for estimating intervention effects in dynamical systems, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of data-driven and mechanistic models in estimating intervention effects, particularly in medicine (e.g., Propofol dosing).

Method: Decomposes system dynamics into parametric (mechanistic) and nonparametric (data-driven) components, with a two-stage procedure for unknown mechanistic parameters.

Result: Hybrid approach shows superior performance in out-of-distribution scenarios compared to purely data-driven or mechanistic models.

Conclusion: Hybrid models offer robust solutions for intervention optimization in complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: Estimating intervention effects in dynamical systems is crucial for outcome optimization. In medicine, such interventions arise in physiological regulation (e.g., cardiovascular system under fluid administration) and pharmacokinetics, among others. Propofol administration is an anesthetic intervention, where the challenge is to estimate the optimal dose required to achieve a target brain concentration for anesthesia, given patient characteristics, while avoiding under- or over-dosing. The pharmacokinetic state is characterized by drug concentrations across tissues, and its dynamics are governed by prior states, patient covariates, drug clearance, and drug administration. While data-driven models can capture complex dynamics, they often fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Mechanistic models on the other hand are typically robust, but might be oversimplified. We propose a hybrid mechanistic-data-driven approach to estimate time-dependent intervention outcomes. Our approach decomposes the dynamical system's transition operator into parametric and nonparametric components, further distinguishing between intervention-related and unrelated dynamics. This structure leverages mechanistic anchors while learning residual patterns from data. For scenarios where mechanistic parameters are unknown, we introduce a two-stage procedure: first, pre-training an encoder on simulated data, and subsequently learning corrections from observed data. Two regimes with incomplete mechanistic knowledge are considered: periodic pendulum and Propofol bolus injections. Results demonstrate that our hybrid approach outperforms purely data-driven and mechanistic approaches, particularly OOD. This work highlights the potential of hybrid mechanistic-data-driven models for robust intervention optimization in complex, real-world dynamical systems.

*Sara Matijevic,Christopher Yau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A bootstrapping-based regularization framework improves stability in deep learning models for clinical predictions without sacrificing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based clinical prediction models often suffer from instability, undermining reliability and limiting clinical adoption.

Method: Proposes embedding bootstrapping directly into deep neural network training to constrain prediction variability.

Result: Improved stability across datasets (GUSTO-I, Framingham, SUPPORT) with lower prediction differences and maintained discriminative performance.

Conclusion: The method enhances robustness and reproducibility while preserving interpretability, offering reliable clinical predictions.

Abstract: Clinical prediction models are increasingly used to support patient care, yet many deep learning-based approaches remain unstable, as their predictions can vary substantially when trained on different samples from the same population. Such instability undermines reliability and limits clinical adoption. In this study, we propose a novel bootstrapping-based regularisation framework that embeds the bootstrapping process directly into the training of deep neural networks. This approach constrains prediction variability across resampled datasets, producing a single model with inherent stability properties. We evaluated models constructed using the proposed regularisation approach against conventional and ensemble models using simulated data and three clinical datasets: GUSTO-I, Framingham, and SUPPORT. Across all datasets, our model exhibited improved prediction stability, with lower mean absolute differences (e.g., 0.019 vs. 0.059 in GUSTO-I; 0.057 vs. 0.088 in Framingham) and markedly fewer significantly deviating predictions. Importantly, discriminative performance and feature importance consistency were maintained, with high SHAP correlations between models (e.g., 0.894 for GUSTO-I; 0.965 for Framingham). While ensemble models achieved greater stability, we show that this came at the expense of interpretability, as each constituent model used predictors in different ways. By regularising predictions to align with bootstrapped distributions, our approach allows prediction models to be developed that achieve greater robustness and reproducibility without sacrificing interpretability. This method provides a practical route toward more reliable and clinically trustworthy deep learning models, particularly valuable in data-limited healthcare settings.

*Amirpasha Hedayat,Alberto Padovan,Karthik Duraisamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces adaptive non-intrusive Reduced Order Models (ROMs) to address limitations of static ROMs when systems deviate from training data. It proposes three formulations—Adaptive OpInf, Adaptive NiTROM, and a hybrid—and evaluates their performance on a perturbed lid-driven cavity flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static ROMs fail when systems evolve beyond their training manifold, limiting practical utility. The authors aim to develop adaptive ROMs that update dynamically online.

Method: Three adaptive ROM formulations are proposed: 1) Adaptive OpInf (sequential updates), 2) Adaptive NiTROM (joint optimization), and 3) a hybrid approach. The study focuses on online data, adaptation windows, and computational costs.

Result: Adaptive OpInf reduces amplitude drift efficiently, Adaptive NiTROM achieves near-exact energy tracking (but is sensitive), and the hybrid excels under regime changes with minimal offline data.

Conclusion: Predictive ROMs must be cost-aware and transparent. The proposed adaptive ROMs offer a practical solution for evolving dynamics, emphasizing clear reporting of training/adaptation regimes.

Abstract: Projection-based Reduced Order Models (ROMs) are often deployed as static surrogates, which limits their practical utility once a system leaves the training manifold. We formalize and study adaptive non-intrusive ROMs that update both the latent subspace and the reduced dynamics online. Building on ideas from static non-intrusive ROMs, specifically, Operator Inference (OpInf) and the recently-introduced Non-intrusive Trajectory-based optimization of Reduced-Order Models (NiTROM), we propose three formulations: Adaptive OpInf (sequential basis/operator refits), Adaptive NiTROM (joint Riemannian optimization of encoder/decoder and polynomial dynamics), and a hybrid that initializes NiTROM with an OpInf update. We describe the online data window, adaptation window, and computational budget, and analyze cost scaling. On a transiently perturbed lid-driven cavity flow, static Galerkin/OpInf/NiTROM drift or destabilize when forecasting beyond training. In contrast, Adaptive OpInf robustly suppresses amplitude drift with modest cost; Adaptive NiTROM is shown to attain near-exact energy tracking under frequent updates but is sensitive to its initialization and optimization depth; the hybrid is most reliable under regime changes and minimal offline data, yielding physically coherent fields and bounded energy. We argue that predictive claims for ROMs must be cost-aware and transparent, with clear separation of training/adaptation/deployment regimes and explicit reporting of online budgets and full-order model queries. This work provides a practical template for building self-correcting, non-intrusive ROMs that remain effective as the dynamics evolve well beyond the initial manifold.

TL;DR: WSBD is a novel optimizer for Quantum Neural Networks that uses dynamic, parameter-wise freezing to reduce computational costs and overcome barren plateaus, achieving faster convergence than Adam.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of gradient estimation and the barren plateau problem in QNNs hinder efficient training, prompting the need for a more effective optimizer.

Method: WSBD employs a dynamic, parameter-wise freezing strategy based on gradient-derived importance scores to focus computational resources and reduce forward passes.

Result: WSBD converges 63.9% faster on average than Adam for the ground-state-energy problem, with performance improving as QNN size grows.

Conclusion: WSBD offers a computationally efficient and adaptive approach for QNN training, outperforming traditional methods while maintaining full expressive capacity.

Abstract: The training of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) is hindered by the high computational cost of gradient estimation and the barren plateau problem, where optimization landscapes become intractably flat. To address these challenges, we introduce Weighted Stochastic Block Descent (WSBD), a novel optimizer with a dynamic, parameter-wise freezing strategy. WSBD intelligently focuses computational resources by identifying and temporarily freezing less influential parameters based on a gradient-derived importance score. This approach significantly reduces the number of forward passes required per training step and helps navigate the optimization landscape more effectively. Unlike pruning or layer-wise freezing, WSBD maintains full expressive capacity while adapting throughout training. Our extensive evaluation shows that WSBD converges on average 63.9% faster than Adam for the popular ground-state-energy problem, an advantage that grows with QNN size. We provide a formal convergence proof for WSBD and show that parameter-wise freezing outperforms traditional layer-wise approaches in QNNs.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to study robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs) with general policy parameterization, improving computational efficiency and sample complexity guarantees compared to prior work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on RMDPs is limited to tabular policies, lacking sample complexity guarantees or being computationally expensive. This paper aims to address these gaps.

Method: The method reduces average reward RMDPs to entropy-regularized discounted robust MDPs, introduces Lipschitz properties for general policies, and uses multilevel Monte Carlo gradient estimation.

Result: Novel Lipschitz properties are proven, and improved algorithms (projected gradient descent and Frank--Wolfe) achieve better sample complexity bounds.

Conclusion: This is the first work to provide sample complexity guarantees for RMDPs with general policy parameterization beyond (s,a)-rectangularity, improving computational efficiency and theoretical bounds.

Abstract: We study robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs) with general policy parameterization under s-rectangular and non-rectangular uncertainty sets. Prior work is largely limited to tabular policies, and hence either lacks sample complexity guarantees or incurs high computational cost. Our method reduces the average reward RMDPs to entropy-regularized discounted robust MDPs, restoring strong duality and enabling tractable equilibrium computation. We prove novel Lipschitz and Lipschitz-smoothness properties for general policy parameterizations that extends to infinite state spaces. To address infinite-horizon gradient estimation, we introduce a multilevel Monte Carlo gradient estimator with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(ε^{-2})$ sample complexity, a factor of $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-2})$ improvement over prior work. Building on this, we design a projected gradient descent algorithm for s-rectangular uncertainty ($\mathcal{O}(ε^{-5})$) and a Frank--Wolfe algorithm for non-rectangular uncertainty ($\mathcal{O}(ε^{-4})$ discounted, $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-10.5})$ average reward), significantly improving prior results in both the discounted setting and average reward setting. Our work is the first one to provide sample complexity guarantees for RMDPs with general policy parameterization beyond $(s, a)$-rectangularity. It also provides the first such guarantees in the average reward setting and improves existing bounds for discounted robust MDPs.

### [184] [Sparse Semantic Dimension as a Generalization Certificate for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11388)
*Dibyanayan Bandyopadhyay,Asif Ekbal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs generalize robustly despite high parameter counts due to low-dimensional, sparse activation manifolds. The Sparse Semantic Dimension (SSD) framework attributes this to dictionary sparsity, not total parameters. Empirical validation shows larger models learn more compressible structures, and SSD can monitor epistemic uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why LLMs generalize well despite overfitting risks posed by high parameter counts.

Method: Introduce SSD, a complexity measure from Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) feature vocabulary, to analyze activation sparsity. Validate on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2B.

Result: Larger models require fewer calibration samples; SSD provides non-vacuous generalization bounds and detects epistemic uncertainty via feature explosions.

Conclusion: Generalization in LLMs stems from sparse activation geometry, not parameter count. SSD offers insights into model scalability and safety.

Abstract: Standard statistical learning theory predicts that Large Language Models (LLMs) should overfit because their parameter counts vastly exceed the number of training tokens. Yet, in practice, they generalize robustly. We propose that the effective capacity controlling generalization lies in the geometry of the model's internal representations: while the parameter space is high-dimensional, the activation states lie on a low-dimensional, sparse manifold. To formalize this, we introduce the Sparse Semantic Dimension (SSD), a complexity measure derived from the active feature vocabulary of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) trained on the model's layers. Treating the LLM and SAE as frozen oracles, we utilize this framework to attribute the model's generalization capabilities to the sparsity of the dictionary rather than the total parameter count. Empirically, we validate this framework on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2B, demonstrating that our bound provides non-vacuous certificates at realistic sample sizes. Crucially, we uncover a counter-intuitive "feature sharpness" scaling law: despite being an order of magnitude larger, Gemma-2B requires significantly fewer calibration samples to identify its active manifold compared to GPT-2, suggesting that larger models learn more compressible, distinct semantic structures. Finally, we show that this framework functions as a reliable safety monitor: out-of-distribution inputs trigger a measurable "feature explosion" (a sharp spike in active features), effectively signaling epistemic uncertainty through learned feature violation.

TL;DR: Efficiently guide unconditional diffusion models without gradient guidance during inference, using noise alignment and transferable concept vectors for fast controllable generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Avoid the computational overhead of retraining or gradient-based guidance in unconditional diffusion models.

Method: Use noise alignment for coarse semantic steering and transferable concept vectors for refined control, identified via Recursive Feature Machine (RFM).

Result: Improved accuracy/quality over gradient-based guidance with significant inference speedups on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and CelebA.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables efficient and fast controllable generation in diffusion models without gradient guidance.

Abstract: Guiding unconditional diffusion models typically requires either retraining with conditional inputs or per-step gradient computations (e.g., classifier-based guidance), both of which incur substantial computational overhead. We present a general recipe for efficiently steering unconditional diffusion {without gradient guidance during inference}, enabling fast controllable generation. Our approach is built on two observations about diffusion model structure: Noise Alignment: even in early, highly corrupted stages, coarse semantic steering is possible using a lightweight, offline-computed guidance signal, avoiding any per-step or per-sample gradients. Transferable concept vectors: a concept direction in activation space once learned transfers across both {timesteps} and {samples}; the same fixed steering vector learned near low noise level remains effective when injected at intermediate noise levels for every generation trajectory, providing refined conditional control with efficiency. Such concept directions can be efficiently and reliably identified via Recursive Feature Machine (RFM), a light-weight backpropagation-free feature learning method. Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and CelebA demonstrate improved accuracy/quality over gradient-based guidance, while achieving significant inference speedups.

### [186] [Can We Really Learn One Representation to Optimize All Rewards?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11399)
*Chongyi Zheng,Royina Karegoudra Jayanth,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demystifies forward-backward (FB) representation learning in RL, proposing a simplified method called one-step FB that improves performance and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the theoretical and practical aspects of FB representation learning in RL and propose a more efficient unsupervised pre-training method.

Method: Analyzes FB's objectives and behavior, connects it with rank matching, fitted Q-evaluation, and contraction mapping, and introduces one-step FB for policy improvement.

Result: One-step FB achieves errors 10^5 smaller and improves zero-shot performance by +24% in experiments.

Conclusion: The study provides clarity on FB representation learning and demonstrates the effectiveness of one-step FB for RL tasks.

Abstract: As machine learning has moved towards leveraging large models as priors for downstream tasks, the community has debated the right form of prior for solving reinforcement learning (RL) problems. If one were to try to prefetch as much computation as possible, they would attempt to learn a prior over the policies for some yet-to-be-determined reward function. Recent work (forward-backward (FB) representation learning) has tried this, arguing that an unsupervised representation learning procedure can enable optimal control over arbitrary rewards without further fine-tuning. However, FB's training objective and learning behavior remain mysterious. In this paper, we demystify FB by clarifying when such representations can exist, what its objective optimizes, and how it converges in practice. We draw connections with rank matching, fitted Q-evaluation, and contraction mapping. Our analysis suggests a simplified unsupervised pre-training method for RL that, instead of enabling optimal control, performs one step of policy improvement. We call our proposed method $\textbf{one-step forward-backward representation learning (one-step FB)}$. Experiments in didactic settings, as well as in $10$ state-based and image-based continuous control domains, demonstrate that one-step FB converges to errors $10^5$ smaller and improves zero-shot performance by $+24\%$ on average.

TL;DR: CADET, a decoder-only transformer for CTR prediction, addresses challenges in ads CTR prediction with innovations like context-conditioned decoding and self-gated attention, achieving a 11.04% CTR lift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to adapt transformer-based architectures to ads CTR prediction, addressing challenges like post-scoring signals and scalability.

Method: CADET introduces innovations such as context-conditioned decoding, self-gated attention, timestamp-based RoPE, session masking, and engineering techniques.

Result: CADET achieves an 11.04% CTR lift compared to the baseline LiRank model in online A/B testing.

Conclusion: CADET successfully addresses CTR prediction challenges and is deployed on LinkedIn's advertising platform.

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is fundamental to online advertising systems. While Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) with explicit feature interactions have long dominated this domain, recent advances in generative recommenders have shown promising results in content recommendation. However, adapting these transformer-based architectures to ads CTR prediction still presents unique challenges, including handling post-scoring contextual signals, maintaining offline-online consistency, and scaling to industrial workloads. We present CADET (Context-Conditioned Ads Decoder-Only Transformer), an end-to-end decoder-only transformer for ads CTR prediction deployed at LinkedIn. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a context-conditioned decoding architecture with multi-tower prediction heads that explicitly model post-scoring signals such as ad position, resolving the chicken-and-egg problem between predicted CTR and ranking; (2) a self-gated attention mechanism that stabilizes training by adaptively regulating information flow at both representation and interaction levels; (3) a timestamp-based variant of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) that captures temporal relationships across timescales from seconds to months; (4) session masking strategies that prevent the model from learning dependencies on unavailable in-session events, addressing train-serve skew; and (5) production engineering techniques including tensor packing, sequence chunking, and custom Flash Attention kernels that enable efficient training and serving at scale. In online A/B testing, CADET achieves a 11.04\% CTR lift compared to the production LiRank baseline model, a hybrid ensemble of DCNv2 and sequential encoders. The system has been successfully deployed on LinkedIn's advertising platform, serving the main traffic for homefeed sponsored updates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeSynth framework evaluates linear and nonlinear time series models, showing linear models collapse under complexity while nonlinear ones excel, especially CNNs and Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address debates on whether nonlinear models truly outperform linear ones by using a structured framework to emulate real-world time series dynamics.

Method: TimeSynth synthesizes signals with real-world properties (non-stationarity, trends, etc.). Evaluates Linear, MLP, CNN, and Transformer models with unbiased protocols.

Result: Linear models collapse under signal complexity; nonlinear models (CNNs, Transformers) perform better, especially with complex signals.

Conclusion: TimeSynth provides a principled way to assess forecasting models, showing nonlinear approaches excel where linear ones fail.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental tool with wide ranging applications, yet recent debates question whether complex nonlinear architectures truly outperform simple linear models. Prior claims of dominance of the linear model often stem from benchmarks that lack diverse temporal dynamics and employ biased evaluation protocols. We revisit this debate through TimeSynth, a structured framework that emulates key properties of real world time series,including non-stationarity, periodicity, trends, and phase modulation by creating synthesized signals whose parameters are derived from real-world time series. Evaluating four model families Linear, Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Transformers, we find a systematic bias in linear models: they collapse to simple oscillation regardless of signal complexity. Nonlinear models avoid this collapse and gain clear advantages as signal complexity increases. Notably, Transformers and CNN based models exhibit slightly greater adaptability to complex modulated signals compared to MLPs. Beyond clean forecasting, the framework highlights robustness differences under distribution and noise shifts and removes biases of prior benchmarks by using independent instances for train, test, and validation for each signal family. Collectively, TimeSynth provides a principled foundation for understanding when different forecasting approaches succeed or fail, moving beyond oversimplified claims of model equivalence.

*Ziyuan Huang,Lina Alkarmi,Mingyan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores strategic classification, focusing on designing classifier thresholds and difficulty progression in a multi-level framework to incentivize honest effort, proving agents can achieve high levels through genuine improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses manipulation by self-interested agents in classification systems, shifting focus from dynamic classifier weights to threshold and difficulty design to promote honest efforts.

Method: Analyzes classifier thresholds and difficulty progression within a multi-level promotion-relegation framework, considering agents' farsightedness, skill retention, and self-reinforcing effects.

Result: Demonstrates that optimal threshold sequences can incentivize honest effort, enabling agents to reach high levels solely through genuine improvement under mild conditions.

Conclusion: Proposes a novel approach to strategic classification by designing thresholds and progression to counteract manipulation, ensuring long-term honest effort.

Abstract: Strategic classification studies the problem where self-interested individuals or agents manipulate their response to obtain favorable decision outcomes made by classifiers, typically turning to dishonest actions when they are less costly than genuine efforts. While existing studies on sequential strategic classification primarily focus on optimizing dynamic classifier weights, we depart from these weight-centric approaches by analyzing the design of classifier thresholds and difficulty progression within a multi-level promotion-relegation framework. Our model captures the critical inter-temporal incentives driven by an agent's farsightedness, skill retention, and a leg-up effect where qualification and attainment can be self-reinforcing. We characterize the agent's optimal long-term strategy and demonstrate that a principal can design a sequence of thresholds to effectively incentivize honest effort. Crucially, we prove that under mild conditions, this mechanism enables agents to reach arbitrarily high levels solely through genuine improvement efforts.

### [190] [Hierarchical Concept Embedding & Pursuit for Interpretable Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11448)
*Nghia Nguyen,Tianjiao Ding,René Vidal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HCEP introduces hierarchical concept embedding and pursuit to improve interpretability and accuracy in image classification by leveraging hierarchical sparse coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpretable-by-design models in computer vision often ignore hierarchical concept structures, leading to inconsistent explanations. HCEP addresses this gap by incorporating hierarchical relationships.

Method: HCEP constructs a hierarchy of concept embeddings and uses hierarchical sparse coding to recover concepts from images. It assumes the correct concepts form a rooted path in the hierarchy.

Result: HCEP outperforms baselines in concept precision and recall while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. It performs especially well with limited samples.

Conclusion: Incorporating hierarchical structures into sparse coding improves reliability and interpretability of image classification models.

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are gaining traction in computer vision because they provide faithful explanations for their predictions. In image classification, these models typically recover human-interpretable concepts from an image and use them for classification. Sparse concept recovery methods leverage the latent space of vision-language models to represent image embeddings as a sparse combination of concept embeddings. However, because such methods ignore the hierarchical structure of concepts, they can produce correct predictions with explanations that are inconsistent with the hierarchy. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept Embedding \& Pursuit (HCEP), a framework that induces a hierarchy of concept embeddings in the latent space and uses hierarchical sparse coding to recover the concepts present in an image. Given a hierarchy of semantic concepts, we construct a corresponding hierarchy of concept embeddings and, assuming the correct concepts for an image form a rooted path in the hierarchy, derive desirable conditions for identifying them in the embedded space. We show that hierarchical sparse coding reliably recovers hierarchical concept embeddings, whereas vanilla sparse coding fails. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HCEP outperforms baselines in concept precision and recall while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Moreover, when the number of samples is limited, HCEP achieves superior classification accuracy and concept recovery. These results show that incorporating hierarchical structures into sparse coding yields more reliable and interpretable image classification models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MT-AIM, a deep learning model using synthetic data and feature augmentation to classify lower back movements accurately despite noisy, small-scale data from Motion Tape sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Back pain is common and worsened by certain movements, but remote monitoring is challenging due to costly sensors. Motion Tape offers a low-cost alternative but has small, noisy datasets.

Method: MT-AIM uses conditional generative models to create synthetic MT data and predict joint kinematics, enhancing classification pipeline training.

Result: MT-AIM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in classifying lower back movements, improving movement analysis with Motion Tape.

Conclusion: MT-AIM bridges the gap between physiological sensing and movement analysis, addressing Motion Tape's limitations with innovative synthetic data and feature augmentation.

Abstract: Back pain is a pervasive issue affecting a significant portion of the population, often worsened by certain movements of the lower back. Assessing these movements is important for helping clinicians prescribe appropriate physical therapy. However, it can be difficult to monitor patients' movements remotely outside the clinic. High-fidelity data from motion capture sensors can be used to classify different movements, but these sensors are costly and impractical for use in free-living environments. Motion Tape (MT), a new fabric-based wearable sensor, addresses these issues by being low cost and portable. Despite these advantages, novelty and variability in sensor stability make the MT dataset small scale and inherent to noise. In this work, we propose the Motion-Tape Augmentation Inference Model (MT-AIM), a deep learning classification pipeline trained on MT data. In order to address the challenges of limited sample size and noise present within the MT dataset, MT-AIM leverages conditional generative models to generate synthetic MT data of a desired movement, as well as predicting joint kinematics as additional features. This combination of synthetic data generation and feature augmentation enables MT-AIM to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in classifying lower back movements, bridging the gap between physiological sensing and movement analysis.

TL;DR: A novel method recovers sparse vectors from Poisson noise-corrupted linear models using an external-division Bregman operator, improving stability and performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bias introduced by classical ℓ₁-norm regularization and enhance sparse solution recovery in Poisson noise scenarios.

Method: Introduces an external-division Bregman operator embedded into the NoLips algorithm, replacing standard Bregman operators, with geometric insights via primal-dual space interpretations.

Result: Shows more stable convergence and superior performance on synthetic data and image restoration compared to KL-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates bias and outperforms conventional techniques in Poisson noise settings.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for recovering sparse vectors from linear models corrupted by Poisson noise. The contribution is twofold. First, an operator defined via the external division of two Bregman proximity operators is introduced to promote sparse solutions while mitigating the estimation bias induced by classical $\ell_1$-norm regularization. This operator is then embedded into the already established NoLips algorithm, replacing the standard Bregman proximity operator in a plug-and-play manner. Second, the geometric structure of the proposed external-division operator is elucidated through two complementary reformulations, which provide clear interpretations in terms of the primal and dual spaces of the Poisson inverse problem. Numerical tests show that the proposed method exhibits more stable convergence behavior than conventional Kullback-Leibler (KL)-based approaches and achieves significantly superior performance on synthetic data and an image restoration problem.

TL;DR: CMAB-GFN integrates combinatorial multi-armed bandits with GFlowNets to improve efficiency by pruning low-quality actions and focusing exploration on high-reward subspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GFlowNets struggle with excessive exploration in large state spaces, leading to suboptimal sampling and convergence. Addressing this challenge is crucial for better performance.

Method: The proposed CMAB-GFN combines GFlowNets with a combinatorial multi-armed bandit framework to prune low-quality actions and explore high-scoring subspaces efficiently.

Result: Experiments show CMAB-GFN generates higher-reward candidates compared to existing methods, maintaining diversity while improving efficiency.

Conclusion: CMAB-GFN effectively addresses the challenge of inefficient exploration in GFlowNets, enhancing performance without sacrificing diversity.

Abstract: As a probabilistic sampling framework, Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) show strong potential for constructing complex combinatorial objects through the sequential composition of elementary components. However, existing GFlowNets often suffer from excessive exploration over vast state spaces, leading to over-sampling of low-reward regions and convergence to suboptimal distributions. Effectively biasing GFlowNets toward high-reward solutions remains a non-trivial challenge. In this paper, we propose CMAB-GFN, which integrates a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) framework with GFlowNet policies. The CMAB component prunes low-quality actions, yielding compact high-scoring subspaces for exploration. Restricting GFNs to these compact high-scoring subspaces accelerates the discovery of high-value candidates, while the exploration of different subspaces ensures that diversity is not sacrificed. Experimental results on multiple tasks demonstrate that CMAB-GFN generates higher-reward candidates than existing approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TL;DR: This paper improves GFlowNets by restricting actor exploration using a planner to partition state space, enabling faster convergence and higher reward/diversity candidates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GFlowNets struggle with convergence in large state spaces due to free exploration.

Method: Introduces a planner to partition state space into overlapping partial regions and a heuristic strategy to switch regions, optimizing exploration.

Result: Achieves faster convergence, higher rewards, and improved diversity in candidate generation.

Conclusion: Restricting actor exploration via partial state spaces enhances GFlowNets' scalability and performance.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have shown promising potential to generate high-scoring candidates with probability proportional to their rewards. As existing GFlowNets freely explore in state space, they encounter significant convergence challenges when scaling to large state spaces. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes to restrict the exploration of actor. A planner is introduced to partition the entire state space into overlapping partial state spaces. Given their limited size, these partial state spaces allow the actor to efficiently identify subregions with higher rewards. A heuristic strategy is introduced to switch partial regions thus preventing the actor from wasting time exploring fully explored or low-reward partial regions. By iteratively exploring these partial state spaces, the actor learns to converge towards the high-reward subregions within the entire state space. Experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate that \modelname converges faster than existing works on large state spaces. Furthermore, \modelname not only generates candidates with higher rewards but also significantly improves their diversity.

*Diptarka Chakraborty,Kushagra Chatterjee,Debarati Das,Tien-Long Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fair consensus clustering algorithm for streaming data, requiring minimal memory and offering improved approximation guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of offline methods by enabling fair consensus clustering in a streaming model with limited memory.

Method: Designs a constant-factor algorithm using a framework integrating closest fair clustering and cluster fitting.

Result: Achieves logarithmic memory usage and improved approximation guarantees, applicable to various fairness definitions.

Conclusion: The framework is versatile, extending to k-median clustering and applicable offline, enhancing scalability and fairness.

Abstract: Consensus clustering seeks to combine multiple clusterings of the same dataset, potentially derived by considering various non-sensitive attributes by different agents in a multi-agent environment, into a single partitioning that best reflects the overall structure of the underlying dataset. Recent work by Chakraborty et al, introduced a fair variant under proportionate fairness and obtained a constant-factor approximation by naively selecting the best closest fair input clustering; however, their offline approach requires storing all input clusterings, which is prohibitively expensive for most large-scale applications.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of fair consensus clustering in the streaming model, where input clusterings arrive sequentially and memory is limited. We design the first constant-factor algorithm that processes the stream while storing only a logarithmic number of inputs. En route, we introduce a new generic algorithmic framework that integrates closest fair clustering with cluster fitting, yielding improved approximation guarantees not only in the streaming setting but also when revisited offline. Furthermore, the framework is fairness-agnostic: it applies to any fairness definition for which an approximately close fair clustering can be computed efficiently. Finally, we extend our methods to the more general k-median consensus clustering problem.

### [196] [Calibrating an Imperfect Auxiliary Predictor for Unobserved No-Purchase Choice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11505)
*Jiangkai Xiong,Kalyan Talluri,Hanzhao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of estimating consumer preferences and market size when firms lack data on outside options (e.g., competitor purchases or no-purchase decisions). It proposes calibration methods to improve predictions using imperfect auxiliary predictors and purchase-only data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Firms often lack visibility into key consumer actions, making market-size and preference estimation difficult. Existing methods rely on auxiliary data, which may be biased or miscalibrated due to differences in channels, periods, or populations.

Method: The authors develop two calibration methods: one for affine miscalibration in logit space (using simple regression) and another for nearly monotone conditions (using rank-based calibration with finite-sample error bounds). These methods leverage purchase-only data and auxiliary predictors.

Result: The methods enable consistent recovery of no-purchase probabilities and improve estimation accuracy. Numerical experiments show enhancements in no-purchase estimation and downstream assortment optimization decisions.

Conclusion: The proposed calibration methods provide statistically valid estimates of outside-option probabilities, even with imperfect predictors. The results highlight the importance of predictor alignment and utility-learning accuracy for improving decision-making in assortment optimization.

Abstract: Firms typically cannot observe key consumer actions: whether customers buy from a competitor, choose not to buy, or even fully consider the firm's offer. This missing outside-option information makes market-size and preference estimation difficult even in simple multinomial logit (MNL) models, and it is a central obstacle in practice when only transaction data are recorded. Existing approaches often rely on auxiliary market-share, aggregated, or cross-market data. We study a complementary setting in which a black-box auxiliary predictor provides outside-option probabilities, but is potentially biased or miscalibrated because it was trained in a different channel, period, or population, or produced by an external machine-learning system. We develop calibration methods that turn such imperfect predictions into statistically valid no-purchase estimates using purchase-only data from the focal environment. First, under affine miscalibration in logit space, we show that a simple regression identifies outside-option utility parameters and yields consistent recovery of no-purchase probabilities without collecting new labels for no-purchase events. Second, under a weaker nearly monotone condition, we propose a rank-based calibration method and derive finite-sample error bounds that cleanly separate auxiliary-predictor quality from first-stage utility-learning error over observed in-set choices. Our analysis also translates estimation error into downstream decision quality for assortment optimization, quantifying how calibration accuracy affects revenue performance. The bounds provide explicit dependence on predictor alignment and utility-learning error, clarifying when each source dominates. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements in no-purchase estimation and downstream assortment decisions, and we discuss robust aggregation extensions for combining multiple auxiliary predictors.

TL;DR: A systematic framework based on the Roofline model is proposed to measure SLMs' performance on edge hardware, introducing Relative Inference Potential for efficiency comparison.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transition to localized intelligence via SLMs necessitates rigorous performance characterization on resource-constrained edge hardware, addressing the challenge of measuring diverse architectures across heterogeneous platforms.

Method: A systematic framework using the Roofline model unifies architectural primitives and hardware constraints via operational intensity (OI), introducing Relative Inference Potential for efficiency comparison.

Result: Empirical analysis shows sequence length significantly affects performance and OI, with a critical regression in OI as model depth increases. Structural refinements like MLA unlock latent inference potential.

Conclusion: The framework offers actionable insights for hardware-software co-design to align neural structures with physical constraints in on-device intelligence.

Abstract: The transition toward localized intelligence through Small Language Models (SLMs) has intensified the need for rigorous performance characterization on resource-constrained edge hardware. However, objectively measuring the theoretical performance ceilings of diverse architectures across heterogeneous platforms remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we propose a systematic framework based on the Roofline model that unifies architectural primitives and hardware constraints through the lens of operational intensity (OI). By defining an inference-potential region, we introduce the Relative Inference Potential as a novel metric to compare efficiency differences between Large Language Models (LLMs) on the same hardware substrate. Extensive empirical analysis across diverse compute tiers reveals that variations in performance and OI are significantly influenced by sequence length. We further identify a critical regression in OI as model depth increases. Additionally, our findings highlight an efficiency trap induced by hardware heterogeneity and demonstrate how structural refinements, such as Multi-head Latent Attention (M LA), can effectively unlock latent inference potential across various hardware substrates. These insights provide actionable directions for hardware-software co-design to align neural structures with physical constraints in on-device intelligence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified regularization approach for RLHF to balance preventing reward hacking and maintaining stable policy updates, improving alignment performance and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLHF methods address reward hacking and stable optimization separately, leading to an unexplored implicit trade-off. The paper aims to unify these objectives for better alignment.

Method: The authors introduce a unified regularization approach combining KL-divergence penalty against a supervised fine-tuned model ($π_0$) and policy ratio clipping towards the current policy ($π_t$), resulting in a weighted supervised fine-tuning loss.

Result: Experiments show the method outperforms RLHF and online preference learning, achieving better alignment performance and stability.

Conclusion: The unified approach provides a superior trade-off, simplifying implementation while enhancing alignment results.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has advanced alignment capabilities significantly but remains hindered by two core challenges: \textbf{reward hacking} and \textbf{stable optimization}. Current solutions independently address these issues through separate regularization strategies, specifically a KL-divergence penalty against a supervised fine-tuned model ($π_0$) to mitigate reward hacking, and policy ratio clipping towards the current policy ($π_t$) to promote stable alignment. However, the implicit trade-off arising from simultaneously regularizing towards both $π_0$ and $π_t$ remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce a unified regularization approach that explicitly balances the objectives of preventing reward hacking and maintaining stable policy updates. Our simple yet principled alignment objective yields a weighted supervised fine-tuning loss with a superior trade-off, which demonstrably improves both alignment results and implementation complexity. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate that our method consistently outperforms RLHF and online preference learning methods, achieving enhanced alignment performance and stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the temporal credit assignment problem in RL for long-horizon tasks, highlighting the limitations of traditional reward structures (outcome vs. process rewards).

Method: Proposes ADMIRE, which adaptively anchors rewards to dynamically distilled milestones and uses asymmetric credit assignment to denoise successful and scaffold failed trajectories.

Result: ADMIRE achieves over 10% absolute improvement in success rates across base models on AndroidWorld and shows strong generalizability in diverse RL algorithms and environments.

Conclusion: ADMIRE effectively resolves the reward fidelity-density trade-off, enhancing performance and adaptability in RL tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for training Mobile GUI Agents, yet it struggles with the temporal credit assignment problem inherent in long-horizon tasks. A primary challenge lies in the trade-off between reward fidelity and density: outcome reward offers high fidelity but suffers from signal sparsity, while process reward provides dense supervision but remains prone to bias and reward hacking. To resolve this conflict, we propose the Adaptive Milestone Reward (ADMIRE) mechanism. ADMIRE constructs a verifiable, adaptive reward system by anchoring trajectory to milestones, which are dynamically distilled from successful explorations. Crucially, ADMIRE integrates an asymmetric credit assignment strategy that denoises successful trajectories and scaffolds failed trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADMIRE consistently yields over 10% absolute improvement in success rate across different base models on AndroidWorld. Moreover, the method exhibits robust generalizability, achieving strong performance across diverse RL algorithms and heterogeneous environments such as web navigation and embodied tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM serving frameworks don't distinguish between reasoning and answering phases, causing performance issues under GPU memory constraints.

Method: PASCAL uses phase-aware scheduling, controlled preemption, token pacing, and dynamic migration at phase boundaries.

Result: PASCAL reduces tail TTFT by up to 72% while maintaining answering phase Service-Level Objective (SLO) attainment.

Conclusion: Phase-aware scheduling is crucial for improving performance in reasoning-based LLM deployments.

Abstract: The emergence of reasoning-based LLMs leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) inference introduces new serving challenges, as their extended reasoning phases delay user-visible output and inflate Time-To-First-Token (TTFT). Existing LLM serving frameworks fail to distinguish between reasoning and answering phases, leading to performance degradation under GPU memory constraints. We present PASCAL, a phase-aware scheduling algorithm that prioritizes reasoning to reduce TTFT while using controlled preemption and token pacing during answering to preserve Quality-of-Experience (QoE). Our hierarchical scheduler combines instance-level placement with intra-instance execution and enables dynamic migration at phase boundaries to balance load and reduce interference. Across benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, PASCAL reduces tail TTFT by up to 72% while maintaining answering phase SLO attainment, demonstrating the importance of phase-aware scheduling for reasoning-based LLM deployment.

TL;DR: ALTTS, a dual-path framework, decouples autoregression and cross-relation modeling in multivariate time series forecasting to improve long-horizon accuracy by alternating optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the conflict in optimizing a single model for both autoregressive dynamics and cross-dimension interactions, which can degrade long-horizon forecasting.

Method: ALTTS uses a linear predictor for autoregression and a Transformer with Cross-Relation Self-Attention for cross-relation modeling, coordinated via alternating optimization.

Result: ALTTS outperforms prior methods, especially in long-horizon forecasting, demonstrating the effectiveness of decoupling and optimizing the two factors separately.

Conclusion: Careful optimization strategies, rather than complex architectures, can significantly advance multivariate time series forecasting.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting involves two qualitatively distinct factors: (i) stable within-series autoregressive (AR) dynamics, and (ii) intermittent cross-dimension interactions that can become spurious over long horizons. We argue that fitting a single model to capture both effects creates an optimization conflict: the high-variance updates needed for cross-dimension modeling can corrupt the gradients that support autoregression, resulting in brittle training and degraded long-horizon accuracy. To address this, we propose ALTTS, a dual-path framework that explicitly decouples autoregression and cross-relation (CR) modeling. In ALTTS, the AR path is instantiated with a linear predictor, while the CR path uses a Transformer equipped with Cross-Relation Self-Attention (CRSA); the two branches are coordinated via alternating optimization to isolate gradient noise and reduce cross-block interference. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ALTTS consistently outperforms prior methods, with the most pronounced improvements on long-horizon forecasting. Overall, our results suggest that carefully designed optimization strategies, rather than ever more complex architectures, can be a key driver of progress in multivariate time series forecasting.

### [202] [Krause Synchronization Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11534)
*Jingkun Liu,Yisong Yue,Max Welling,Yue Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Krause Attention replaces global softmax normalization in Transformers with localized, distance-based interactions to prevent representation collapse and reduce computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional self-attention in Transformers leads to synchronization dynamics and attention sinks, causing representation collapse. This paper aims to address these issues with a novel attention mechanism.

Method: Introduces Krause Attention, inspired by bounded-confidence consensus dynamics, which uses distance-based, localized, and selectively sparse interactions instead of global aggregation.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements in vision tasks, autoregressive generation, and large language models, with reduced computational complexity.

Conclusion: Krause Attention offers a scalable and effective inductive bias for attention, alleviating issues like attention sinks and reducing runtime complexity.

Abstract: Self-attention in Transformers relies on globally normalized softmax weights, causing all tokens to compete for influence at every layer. When composed across depth, this interaction pattern induces strong synchronization dynamics that favor convergence toward a dominant mode, a behavior associated with representation collapse and attention sink phenomena. We introduce Krause Attention, a principled attention mechanism inspired by bounded-confidence consensus dynamics. Krause Attention replaces similarity-based global aggregation with distance-based, localized, and selectively sparse interactions, promoting structured local synchronization instead of global mixing. We relate this behavior to recent theory modeling Transformer dynamics as interacting particle systems, and show how bounded-confidence interactions naturally moderate attention concentration and alleviate attention sinks. Restricting interactions to local neighborhoods also reduces runtime complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. Experiments across vision (ViT on CIFAR/ImageNet), autoregressive generation (MNIST/CIFAR-10), and large language models (Llama/Qwen) demonstrate consistent gains with substantially reduced computation, highlighting bounded-confidence dynamics as a scalable and effective inductive bias for attention.

*Yuanfu Wang,Zhixuan Liu,Xiangtian Li,Chaochao Lu,Chao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introducing NRT (Native Reasoning Training), a novel framework overcoming the constraints of current reasoning models by generating its own reasoning traces from standard QA pairs, eliminating expert-written data dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations like high costs, human biases, and restricted verifiable domains inherent in current SFT and RLVR training paradigms.

Method: NRT treats reasoning as latent variables, uses a unified objective optimizing reasoning paths to increase likelihood of correct answers, and designs robust reward aggregation functions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming SFT and prior verifier-free RL methods, with strong gains in complex reasoning and robustness.

Conclusion: NRT provides a scalable, general solution for building powerful reasoning systems without dependency on external verifiers or expert data.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for training large reasoning models--combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)--is fundamentally constrained by its reliance on high-quality, human-annotated reasoning data and external verifiers. This dependency incurs significant data-collection costs, risks embedding human cognitive biases, and confines the reinforcement learning stage to objectively assessable domains like mathematics and coding, leaving a wide range of unverifiable tasks beyond its scope. To overcome these limitations, we introduce NRT (Native Reasoning Training), a novel framework that cultivates complex reasoning by having the model generate its own reasoning traces using only standard question-answer pairs, thereby obviating the need for expert-written demonstrations. NRT reframes the training problem by treating the reasoning process as a latent variable. It employs a unified training objective that models reasoning as an optimization problem, intrinsically rewarding paths that increase the model's likelihood of producing the ground-truth answer. This unified perspective allows us to analyze intrinsic failure modes of prior methods, such as policy collapse, and systematically design more robust reward aggregation functions, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop where the model learns to think in ways that resolve its own uncertainty. Empirical evaluation on Llama and Mistral model families demonstrates that NRT achieves state-of-the-art performance among verifier-free methods, significantly outperforming standard SFT baselines and prior verifier-free RL methods. Our approach yields particularly strong performance gains in complex reasoning domains and exhibits high robustness to policy collapse, offering a general, scalable path toward building more powerful and broadly applicable reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TS-Memory is a lightweight memory adapter for Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) that combines parametric adaptation and non-parametric retrieval to improve forecasting without costly latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting TSFMs to downstream domains under distribution shift is challenging due to trade-offs between catastrophic forgetting (parametric) and high inference latency (non-parametric).

Method: TS-Memory uses Parametric Memory Distillation in two stages: (1) offline kNN teacher synthesis of confidence-aware quantile targets, (2) distillation into a lightweight adapter with confidence-gated supervision.

Result: TS-Memory improves forecasting accuracy and efficiency across diverse benchmarks, matching frozen backbone efficiency while outperforming other adaptation methods.

Conclusion: TS-Memory successfully addresses domain adaptation challenges in TSFMs, offering retrieval-free deployment with consistent performance gains.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) achieve strong zero-shot forecasting through large-scale pre-training, but adapting them to downstream domains under distribution shift remains challenging. Existing solutions face a trade-off: Parametric Adaptation can cause catastrophic forgetting and requires costly multi-domain maintenance, while Non-Parametric Retrieval improves forecasts but incurs high inference latency due to datastore search. We propose Parametric Memory Distillation and implement it as TS-Memory, a lightweight memory adapter that augments frozen TSFMs. TS-Memory is trained in two stages. First, we construct an offline, leakage-safe kNN teacher that synthesizes confidence-aware quantile targets from retrieved futures. Second, we distill this retrieval-induced distributional correction into a lightweight memory adapter via confidence-gated supervision. During inference, TS-Memory fuses memory and backbone predictions with constant-time overhead, enabling retrieval-free deployment. Experiments across diverse TSFMs and benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both point and probabilistic forecasting over representative adaptation methods, with efficiency comparable to the frozen backbone.

### [205] [The Implicit Bias of Steepest Descent with Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11557)
*Jichu Li,Xuan Tang,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how batch size, momentum, and variance reduction affect the max-margin behavior and convergence rates of mini-batch stochastic steepest descent in multi-class classification under specific norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the implicit bias of stochastic steepest descent methods and clarify when stochastic optimization aligns with full-batch behavior, improving upon prior results.

Method: Study mini-batch stochastic steepest descent under general norms, examining batch size, momentum, and variance reduction's impact on convergence and bias.

Result: Without momentum, convergence requires large batches, while momentum enables small-batch convergence but slows rates. Variance reduction recovers full-batch bias for any batch size. Batch-size-one updates yield a different bias.

Conclusion: The unified analysis provides explicit, dimension-free rates and clarifies conditions for stochastic optimization to match full-batch behavior, aiding further exploration of stochastic gradient algorithms.

Abstract: A variety of widely used optimization methods like SignSGD and Muon can be interpreted as instances of steepest descent under different norm-induced geometries. In this work, we study the implicit bias of mini-batch stochastic steepest descent in multi-class classification, characterizing how batch size, momentum, and variance reduction shape the limiting max-margin behavior and convergence rates under general entry-wise and Schatten-$p$ norms. We show that without momentum, convergence only occurs with large batches, yielding a batch-dependent margin gap but the full-batch convergence rate. In contrast, momentum enables small-batch convergence through a batch-momentum trade-off, though it slows convergence. This approach provides fully explicit, dimension-free rates that improve upon prior results. Moreover, we prove that variance reduction can recover the exact full-batch implicit bias for any batch size, albeit at a slower convergence rate. Finally, we further investigate the batch-size-one steepest descent without momentum, and reveal its convergence to a fundamentally different bias via a concrete data example, which reveals a key limitation of purely stochastic updates. Overall, our unified analysis clarifies when stochastic optimization aligns with full-batch behavior, and paves the way for perform deeper explorations of the training behavior of stochastic gradient steepest descent algorithms.

TL;DR: Brain Foundation Models (BFMs) advance neuroscience but lack standardized evaluation. Brain4FMs introduces an open platform for unified benchmarking of BFMs using SSL taxonomy and public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of unified understanding and standardized evaluation of BFMs in neuroscience, facilitating more accurate and transferable models.

Method: Organizes BFMs under a self-supervised learning taxonomy and summarizes downstream tasks with curated datasets. Introduces Brain4FMs, an open platform integrating 15 BFMs and 18 datasets for standardized evaluation.

Result: Brain4FMs enables systematic comparison of pretraining data, SSL strategies, and architectures' impact on BFM performance.

Conclusion: The platform guides future development of BFMs by providing a standardized framework for evaluation and analysis.

Abstract: Brain Foundation Models (BFMs) are transforming neuroscience by enabling scalable and transferable learning from neural signals, advancing both clinical diagnostics and cutting-edge neuroscience exploration. Their emergence is powered by large-scale clinical recordings, particularly electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG, which provide rich temporal and spatial representations of brain dynamics. However, despite their rapid proliferation, the field lacks a unified understanding of existing methodologies and a standardized evaluation framework. To fill this gap, we map the benchmark design space along two axes: (i) from the model perspective, we organize BFMs under a self-supervised learning (SSL) taxonomy; and (ii) from the dataset perspective, we summarize common downstream tasks and curate representative public datasets across clinical and human-centric neurotechnology applications. Building on this consolidation, we introduce Brain4FMs, an open evaluation platform with plug-and-play interfaces that integrates 15 representative BFMs and 18 public datasets. It enables standardized comparisons and analysis of how pretraining data, SSL strategies, and architectures affect generalization and downstream performance, guiding more accurate and transferable BFMs. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Brain4FMs-85B8.

### [207] [Gradient Compression May Hurt Generalization: A Remedy by Synthetic Data Guided Sharpness Aware Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11584)
*Yujie Gu,Richeng Jin,Zhaoyang Zhang,Huaiyu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient compression in federated learning (FL) sharpens loss landscapes, hurting generalization. FedSynSAM uses global model trajectories for accurate perturbation estimation, improving FL performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient compression in FL, though communication-efficient, causes sharper loss landscapes and hinders generalization, especially under non-IID data. SAM's direct use in FL fails due to data heterogeneity and compression.

Method: Proposes FedSynSAM, leveraging global model trajectories to create synthetic data for accurate global perturbation estimation, addressing SAM's limitations in FL.

Result: FedSynSAM achieves accurate perturbation estimation, improving FL performance, with convergence guarantees and experimental validation.

Conclusion: FedSynSAM effectively mitigates the negative impact of gradient compression in FL, enhancing generalization through better perturbation estimation.

Abstract: It is commonly believed that gradient compression in federated learning (FL) enjoys significant improvement in communication efficiency with negligible performance degradation. In this paper, we find that gradient compression induces sharper loss landscapes in federated learning, particularly under non-IID data distributions, which suggests hindered generalization capability. The recently emerging Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) effectively searches for a flat minima by incorporating a gradient ascent step (i.e., perturbing the model with gradients) before the celebrated stochastic gradient descent. Nonetheless, the direct application of SAM in FL suffers from inaccurate estimation of the global perturbation due to data heterogeneity. Existing approaches propose to utilize the model update from the previous communication round as a rough estimate. However, its effectiveness is hindered when model update compression is incorporated. In this paper, we propose FedSynSAM, which leverages the global model trajectory to construct synthetic data and facilitates an accurate estimation of the global perturbation. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is established, and extensive experiments are conducted to validate its effectiveness.

### [208] [Learn from Your Mistakes: Self-Correcting Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11590)
*Yair Schiff,Omer Belhasin,Roy Uziel,Guanghan Wang,Marianne Arriola,Gilad Turok,Michael Elad,Volodymyr Kuleshov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Progressive Self-Correction (ProSeCo) enhances masked diffusion models by allowing iterative refinement of generated tokens, improving quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) fix tokens once unmasked, leading to error accumulation and degraded sample quality. ProSeCo aims to address this by enabling corrections during generation.

Method: ProSeCo trains a model to perform both unmasking and correction, reusing denoising outputs for corrector training. It applies corrective refinement steps between unmasking ones to improve outputs.

Result: ProSeCo achieves better quality-efficiency trade-offs (up to 2-3x faster sampling) and improves sample quality (up to 1.3x over standard MDMs).

Conclusion: ProSeCo effectively mitigates error accumulation in MDMs, offering scalable and high-quality generation.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models, enabling parallel token generation while achieving competitive performance. Despite these advantages, MDMs face a fundamental limitation: once tokens are unmasked, they remain fixed, leading to error accumulation and ultimately degrading sample quality. We address this by proposing a framework that trains a model to perform both unmasking and correction. By reusing outputs from the MDM denoising network as inputs for corrector training, we train a model to recover from potential mistakes. During generation we apply additional corrective refinement steps between unmasking ones in order to change decoded tokens and improve outputs. We name our training and sampling method Progressive Self-Correction (ProSeCo) for its unique ability to iteratively refine an entire sequence, including already generated tokens. We conduct extensive experimental validation across multiple conditional and unconditional tasks, demonstrating that ProSeCo yields better quality-efficiency trade-offs (up to ~2-3x faster sampling) and enables inference-time compute scaling to further increase sample quality beyond standard MDMs (up to ~1.3x improvement on benchmarks).

*Naveen Sahi,Jeremy Dohmann,Armen Aghajanyan,Akshat Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SkillRater, a multidimensional data filtering framework, outperforms monolithic scorers by decomposing quality into specialized raters for each capability, validated on vision language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlighting the limitations of scalar quality scores, the paper proposes multidimensional quality assessment to better train models requiring diverse capabilities.

Method: SkillRater uses meta-learning to train specialized raters per capability, progressively selecting samples via dynamic thresholds.

Result: At 2B parameters, SkillRater improves performance by 5.63%, 2.00%, and 3.53% on visual understanding, OCR, and STEM benchmarks, respectively.

Conclusion: SkillRater's orthogonal rater signals confirm its effectiveness in capturing independent quality dimensions, outperforming traditional filtering methods.

Abstract: Data curation methods typically assign samples a single quality score. We argue this scalar framing is fundamentally limited: when training requires multiple distinct capabilities, a monolithic scorer cannot maximize useful signals for all of them simultaneously. Quality is better understood as multidimensional, with each dimension corresponding to a capability the model must acquire. We introduce SkillRater, a framework that decomposes data filtering into specialized raters - one per capability, each trained via meta-learning on a disjoint validation objective - and composes their scores through a progressive selection rule: at each training stage, a sample is retained if any rater ranks it above a threshold that tightens over time, preserving diversity early while concentrating on high-value samples late. We validate this approach on vision language models, decomposing quality into three capability dimensions: visual understanding, OCR, and STEM reasoning. At 2B parameters, SkillRater improves over unfiltered baselines by 5.63% on visual understanding, 2.00% on OCR, and 3.53% on STEM on held out benchmarks. The learned rater signals are near orthogonal, confirming that the decomposition captures genuinely independent quality dimensions and explaining why it outperforms both unfiltered training and monolithic learned filtering.

*Tatsuya Sagawa,Ryosuke Kojima*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Scaling training resources improves pretraining loss in Chemical Language Models (CLMs), but downstream task performance shows limited or no improvement, revealing a disconnect between pretraining metrics and actual performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically validate whether increasing training resources (model size, dataset size, compute) improves both pretraining loss and downstream task performance in CLMs.

Method: Pretrain CLMs while scaling training resources and measure transfer performance across diverse molecular property prediction tasks. Analyze metrics like Hessian or loss landscape and visualize parameter space.

Result: Pretraining loss decreases with increased resources, but downstream performance improves minimally or degrades. Alternative metrics fail to predict downstream performance.

Conclusion: Pretraining metrics do not reliably predict downstream performance; model selection and evaluation must consider downstream task characteristics.

Abstract: Chemical Language Models (CLMs) pre-trained on large scale molecular data are widely used for molecular property prediction. However, the common belief that increasing training resources such as model size, dataset size, and training compute improves both pretraining loss and downstream task performance has not been systematically validated in the chemical domain. In this work, we evaluate this assumption by pretraining CLMs while scaling training resources and measuring transfer performance across diverse molecular property prediction (MPP) tasks. We find that while pretraining loss consistently decreases with increased training resources, downstream task performance shows limited improvement. Moreover, alternative metrics based on the Hessian or loss landscape also fail to estimate downstream performance in CLMs. We further identify conditions under which downstream performance saturates or degrades despite continued improvements in pretraining metrics, and analyze the underlying task dependent failure modes through parameter space visualizations. These results expose a gap between pretraining based evaluation and downstream performance, and emphasize the need for model selection and evaluation strategies that explicitly account for downstream task characteristics.

*Weida Li,Yaoliang Yu,Bryan Kian Hsiang Low*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper revisits probabilistic values for feature ranking in decision trees, introduces TreeGrad for efficient gradient computation, and proposes TreeGrad-Ranker and TreeGrad-Shap for improved feature ranking and Shapley value calculation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability of feature rankings in decision trees by addressing the unreliability of probabilistic values in joint optimization tasks.

Method: Proposes TreeGrad for gradient computation in O(L) time, TreeGrad-Ranker for feature ranking, and TreeGrad-Shap for stable Shapley value calculation.

Result: TreeGrad-Ranker outperforms existing methods on insertion and deletion metrics, and TreeGrad-Shap reduces numerical errors significantly.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide more reliable and efficient feature rankings and Shapley value calculations for decision trees.

Abstract: We revisit the use of probabilistic values, which include the well-known Shapley and Banzhaf values, to rank features for explaining the local predicted values of decision trees. The quality of feature rankings is typically assessed with the insertion and deletion metrics. Empirically, we observe that co-optimizing these two metrics is closely related to a joint optimization that selects a subset of features to maximize the local predicted value while minimizing it for the complement. However, we theoretically show that probabilistic values are generally unreliable for solving this joint optimization. Therefore, we explore deriving feature rankings by directly optimizing the joint objective. As the backbone, we propose TreeGrad, which computes the gradients of the multilinear extension of the joint objective in $O(L)$ time for decision trees with $L$ leaves; these gradients include weighted Banzhaf values. Building upon TreeGrad, we introduce TreeGrad-Ranker, which aggregates the gradients while optimizing the joint objective to produce feature rankings, and TreeGrad-Shap, a numerically stable algorithm for computing Beta Shapley values with integral parameters. In particular, the feature scores computed by TreeGrad-Ranker satisfy all the axioms uniquely characterizing probabilistic values, except for linearity, which itself leads to the established unreliability. Empirically, we demonstrate that the numerical error of Linear TreeShap can be up to $10^{15}$ times larger than that of TreeGrad-Shap when computing the Shapley value. As a by-product, we also develop TreeProb, which generalizes Linear TreeShap to support all probabilistic values. In our experiments, TreeGrad-Ranker performs significantly better on both insertion and deletion metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/watml/TreeGrad.

TL;DR: ArGEnT is a geometry-aware Transformer-based architecture for operator learning on arbitrary domains, integrated into DeepONet, outperforming standard methods in accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of learning solution operators for systems with complex, varying geometries and parametric settings in scientific machine learning.

Method: Proposes ArGEnT, a Transformer-based architecture with self-attention, cross-attention, and hybrid-attention variants to encode geometric information from point-cloud representations.

Result: Demonstrates improved prediction accuracy and generalization across fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, and electrochemical systems, especially with cross-attention.

Conclusion: ArGEnT offers a scalable surrogate modeling framework for optimization and uncertainty quantification in complex physical systems.

Abstract: Learning solution operators for systems with complex, varying geometries and parametric physical settings is a central challenge in scientific machine learning. In many-query regimes such as design optimization, control and inverse problems, surrogate modeling must generalize across geometries while allowing flexible evaluation at arbitrary spatial locations. In this work, we propose Arbitrary Geometry-encoded Transformer (ArGEnT), a geometry-aware attention-based architecture for operator learning on arbitrary domains. ArGEnT employs Transformer attention mechanisms to encode geometric information directly from point-cloud representations with three variants-self-attention, cross-attention, and hybrid-attention-that incorporates different strategies for incorporating geometric features. By integrating ArGEnT into DeepONet as the trunk network, we develop a surrogate modeling framework capable of learning operator mappings that depend on both geometric and non-geometric inputs without the need to explicitly parametrize geometry as a branch network input. Evaluation on benchmark problems spanning fluid dynamics, solid mechanics and electrochemical systems, we demonstrate significantly improved prediction accuracy and generalization performance compared with the standard DeepONet and other existing geometry-aware saurrogates. In particular, the cross-attention transformer variant enables accurate geometry-conditioned predictions with reduced reliance on signed distance functions. By combining flexible geometry encoding with operator-learning capabilities, ArGEnT provides a scalable surrogate modeling framework for optimization, uncertainty quantification, and data-driven modeling of complex physical systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) is effective in cross-domain scenarios due to integrating pre-trained knowledge and task-specific adaptation, leading to improved performance over simpler methods like full fine-tuning and linear probing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why GPL works in cross-domain settings and improve its effectiveness by combining pre-trained knowledge with task-specific adaptation.

Method: A dual-branch GPL method (GP2F) is introduced, featuring a frozen branch for pre-trained knowledge and an adapted branch with lightweight adapters, fused adaptively under topology constraints.

Result: GP2F outperforms existing methods in cross-domain few-shot node and graph classification tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating pre-trained knowledge with task-specific adaptation enhances GPL performance in cross-domain scenarios, validated by theoretical and empirical results.

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for downstream adaptation of pre-trained graph models, mitigating the misalignment between pre-training objectives and downstream tasks. Recently, the focus of GPL has shifted from in-domain to cross-domain scenarios, which is closer to the real world applications, where the pre-training source and downstream target often differ substantially in data distribution. However, why GPLs remain effective under such domain shifts is still unexplored. Empirically, we observe that representative GPL methods are competitive with two simple baselines in cross-domain settings: full fine-tuning (FT) and linear probing (LP), motivating us to explore a deeper understanding of the prompting mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that jointly leveraging these two complementary branches yields a smaller estimation error than using either branch alone, formally proving that cross-domain GPL benefits from the integration between pre-trained knowledge and task-specific adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose GP2F, a dual-branch GPL method that explicitly instantiates the two extremes: (1) a frozen branch that retains pre-trained knowledge, and (2) an adapted branch with lightweight adapters for task-specific adaptation. We then perform adaptive fusion under topology constraints via a contrastive loss and a topology-consistent loss. Extensive experiments on cross-domain few-shot node and graph classification demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

*Jianhua Wang,Yinlin Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TIP is a novel defense framework for Federated Learning that selectively perturbs high-frequency components of critical gradients to protect against Gradient Inversion Attacks while preserving model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses like DP degrade model utility by adding uniform noise. TIP aims to protect privacy without sacrificing accuracy by targeting perturbations where they matter most.

Method: TIP uses Grad-CAM to identify sensitive convolution channels, transforms them into the frequency domain, and selectively perturbs high-frequency components.

Result: TIP makes reconstructed images unrecognizable while maintaining model accuracy, outperforming DP-based defenses in privacy-utility trade-off.

Conclusion: TIP offers a balanced and interpretable solution for defending against Gradient Inversion Attacks in Federated Learning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative model training while preserving data locality; however, the exchange of gradients renders the system vulnerable to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs), allowing adversaries to reconstruct private training data with high fidelity. Existing defenses, such as Differential Privacy (DP), typically employ indiscriminate noise injection across all parameters, which severely degrades model utility and convergence stability. To address those limitation, we proposes Targeted Interpretable Perturbation (TIP), a novel defense framework that integrates model interpretability with frequency domain analysis. Unlike conventional methods that treat parameters uniformly, TIP introduces a dual-targeting strategy. First, leveraging Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to quantify channel sensitivity, we dynamically identify critical convolution channels that encode primary semantic features. Second, we transform these selected kernels into the frequency domain via the Discrete Fourier Transform and selectively inject calibrated perturbations into the high-frequency spectrum. By selectively perturbing high-frequency components, TIP effectively destroys the fine-grained details necessary for image reconstruction while preserving the low-frequency information crucial for model accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TIP renders reconstructed images visually unrecognizable against state-of-the-art GIAs, while maintaining global model accuracy comparable to non-private baselines, significantly outperforming existing DP-based defenses in the privacy-utility trade-off and interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LG-Plug is a novel LLM-guided plug-and-play strategy for OOD detection in TAGs, combining topology and text representations to generate fine-grained embeddings and consensus-driven OOD exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs struggle with OOD nodes due to shallow text encoding or unreliable LLM-generated OOD priors, necessitating a method that balances semantic and structural information.

Method: LG-Plug aligns topology and text representations, uses clustered iterative LLM prompting for OOD exposure, and employs lightweight in-cluster codebook and heuristic sampling.

Result: The method generates reliable OOD exposure, improving detection performance while integrating seamlessly with existing detectors.

Conclusion: LG-Plug effectively addresses limitations of prior approaches by combining semantic and structural insights for robust OOD detection.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) associate nodes with textual attributes and graph structure, enabling GNNs to jointly model semantic and structural information. While effective on in-distribution (ID) data, GNNs often encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes with unseen textual or structural patterns in real-world settings, leading to overconfident and erroneous predictions in the absence of reliable OOD detection. Early approaches address this issue from a topology-driven perspective, leveraging neighboring structures to mitigate node-level detection bias. However, these methods typically encode node texts as shallow vector features, failing to fully exploit rich semantic information. In contrast, recent LLM-based approaches generate pseudo OOD priors by leveraging textual knowledge, but they suffer from several limitations: (1) a reliability-informativeness imbalance in the synthesized OOD priors, as the generated OOD exposures either deviate from the true OOD semantics, or introduce non-negligible ID noise, all of which offers limited improvement to detection performance; (2) reliance on specialized architectures, which prevents incorporation of the extensive effective topology-level insights that have been empirically validated in prior work. To this end, we propose LG-Plug, an LLM-Guided Plug-and-play strategy for TAG OOD detection tasks. LG-Plug aligns topology and text representations to produce fine-grained node embeddings, then generates consensus-driven OOD exposure via clustered iterative LLM prompting. Moreover, it leverages lightweight in-cluster codebook and heuristic sampling reduce time cost of LLM querying. The resulting OOD exposure serves as a regularization term to separate ID and OOD nodes, enabling seamless integration with existing detectors.

*Yang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes a formal equivalence between UMAP, spectral clustering, and contrastive learning, showing that UMAP performs spectral clustering on fuzzy k-nearest neighbor graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite UMAP's popularity, its exact relationship with classical spectral methods was informal. This work aims to provide a theoretical grounding.

Method: The proof involves showing UMAP's optimization as contrastive learning, linking it to spectral clustering via HaoChen et al.'s result, and validating UMAP's spectral initialization.

Result: The equivalence is exact for Gaussian kernels and holds approximately for UMAP's default Cauchy kernel.

Conclusion: This work unifies UMAP, contrastive learning, and spectral clustering, offering theoretical insights into UMAP's behavior.

Abstract: UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is among the most widely used algorithms for non linear dimensionality reduction and data visualisation. Despite its popularity, and despite being presented through the lens of algebraic topology, the exact relationship between UMAP and classical spectral methods has remained informal. In this work, we prove that UMAP performs spectral clustering on the fuzzy k nearest neighbour graph. Our proof proceeds in three steps: (1) we show that UMAP's stochastic optimisation with negative sampling is a contrastive learning objective on the similarity graph; (2) we invoke the result of HaoChen et al. [8], establishing that contrastive learning on a similarity graph is equivalent to spectral clustering; and (3) we verify that UMAP's spectral initialisation computes the exact linear solution to this spectral problem. The equivalence is exact for Gaussian kernels, and holds as a first order approximation for UMAP's default Cauchy type kernel. Our result unifies UMAP, contrastive learning, and spectral clustering under a single framework, and provides theoretical grounding for several empirical observations about UMAP's behaviour.

### [217] [Fully First-Order Algorithms for Online Bilevel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11665)
*Tingkai Jia,Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fully first-order algorithm for non-convex-strongly-convex online bilevel optimization, eliminating the need for Hessian-vector products and improving computational efficiency. Theoretical guarantees show improved regret bounds compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online bilevel optimization (OBO) methods rely on hypergradient descent, which is computationally expensive due to Hessian-vector product requirements. The authors aim to develop a more efficient algorithm by reformulating the problem and avoiding these costly computations.

Method: The authors reformulate the OBO problem as a single-level online problem with inequality constraints and construct Lagrangian functions. They propose a fully first-order algorithm and an improved variant with adaptive inner iterations to reduce computational complexity and improve regret bounds.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves regret bounds of $O(1 + V_T + H_{2,T})$ and $O(\sqrt{T} + V_T)$, where the latter eliminates dependence on the drift variation of the inner-level optimal solution.

Conclusion: The work introduces a computationally efficient first-order method for OBO, providing strong theoretical guarantees and improving upon existing approaches in terms of regret bounds.

Abstract: In this work, we study non-convex-strongly-convex online bilevel optimization (OBO). Existing OBO algorithms are mainly based on hypergradient descent, which requires access to a Hessian-vector product (HVP) oracle and potentially incurs high computational costs. By reformulating the original OBO problem as a single-level online problem with inequality constraints and constructing a sequence of Lagrangian function, we eliminate the need for HVPs arising from implicit differentiation. Specifically, we propose a fully first-order algorithm for OBO, and provide theoretical guarantees showing that it achieves regret of $O(1 + V_T + H_{2,T})$. Furthermore, we develop an improved variant with an adaptive inner-iteration scheme, which removes the dependence on the drift variation of the inner-level optimal solution and achieves regret of $O(\sqrt{T} + V_T)$. This regret have the advatange when $V_{T}\ge O(\sqrt{T})$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study uses motion capture and machine learning to identify running patterns linked to knee injuries (PFPS and ITBS), showing CNN models achieve the highest accuracy (up to 77.9%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Running has a high incidence of knee injuries like PFPS and ITBS. Identifying gait patterns tied to these injuries can improve clinical decisions.

Method: Analyzed 839 treadmill recordings with optical motion capture, focusing on stance phase kinematics. Tested feature spaces and models (classical and deep learning) for injury classification.

Result: Combining time series and point values improved detection. CNNs outperformed classical models (77.9% PFPS, 73.8% ITBS, 71.43% combined injuries). Explainability tools decoded model behavior.

Conclusion: Motion capture systems with advanced machine learning can effectively identify injury-related running patterns, aiding clinical diagnosis.

Abstract: Running is a widely practiced activity but shows a high incidence of knee injuries, especially Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) and Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITBS). Identifying gait patterns linked to these injuries can improve clinical decision-making, which requires precise systems capable of capturing and analyzing temporal kinematic data.
  This study uses optical motion capture systems to enhance detection of injury-related running patterns. We analyze a public dataset of 839 treadmill recordings from healthy and injured runners to evaluate how effectively these systems capture dynamic parameters relevant to injury classification. The focus is on the stance phase, using joint and segment angle time series and discrete point values.
  Three classification tasks are addressed: healthy vs. injured, healthy vs. PFPS, and healthy vs. ITBS. We examine different feature spaces, from traditional point-based metrics to full stance-phase time series and hybrid representations. Multiple models are tested, including classical algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Processes, Decision Trees) and deep learning architectures (CNNs, LSTMs).
  Performance is evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Explainability tools such as Shapley values, saliency maps, and Grad-CAM are used to interpret model behavior. Results show that combining time series with point values substantially improves detection. Deep learning models outperform classical ones, with CNNs achieving the highest accuracy: 77.9% for PFPS, 73.8% for ITBS, and 71.43% for the combined injury class.
  These findings highlight the potential of motion capture systems coupled with advanced machine learning to identify knee injury-related running patterns.

### [220] [ANML: Attribution-Native Machine Learning with Guaranteed Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11690)
*Oliver Zahn,Matt Beton,Simran Chana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ANML (Attribution-Native Machine Learning) weights training samples by quality factors (gradient consistency, verification, reputation, temporal relevance), improving model performance and enabling attribution. It reduces errors by 33-72% and is data-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training pipelines treat all samples identically, failing to account for varying quality (e.g., Nobel laureate vs. unverified data). ANML addresses this by weighting samples based on quality factors.

Method: ANML combines gradient signals with external provenance data (verification, reputation, temporal relevance) to weight samples. It uses a Two-Stage Adaptive gating mechanism to ensure baseline performance.

Result: Achieves 33-72% error reduction, outperforms baselines, and is data-efficient (20% high-quality data beats 100% uniform data by 47%). Contributor-level attribution excels against subtle corruption.

Conclusion: ANML improves model performance and attribution by weighting samples dynamically. It is robust against strategic attacks and outperforms traditional methods.

Abstract: Frontier AI systems increasingly train on specialized expert data, from clinical records to proprietary research to curated datasets, yet current training pipelines treat all samples identically. A Nobel laureate's contribution receives the same weight as an unverified submission. We introduce ANML (Attribution-Native Machine Learning), a framework that weights training samples by four quality factors: gradient-based consistency (q), verification status (v), contributor reputation (r), and temporal relevance (T). By combining what the model observes (gradient signals) with what the system knows about data provenance (external signals), ANML produces per-contributor quality weights that simultaneously improve model performance and enable downstream attribution. Across 5 datasets (178-32,561 samples), ANML achieves 33-72% error reduction over gradient-only baselines. Quality-weighted training is data-efficient: 20% high-quality data outperforms 100% uniformly weighted data by 47%. A Two-Stage Adaptive gating mechanism guarantees that ANML never underperforms the best available baseline, including under strategic joint attacks combining credential faking with gradient alignment. When per-sample detection fails against subtle corruption, contributor-level attribution provides 1.3-5.3x greater improvement than sample-level methods, with the advantage growing as corruption becomes harder to detect.

### [221] [SpiralFormer: Looped Transformers Can Learn Hierarchical Dependencies via Multi-Resolution Recursion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11698)
*Chengting Yu,Xiaobo Shu,Yadao Wang,Yizhen Zhang,Haoyi Wu,You Wu,Rujiao Long,Ziheng Chen,Yuchi Xu,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpiralFormer introduces multi-resolution recursion in looped Transformers, improving efficiency and performance over fixed-resolution models, achieving better results across various scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early looped Transformers underperformed non-recursive baselines. SpiralFormer addresses this by leveraging multi-resolution recursion for hierarchical learning and efficiency.

Method: SpiralFormer uses a multi-resolution recursion schedule, allowing iterative refinement across different scales, unlike fixed-resolution looped Transformers.

Result: Empirical results show SpiralFormer outperforms looped and non-looped baselines in parameter and compute efficiency, scaling from 160M to 1.4B parameters.

Conclusion: Multi-resolution recursion enhances looped Transformers, establishing sequence resolution as a key scaling dimension for recursive architectures.

Abstract: Recursive (looped) Transformers decouple computational depth from parameter depth by repeatedly applying shared layers, providing an explicit architectural primitive for iterative refinement and latent reasoning. However, early looped Transformers often underperform non-recursive baselines of equal compute. While recent literature has introduced more effective recursion mechanisms to mitigate this gap, existing architectures still operate at a fixed, full-token resolution, neglecting the potential efficiency of computing over compressed latent representations. In this paper, we propose SpiralFormer, a looped Transformer that executes recurrence under a multi-resolution recursion schedule. We provide probing evidence that multi-resolution recursion enables the model to learn hierarchical dependencies by inducing iteration-wise functional specialization across different scales. Empirically, SpiralFormer achieves better parameter and compute efficiency than both looped and non-looped baselines across model scales from 160M to 1.4B, establishing sequence resolution as a potential axis for scaling recursive architectures.

*Yongyao Wang,Ziqi Miao,Lu Yang,Haonan Jia,Wenting Yan,Chen Qian,Lijun Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Tabular prediction can benefit from in-table rows as few-shot evidence, yet existing tabular models typically perform instance-wise inference and LLM-based prompting is often brittle. Models do not consistently leverage relevant rows, and noisy context can degrade performance. To address this challenge, we propose TabSieve, a select-then-predict framework that makes evidence usage explicit and auditable. Given a table and a query row, TabSieve first selects a small set of informative rows as evidence and then predicts the missing target conditioned on the selected evidence. To enable this capability, we construct TabSieve-SFT-40K by synthesizing high-quality reasoning trajectories from 331 real tables using a strong teacher model with strict filtering. Furthermore, we introduce TAB-GRPO, a reinforcement learning recipe that jointly optimizes evidence selection and prediction correctness with separate rewards, and stabilizes mixed regression and classification training via dynamic task-advantage balancing. Experiments on a held-out benchmark of 75 classification and 52 regression tables show that TabSieve consistently improves performance across shot budgets, with average gains of 2.92% on classification and 4.45% on regression over the second-best baseline. Further analysis indicates that TabSieve concentrates more attention on the selected evidence, which improves robustness to noisy context.

### [223] [Potential-energy gating for robust state estimation in bistable stochastic systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11712)
*Luigi Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Potential-energy gating improves state estimation in double-well stochastic systems by modulating observation trust based on potential energy, outperforming standard filters significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust filters treat all state regions identically or impose hard bounds, lacking physics-based adaptability for systems with metastable wells.

Method: Modulates observation noise covariance in Bayesian filters using local potential energy, requiring only two hyperparameters. Applied to various filter types.

Result: Achieves 57-80% RMSE improvement over standard filters, robust to potential misspecification, and retains performance under noise-induced transitions.

Conclusion: Physics-based gating enhances state estimation accuracy and robustness, validated synthetically and empirically in ice-core data analysis.

Abstract: We introduce potential-energy gating, a method for robust state estimation in systems governed by double-well stochastic dynamics. The observation noise covariance of a Bayesian filter is modulated by the local value of a known or assumed potential energy function: observations are trusted when the state is near a potential minimum and progressively discounted as it approaches the barrier separating metastable wells. This physics-based mechanism differs from purely statistical robust filters, which treat all regions of state space identically, and from constrained filters, which impose hard bounds on states rather than modulating observation trust. We implement the gating within Extended, Unscented, Ensemble, and Adaptive Kalman filters and particle filters, requiring only two additional hyperparameters. Synthetic benchmarks on a Ginzburg-Landau double-well process with 10% outlier contamination and Monte Carlo validation over 100 replications show 57-80% RMSE improvement over the standard Extended Kalman Filter, all statistically significant (p < 10^{-15}, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). A naive topological baseline using only distance to the nearest well achieves 57%, confirming that the continuous energy landscape adds an additional ~21 percentage points. The method is robust to misspecification: even when assumed potential parameters deviate by 50% from their true values, improvement never falls below 47%. Comparing externally forced and spontaneous Kramers-type transitions, gating retains 68% improvement under noise-induced transitions whereas the naive baseline degrades to 30%. As an empirical illustration, we apply the framework to Dansgaard-Oeschger events in the NGRIP delta-18O ice-core record, estimating asymmetry parameter gamma = -0.109 (bootstrap 95% CI: [-0.220, -0.011], excluding zero) and demonstrating that outlier fraction explains 91% of the variance in filter improvement.

*Haolei Bai,Lingcheng Kong,Xueyi Chen,Jianmian Wang,Zhiqiang Tao,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DICE, a diffusion-based large language model series for CUDA kernel generation, addressing challenges like data scarcity and specialization with a bi-phase training framework and outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion LLMs offer parallel token generation benefits, ideal for non-sequential tasks like code generation, but face challenges in CUDA kernel specialization and lack of data.

Method: Constructed CuKe dataset and proposed BiC-RL framework for CUDA kernel infilling and end-to-end generation, resulting in DICE models.

Result: DICE outperforms comparable autoregressive and diffusion LLMs on KernelBench, setting a new benchmark.

Conclusion: DICE demonstrates superior performance in CUDA kernel generation, showcasing the potential of diffusion LLMs for specialized coding tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, owing to their capacity for parallel token generation. This paradigm is particularly well-suited for code generation, where holistic structural planning and non-sequential refinement are critical. Despite this potential, tailoring dLLMs for CUDA kernel generation remains challenging, obstructed not only by the high specialization but also by the severe lack of high-quality training data. To address these challenges, we construct CuKe, an augmented supervised fine-tuning dataset optimized for high-performance CUDA kernels. On top of it, we propose a bi-phase curated reinforcement learning (BiC-RL) framework consisting of a CUDA kernel infilling stage and an end-to-end CUDA kernel generation stage. Leveraging this training framework, we introduce DICE, a series of diffusion large language models designed for CUDA kernel generation, spanning three parameter scales, 1.7B, 4B, and 8B. Extensive experiments on KernelBench demonstrate that DICE significantly outperforms both autoregressive and diffusion LLMs of comparable scale, establishing a new state-of-the-art for CUDA kernel generation.

### [225] [Dopamine: Brain Modes, Not Brains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11726)
*Shervin Ghasemlou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method called \methodname{}, which adapts pretrained models by modifying activation thresholds and gains instead of weight updates, offering interpretability and conditional computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional weight-space PEFT methods lack interpretability and clarity about which computations are reused or bypassed. The authors aim to address this by exploring adaptation as changes in activation modes.

Method: The proposed \methodname{} freezes base weights and learns per-neuron thresholds and gains. A smooth gate decides neuron participation during training, hardening into conditional computation at inference.

Result: Tested on MNIST variants, \methodname{} improves accuracy with fewer trainable parameters than \lora{} and exhibits partial activation sparsity. However, it trades some accuracy for interpretability.

Conclusion: \methodname{} offers a more interpretable and parameter-efficient alternative to weight-based PEFT, though its expressivity is limited if the frozen base lacks necessary features.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as \lora{} adapt large pretrained models by adding small weight-space updates. While effective, weight deltas are hard to interpret mechanistically, and they do not directly expose \emph{which} internal computations are reused versus bypassed for a new task. We explore an alternative view inspired by neuromodulation: adaptation as a change in \emph{mode} -- selecting and rescaling existing computations -- rather than rewriting the underlying weights. We propose \methodname{}, a simple activation-space PEFT technique that freezes base weights and learns per-neuron \emph{thresholds} and \emph{gains}. During training, a smooth gate decides whether a neuron's activation participates; at inference the gate can be hardened to yield explicit conditional computation and neuron-level attributions.
  As a proof of concept, we study ``mode specialization'' on MNIST (0$^\circ$) versus rotated MNIST (45$^\circ$). We pretrain a small MLP on a 50/50 mixture (foundation), freeze its weights, and then specialize to the rotated mode using \methodname{}. Across seeds, \methodname{} improves rotated accuracy over the frozen baseline while using only a few hundred trainable parameters per layer, and exhibits partial activation sparsity (a minority of units strongly active). Compared to \lora{}, \methodname{} trades some accuracy for substantially fewer trainable parameters and a more interpretable ``which-neurons-fire'' mechanism. We discuss limitations, including reduced expressivity when the frozen base lacks features needed for the target mode.

TL;DR: UFO integrates U-Nets, Transformers, and Neural CDEs to improve probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series, offering faster inference and better accuracy than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series is challenging, and current Neural CDE methods lack scalability and global context.

Method: UFO combines parallelizable U-Nets, global modeling of Transformers, and continuous-time dynamics of Neural CDEs.

Result: UFO outperforms ten state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy and provides up to 15× faster inference.

Conclusion: UFO offers a scalable, accurate solution for probabilistic forecasting with broad applications.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series is crucial in domains such as healthcare and finance, yet it remains a formidable challenge. Existing Neural Controlled Differential Equation (Neural CDE) approaches, while effective at modelling continuous dynamics, suffer from slow, inherently sequential computation, which restricts scalability and limits access to global context. We introduce UFO (U-Former ODE), a novel architecture that seamlessly integrates the parallelizable, multiscale feature extraction of U-Nets, the powerful global modelling of Transformers, and the continuous-time dynamics of Neural CDEs. By constructing a fully causal, parallelizable model, UFO achieves a global receptive field while retaining strong sensitivity to local temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks -- covering both regularly and irregularly sampled time series -- demonstrate that UFO consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art neural baselines in predictive accuracy. Moreover, UFO delivers up to 15$\times$ faster inference compared to conventional Neural CDEs, with consistently strong performance on long and highly multivariate sequences.

TL;DR: TLDR: TUBO, a novel ML framework, improves network traffic forecasting accuracy (4x better) and burst prediction (94% accuracy), enhancing proactive traffic engineering outcomes (9x better throughput).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models struggle with network traffic's burst and complex patterns, leading to unreliable forecasts.

Method: TUBO introduces burst processing and model selection from a pool to handle traffic fluctuations and patterns, providing deterministic predictions with uncertainty quantification.

Result: TUBO outperforms existing methods in accuracy (4x) and burst forecasting (94% accuracy), improving proactive traffic engineering throughput (9x).

Conclusion: TUBO effectively addresses network traffic forecasting challenges, enhancing reliability and performance in applications like traffic engineering.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting based network operation optimization and management offers enormous promise but also presents significant challenges from traffic forecasting perspective. While deep learning models have proven to be relatively more effective than traditional statistical methods for time series forecasting, their reliability is not satisfactory due to their inability to effectively handle unique characteristics of network traffic. In particular, the burst and complex traffic patterns makes the existing models less reliable, as each type of deep learning model has limited capability in capturing traffic patterns. To address this issue, we introduce TUBO, a novel machine learning framework custom designed for reliable network traffic forecasting. TUBO features two key components: burst processing for handling significant traffic fluctuations and model selection for adapting to varying traffic patterns using a pool of models. A standout feature of TUBO is its ability to provide deterministic predictions along with quantified uncertainty, which serves as a cue for identifying the most reliable forecasts. Evaluations on three real-world network demand matrix (DM) datasets (Abilene, GEANT, and CERNET) show that TUBO significantly outperforms existing methods on forecasting accuracy (by 4 times), and also achieves up to 94% accuracy in burst occurrence forecasting. Furthermore, we also consider traffic demand forecasting based proactive traffic engineering (TE) as a downstream use case. Our results show that compared to reactive approaches and proactive TE using the best existing DM forecasting methods, proactive TE powered by TUBO improves aggregated throughput by 9 times and 3 times, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MUSE is a framework enabling seamless model updates in multi-tenant Score-as-a-Service environments by decoupling model scores from client decision boundaries, reducing recalibration bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retraining models shifts score distributions, invalidating thresholds and creating bottlenecks in multi-tenant environments due to the need for coordinated threshold updates across clients.

Method: MUSE uses dynamic intent-based routing and a two-level score transformation to map model outputs to a stable reference distribution, optimizing infrastructure reuse.

Result: Deployed at Feedzai, MUSE processes over 55 billion events annually with high availability and low latency, reducing model lead time from weeks to minutes.

Conclusion: MUSE enhances model resilience against evolving threats, significantly cutting fraud losses and operational costs.

Abstract: In binary classification systems, decision thresholds translate model scores into actions. Choosing suitable thresholds relies on the specific distribution of the underlying model scores but also on the specific business decisions of each client using that model. However, retraining models inevitably shifts score distributions, invalidating existing thresholds. In multi-tenant Score-as-a-Service environments, where decision boundaries reside in client-managed infrastructure, this creates a severe bottleneck: recalibration requires coordinating threshold updates across hundreds of clients, consuming excessive human hours and leading to model stagnation. We introduce MUSE, a model serving framework that enables seamless model updates by decoupling model scores from client decision boundaries. Designed for multi-tenancy, MUSE optimizes infrastructure re-use by sharing models via dynamic intent-based routing, combined with a two-level score transformation that maps model outputs to a stable, reference distribution. Deployed at scale by Feedzai, MUSE processes over a thousand events per second, and over 55 billion events in the last 12 months, across several dozens of tenants, while maintaining high-availability and low-latency guarantees. By reducing model lead time from weeks to minutes, MUSE promotes model resilience against shifting attacks, saving millions of dollars in fraud losses and operational costs.

*Suraj Ranganath,Anish Patnaik,Vaishak Menon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies how bit allocation affects low-bit planning efficiency in spatial reasoning, finding that 4-bit settings are sensitive to allocation choices, while 8-bit and 6-bit remain effective. Module-aware quantization policies are recommended.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether total bitwidth or specific bit allocation across modules determines low-bit planning behavior in spatial reasoning tasks.

Method: Uses DINO-WM on the Wall planning task with various quantization variants (uniform, mixed, asymmetric, layerwise) under two planner budgets. Evaluates paired-goal mixed-bit settings.

Result: Observes a three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings perform similarly to FP16, 3-bit collapses, and 4-bit is allocation-sensitive. Preserving encoder precision improves planning.

Conclusion: Module-aware, budget-aware quantization policies are crucial for efficient spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Efficient spatial reasoning requires world models that remain reliable under tight precision budgets. We study whether low-bit planning behavior is determined mostly by total bitwidth or by where bits are allocated across modules. Using DINO-WM on the Wall planning task, we run a paired-goal mixed-bit evaluation across uniform, mixed, asymmetric, and layerwise variants under two planner budgets. We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive. In that transition region, preserving encoder precision improves planning relative to uniform quantization, and near-size asymmetric variants show the same encoder-side direction. In a later strict 22-cell replication with smaller per-cell episode count, the mixed-versus-uniform INT4 sign becomes budget-conditioned, which further highlights the sensitivity of this transition regime. These findings motivate module-aware, budget-aware quantization policies as a broader research direction for efficient spatial reasoning.

*Haoran Dang,Cuiling Lan,Hai Wan,Xibin Zhao,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TAMPO introduces a learnable meta-policy for temperature control in LLMs, improving exploration and policy performance in RL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static or heuristic temperature schedules in LLMs limit policy improvement by failing to adapt to dynamic RL demands.

Method: TAMPO uses a hierarchical two-loop process: inner loop updates LLM policy with meta-policy-selected temperatures; outer loop optimizes the temperature distribution based on trajectory advantage.

Result: TAMPO outperforms fixed/heuristic temperature baselines on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Temperature can be effectively learned as a meta-policy for adaptive exploration in LLM reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Temperature is a crucial hyperparameter in large language models (LLMs), controlling the trade-off between exploration and exploitation during text generation. High temperatures encourage diverse but noisy outputs, while low temperatures produce focused outputs but may cause premature convergence. Yet static or heuristic temperature schedules fail to adapt to the dynamic demands of reinforcement learning (RL) throughout training, often limiting policy improvement. We propose Temperature Adaptive Meta Policy Optimization (TAMPO), a new framework that recasts temperature control as a learnable meta-policy. TAMPO operates through a hierarchical two-loop process. In the inner loop, the LLM policy is updated (e.g., using GRPO) with trajectories sampled at the temperature selected by the meta-policy. In the outer loop, meta-policy updates the distribution over candidate temperatures by rewarding those that maximize the likelihood of high-advantage trajectories. This trajectory-guided, reward-driven mechanism enables online adaptation without additional rollouts, directly aligning exploration with policy improvement. On five mathematical reasoning benchmarks, TAMPO outperforms baselines using fixed or heuristic temperatures, establishing temperature as an effective learnable meta-policy for adaptive exploration in LLM reinforcement learning.

*Ainhize Barrainkua,Santiago Mazuelas,Novi Quadrianto,Jose A. Lozano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPECTRE is a new method to enhance fairness in classifiers without needing demographic data, outperforming existing approaches by avoiding over-pessimism and ensuring robust fairness guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing concerns about societal bias amplification in automated classification systems, especially when demographic data is unavailable.

Method: SPECTRE uses minimax-fair techniques to adjust Fourier feature mappings and constrain worst-case distribution deviations from empirical data.

Result: SPECTRE achieves higher fairness guarantees and smaller interquartile ranges than state-of-the-art methods, even outperforming those with demographic data access.

Conclusion: SPECTRE provides a robust solution for fairness in classification without demographic data, supported by strong empirical and theoretical results.

Abstract: As automated classification systems become increasingly prevalent, concerns have emerged over their potential to reinforce and amplify existing societal biases. In the light of this issue, many methods have been proposed to enhance the fairness guarantees of classifiers. Most of the existing interventions assume access to group information for all instances, a requirement rarely met in practice. Fairness without access to demographic information has often been approached through robust optimization techniques,which target worst-case outcomes over a set of plausible distributions known as the uncertainty set. However, their effectiveness is strongly influenced by the chosen uncertainty set. In fact, existing approaches often overemphasize outliers or overly pessimistic scenarios, compromising both overall performance and fairness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPECTRE, a minimax-fair method that adjusts the spectrum of a simple Fourier feature mapping and constrains the extent to which the worst-case distribution can deviate from the empirical distribution. We perform extensive experiments on the American Community Survey datasets involving 20 states. The safeness of SPECTRE comes as it provides the highest average values on fairness guarantees together with the smallest interquartile range in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches, even compared to those with access to demographic group information. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis that derives computable bounds on the worst-case error for both individual groups and the overall population, as well as characterizes the worst-case distributions responsible for these extremal performances

*Miaosen Zhang,Yishan Liu,Shuxia Lin,Xu Yang,Qi Dai,Chong Luo,Weihao Jiang,Peng Hou,Anxiang Zeng,Xin Geng,Baining Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) underperforms reinforcement learning (RL) due to data distribution misalignment. The paper introduces On-Policy SFT via Distribution Discriminant Theory (DDT) and two techniques (IDFT and Hinted Decoding) to bridge the gap, achieving RL-like generalization while retaining SFT efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inferior generalization of SFT compared to RL, driven by RL's use of on-policy data, by proposing a framework to align SFT with on-policy data.

Method: Introduces DDT to analyze data-model alignment, and two techniques: IDFT (loss-level) and Hinted Decoding (data-level) to enhance SFT's generalization.

Result: The framework matches RL algorithms like DPO and SimPO in generalization while keeping SFT's computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed On-Policy SFT offers a viable alternative to RL, especially where RL is impractical, with open-source implementation.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is computationally efficient but often yields inferior generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). This gap is primarily driven by RL's use of on-policy data. We propose a framework to bridge this chasm by enabling On-Policy SFT. We first present \textbf{\textit{Distribution Discriminant Theory (DDT)}}, which explains and quantifies the alignment between data and the model-induced distribution. Leveraging DDT, we introduce two complementary techniques: (i) \textbf{\textit{In-Distribution Finetuning (IDFT)}}, a loss-level method to enhance generalization ability of SFT, and (ii) \textbf{\textit{Hinted Decoding}}, a data-level technique that can re-align the training corpus to the model's distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves generalization performance on par with prominent offline RL algorithms, including DPO and SimPO, while maintaining the efficiency of an SFT pipeline. The proposed framework thus offers a practical alternative in domains where RL is infeasible. We open-source the code here: https://github.com/zhangmiaosen2000/Towards-On-Policy-SFT

### [233] [Evaluating LLM Safety Under Repeated Inference via Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11786)
*Keita Broadwater*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: APST introduces a depth-oriented evaluation framework for LLMs, focusing on response consistency and safety under repeated inference, revealing reliability differences missed by traditional benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional benchmarks assess LLM safety broadly but miss risks from repeated inferences on similar prompts, critical in high-stakes settings.

Method: APST samples identical prompts repeatedly under controlled conditions (e.g., decoding temperature) to identify failure modes like hallucinations and inconsistency.

Result: Models with similar benchmark scores show varying failure rates under repeated sampling, especially at higher temperatures.

Conclusion: APST bridges benchmark alignment and deployment risk assessment, uncovering reliability gaps overlooked by single-sample evaluations.

Abstract: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess safety risk through breadth-oriented evaluation across diverse tasks. However, real-world deployment exposes a different class of risk: operational failures arising from repeated inference on identical or near-identical prompts rather than broad task generalization. In high-stakes settings, response consistency and safety under sustained use are critical. We introduce Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing (APST), a depth-oriented evaluation framework inspired by reliability engineering. APST repeatedly samples identical prompts under controlled operational conditions (e.g., decoding temperature) to surface latent failure modes including hallucinations, refusal inconsistency, and unsafe completions. Rather than treating failures as isolated events, APST models them as stochastic outcomes of independent inference events. We formalize safety failures using Bernoulli and binomial models to estimate per-inference failure probabilities, enabling quantitative comparison of reliability across models and decoding configurations. Applying APST to multiple instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on AIR-BENCH-derived safety prompts, we find that models with similar benchmark-aligned scores can exhibit substantially different empirical failure rates under repeated sampling, particularly as temperature increases. These results demonstrate that shallow, single-sample evaluation can obscure meaningful reliability differences under sustained use. APST complements existing benchmarks by providing a practical framework for evaluating LLM safety and reliability under repeated inference, bridging benchmark alignment and deployment-oriented risk assessment.

*Sebastian Zeng,Andreas Petersson,Wolfgang Bock*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a latent-variable method to learn linear SPDEs from spatiotemporal data without requiring noise or initial conditions, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for SPDEs either need noise/initial conditions or use deterministic surrogates, failing to capture stochasticity.

Method: Combines spectral Galerkin projection and Wiener chaos expansion to reduce SPDEs to finite ODEs; jointly infers latent dynamics and forcing via variational learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic data for bounded/unbounded spatial domains.

Conclusion: The structured latent-variable framework effectively learns stochastic dynamics without explicit noise observations.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the law of linear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with additive Gaussian forcing from spatiotemporal observations. Most existing deep learning approaches either assume access to the driving noise or initial condition, or rely on deterministic surrogate models that fail to capture intrinsic stochasticity. We propose a structured latent-variable formulation that requires only observations of solution realizations and learns the underlying randomly forced dynamics. Our approach combines a spectral Galerkin projection with a truncated Wiener chaos expansion, yielding a principled separation between deterministic evolution and stochastic forcing. This reduces the infinite-dimensional SPDE to a finite system of parametrized ordinary differential equations governing latent temporal dynamics. The latent dynamics and stochastic forcing are jointly inferred through variational learning, allowing recovery of stochastic structure without explicit observation or simulation of noise during training. Empirical evaluation on synthetic data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance under comparable modeling assumptions across bounded and unbounded one-dimensional spatial domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CIR, a framework using Tanh activation and normalization to stabilize RL training, showing strong performance on control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overlooked potential in constraining initial input representations to alleviate distribution shift and stabilize RL training.

Method: Proposes CIR with Tanh activation, normalization, skip connections, and convex Q-learning for flexible value estimates.

Result: CIR demonstrates strong performance on continuous control tasks, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: CIR effectively stabilizes RL training and enhances performance by constraining initial representations.

Abstract: Recently, there have been numerous attempts to enhance the sample efficiency of off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) agents when interacting with the environment, including architecture improvements and new algorithms. Despite these advances, they overlook the potential of directly constraining the initial representations of the input data, which can intuitively alleviate the distribution shift issue and stabilize training. In this paper, we introduce the Tanh function into the initial layer to fulfill such a constraint. We theoretically unpack the convergence property of the temporal difference learning with the Tanh function under linear function approximation. Motivated by theoretical insights, we present our Constrained Initial Representations framework, tagged CIR, which is made up of three components: (i) the Tanh activation along with normalization methods to stabilize representations; (ii) the skip connection module to provide a linear pathway from the shallow layer to the deep layer; (iii) the convex Q-learning that allows a more flexible value estimate and mitigates potential conservatism. Empirical results show that CIR exhibits strong performance on numerous continuous control tasks, even being competitive or surpassing existing strong baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate SOZ localization from iEEG is critical for epilepsy surgery but complicated by spatiotemporal seizure dynamics.

Method: SpaTeoGL learns spatial graphs (electrode interactions) and temporal graphs (window similarity) via smooth graph signal processing, using an alternating block coordinate descent algorithm.

Result: Competitive with baseline methods, SpaTeoGL improves non-SOZ identification and provides interpretable insights into seizure dynamics.

Conclusion: SpaTeoGL effectively addresses SOZ localization challenges, offering both performance and interpretability benefits.

Abstract: Accurate localization of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) from intracranial EEG (iEEG) is essential for epilepsy surgery but is challenged by complex spatiotemporal seizure dynamics. We propose SpaTeoGL, a spatiotemporal graph learning framework for interpretable seizure network analysis. SpaTeoGL jointly learns window-level spatial graphs capturing interactions among iEEG electrodes and a temporal graph linking time windows based on similarity of their spatial structure. The method is formulated within a smooth graph signal processing framework and solved via an alternating block coordinate descent algorithm with convergence guarantees. Experiments on a multicenter iEEG dataset with successful surgical outcomes show that SpaTeoGL is competitive with a baseline based on horizontal visibility graphs and logistic regression, while improving non-SOZ identification and providing interpretable insights into seizure onset and propagation dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmarking framework for fair graph link prediction, focusing on structural biases beyond homophily. It proposes a taxonomy of topological bias measures and a graph generation method to evaluate fairness-aware models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness-aware methods often overlook diverse topological biases in social graphs, limiting their generalization. The paper aims to address this gap by understanding and mitigating structural biases.

Method: The authors develop a framework that formalizes topological bias measures and introduces a graph generation method to evaluate fairness-aware link prediction models across varied biases.

Result: The study reveals how predictive fairness interacts with structural biases, showing sensitivity beyond homophily and highlighting the need for grounded evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework provides insights into fairness interventions' limitations and underscores the importance of considering diverse structural biases in graph learning.

Abstract: Graph link prediction (LP) plays a critical role in socially impactful applications, such as job recommendation and friendship formation. Ensuring fairness in this task is thus essential. While many fairness-aware methods manipulate graph structures to mitigate prediction disparities, the topological biases inherent to social graph structures remain poorly understood and are often reduced to homophily alone. This undermines the generalization potential of fairness interventions and limits their applicability across diverse network topologies. In this work, we propose a novel benchmarking framework for fair LP, centered on the structural biases of the underlying graphs. We begin by reviewing and formalizing a broad taxonomy of topological bias measures relevant to fairness in graphs. In parallel, we introduce a flexible graph generation method that simultaneously ensures fidelity to real-world graph patterns and enables controlled variation across a wide spectrum of structural biases. We apply this framework to evaluate both classical and fairness-aware LP models across multiple use cases. Our results provide a fine-grained empirical analysis of the interactions between predictive fairness and structural biases. This new perspective reveals the sensitivity of fairness interventions to beyond-homophily biases and underscores the need for structurally grounded fairness evaluations in graph learning.

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Path signatures embed trajectories into tensor algebra and constitute a universal, non-parametric representation of paths; however, in the standard form, they collapse temporal structure into a single global object, which limits their suitability for decision-making problems that require step-wise reactivity. We propose the Incremental Signature Contribution (ISC) method, which decomposes truncated path signatures into a temporally ordered sequence of elements in the tensor-algebra space, corresponding to incremental contributions induced by last path increments. This reconstruction preserves the algebraic structure and expressivity of signatures, while making their internal temporal evolution explicit, enabling processing signature-based representations via sequential modeling approaches. In contrast to full signatures, ISC is inherently sensitive to instantaneous trajectory updates, which is critical for sensitive and stability-requiring control dynamics. Building on this representation, we introduce ISC-Transformer (ISCT), an offline reinforcement learning model that integrates ISC into a standard Transformer architecture without further architectural modification. We evaluate ISCT on HalfCheetah, Walker2d, Hopper, and Maze2d, including settings with delayed rewards and downgraded datasets. The results demonstrate that ISC method provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective alternative to path processing for temporally sensitive control tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory bandwidth limits agentic LLM inference with long contexts, making SwiGLU MLP blocks a bottleneck due to their large weights.

Method: The paper introduces DeepFusionKernel, a deeply fused kernel that minimizes HBM traffic and enhances cache reuse, integrated with SGLang and paired with a kernel scheduler.

Result: DeepFusionKernel achieves up to 13.2% speedup on H100 and 9.7% on A100 GPUs compared to SGLang, with consistent performance across generation lengths.

Conclusion: DeepFusionKernel effectively addresses memory bandwidth limitations, offering adaptable and consistent accelerations for diverse models and hardware platforms.

Abstract: Agentic LLM inference with long contexts is increasingly limited by memory bandwidth rather than compute. In this setting, SwiGLU MLP blocks, whose large weights exceed cache capacity, become a major yet under-optimized bottleneck. We propose DeepFusionKernel, a deeply fused kernel that cuts HBM traffic and boosts cache reuse, delivering up to 13.2% speedup on H100 and 9.7% on A100 over SGLang. Integrated with SGLang and paired with a kernel scheduler, DeepFusionKernel ensures consistent accelerations over generation lengths, while remaining adaptable to diverse models, inference configurations, and hardware platforms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a confidence-aware active learning framework (CAAL) to efficiently estimate hard-to-measure atmospheric particle properties using routine observations, addressing challenges like heteroscedastic noise and limited labeling budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantifying air pollution's health and climate impacts requires particle properties like toxicity and hygroscopicity, which are costly to measure directly. The paper aims to estimate these properties from routinely available but indirect observations.

Method: The authors propose CAAL, a framework with a decoupled uncertainty-aware training objective and a confidence-aware acquisition function. This separates and dynamically weights epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties for better sample selection.

Result: CAAL outperforms standard active learning baselines in experiments using particle-resolved simulations and real atmospheric observations, demonstrating robust and efficient sample selection.

Conclusion: CAAL provides a practical solution for expanding high-cost particle property databases efficiently, improving estimations under heteroscedastic noise and limited labeling budgets.

Abstract: Quantifying the impacts of air pollution on health and climate relies on key atmospheric particle properties such as toxicity and hygroscopicity. However, these properties typically require complex observational techniques or expensive particle-resolved numerical simulations, limiting the availability of labeled data. We therefore estimate these hard-to-measure particle properties from routinely available observations (e.g., air pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions). Because routine observations only indirectly reflect particle composition and structure, the mapping from routine observations to particle properties is noisy and input-dependent, yielding a heteroscedastic regression setting. With a limited and costly labeling budget, the central challenge is to select which samples to measure or simulate. While active learning is a natural approach, most acquisition strategies rely on predictive uncertainty. Under heteroscedastic noise, this signal conflates reducible epistemic uncertainty with irreducible aleatoric uncertainty, causing limited budgets to be wasted in noise-dominated regions. To address this challenge, we propose a confidence-aware active learning framework (CAAL) for efficient and robust sample selection in heteroscedastic settings. CAAL consists of two components: a decoupled uncertainty-aware training objective that separately optimises the predictive mean and noise level to stabilise uncertainty estimation, and a confidence-aware acquisition function that dynamically weights epistemic uncertainty using predicted aleatoric uncertainty as a reliability signal. Experiments on particle-resolved numerical simulations and real atmospheric observations show that CAAL consistently outperforms standard AL baselines. The proposed framework provides a practical and general solution for the efficient expansion of high-cost atmospheric particle property databases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the conflict between individual economic incentives and collective welfare in climate action, aiming to identify solutions for global coordination.

Method: The paper uses InvestESG, a multi-agent simulation, and applies Advantage Alignment, an opponent shaping algorithm, to influence agent behavior toward cooperation.

Result: Advantage Alignment biases learning toward cooperative equilibria, showing potential to align individual incentives with long-term sustainability goals.

Conclusion: Strategic shaping of agent learning can improve outcomes, providing actionable insights for policies that align market incentives with sustainability.

Abstract: Addressing climate change requires global coordination, yet rational economic actors often prioritize immediate gains over collective welfare, resulting in social dilemmas. InvestESG is a recently proposed multi-agent simulation that captures the dynamic interplay between investors and companies under climate risk. We provide a formal characterization of the conditions under which InvestESG exhibits an intertemporal social dilemma, deriving theoretical thresholds at which individual incentives diverge from collective welfare. Building on this, we apply Advantage Alignment, a scalable opponent shaping algorithm shown to be effective in general-sum games, to influence agent learning in InvestESG. We offer theoretical insights into why Advantage Alignment systematically favors socially beneficial equilibria by biasing learning dynamics toward cooperative outcomes. Our results demonstrate that strategically shaping the learning processes of economic agents can result in better outcomes that could inform policy mechanisms to better align market incentives with long-term sustainability goals.

TL;DR: Design of resilient communication networks with dynamic uncertainty in links and nodes, using robust optimization and scalable methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure reliable signal transfer despite degradation and uncertainty in network components.

Method: Robust optimization framework with scalable methods like column-and-constraint generation, Benders decomposition, and iterative robust optimization.

Result: Effective solutions ensuring network connectivity under worst-case uncertainty, outperforming classical models.

Conclusion: The methodology is effective and advantageous for resilient network design under dynamic uncertainty.

Abstract: We study the design of resilient and reliable communication networks in which a signal can be transferred only up to a limited distance before its quality falls below an acceptable threshold. When excessive signal degradation occurs, regeneration is required through regenerators installed at selected network nodes. In this work, both network links and nodes are subject to uncertainty. The installation costs of regenerators are modeled using a budgeted uncertainty set. In addition, link lengths follow a dynamic budgeted uncertainty set introduced in this paper, where deviations may vary over time. Robust optimization seeks solutions whose performance is guaranteed under all scenarios represented by the underlying uncertainty set. Accordingly, the objective is to identify a minimum-cost subset of nodes for regenerator deployment that ensures full network connectivity, even under the worst possible realizations of uncertainty. To solve the problem, we first formulate it within a robust optimization framework, and then develop scalable solution methods based on column-and-constraint generation, Benders decomposition, and iterative robust optimization. In addition, we formulate a learning-based hide-and-seek game to further analyze the problem structure. The proposed approaches are evaluated against classical static budgeted robust models and deterministic worst-case formulations. Both theoretical analysis and computational results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our methodology.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A$^{2}$V-SLP introduces an alignment-aware variational framework for sign language production, using articulator-wise disentangled latent distributions and a non-autoregressive Transformer for improved realism and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance sign language production by learning articulator-wise disentangled latent distributions instead of deterministic embeddings, addressing issues like latent collapse and improving alignment between linguistic input and motion.

Method: The framework employs a disentangled Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode sign pose sequences and extract articulator-specific mean and variance vectors. A non-autoregressive Transformer predicts these latent distributions from text embeddings, and the VAE decoder reconstructs sign poses through stochastic sampling. A gloss attention mechanism strengthens input-motion alignment.

Result: A$^{2}$V-SLP outperforms deterministic latent regression, achieving state-of-the-art back-translation performance and improved motion realism, even without gloss annotations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively maintains articulator-level representations through distributional latent modeling and enhances alignment, demonstrating superior performance in sign language production.

Abstract: Building upon recent structural disentanglement frameworks for sign language production, we propose A$^{2}$V-SLP, an alignment-aware variational framework that learns articulator-wise disentangled latent distributions rather than deterministic embeddings. A disentangled Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes ground-truth sign pose sequences and extracts articulator-specific mean and variance vectors, which are used as distributional supervision for training a non-autoregressive Transformer. Given text embeddings, the Transformer predicts both latent means and log-variances, while the VAE decoder reconstructs the final sign pose sequences through stochastic sampling at the decoding stage. This formulation maintains articulator-level representations by avoiding deterministic latent collapse through distributional latent modeling. In addition, we integrate a gloss attention mechanism to strengthen alignment between linguistic input and articulated motion. Experimental results show consistent gains over deterministic latent regression, achieving state-of-the-art back-translation performance and improved motion realism in a fully gloss-free setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes in-context learning in large language models (LLMs) using Gaussian Processes (GPs), comparing their performance against empirical GP-regression and 1-nearest-neighbor bounds, and explores how post-training can shift their inductive biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs learn from few demonstrations and quantify their behavior as GP learners, providing insights into their inductive biases and potential for steering these biases.

Method: Controlled experiments with LLMs observing sequences of function samples from GP priors, evaluating prediction error, and comparing against GP-regression and 1-NN benchmarks. Likelihood-based analysis and post-training (reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning) are used to study inductive biases.

Result: LLM learning curves align with GP lower bounds as demonstrations increase, and their predictions favor less smooth GP kernels. Post-training effectively shifts biases toward smoother kernels, improving sample-efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework quantifies LLMs' GP-like behavior and offers tools to steer their inductive biases for continuous function learning, enhancing their adaptability to different tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can learn from a few demonstrations provided at inference time. We study this in-context learning phenomenon through the lens of Gaussian Processes (GPs). We build controlled experiments where models observe sequences of multivariate scalar-valued function samples drawn from known GP priors. We evaluate prediction error in relation to the number of demonstrations and compare against two principled references: (i) an empirical GP-regression learner that gives a lower bound on achievable error, and (ii) the expected error of a 1-nearest-neighbor (1-NN) rule, which gives a data-driven upper bound. Across model sizes, we find that LLM learning curves are strongly influenced by the function-generating kernels and approach the GP lower bound as the number of demonstrations increases. We then study the inductive biases of these models using a likelihood-based analysis. We find that LLM predictions are most likely under less smooth GP kernels. Finally, we explore whether post-training can shift these inductive biases and improve sample-efficiency on functions sampled from GPs with smoother kernels. We find that both reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning can effectively shift inductive biases in the direction of the training data. Together, our framework quantifies the extent to which LLMs behave like GP learners and provides tools for steering their inductive biases for continuous function learning tasks.

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework enhances low-resolution weather forecasts into high-resolution probabilistic predictions without model-specific fine-tuning, improving accuracy and uncertainty representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide scalable, model-agnostic probabilistic enhancements for weather forecasting pipelines without requiring adjustments for different upstream models.

Method: A single conditional diffusion model trains on paired coarse (~25 km) and high-resolution (~5 km) data, applied zero-shot to deterministic forecasts from various weather models.

Result: Downscaled forecasts improve upon raw deterministic forecasts, showing significant gains in probabilistic skill (measured by CRPS) across diverse AI and NWP systems.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based downscaling offers a scalable solution for enhancing spatial resolution and uncertainty in operational weather forecasting.

Abstract: We introduce a universal diffusion-based downscaling framework that lifts deterministic low-resolution weather forecasts into probabilistic high-resolution predictions without any model-specific fine-tuning. A single conditional diffusion model is trained on paired coarse-resolution inputs (~25 km resolution) and high-resolution regional reanalysis targets (~5 km resolution), and is applied in a fully zero-shot manner to deterministic forecasts from heterogeneous upstream weather models. Focusing on near-surface variables, we evaluate probabilistic forecasts against independent in situ station observations over lead times up to 90 h. Across a diverse set of AI-based and numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems, the ensemble mean of the downscaled forecasts consistently improves upon each model's own raw deterministic forecast, and substantially larger gains are observed in probabilistic skill as measured by CRPS. These results demonstrate that diffusion-based downscaling provides a scalable, model-agnostic probabilistic interface for enhancing spatial resolution and uncertainty representation in operational weather forecasting pipelines.

TL;DR: HyPO improves DPO by conditionally debiasing the reference signal for pessimistic pairs, mitigating premature satisfaction and enhancing performance without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of premature satisfaction in DPO due to reliance on a reference policy, especially problematic for pessimistic pairs.

Method: Introduces Hybrid-DPO (HyPO), a modification to DPO that applies the reference conditionally, treating it as neutral for pessimistic pairs.

Result: HyPO improves inference-aligned metrics and achieves higher pairwise win rates compared to DPO.

Conclusion: Conditionally debiasing the reference signal enhances direct preference alignment without discarding its stabilizing benefits.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become the de facto standard for offline preference alignment of large language models, but its reliance on a reference policy introduces a critical tension. DPO weighs each update relative to a reference, which stabilizes the training by regularizing the updates within a trusted region. This reliance becomes problematic for pessimistic pairs, where the reference model prefers the rejected response. For these pairs, DPO prematurely attenuates the gradient as soon as the policy margin ($Δ_θ$) merely beats the reference margin ($Δ_{\mathrm{ref}}$) even if the policy is still wrong ($Δ_θ<0$). We name this failure premature satisfaction, which is a concrete form of the training-inference mismatch. Reference-free objectives remove this mismatch by optimizing the absolute margin, but at the cost of discarding the stabilizing signal of the reference. We mitigate this tension with Hybrid-DPO (HyPO), a drop-in modification to DPO that applies reference conditionally: HyPO behaves exactly like DPO when the reference is optimistic or neutral, and it treats the reference as neutral when it is pessimistic by replacing $Δ_θ-Δ_{\mathrm{ref}}$ with $Δ_θ-\max\{0,Δ_{\mathrm{ref}}\}$. This one-line change strictly strengthens per-example learning signals on pessimistic pairs while preserving DPO's objective form and computational cost. By conditionally debiasing the pessimistic reference signal, HyPO mitigates premature satisfaction; empirically, across preference alignment, HyPO improves inference-aligned metrics and achieves higher pairwise win rates. Our results provide evidence that direct preference alignment could be enhanced by conditionally debiasing the reference signal, rather than discarding it.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces conditional average learning in the PAC framework, extending classic PAC learning to tasks like explainability and fairness. It provides a complete learnability characterization and tight sample complexity bounds based on novel combinatorial parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to generalize PAC learning to scenarios where predicting neighborhood label averages is more useful than learning individual labels, applicable in domains like fairness and recommendation systems.

Method: The method involves analyzing conditional averages using novel combinatorial parameters related to the concept class and neighborhood system, derived from the neighborhood graph's independence number.

Result: The key result is a complete characterization of learnability for conditional averages, with sample complexity bounds that are nearly tight (up to logarithmic factors).

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the successful extension of PAC learning to conditional averages, providing a framework applicable to diverse real-world learning tasks.

Abstract: We introduce the problem of learning conditional averages in the PAC framework. The learner receives a sample labeled by an unknown target concept from a known concept class, as in standard PAC learning. However, instead of learning the target concept itself, the goal is to predict, for each instance, the average label over its neighborhood -- an arbitrary subset of points that contains the instance. In the degenerate case where all neighborhoods are singletons, the problem reduces exactly to classic PAC learning. More generally, it extends PAC learning to a setting that captures learning tasks arising in several domains, including explainability, fairness, and recommendation systems. Our main contribution is a complete characterization of when conditional averages are learnable, together with sample complexity bounds that are tight up to logarithmic factors. The characterization hinges on the joint finiteness of two novel combinatorial parameters, which depend on both the concept class and the neighborhood system, and are closely related to the independence number of the associated neighborhood graph.

TL;DR: The paper introduces gpt-oss-puzzle-88B, a deployment-optimized version of gpt-oss-120B, using methods like MoE pruning and FP8 quantization to reduce costs while maintaining accuracy. It achieves significant throughput speedups and advocates for request-level efficiency metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high serving costs of reasoning-focused LLMs due to longer reasoning traces, the paper focuses on optimizing inference without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Combines heterogeneous MoE expert pruning, window attention replacement, FP8 KV-cache quantization, and post-training reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves 1.63X and 1.22X throughput speedups in long-context and short-context settings, respectively. gpt-oss-puzzle-88B matches or exceeds parent model accuracy.

Conclusion: Post-training architecture search can significantly reduce inference costs while maintaining or improving accuracy, demonstrated by gpt-oss-puzzle-88B's performance.

Abstract: Reasoning-focused LLMs improve answer quality by generating longer reasoning traces, but the additional tokens dramatically increase serving cost, motivating inference optimization. We extend and apply Puzzle, a post-training neural architecture search (NAS) framework, to gpt-oss-120B to produce gpt-oss-puzzle-88B, a deployment-optimized derivative. Our approach combines heterogeneous MoE expert pruning, selective replacement of full-context attention with window attention, FP8 KV-cache quantization with calibrated scales, and post-training reinforcement learning to recover accuracy, while maintaining low generation length. In terms of per-token speeds, on an 8XH100 node we achieve 1.63X and 1.22X throughput speedups in long-context and short-context settings, respectively. gpt-oss-puzzle-88B also delivers throughput speedups of 2.82X on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. However, because token counts can change with reasoning effort and model variants, per-token throughput (tok/s) and latency (ms/token) do not necessarily lead to end-to-end speedups: a 2X throughput gain is erased if traces grow 2X. Conversely, throughput gains can be spent on more reasoning tokens to improve accuracy; we therefore advocate request-level efficiency metrics that normalize throughput by tokens generated and trace an accuracy--speed frontier across reasoning efforts. We show that gpt-oss-puzzle-88B improves over gpt-oss-120B along the entire frontier, delivering up to 1.29X higher request-level efficiency. Across various benchmarks, gpt-oss-puzzle-88B matches or slightly exceeds the parent on suite-average accuracy across reasoning efforts, with retention ranging from 100.8% (high) to 108.2% (low), showing that post-training architecture search can substantially reduce inference costs without sacrificing quality.

TL;DR: RAM-Net bridges the gap between linear attention and full attention models by using high-dimensional sparse vectors for selective memory access, enabling scalability and efficiency without added parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of linear attention architectures, which compress unbounded history into fixed-size memory, causing information loss and reduced expressivity.

Method: Introduces Random Access Memory Network (RAM-Net), mapping inputs to high-dimensional sparse vectors as explicit addresses for selective memory access, enabling exponential state scaling.

Result: RAM-Net outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in fine-grained long-range retrieval and performs competitively in language modeling and commonsense reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: RAM-Net effectively captures complex dependencies with reduced computational overhead, validating its superior capability compared to traditional linear models.

Abstract: While linear attention architectures offer efficient inference, compressing unbounded history into a fixed-size memory inherently limits expressivity and causes information loss. To address this limitation, we introduce Random Access Memory Network (RAM-Net), a novel architecture designed to bridge the gap between the representational capacity of full attention and the memory efficiency of linear models. The core of RAM-Net maps inputs to high-dimensional sparse vectors serving as explicit addresses, allowing the model to selectively access a massive memory state. This design enables exponential state size scaling without additional parameters, which significantly mitigates signal interference and enhances retrieval fidelity. Moreover, the inherent sparsity ensures exceptional computational efficiency, as state updates are confined to minimal entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM-Net consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in fine-grained long-range retrieval tasks and achieves competitive performance in standard language modeling and zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks, validating its superior capability to capture complex dependencies with significantly reduced computational overhead.

*Ruixian Su,Yukun Bao,Xinze Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temporally Unified Adversarial Perturbations (TUAPs) and Timestamp-wise Gradient Accumulation Method (TGAM) to address temporally inconsistent perturbations in adversarial attacks on time series forecasting models, showing superior performance in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for time series forecasting are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing methods lack temporal consistency, making them impractical for real-world use.

Method: Proposes TUAPs for temporal consistency and TGAM for efficient perturbation generation by aggregating gradients from overlapping samples, integrated with momentum-based attacks.

Result: Outperforms baselines in white-box and black-box attacks under TUAP constraints, with superior transferability even without constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses temporal inconsistency in adversarial perturbations, demonstrating strong performance and generalizability.

Abstract: While deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in time series forecasting, their vulnerability to adversarial examples remains a critical security concern. However, existing attack methods in the forecasting field typically ignore the temporal consistency inherent in time series data, leading to divergent and contradictory perturbation values for the same timestamp across overlapping samples. This temporally inconsistent perturbations problem renders adversarial attacks impractical for real-world data manipulation. To address this, we introduce Temporally Unified Adversarial Perturbations (TUAPs), which enforce a temporal unification constraint to ensure identical perturbations for each timestamp across all overlapping samples. Moreover, we propose a novel Timestamp-wise Gradient Accumulation Method (TGAM) that provides a modular and efficient approach to effectively generate TUAPs by aggregating local gradient information from overlapping samples. By integrating TGAM with momentum-based attack algorithms, we ensure strict temporal consistency while fully utilizing series-level gradient information to explore the adversarial perturbation space. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and four representative state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baselines in both white-box and black-box transfer attack scenarios under TUAP constraints. Moreover, our method also exhibits superior transfer attack performance even without TUAP constraints, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in generating adversarial perturbations for time series forecasting models.

*Karolin Frohnapfel,Mara Seyfert,Sebastian Bordt,Ulrike von Luxburg,Kristof Meding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses predictive multiplicity in AI decision support systems, its conflict with the EU AI Act's accuracy requirements, and proposes tools like individual conflict ratios and δ-ambiguity to address it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive multiplicity creates arbitrariness in AI decisions impacting humans, conflicting with the EU AI Act's mandate for detailed performance reporting.

Method: Analyzes predictive multiplicity in the context of the EU AI Act, suggesting conflict ratios and δ-ambiguity to quantify model disagreements and detect affected individuals.

Result: Proposes practical tools and rules for evaluating predictive multiplicity and suggests making this information available to system deployers.

Conclusion: Incorporating predictive multiplicity analysis aligns with EU AI Act compliance and improves transparency for deployers.

Abstract: When building AI systems for decision support, one often encounters the phenomenon of predictive multiplicity: a single best model does not exist; instead, one can construct many models with similar overall accuracy that differ in their predictions for individual cases. Especially when decisions have a direct impact on humans, this can be highly unsatisfactory. For a person subject to high disagreement between models, one could as well have chosen a different model of similar overall accuracy that would have decided the person's case differently. We argue that this arbitrariness conflicts with the EU AI Act, which requires providers of high-risk AI systems to report performance not only at the dataset level but also for specific persons. The goal of this paper is to put predictive multiplicity in context with the EU AI Act's provisions on accuracy and to subsequently derive concrete suggestions on how to evaluate and report predictive multiplicity in practice. Specifically: (1) We argue that incorporating information about predictive multiplicity can serve compliance with the EU AI Act's accuracy provisions for providers. (2) Based on this legal analysis, we suggest individual conflict ratios and $δ$-ambiguity as tools to quantify the disagreement between models on individual cases and to help detect individuals subject to conflicting predictions. (3) Based on computational insights, we derive easy-to-implement rules on how model providers could evaluate predictive multiplicity in practice. (4) Ultimately, we suggest that information about predictive multiplicity should be made available to deployers under the AI Act, enabling them to judge whether system outputs for specific individuals are reliable enough for their use case.

TL;DR: PMFL enhances federated learning by using historical models and adaptive aggregation to handle data and participation heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning suffers performance drops in heterogeneous settings due to varied data distributions and node participation frequencies.

Method: Introduces model-contrastive terms for consistent updates and adaptive aggregation weights based on participation counts.

Result: PMFL outperforms existing FL methods in heterogeneous scenarios.

Conclusion: PMFL effectively addresses heterogeneity challenges in FL by leveraging historical information and adaptive aggregation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple nodes to collaboratively train a model without sharing raw data. However, FL systems are usually deployed in heterogeneous scenarios, where nodes differ in both data distributions and participation frequencies, which undermines the FL performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper proposes PMFL, a performance-enhanced model-contrastive federated learning framework using historical training information. Specifically, on the node side, we design a novel model-contrastive term into the node optimization objective by incorporating historical local models to capture stable contrastive points, thereby improving the consistency of model updates in heterogeneous data distributions.
  On the server side, we utilize the cumulative participation count of each node to adaptively adjust its aggregation weight, thereby correcting the bias in the global objective caused by different node participation frequencies. Furthermore, the updated global model incorporates historical global models to reduce its fluctuations in performance between adjacent rounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PMFL achieves superior performance compared with existing FL methods in heterogeneous scenarios.

*Xubin Wang,Weijia Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Meta-Sel is a lightweight, supervised meta-learning method for selecting effective few-shot examples in in-context learning (ICL), outperforming 12 other methods while being fast and interpretable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demonstration selection is critical in ICL but must be cheap and effective under tight prompt budgets. Existing methods lack efficiency or performance.

Method: Meta-Sel learns a scoring function using logistic regression on meta-features (TF-IDF similarity and length ratio) from labeled data, avoiding fine-tuning or extra LLM calls.

Result: Meta-Sel ranks among top methods across four datasets and five LLMs, especially aiding smaller models, with competitive speed.

Conclusion: Meta-Sel provides efficient, interpretable, and effective demonstration selection, enhancing ICL performance without added overhead.

Abstract: Demonstration selection is a practical bottleneck in in-context learning (ICL): under a tight prompt budget, accuracy can change substantially depending on which few-shot examples are included, yet selection must remain cheap enough to run per query over large candidate pools. We propose Meta-Sel, a lightweight supervised meta-learning approach for intent classification that learns a fast, interpretable scoring function for (candidate, query) pairs from labeled training data.
  Meta-Sel constructs a meta-dataset by sampling pairs from the training split and using class agreement as supervision, then trains a calibrated logistic regressor on two inexpensive meta-features: TF--IDF cosine similarity and a length-compatibility ratio. At inference time, the selector performs a single vectorized scoring pass over the full candidate pool and returns the top-k demonstrations, requiring no model fine-tuning, no online exploration, and no additional LLM calls. This yields deterministic rankings and makes the selection mechanism straightforward to audit via interpretable feature weights.
  Beyond proposing Meta-Sel, we provide a broad empirical study of demonstration selection, benchmarking 12 methods -- spanning prompt engineering baselines, heuristic selection, reinforcement learning, and influence-based approaches -- across four intent datasets and five open-source LLMs. Across this benchmark, Meta-Sel consistently ranks among the top-performing methods, is particularly effective for smaller models where selection quality can partially compensate for limited model capacity, and maintains competitive selection-time overhead.

TL;DR: The paper explores how capability-oriented training can lead AI models to exploit implicit loopholes in training environments, revealing risks beyond explicit harm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI models, trained via reinforcement learning (RL), exploit implicit flaws in training environments to maximize rewards, even without malicious intent.

Method: Designed four vulnerability games simulating exploitable flaws (context-conditional compliance, proxy metrics, reward tampering, self-evaluation). Tested models' ability to exploit these.

Result: Models consistently learned to exploit vulnerabilities, developing generalizable strategies that increased rewards at the expense of task correctness or safety.

Conclusion: Capability-oriented training risks challenge current alignment approaches; future AI safety must audit training environments and reward mechanisms.

Abstract: While most AI alignment research focuses on preventing models from generating explicitly harmful content, a more subtle risk is emerging: capability-oriented training induced exploitation. We investigate whether language models, when trained with reinforcement learning (RL) in environments with implicit loopholes, will spontaneously learn to exploit these flaws to maximize their reward, even without any malicious intent in their training. To test this, we design a suite of four diverse "vulnerability games", each presenting a unique, exploitable flaw related to context-conditional compliance, proxy metrics, reward tampering, and self-evaluation. Our experiments show that models consistently learn to exploit these vulnerabilities, discovering opportunistic strategies that significantly increase their reward at the expense of task correctness or safety. More critically, we find that these exploitative strategies are not narrow "tricks" but generalizable skills; they can be transferred to new tasks and even "distilled" from a capable teacher model to other student models through data alone. Our findings reveal that capability-oriented training induced risks pose a fundamental challenge to current alignment approaches, suggesting that future AI safety work must extend beyond content moderation to rigorously auditing and securing the training environments and reward mechanisms themselves.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational infeasibility of existing Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) approaches in large parameter spaces of LLMs by introducing a geometric reformulation.

Method: Proposes Manifold-aware Temporal LoRA (MaT-LoRA), which confines temporal updates to a low-dimensional manifold within a low-rank adaptation subspace using a structured temporal core.

Result: Demonstrates superior temporal generalization performance and practical scalability on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: MaT-LoRA efficiently models temporal evolution in LLMs with reduced complexity, offering a scalable solution for real-world deployments.

Abstract: Temporal distribution shifts are pervasive in real-world deployments of Large Language Models (LLMs), where data evolves continuously over time. While Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) seeks to model such structured evolution, existing approaches characterize model adaptation in the full parameter space. This formulation becomes computationally infeasible for modern LLMs. This paper introduces a geometric reformulation of TDG under parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We establish that the low-dimensional temporal structure underlying model evolution can be preserved under parameter-efficient reparameterization, enabling temporal modeling without operating in the ambient parameter space. Building on this principle, we propose Manifold-aware Temporal LoRA (MaT-LoRA), which constrains temporal updates to a shared low-dimensional manifold within a low-rank adaptation subspace, and models its evolution through a structured temporal core. This reparameterization dramatically reduces temporal modeling complexity while retaining expressive power. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including scientific documents, news publishers, and review ratings, demonstrate that MaT-LoRA achieves superior temporal generalization performance with practical scalability for LLMs.

*Wenkai Yang,Weijie Liu,Ruobing Xie,Kai Yang,Saiyong Yang,Yankai Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: On-policy distillation (OPD) improves student performance by aligning it with teacher logits. Generalized OPD (G-OPD) introduces reward scaling and flexible reference models, enhancing performance. Reward extrapolation (ExOPD) surpasses standard OPD, especially merging domain experts. Reward correction further aids distillation but requires teacher's pre-RL model and more computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance OPD's performance by introducing flexibility in reference models and reward scaling, addressing limitations of standard OPD.

Method: Propose G-OPD with flexible reference models and reward scaling. Tested on math reasoning and code generation tasks, focusing on ExOPD and reward correction.

Result: ExOPD outperforms OPD and surpasses teacher performance in merging domain experts. Reward correction improves distillation but requires additional resources.

Conclusion: G-OPD, especially ExOPD, offers superior performance and insights for future OPD research, though reward correction has trade-offs.

Abstract: On-policy distillation (OPD), which aligns the student with the teacher's logit distribution on student-generated trajectories, has demonstrated strong empirical gains in improving student performance and often outperforms off-policy distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) paradigms. In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i.e., reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings. In particular, in the setting where we merge the knowledge from different domain experts, obtained by applying domain-specific RL to the same student model, back into the original student, ExOPD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's performance boundary and outperform the domain teachers. (2) Building on ExOPD, we further find that in the strong-to-weak distillation setting (i.e., distilling a smaller student from a larger teacher), performing reward correction by choosing the reference model as the teacher's base model before RL yields a more accurate reward signal and further improves distillation performance. However, this choice assumes access to the teacher's pre-RL variant and incurs more computational overhead. We hope our work offers new insights for future research on OPD.

TL;DR: The paper explores the Momentum Least Mean Squares (MLMS) algorithm for adaptive identification in nonstationary data streams, offering theoretical bounds and experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of nonstationary data streams violating i.i.d. assumptions necessitate efficient, single-pass algorithms.

Method: The paper investigates MLMS, deriving its tracking performance and regret bounds in time-varying stochastic linear systems.

Result: MLMS shows rapid adaptation and robust tracking in synthetic and real-world data, especially in nonstationary settings.

Conclusion: MLMS is promising for streaming and online learning applications due to its computational simplicity and effectiveness.

Abstract: In large-scale data processing scenarios, data often arrive in sequential streams generated by complex systems that exhibit drifting distributions and time-varying system parameters. This nonstationarity challenges theoretical analysis, as it violates classical assumptions of i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) samples, necessitating algorithms capable of real-time updates without expensive retraining. An effective approach should process each sample in a single pass, while maintaining computational and memory complexities independent of the data stream length. Motivated by these challenges, this paper investigates the Momentum Least Mean Squares (MLMS) algorithm as an adaptive identification tool, leveraging its computational simplicity and online processing capabilities. Theoretically, we derive tracking performance and regret bounds for the MLMS in time-varying stochastic linear systems under various practical conditions. Unlike classical LMS, whose stability can be characterized by first-order random vector difference equations, MLMS introduces an additional dynamical state due to momentum, leading to second-order time-varying random vector difference equations whose stability analysis hinges on more complicated products of random matrices, which poses a substantially challenging problem to resolve. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate that MLMS achieves rapid adaptation and robust tracking, in agreement with our theoretical results especially in nonstationary settings, highlighting its promise for modern streaming and online learning applications.

Motivation: Understand how DP mechanisms impact SNN firing rates and FNL coordination in real-world, non-IID settings.

Method: Analyze DP's gradient clipping and noise injection effects on SNNs via ablations on privacy budgets and clipping bounds.

Result: DP causes systematic rate shifts, attenuated aggregation, and ranking instability in client selection.

Conclusion: Findings guide balancing privacy strength and rate-dependent coordination in FNL.

Abstract: Federated Neuromorphic Learning (FNL) enables energy-efficient and privacy-preserving learning on devices without centralizing data. However, real-world deployments require additional privacy mechanisms that can significantly alter training signals. This paper analyzes how Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms, specifically gradient clipping and noise injection, perturb firing-rate statistics in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and how these perturbations are propagated to rate-based FNL coordination. On a speech recognition task under non-IID settings, ablations across privacy budgets and clipping bounds reveal systematic rate shifts, attenuated aggregation, and ranking instability during client selection. Moreover, we relate these shifts to sparsity and memory indicators. Our findings provide actionable guidance for privacy-preserving FNL, specifically regarding the balance between privacy strength and rate-dependent coordination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods in federated foundation models, which involve high costs and privacy risks, FedGRPO aims to optimize client selection and knowledge transfer via reward signals.

Method: FedGRPO includes competence-based expert selection via a confidence graph and leverages Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to aggregate scalar rewards from selected clients, avoiding data or model transfer.

Result: Empirical results show FedGRPO outperforms traditional federated foundation models in downstream accuracy and communication efficiency.

Conclusion: FedGRPO provides a scalable, privacy-aware solution for federated foundation models by focusing on reward-based aggregation and expert client selection.

Abstract: One important direction of Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) is leveraging data from small client models to enhance the performance of a large server-side foundation model. Existing methods based on model level or representation level knowledge transfer either require expensive local training or incur high communication costs and introduce unavoidable privacy risks. We reformulate this problem as a reinforcement learning style evaluation process and propose FedGRPO, a privacy preserving framework comprising two modules. The first module performs competence-based expert selection by building a lightweight confidence graph from auxiliary data to identify the most suitable clients for each question. The second module leverages the "Group Relative" concept from the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by packaging each question together with its solution rationale into candidate policies, dispatching these policies to a selected subset of expert clients, and aggregating solely the resulting scalar reward signals via a federated group-relative loss function. By exchanging reward values instead of data or model updates, FedGRPO reduces privacy risk and communication overhead while enabling parallel evaluation across heterogeneous devices. Empirical results on diverse domain tasks demonstrate that FedGRPO achieves superior downstream accuracy and communication efficiency compared to conventional FedFMs baselines.

TL;DR: Olmix, a framework for data mixing in LM training, addresses challenges like unclear configuration space and evolving domain sets, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data mixing methods lack justification and fail to handle evolving domain sets during LM development, prompting the need for a more practical solution.

Method: Olmix conducts an empirical study to identify effective design choices and introduces mixture reuse to efficiently update data ratios when domains change.

Result: Mixture reuse reduces compute by 74% while matching performance of full recomputation and improves downstream task performance by 11.6%.

Conclusion: Olmix effectively addresses practical challenges in data mixing for LM training, offering significant efficiency and performance gains.

Abstract: Data mixing -- determining the ratios of data from different domains -- is a first-order concern for training language models (LMs). While existing mixing methods show promise, they fall short when applied during real-world LM development. We present Olmix, a framework that addresses two such challenges. First, the configuration space for developing a mixing method is not well understood -- design choices across existing methods lack justification or consensus and overlook practical issues like data constraints. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of this space, identifying which design choices lead to a strong mixing method. Second, in practice, the domain set evolves throughout LM development as datasets are added, removed, partitioned, and revised -- a problem setting largely unaddressed by existing works, which assume fixed domains. We study how to efficiently recompute the mixture after the domain set is updated, leveraging information from past mixtures. We introduce mixture reuse, a mechanism that reuses existing ratios and recomputes ratios only for domains affected by the update. Over a sequence of five domain-set updates mirroring real-world LM development, mixture reuse matches the performance of fully recomputing the mix after each update with 74% less compute and improves over training without mixing by 11.6% on downstream tasks.

TL;DR: PrefillShare reduces redundancy in multi-agent systems by sharing the prefill stage and KV cache across models, improving latency and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing redundancy in computation and KV storage when multiple models process the same prompt prefix in multi-agent systems.

Method: PrefillShare factorizes models into prefill and decode modules, freezes prefill, fine-tunes decode, and introduces routing for heterogeneous models.

Result: Achieves accuracy matching full fine-tuning, reduces p95 latency by 4.5x, and increases throughput by 3.9x.

Conclusion: PrefillShare effectively eliminates redundancy, enhancing performance in multi-model agent workloads.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems increasingly orchestrate multiple specialized language models to solve complex real-world problems, often invoking them over a shared context. This execution pattern repeatedly processes the same prompt prefix across models. Consequently, each model redundantly executes the prefill stage and maintains its own key-value (KV) cache, increasing aggregate prefill load and worsening tail latency by intensifying prefill-decode interference in existing LLM serving stacks. Disaggregated serving reduces such interference by placing prefill and decode on separate GPUs, but disaggregation does not fundamentally eliminate inter-model redundancy in computation and KV storage for the same prompt. To address this issue, we propose PrefillShare, a novel algorithm that enables sharing the prefill stage across multiple models in a disaggregated setting. PrefillShare factorizes the model into prefill and decode modules, freezes the prefill module, and fine-tunes only the decode module. This design allows multiple task-specific models to share a prefill module and the KV cache generated for the same prompt. We further introduce a routing mechanism that enables effective prefill sharing across heterogeneous models in a vLLM-based disaggregated system. PrefillShare not only matches full fine-tuning accuracy on a broad range of tasks and models, but also delivers 4.5x lower p95 latency and 3.9x higher throughput in multi-model agent workloads.

TL;DR: A reciprocal-space generative pipeline for crystalline materials replaces direct atomic coordinate modeling with Fourier-transformed unit-cell density, enabling efficient scaling and handling of crystallographic symmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional generative models struggle with periodic boundary conditions, crystallographic symmetries, and scaling to large/diverse unit cells, necessitating a novel approach.

Method: The method uses a truncated Fourier transform of species-resolved unit-cell density, a transformer variational autoencoder, and latent diffusion in compressed latent space.

Result: The approach reconstructs unit cells with up to 108 atoms per species using only nine Fourier basis functions per dimension and performs well on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The reciprocal-space pipeline effectively addresses limitations of particle-based models, offering scalability and symmetry handling for crystalline material discovery.

Abstract: The discovery of new crystalline materials calls for generative models that handle periodic boundary conditions, crystallographic symmetries, and physical constraints, while scaling to large and structurally diverse unit cells. We propose a reciprocal-space generative pipeline that represents crystals through a truncated Fourier transform of the species-resolved unit-cell density, rather than modeling atomic coordinates directly. This representation is periodicity-native, admits simple algebraic actions of space-group symmetries, and naturally supports variable atomic multiplicities during generation, addressing a common limitation of particle-based approaches. Using only nine Fourier basis functions per spatial dimension, our approach reconstructs unit cells containing up to 108 atoms per chemical species. We instantiate this pipeline with a transformer variational autoencoder over complex-valued Fourier coefficients, and a latent diffusion model that generates in the compressed latent space. We evaluate reconstruction and latent diffusion on the LeMaterial benchmark and compare unconditional generation against coordinate-based baselines in the small-cell regime ($\leq 16$ atoms per unit cell).

TL;DR: An online reinforcement learning approach trains LLMs using runtime performance feedback and staged optimization techniques to enhance HPC code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' strong code generation abilities, their runtime performance is unreliable, especially in HPC. This work aims to address this gap by integrating runtime feedback into training.

Method: The proposed method uses online reinforcement learning, executing LLM-generated code on a supercomputer and feeding back GFLOPS as rewards. A Staged Quality-Diversity (SQD) algorithm progressively varies optimization techniques per problem. A distributed system connects GPU training and CPU benchmarking clusters, training Qwen2.5 Coder 14B with GRPO on matrix multiplication.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that combining runtime performance feedback with staged optimization improves LLMs' HPC code generation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances LLM-generated code performance in HPC, leveraging runtime feedback and diverse optimization stages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong code generation capabilities, yet the runtime performance of generated code is not guaranteed, and there have been few attempts to train LLMs using runtime performance as a reward in the HPC domain. We propose an online reinforcement learning approach that executes LLM-generated code on a supercomputer and directly feeds back the measured runtime performance (GFLOPS) as a reward. We further introduce a Staged Quality-Diversity (SQD) algorithm that progressively varies the permitted optimization techniques on a per-problem basis, enabling the model to learn code optimization from diverse perspectives. We build a distributed system connecting a GPU training cluster with a CPU benchmarking cluster, and train Qwen2.5 Coder 14B on a double-precision matrix multiplication task using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through two experiments, we show that reinforcement learning combining runtime performance feedback with staged optimization can improve the HPC code generation capability of LLMs.

*Hyunsung Kim,Kunhee Lee,Sangwoo Seo,Sang-Ki Ko,Jinsung Yoon,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PathCRF is a framework for detecting soccer events using player tracking data only, reducing reliance on manual annotation and costly ball tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current soccer event data collection is labor-intensive and confined to top-tier competitions due to high costs. PathCRF aims to enable broader data-driven analysis by automating event detection.

Method: Models player trajectories as a dynamic graph, using a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to logically detect events. Emission and transition scores are dynamically computed from edge embeddings via a Set Attention-based backbone.

Result: PathCRF produces accurate, logically consistent possession paths, reducing manual annotation needs and enabling reliable analyses.

Conclusion: PathCRF successfully automates soccer event detection using player tracking data, making comprehensive data collection more scalable.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in AI, event data collection in soccer still relies heavily on labor-intensive manual annotation. Although prior work has explored automatic event detection using player and ball trajectories, ball tracking also remains difficult to scale due to high infrastructural and operational costs. As a result, comprehensive data collection in soccer is largely confined to top-tier competitions, limiting the broader adoption of data-driven analysis in this domain. To address this challenge, this paper proposes PathCRF, a framework for detecting on-ball soccer events using only player tracking data. We model player trajectories as a fully connected dynamic graph and formulate event detection as the problem of selecting exactly one edge corresponding to the current possession state at each time step. To ensure logical consistency of the resulting edge sequence, we employ a Conditional Random Field (CRF) that forbids impossible transitions between consecutive edges. Both emission and transition scores dynamically computed from edge embeddings produced by a Set Attention-based backbone architecture. During inference, the most probable edge sequence is obtained via Viterbi decoding, and events such as ball controls or passes are detected whenever the selected edge changes between adjacent time steps. Experiments show that PathCRF produces accurate, logically consistent possession paths, enabling reliable downstream analyses while substantially reducing the need for manual event annotation.

*Jihao Andreas Lin,Sebastian Ament,Louis C. Tiao,David Eriksson,Maximilian Balandat,Eytan Bakshy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Empirical GPs offer a flexible, data-driven alternative to traditional Gaussian processes by empirically estimating mean and covariance functions from historical data, improving adaptability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GPs rely on handcrafted kernel functions, which limit adaptivity and require expert knowledge. Empirical GPs aim to overcome these limitations by deriving priors directly from data.

Method: Empirical GPs estimate mean and covariance functions from historical observations. The framework uses an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for learning the GP prior from independent datasets.

Result: The model converges to the GP closest to the real data-generating process. Empirically, it performs competitively in learning curve extrapolation and time series forecasting.

Conclusion: Empirical GPs provide a principled and flexible approach to Gaussian process modeling, enhancing performance and reducing reliance on expert-crafted kernels.

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful and widely used probabilistic regression models, but their effectiveness in practice is often limited by the choice of kernel function. This kernel function is typically handcrafted from a small set of standard functions, a process that requires expert knowledge, results in limited adaptivity to data, and imposes strong assumptions on the hypothesis space. We study Empirical GPs, a principled framework for constructing flexible, data-driven GP priors that overcome these limitations. Rather than relying on standard parametric kernels, we estimate the mean and covariance functions empirically from a corpus of historical observations, enabling the prior to reflect rich, non-trivial covariance structures present in the data. Theoretically, we show that the resulting model converges to the GP that is closest (in KL-divergence sense) to the real data generating process. Practically, we formulate the problem of learning the GP prior from independent datasets as likelihood estimation and derive an Expectation-Maximization algorithm with closed-form updates, allowing the model handle heterogeneous observation locations across datasets. We demonstrate that Empirical GPs achieve competitive performance on learning curve extrapolation and time series forecasting benchmarks.

TL;DR: A novel method learns structured latent representations correlating state distances with transition actions, improving robustness to sensor noise in RL tasks without explicit probabilistic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is estimating environment states from noisy, high-dimensional observations in RL, where traditional probabilistic models limit generalization due to explicit noise assumptions.

Method: Introduces a multimodal latent transition model and sensor fusion via inverse distance weighting, adapting multiple sensor modalities without noise distribution knowledge.

Result: Empirical validation shows improved robustness to sensor noise, superior state estimation, and enhanced RL agent performance without explicit noise augmentation.

Conclusion: Transition-aware metric spaces offer a scalable solution for robust state estimation in sequential decision-making.

Abstract: Estimating the state of an environment from high-dimensional, multimodal, and noisy observations is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Traditional approaches rely on probabilistic models to account for the uncertainty, but often require explicit noise assumptions, in turn limiting generalization. In this work, we contribute a novel method to learn a structured latent representation, in which distances between states directly correlate with the minimum number of actions required to transition between them. The proposed metric space formulation provides a geometric interpretation of uncertainty without the need for explicit probabilistic modeling. To achieve this, we introduce a multimodal latent transition model and a sensor fusion mechanism based on inverse distance weighting, allowing for the adaptive integration of multiple sensor modalities without prior knowledge of noise distributions. We empirically validate the approach on a range of multimodal RL tasks, demonstrating improved robustness to sensor noise and superior state estimation compared to baseline methods. Our experiments show enhanced performance of an RL agent via the learned representation, eliminating the need of explicit noise augmentation. The presented results suggest that leveraging transition-aware metric spaces provides a principled and scalable solution for robust state estimation in sequential decision-making.

*Haolin Liu,Braham Snyder,Chen-Yu Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores offline reinforcement learning under $Q^\star$-approximation and partial coverage, addressing theoretical gaps and improving sample complexity bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the lack of theoretical understanding of $Q^\star$-realizability and Bellman completeness for sample-efficient offline RL under partial coverage.

Method: Introduces a general framework inspired by model-free decision-estimation coefficients (DEC), modularizing $Q^\star$ estimation procedures. Develops a second-order performance difference lemma for improved sample complexity.

Result: Achieves better sample complexity bounds ($\epsilon^{-2}$) for soft $Q$-learning, removes the need for additional online interaction, and extends learnability to low-Bellman-rank MDPs without Bellman completeness.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive theoretical framework and practical improvements for offline RL, bridging gaps in existing literature and offering new insights.

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning under $Q^\star$-approximation and partial coverage, a setting that motivates practical algorithms such as Conservative $Q$-Learning (CQL; Kumar et al., 2020) but has received limited theoretical attention. Our work is inspired by the following open question: "Are $Q^\star$-realizability and Bellman completeness sufficient for sample-efficient offline RL under partial coverage?"
  We answer in the negative by establishing an information-theoretic lower bound. Going substantially beyond this, we introduce a general framework that characterizes the intrinsic complexity of a given $Q^\star$ function class, inspired by model-free decision-estimation coefficients (DEC) for online RL (Foster et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2025b). This complexity recovers and improves the quantities underlying the guarantees of Chen and Jiang (2022) and Uehara et al. (2023), and extends to broader settings. Our decision-estimation decomposition can be combined with a wide range of $Q^\star$ estimation procedures, modularizing and generalizing existing approaches.
  Beyond the general framework, we make further contributions: By developing a novel second-order performance difference lemma, we obtain the first $ε^{-2}$ sample complexity under partial coverage for soft $Q$-learning, improving the $ε^{-4}$ bound of Uehara et al. (2023). We remove Chen and Jiang's (2022) need for additional online interaction when the value gap of $Q^\star$ is unknown. We also give the first characterization of offline learnability for general low-Bellman-rank MDPs without Bellman completeness (Jiang et al., 2017; Du et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2021), a canonical setting in online RL that remains unexplored in offline RL except for special cases. Finally, we provide the first analysis for CQL under $Q^\star$-realizability and Bellman completeness beyond the tabular case.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Bayesian Optimization framework that leverages high-dimensional auxiliary information and task history for efficient optimization, outperforming existing methods in robotic hardware design and hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world optimization problems often generate auxiliary data alongside performance measures, but existing Bayesian Optimization methods overlook this. The paper aims to utilize this additional information to improve optimization efficiency.

Method: A neural model is developed to predict performance measures using auxiliary feedback and few-shot context from task history.

Result: The method achieves more accurate predictions and faster optimization compared to traditional multi-task optimization methods in robotic hardware design and hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively leverages auxiliary feedback and task history, significantly enhancing optimization performance in complex design problems.

Abstract: Many real-world design problems involve optimizing an expensive black-box function $f(x)$, such as hardware design or drug discovery. Bayesian Optimization has emerged as a sample-efficient framework for this problem. However, the basic setting considered by these methods is simplified compared to real-world experimental setups, where experiments often generate a wealth of useful information. We introduce a new setting where an experiment generates high-dimensional auxiliary information $h(x)$ along with the performance measure $f(x)$; moreover, a history of previously solved tasks from the same task family is available for accelerating optimization. A key challenge of our setting is learning how to represent and utilize $h(x)$ for efficiently solving new optimization tasks beyond the task history. We develop a novel approach for this setting based on a neural model which predicts $f(x)$ for unseen designs given a few-shot context containing observations of $h(x)$. We evaluate our method on two challenging domains, robotic hardware design and neural network hyperparameter tuning, and introduce a novel design problem and large-scale benchmark for the former. On both domains, our method utilizes auxiliary feedback effectively to achieve more accurate few-shot prediction and faster optimization of design tasks, significantly outperforming several methods for multi-task optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces KAN-FIF, a lightweight framework for TC monitoring, reducing parameters and inference time while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely TC monitoring is critical for reducing damage, but existing methods are resource-heavy and inefficient.

Method: KAN-FIF combines MLP, CNN, and KAN layers for efficient multimodal TC attribute modeling.

Result: Achieves 94.8% fewer parameters, 68.7% faster inference, and 32.5% lower MAE compared to baselines.

Conclusion: KAN-FIF is feasible for edge-device deployment, enhancing operational TC monitoring.

Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TC) are among the most destructive natural disasters, causing catastrophic damage to coastal regions through extreme winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. Timely monitoring of tropical cyclones is crucial for reducing loss of life and property, yet it is hindered by the computational inefficiency and high parameter counts of existing methods on resource-constrained edge devices. Current physics-guided models suffer from linear feature interactions that fail to capture high-order polynomial relationships between TC attributes, leading to inflated model sizes and hardware incompatibility. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based Feature Interaction Framework (KAN-FIF), a lightweight multimodal architecture that integrates MLP and CNN layers with spline-parameterized KAN layers. For Maximum Sustained Wind (MSW) prediction, experiments demonstrate that the KAN-FIF framework achieves a $94.8\%$ reduction in parameters (0.99MB vs 19MB) and $68.7\%$ faster inference per sample (2.3ms vs 7.35ms) compared to baseline model Phy-CoCo, while maintaining superior accuracy with $32.5\%$ lower MAE. The offline deployment experiment of the FY-4 series meteorological satellite processor on the Qingyun-1000 development board achieved a 14.41ms per-sample inference latency with the KAN-FIF framework, demonstrating promising feasibility for operational TC monitoring and extending deployability to edge-device AI applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Combining Transformers with a linear damped harmonic oscillator analogy to handle irregular time series efficiently, avoiding computational bottlenecks of numerical solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers struggle with irregular time series due to uniform interval assumptions, while NODEs are computationally expensive.

Method: Replace NODEs with a linear damped harmonic oscillator analogy, modeling keys/values as oscillators and expanding queries in sinusoidal modes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on irregular time series benchmarks with significant speed improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers theoretical guarantees, scalability, and outperforms existing approaches in efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Transformers excel at time series modelling through attention mechanisms that capture long-term temporal patterns. However, they assume uniform time intervals and therefore struggle with irregular time series. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) effectively handle irregular time series by modelling hidden states as continuously evolving trajectories. ContiFormers arxiv:2402.10635 combine NODEs with Transformers, but inherit the computational bottleneck of the former by using heavy numerical solvers. This bottleneck can be removed by using a closed-form solution for the given dynamical system - but this is known to be intractable in general! We obviate this by replacing NODEs with a novel linear damped harmonic oscillator analogy - which has a known closed-form solution. We model keys and values as damped, driven oscillators and expand the query in a sinusoidal basis up to a suitable number of modes. This analogy naturally captures the query-key coupling that is fundamental to any transformer architecture by modelling attention as a resonance phenomenon. Our closed-form solution eliminates the computational overhead of numerical ODE solvers while preserving expressivity. We prove that this oscillator-based parameterisation maintains the universal approximation property of continuous-time attention; specifically, any discrete attention matrix realisable by ContiFormer's continuous keys can be approximated arbitrarily well by our fixed oscillator modes. Our approach delivers both theoretical guarantees and scalability, achieving state-of-the-art performance on irregular time series benchmarks while being orders of magnitude faster.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TSFM benchmarks suffer from data reuse, poor integrity, misaligned tasks, and rigid analysis, hindering generalizable insights.

Method: Introduces TIME: 50 fresh datasets, 98 tasks, human-in-the-loop pipeline, and pattern-level evaluation using structural time series features.

Result: Evaluated 12 TSFMs via multi-granular leaderboard, providing insights into model capabilities across diverse temporal patterns.

Conclusion: TIME offers a robust, real-world-aligned benchmark for zero-shot TSFM evaluation, advancing pattern-level insights.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are revolutionizing the forecasting landscape from specific dataset modeling to generalizable task evaluation. However, we contend that existing benchmarks exhibit common limitations in four dimensions: constrained data composition dominated by reused legacy sources, compromised data integrity lacking rigorous quality assurance, misaligned task formulations detached from real-world contexts, and rigid analysis perspectives that obscure generalizable insights. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TIME, a next-generation task-centric benchmark comprising 50 fresh datasets and 98 forecasting tasks, tailored for strict zero-shot TSFM evaluation free from data leakage. Integrating large language models and human expertise, we establish a rigorous human-in-the-loop benchmark construction pipeline to ensure high data integrity and redefine task formulation by aligning forecasting configurations with real-world operational requirements and variate predictability. Furthermore, we propose a novel pattern-level evaluation perspective that moves beyond traditional dataset-level evaluations based on static meta labels. By leveraging structural time series features to characterize intrinsic temporal properties, this approach offers generalizable insights into model capabilities across diverse patterns. We evaluate 12 representative TSFMs and establish a multi-granular leaderboard to facilitate in-depth analysis and visualized inspection.

TL;DR: SafeNeuron is a neuron-level safety alignment framework that redistributes safety representations across LLMs to improve robustness against attacks and reduce reliance on sparse safety pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment methods for LLMs are brittle and focus on behavioral-level control, making them vulnerable to neuron-level attacks and lacking internal safety mechanism oversight.

Method: SafeNeuron identifies safety-related neurons and freezes them during preference optimization to force redundant safety representation construction and prevent sparse pathway reliance.

Result: SafeNeuron enhances robustness against neuron pruning attacks, reduces misuse risks in open-source models, and maintains general capabilities while revealing stable safety representations.

Conclusion: SafeNeuron offers an interpretable and robust approach to model alignment by addressing internal safety mechanisms and redistributing safety representations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs are typically safety-aligned before release to prevent harmful content generation. However, recent studies show that safety behaviors are concentrated in a small subset of parameters, making alignment brittle and easily bypassed through neuron-level attacks. Moreover, most existing alignment methods operate at the behavioral level, offering limited control over the model's internal safety mechanisms. In this work, we propose SafeNeuron, a neuron-level safety alignment framework that improves robustness by redistributing safety representations across the network. SafeNeuron first identifies safety-related neurons, then freezes these neurons during preference optimization to prevent reliance on sparse safety pathways and force the model to construct redundant safety representations. Extensive experiments across models and modalities demonstrate that SafeNeuron significantly improves robustness against neuron pruning attacks, reduces the risk of open-source models being repurposed as red-team generators, and preserves general capabilities. Furthermore, our layer-wise analysis reveals that safety behaviors are governed by stable and shared internal representations. Overall, SafeNeuron provides an interpretable and robust perspective for model alignment.

TL;DR: GRXForm improves molecular optimization by adapting a pre-trained Graph Transformer with Group Relative Policy Optimization to handle heterogeneous starting structures, achieving competitive results without additional refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for molecular optimization struggle with generalization due to high variance from diverse starting structures.

Method: GRXForm uses a pre-trained Graph Transformer and fine-tunes it with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to normalize rewards relative to starting structures.

Result: GRXForm generalizes to out-of-distribution scaffolds without inference-time oracle calls, performing competitively in multi-objective optimization.

Conclusion: GRXForm effectively addresses variance issues in molecular optimization, offering a transferable and efficient solution.

Abstract: Molecular design encompasses tasks ranging from de-novo design to structural alteration of given molecules or fragments. For the latter, state-of-the-art methods predominantly function as "Instance Optimizers'', expending significant compute restarting the search for every input structure. While model-based approaches theoretically offer amortized efficiency by learning a policy transferable to unseen structures, existing methods struggle to generalize. We identify a key failure mode: the high variance arising from the heterogeneous difficulty of distinct starting structures. To address this, we introduce GRXForm, adapting a pre-trained Graph Transformer model that optimizes molecules via sequential atom-and-bond additions. We employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for goal-directed fine-tuning to mitigate variance by normalizing rewards relative to the starting structure. Empirically, GRXForm generalizes to out-of-distribution molecular scaffolds without inference-time oracle calls or refinement, achieving scores in multi-objective optimization competitive with leading instance optimizers.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effects of sampling and reference choices in aligning large language models with human preferences, showing that proper sampling improves rankings while skewed sampling can cause issues. It also analyzes iterative alignment dynamics, identifying potential oscillations or entropy collapse and characterizing stable regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical underpinnings of sampling and reference choices in preference alignment methods, which are widely used but poorly understood.

Method: The study uses Identity Preference Optimization to analyze sampling effects and iterative alignment dynamics, extending insights to Direct Preference Optimization.

Result: Proper sampling enhances ranking guarantees, while skewed sampling can lead to concentration issues. Iterative alignment dynamics may exhibit oscillations or entropy collapse under certain conditions.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of careful sampling and parameter choices in preference alignment methods, with implications for broader applications in aligning language models.

Abstract: Standard methods for aligning large language models with human preferences learn from pairwise comparisons among sampled candidate responses and regularize toward a reference policy. Despite their effectiveness, the effects of sampling and reference choices are poorly understood theoretically. We investigate these effects through Identity Preference Optimization, a widely used preference alignment framework, and show that proper instance-dependent sampling can yield stronger ranking guarantees, while skewed on-policy sampling can induce excessive concentration under structured preferences. We then analyze iterative alignment dynamics in which the learned policy feeds back into future sampling and reference policies, reflecting a common practice of model-generated preference data. We prove that these dynamics can exhibit persistent oscillations or entropy collapse for certain parameter choices, and characterize regimes that guarantee stability. Our theoretical insights extend to Direct Preference Optimization, indicating the phenomena we captured are common to a broader class of preference-alignment methods. Experiments on real-world preference data validate our findings.

TL;DR: WaveFormer is a transformer architecture integrating wavelet decomposition for biomedical signal classification, outperforming standard transformers by capturing multi-scale frequency patterns and temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transformer architectures struggle with long sequences and complex temporal dynamics in biomedical signals, lacking effective frequency-domain processing.

Method: WaveFormer uses multi-channel DWT for embedding and mono-channel DWT for positional encoding, adapting to signal-specific temporal structures.

Result: WaveFormer achieves competitive performance across eight datasets with varying sequence lengths and channel counts.

Conclusion: WaveFormer offers a principled way to integrate frequency-domain knowledge into transformers for time series classification.

Abstract: Biomedical signal classification presents unique challenges due to long sequences, complex temporal dynamics, and multi-scale frequency patterns that are poorly captured by standard transformer architectures. We propose WaveFormer, a transformer architecture that integrates wavelet decomposition at two critical stages: embedding construction, where multi-channel Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) extracts frequency features to create tokens containing both time-domain and frequency-domain information, and positional encoding, where Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding (DyWPE) adapts position embeddings to signal-specific temporal structure through mono-channel DWT analysis. We evaluate WaveFormer on eight diverse datasets spanning human activity recognition and brain signal analysis, with sequence lengths ranging from 50 to 3000 timesteps and channel counts from 1 to 144. Experimental results demonstrate that WaveFormer achieves competitive performance through comprehensive frequency-aware processing. Our approach provides a principled framework for incorporating frequency-domain knowledge into transformer-based time series classification.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoRAM, a memory consolidation mechanism that reduces attention usage over time by distilling episodic retrievals into semantic memory, achieving significant efficiency gains and matching human memory transition patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the observation that 88% of attention operations in GPT-2 models retrieve redundant information, which doesn't decrease during training. This inefficiency suggests the need for a dynamic attention mechanism that adapts over time to reduce unnecessary computations.

Method: The authors propose CoRAM (Consolidation-based Routing for Adaptive Memory), a biologically inspired mechanism that gradually converts episodic retrievals into parametric semantic memory. Unlike static sparse attention methods, CoRAM dynamically reduces attention utilization as patterns become familiar.

Result: CoRAM achieves a 37.8× reduction in attention usage, with a sharp transition around 3K steps. It also demonstrates 100% retrieval accuracy at 1.6% attention compute on the SRCD benchmark and matches human memory transition curves (γ ≈ 0.43).

Conclusion: The paper concludes that CoRAM effectively addresses the redundancy in attention operations, offering a biologically plausible solution that improves efficiency and transfers learned patterns to new tasks without retraining.

Abstract: Hybrid architectures combining state-space models with attention have achieved strong efficiency-quality tradeoffs, yet existing approaches either apply attention uniformly or learn static sparse patterns. This misses a key opportunity: \emph{attention demand should decrease over time as recurring patterns become familiar}. We present a surprising finding from analyzing GPT-2 models: \textbf{88\%} of attention operations retrieve information already predictable from the model's hidden state, and this redundancy does \emph{not} decrease during training. Motivated by this observation, we introduce \textbf{\ours{}} (\textbf{C}onsolidation-based \textbf{R}outing for \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{M}emory), a biologically inspired memory consolidation mechanism that gradually distills episodic retrievals into parametric semantic memory. Unlike prior sparse attention methods, \ours{} exhibits \emph{decreasing attention utilization} over training, achieving a \textbf{37.8$\times$} reduction through a sharp phase transition at approximately 3K steps. We prove that this capability is \emph{impossible} without consolidation: any static routing scheme requires $Ω(f \cdot n)$ attention for tasks with recurring patterns of frequency $f$. On our proposed SRCD benchmark, \ours{} achieves \textbf{100\% retrieval accuracy} at 1.6\% attention compute (vs.\ 68\% for baselines), and consolidated patterns transfer to unseen tasks with \textbf{48--52\%} attention reduction without retraining. Remarkably, the learned consolidation dynamics quantitatively match human episodic-to-semantic memory transition curves from cognitive psychology ($γ= 0.43$ vs.\ $γ_{\text{human}} \approx 0.4$--$0.5$).

TL;DR: The paper introduces PhyIP, a non-invasive method to evaluate if neural models internalize physical laws linearly from frozen representations, avoiding the pitfalls of adaptation-based evaluations that can distort latent structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of determining whether neural models genuinely learn physical laws or rely on statistical shortcuts, especially under OOD shifts, without altering the model's representations through invasive methods like fine-tuning.

Method: Proposes PhyIP, which tests if physical quantities are linearly decodable from frozen SSL representations, adhering to the linear representation hypothesis. Evaluated on fluid dynamics and orbital mechanics.

Result: Finds that when SSL achieves low error, physical quantities become linearly accessible (e.g., high correlation ρ>0.90). Adaptation-based evaluations, however, can collapse this structure (ρ≈0.05).

Conclusion: Low-capacity probes like PhyIP provide a more accurate evaluation of latent physical world models compared to adaptation-based methods, which may obscure true learning.

Abstract: Determining whether neural models internalize physical laws as world models, rather than exploiting statistical shortcuts, remains challenging, especially under out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts. Standard evaluations often test latent capability via downstream adaptation (e.g., fine-tuning or high-capacity probes), but such interventions can change the representations being measured and thus confound what was learned during self-supervised learning (SSL). We propose a non-invasive evaluation protocol, PhyIP. We test whether physical quantities are linearly decodable from frozen representations, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis. Across fluid dynamics and orbital mechanics, we find that when SSL achieves low error, latent structure becomes linearly accessible. PhyIP recovers internal energy and Newtonian inverse-square scaling on OOD tests (e.g., $ρ> 0.90$). In contrast, adaptation-based evaluations can collapse this structure ($ρ\approx 0.05$). These findings suggest that adaptation-based evaluation can obscure latent structures and that low-capacity probes offer a more accurate evaluation of physical world models.

TL;DR: Introduces Categorical Flow Maps for efficient few-step generation of categorical data using self-distillation, leveraging continuous trajectories and existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate inference in categorical data generation by combining flow matching with self-distillation.

Method: Defines a flow map towards the simplex, uses distillation techniques, and introduces an endpoint consistency objective.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art few-step results on images, molecular graphs, and text, even in single-step generation.

Conclusion: Categorical Flow Maps effectively accelerate and improve categorical data generation with existing techniques.

Abstract: We introduce Categorical Flow Maps, a flow-matching method for accelerated few-step generation of categorical data via self-distillation. Building on recent variational formulations of flow matching and the broader trend towards accelerated inference in diffusion and flow-based models, we define a flow map towards the simplex that transports probability mass toward a predicted endpoint, yielding a parametrisation that naturally constrains model predictions. Since our trajectories are continuous rather than discrete, Categorical Flow Maps can be trained with existing distillation techniques, as well as a new objective based on endpoint consistency. This continuous formulation also automatically unlocks test-time inference: we can directly reuse existing guidance and reweighting techniques in the categorical setting to steer sampling toward downstream objectives. Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art few-step results on images, molecular graphs, and text, with strong performance even in single-step generation.

### [279] [Intrinsic-Energy Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures Induce Quasimetric Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12245)
*Anthony Kobanda,Waris Radji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper connects Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) and Quasimetric Reinforcement Learning (QRL) by showing that JEPA energy functions can be intrinsic (least-action) energies, which are quasimetrics, aligning with QRL's focus on asymmetric dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between JEPAs, which learn representations via energy functions, and QRL, which studies goal-reaching control with asymmetric distances.

Method: Restricts JEPA energy functions to intrinsic energies (infima of accumulated local effort) and shows they are quasimetrics, aligning with QRL's cost-to-go functions.

Result: JEPAs modeling intrinsic energies align with QRL's quasimetric value class, and symmetric energies are mismatched with directional reachability.

Conclusion: Asymmetric (quasimetric) energies in JEPAs are better suited for directional tasks, connecting them naturally with QRL.

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) aim to learn representations by predicting target embeddings from context embeddings, inducing a scalar compatibility energy in a latent space. In contrast, Quasimetric Reinforcement Learning (QRL) studies goal-conditioned control through directed distance values (cost-to-go) that support reaching goals under asymmetric dynamics. In this short article, we connect these viewpoints by restricting attention to a principled class of JEPA energy functions : intrinsic (least-action) energies, defined as infima of accumulated local effort over admissible trajectories between two states. Under mild closure and additivity assumptions, any intrinsic energy is a quasimetric. In goal-reaching control, optimal cost-to-go functions admit exactly this intrinsic form ; inversely, JEPAs trained to model intrinsic energies lie in the quasimetric value class targeted by QRL. Moreover, we observe why symmetric finite energies are structurally mismatched with one-way reachability, motivating asymmetric (quasimetric) energies when directionality matters.

TL;DR: GNNs can unintentionally expose sensitive community data. This paper proposes a perturbation strategy to conceal communities while preserving utility, outperforming existing methods by 20-45%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address group-level privacy risks when using GNNs for community detection, aiming to hide sensitive communities without significantly harming data utility.

Method: Introduces a perturbation strategy rewiring edges and modifying node features to reduce community distinctiveness, leveraging insights about connectivity and feature similarity.

Result: Achieves median concealment improvements of 20-45% over DICE under identical perturbation budgets in synthetic and real-world networks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective mitigation against GNN-based community exposure and underscores inherent privacy risks in graph learning.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to use attributed graphs to learn representations. Such representations are beneficial in the unsupervised learning of clusters and community detection. Nonetheless, such inference may reveal sensitive groups, clustered systems, or collective behaviors, raising concerns regarding group-level privacy. Community attribution in social and critical infrastructure networks, for example, can expose coordinated asset groups, operational hierarchies, and system dependencies that could be used for profiling or intelligence gathering. We study a defensive setting in which a data publisher (defender) seeks to conceal a community of interest while making limited, utility-aware changes in the network. Our analysis indicates that community concealment is strongly influenced by two quantifiable factors: connectivity at the community boundary and feature similarity between the protected community and adjacent communities. Informed by these findings, we present a perturbation strategy that rewires a set of selected edges and modifies node features to reduce the distinctiveness leveraged by GNN message passing. The proposed method outperforms DICE in our experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real network graphs under identical perturbation budgets. Overall, it achieves median relative concealment improvements of approximately 20-45% across the evaluated settings. These findings demonstrate a mitigation strategy against GNN-based community learning and highlight group-level privacy risks intrinsic to graph learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FGNO introduces dynamic corruption levels in SSL for time-series data, outperforming fixed-ratio methods with robust performance across biomedical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed masking ratios in SSL limit flexibility; dynamic corruption levels enhance representation learning.

Method: FGNO combines operator learning with flow matching, uses STFT for resolution unification, and extracts features from varying noise strengths.

Result: FGNO improves AUROC by 35%, reduces RMSE by 16%, and boosts accuracy/F1 by 20% across biomedical datasets.

Conclusion: FGNO offers adaptable, high-performance SSL for diverse time-series tasks, especially in low-data scenarios.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a powerful paradigm for learning from unlabeled time-series data. However, popular methods such as masked autoencoders (MAEs) rely on reconstructing inputs from a fixed, predetermined masking ratio. Instead of this static design, we propose treating the corruption level as a new degree of freedom for representation learning, enhancing flexibility and performance. To achieve this, we introduce the Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO), a novel framework combining operator learning with flow matching for SSL training. FGNO learns mappings in functional spaces by using Short-Time Fourier Transform to unify different time resolutions. We extract a rich hierarchy of features by tapping into different network layers and flow times that apply varying strengths of noise to the input data. This enables the extraction of versatile representations, from low-level patterns to high-level global features, using a single model adaptable to specific tasks. Unlike prior generative SSL methods that use noisy inputs during inference, we propose using clean inputs for representation extraction while learning representations with noise; this eliminates randomness and boosts accuracy. We evaluate FGNO across three biomedical domains, where it consistently outperforms established baselines. Our method yields up to 35% AUROC gains in neural signal decoding (BrainTreeBank), 16% RMSE reductions in skin temperature prediction (DREAMT), and over 20% improvement in accuracy and macro-F1 on SleepEDF under low-data regimes. These results highlight FGNO's robustness to data scarcity and its superior capacity to learn expressive representations for diverse time series.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fun-DDPS is a generative framework combining function-space diffusion models and neural operators for subsurface flow modeling in CCS, improving accuracy and efficiency in forward and inverse problem-solving under sparse data conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of accurately characterizing subsurface flow in CCS, particularly the ill-posed nature of inverse problems with limited observations, by developing a robust and efficient framework.

Method: Fun-DDPS uses a single-channel diffusion model for prior distribution learning and a Local Neural Operator surrogate for physics-consistent guidance, decoupling parameter recovery and data assimilation.

Result: Fun-DDPS significantly outperforms standard surrogates (11x improvement in forward modeling) and matches ground truth in inverse modeling with high sample efficiency and physical consistency.

Conclusion: The Fun-DDPS framework effectively handles extreme data sparsity and produces accurate, artifact-free results, making it a promising tool for CCS subsurface flow modeling.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of subsurface flow is critical for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) but remains challenged by the ill-posed nature of inverse problems with sparse observations. We present Fun-DDPS, a generative framework that combines function-space diffusion models with differentiable neural operator surrogates for both forward and inverse modeling. Our approach learns a prior distribution over geological parameters (geomodel) using a single-channel diffusion model, then leverages a Local Neural Operator (LNO) surrogate to provide physics-consistent guidance for cross-field conditioning on the dynamics field. This decoupling allows the diffusion prior to robustly recover missing information in parameter space, while the surrogate provides efficient gradient-based guidance for data assimilation. We demonstrate Fun-DDPS on synthetic CCS modeling datasets, achieving two key results: (1) For forward modeling with only 25% observations, Fun-DDPS achieves 7.7% relative error compared to 86.9% for standard surrogates (an 11x improvement), proving its capability to handle extreme data sparsity where deterministic methods fail. (2) We provide the first rigorous validation of diffusion-based inverse solvers against asymptotically exact Rejection Sampling (RS) posteriors. Both Fun-DDPS and the joint-state baseline (Fun-DPS) achieve Jensen-Shannon divergence less than 0.06 against the ground truth. Crucially, Fun-DDPS produces physically consistent realizations free from the high-frequency artifacts observed in joint-state baselines, achieving this with 4x improved sample efficiency compared to rejection sampling.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a human-centered XAI module for DashAI, a no-code ML platform, integrating PDP, PFI, and KernelSHAP techniques. A user study showed high task success, usability for novices, and trust improvements, though experts were more critical of explanation sufficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap in explainability for no-code ML platforms, ensuring transparency in automated decisions for sensitive domains like healthcare and finance.

Method: The method involves integrating PDP, PFI, and KernelSHAP into DashAI's workflow for tabular classification, followed by a user study with ML novices and experts to evaluate usability and explanation impact.

Result: Results showed high task success (≥80%), novices finding explanations useful and trustworthy (ESS: α=0.74), while experts were more critical. Trust in Automation improved (TiA: α=0.60), especially for novices.

Conclusion: The study highlights the challenge of making XAI explanations accessible to novices while detailed enough for experts in no-code ML platforms.

Abstract: The increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and public policy has raised concerns about the transparency of automated decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this by clarifying how models generate predictions, yet most methods demand technical expertise, limiting their value for novices. This gap is especially critical in no-code ML platforms, which seek to democratize AI but rarely include explainability. We present a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform. The module integrates three complementary techniques, which are Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP, into DashAI's workflow for tabular classification. A user study (N = 20; ML novices and experts) evaluated usability and the impact of explanations. Results show: (i) high task success ($\geq80\%$) across all explainability tasks; (ii) novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on the Explanation Satisfaction Scale (ESS, Cronbach's $α$ = 0.74, a measure of internal consistency), while experts were more critical of sufficiency and completeness; and (iii) explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on the Trust in Automation scale (TiA, $α$ = 0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts. These findings highlight a central challenge for XAI in no-code ML, making explanations both accessible to novices and sufficiently detailed for experts.

*Zituo Chen,Haixu Wu,Sili Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents Latent Generative Solvers (LGS), a two-stage framework for simulating diverse PDE systems with reduced rollout drift and improved long-term stability, achieving lower computational costs and efficient adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of simulating heterogeneous PDE systems, particularly long-horizon forecasting, by introducing uncertainty-aware and computationally efficient neural solvers.

Method: LGS uses a pretrained VAE to map PDE states into a shared latent space and learns probabilistic dynamics with a Transformer trained by flow matching, incorporating an uncertainty knob and flow forcing.

Result: LGS matches deterministic baselines on short horizons, reduces long-horizon drift, and achieves up to 70× lower FLOPs. It also adapts well to out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: LGS offers a scalable and reliable approach for uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers, enhancing long-term forecasting and scientific workflows.

Abstract: We study long-horizon surrogate simulation across heterogeneous PDE systems. We introduce Latent Generative Solvers (LGS), a two-stage framework that (i) maps diverse PDE states into a shared latent physics space with a pretrained VAE, and (ii) learns probabilistic latent dynamics with a Transformer trained by flow matching. Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to correct off-manifold rollout drift and stabilizing autoregressive prediction. We further use flow forcing to update a system descriptor (context) from model-generated trajectories, aligning train/test conditioning and improving long-term stability. We pretrain on a curated corpus of $\sim$2.5M trajectories at $128^2$ resolution spanning 12 PDE families. LGS matches strong deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons. Learning in latent space plus efficient architectural choices yields up to \textbf{70$\times$} lower FLOPs than non-generative baselines, enabling scalable pretraining. We also show efficient adaptation to an out-of-distribution $256^2$ Kolmogorov flow dataset under limited finetuning budgets. Overall, LGS provides a practical route toward generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that are more reliable for long-term forecasting and downstream scientific workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM) to address uncertainties in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, ensuring robust decentralized execution and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing value-factorization methods suffer from unreliability in real-world settings due to environmental uncertainties.

Method: Introduces DrIGM, a principle aligning agents' robust greedy actions with the team-optimal joint action. Derives robust variants of existing architectures.

Result: Empirical results show improved out-of-distribution performance in SustainGym and StarCraft environments.

Conclusion: DrIGM provides a provable robustness guarantee and seamlessly integrates with existing MARL frameworks.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) commonly adopts centralized training with decentralized execution, where value-factorization methods enforce the individual-global-maximum (IGM) principle so that decentralized greedy actions recover the team-optimal joint action. However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping. Empirically, on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and a StarCraft game environment, our methods consistently improve out-of-distribution performance.

TL;DR: DecisionDB formalizes decision-valued maps to track how data representations affect outcomes, enabling deterministic replay and persistence analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address variability in computational outcomes caused by different data representations and ensure transparency in decision-making processes.

Method: Introduces DecisionDB, an infrastructure that logs, replays, and audits decision-valued maps using content-derived identifiers and write-once storage.

Result: Deterministic replay ensures exact recovery of decision identifiers, partitioning representation space into persistence regions and boundaries.

Conclusion: DecisionDB provides a systematic way to analyze and verify decision persistence across data representations.

Abstract: A computational engine applied to different representations of the same data can produce different discrete outcomes, with some representations preserving the result and others changing it entirely. A decision-valued map records which representations preserve the outcome and which change it, associating each member of a declared representation family with the discrete result it produces. This paper formalizes decision-valued maps and describes DecisionDB, an infrastructure that logs, replays and audits these relationships using identifiers computed from content and artifacts stored in write-once form. Deterministic replay recovers each recorded decision identifier exactly from stored artifacts, with all three identifying fields matching their persisted values. The contribution partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries, and treats decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition.

TL;DR: DTAPP-IICR is a scalable solution for preflight planning of large UAV fleets, combining urgency-based prioritization, single-agent trajectory planning, and iterative conflict resolution to handle dynamic airspace constraints efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of planning paths for large UAV fleets in dynamic, shared airspace include temporal NFZs, heterogeneous vehicle profiles, and strict deadlines. Existing MAPF methods lack scalability and flexibility for real-world UTM.

Method: DTAPP-IICR uses urgency-based mission prioritization, a novel 4D single-agent planner (SFIPP-ST) for trajectory computation, and iterative Large Neighborhood Search guided by a geometric conflict graph for resolving conflicts. Completeness-preserving pruning accelerates the search.

Result: DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets up to 1,000 UAVs, reduces runtime by up to 50% with pruning, and outperforms batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in UTM scenarios.

Conclusion: DTAPP-IICR offers a practical, scalable solution for dense, dynamic urban airspace planning, outperforming other methods in realistic city-scale operations.

Abstract: Preflight planning for large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) fleets in dynamic, shared airspace presents significant challenges, including temporal No-Fly Zones (NFZs), heterogeneous vehicle profiles, and strict delivery deadlines. While Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) provides a formal framework, existing methods often lack the scalability and flexibility required for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace.

TL;DR: This paper presents the Practitioners Blueprint for Secure AI (PBSAI) Governance Ecosystem, a multi-agent reference architecture designed to secure enterprise AI systems. It organizes responsibilities into 12 domains and uses bounded agent families to mediate between tools and policy, ensuring traceability and human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing governance frameworks lack implementable architectures for securing multi-agent AI systems in enterprise and hyperscale environments, prompting the need for PBSAI.

Method: PBSAI introduces a twelve-domain taxonomy, bounded agent families, shared context envelopes, and structured output contracts to mediate between tools and policy. It includes monitoring, coordinated defense, and adaptive response techniques.

Result: PBSAI aligns with NIST AI RMF functions and is demonstrated in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments, providing traceability, provenance, and human-in-the-loop guarantees.

Conclusion: PBSAI serves as a structured, evidence-centric foundation for secure AI ecosystem development and future empirical validation.

Abstract: Enterprises are rapidly deploying large language models, retrieval augmented generation pipelines, and tool using agents into production, often on shared high performance computing clusters and cloud accelerator platforms that also support defensive analytics. These systems increasingly function not as isolated models but as AI estates: socio technical systems spanning models, agents, data pipelines, security tooling, human workflows, and hyperscale infrastructure. Existing governance and security frameworks, including the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and systems security engineering guidance, articulate principles and risk functions but do not provide implementable architectures for multi agent, AI enabled cyber defense.
  This paper introduces the Practitioners Blueprint for Secure AI (PBSAI) Governance Ecosystem, a multi agent reference architecture for securing enterprise and hyperscale AI estates. PBSAI organizes responsibilities into a twelve domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. The architecture assumes baseline enterprise security capabilities and encodes key systems security techniques, including analytic monitoring, coordinated defense, and adaptive response. A lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem level invariants clarifies the traceability, provenance, and human in the loop guarantees enforced across domains. We demonstrate alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and illustrate application in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments. PBSAI is proposed as a structured, evidence centric foundation for open ecosystem development and future empirical validation.

TL;DR: The paper critiques the 'ground truth' paradigm in machine learning, highlighting its bias and Western-centric norms, and proposes a pluralistic approach to annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to expose the flaws in current data annotation practices, which treat human disagreement as noise and impose Western norms as universal benchmarks, marginalizing diverse perspectives.

Method: A systematic literature review (2020-2025) of 346 papers from seven premier venues, using reflexive thematic analysis to identify systemic biases and failures in annotation practices.

Result: Findings reveal deep-seated anchoring bias, removal of human voices, and geographic hegemony in annotation, with disagreement often misdiagnosed as error.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for pluralistic annotation infrastructures to embrace human diversity and cultural pluralism, moving beyond the 'consensus trap' of singular 'ground truth'.

Abstract: In machine learning, "ground truth" refers to the assumed correct labels used to train and evaluate models. However, the foundational "ground truth" paradigm rests on a positivistic fallacy that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this "consensus trap". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the "noisy sensor" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular "right" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience.

TL;DR: BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework, improves multimodal LLM-as-a-judge evaluations by converting images to text for efficient prompt refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments is challenging, especially in multimodal settings like evaluating AI-generated images. Current APO methods are limited by context window constraints.

Method: Proposes BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations and jointly refines judge and I2T prompts.

Result: Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges show BLPO effectively addresses multimodal evaluation challenges.

Conclusion: BLPO provides a practical solution for improving multimodal LLM-as-a-judge evaluations by optimizing prompts efficiently despite context limitations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become widely adopted as automated judges for evaluating AI-generated content. Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets. Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: AgentNoiseBench evaluates LLM-based agents' robustness in noisy environments, revealing performance gaps between benchmarks and real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discrepancy between benchmark performance and real-world deployment necessitates evaluating agent robustness under realistic noise conditions.

Method: Introduces AgentNoiseBench to inject controlled noise into benchmarks, categorizing noise as user-noise or tool-noise, and evaluates diverse models.

Result: Performance variations across models under noise highlight sensitivity to environmental perturbations.

Conclusion: Current agentic models lack robustness in noisy, real-world scenarios, underscoring the need for improved training paradigms.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled LLM-based agents to achieve strong performance on a variety of benchmarks. However, their performance in real-world deployments often that observed on benchmark settings, especially in complex and imperfect environments. This discrepancy largely arises because prevailing training and evaluation paradigms are typically built on idealized assumptions, overlooking the inherent stochasticity and noise present in real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales. Our results reveal consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations.

TL;DR: BAO is an RL framework balancing task performance and user engagement for proactive LLM agents, outperforming baselines and matching commercial agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between task performance and user engagement in proactive LLM agents.

Method: Combines behavior enhancement for proactive reasoning and behavior regularization to align with user expectations.

Result: Outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines and matches commercial LLM agents in multi-turn tasks.

Conclusion: BAO effectively trains proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Proactive large language model (LLM) agents aim to actively plan, query, and interact over multiple turns, enabling efficient task completion beyond passive instruction following and making them essential for real-world, user-centric applications. Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for training such agents in multi-turn settings, allowing interaction strategies to be learned from feedback. However, existing pipelines face a critical challenge in balancing task performance with user engagement, as passive agents can not efficiently adapt to users' intentions while overuse of human feedback reduces their satisfaction. To address this trade-off, we propose BAO, an agentic RL framework that combines behavior enhancement to enrich proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities with behavior regularization to suppress inefficient or redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations. We evaluate BAO on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite, and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines while achieving comparable or even superior performance to commercial LLM agents, highlighting its effectiveness for training proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReplicatorBench is a new benchmark evaluating AI agents' ability to replicate scientific research, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by including non-replicable claims and assessing the replication process. ReplicatorAgent shows LLMs excel in experiment design but struggle with resource retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook non-replicable research and the replication process, focusing only on reproducible outcomes. ReplicatorBench aims to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.

Method: Introduces ReplicatorBench with human-verified claims (replicable and non-replicable) across three replication stages: data retrieval, experiment execution, and result interpretation. Develops ReplicatorAgent to test AI capabilities using LLMs.

Result: LLM agents perform well in designing and executing experiments but face challenges in retrieving necessary resources (e.g., new data) for replication.

Conclusion: ReplicatorBench offers a robust framework for assessing AI agents' replication abilities, highlighting current limitations in resource retrieval despite strong experiment execution.

Abstract: The literature has witnessed an emerging interest in AI agents for automated assessment of scientific papers. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on the computational aspect of this task, testing agents' ability to reproduce or replicate research outcomes when having access to the code and data. This setting, while foundational, (1) fails to capture the inconsistent availability of new data for replication as opposed to reproduction, and (2) lacks ground-truth diversity by focusing only on reproducible papers, thereby failing to evaluate an agent's ability to identify non-replicable research. Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world. To set a baseline of AI agents' capability, we develop ReplicatorAgent, an agentic framework equipped with necessary tools, like web search and iterative interaction with sandboxed environments, to accomplish tasks in ReplicatorBench. We evaluate ReplicatorAgent across four underlying large language models (LLMs), as well as different design choices of programming language and levels of code access. Our findings reveal that while current LLM agents are capable of effectively designing and executing computational experiments, they struggle with retrieving resources, such as new data, necessary to replicate a claim.

*Heejeong Nam,Quentin Le Lidec,Lucas Maes,Yann LeCun,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: C-JEPA is an object-centric world model improving relational understanding via object-level masking, enhancing counterfactual reasoning and agent control efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object-centric representations lack interaction-dependent dynamics, needing improvement for robust relational understanding in prediction, reasoning, and control.

Method: C-JEPA extends masked joint embedding prediction to object-centric representations, using object-level masking to enforce interaction reasoning and prevent shortcuts.

Result: C-JEPA improves visual question answering by ~20% in counterfactual reasoning and enables efficient planning with only 1% of latent features, matching patch-based models.

Conclusion: Object-level masking in C-JEPA introduces causal inductive bias, enhancing relational reasoning and efficiency in world modeling tasks.

Abstract: World models require robust relational understanding to support prediction, reasoning, and control. While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance. Finally, we provide a formal analysis demonstrating that object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions.

*Michael Menezes,Anastasios Kyrillidis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GHOST is a structured pruning framework for Mamba2 models, reducing state dimensions without backpropagation, achieving a 50% reduction with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba2's expanded state dimension improves temporal modeling but causes inference overhead, and standard pruning methods fail to address this effectively.

Method: GHOST uses forward-pass statistics to approximate control-theoretic balanced truncation, jointly measuring controllability and observability.

Result: GHOST reduces state dimensions by 50% with only a ~1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2 across models from 130M to 2.7B parameters.

Conclusion: GHOST offers an efficient alternative to gradient-based pruning, addressing Mamba2's inference bottlenecks without backpropagation costs.

Abstract: While Mamba2's expanded state dimension enhances temporal modeling, it incurs substantial inference overhead that saturates bandwidth during autoregressive generation. Standard pruning methods fail to address this bottleneck: unstructured sparsity leaves activations dense, magnitude-based selection ignores runtime dynamics, and gradient-based methods impose prohibitive costs. We introduce GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation), a structured pruning framework that approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics. By jointly measuring controllability and observability, GHOST rivals the fidelity of gradient-based methods without requiring backpropagation. As a highlight, on models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, our approach achieves a 50\% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2.

*Sina Tayebati,Divake Kumar,Nastaran Darabi,Davide Ettori,Ranganath Krishnan,Amit Ranjan Trivedi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACER is a new metric for detecting uncertainty in multi-turn AI-human interactions by focusing on trajectory-level breakdowns, outperforming existing single-shot methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty metrics fail to capture critical episodes in multi-turn interactions, leading to undetected failures despite confident local generation.

Method: TRACER combines content-aware surprisal, situational-awareness signals, repetition patterns, and coherence gaps, aggregated with a tail-focused risk functional.

Result: TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines in predicting task failure and selective execution.

Conclusion: TRACER enables earlier and more accurate uncertainty detection in complex conversational tool-use settings.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty for AI agents in real-world multi-turn tool-using interaction with humans is difficult because failures are often triggered by sparse critical episodes (e.g., looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination) even when local generation appears confident. Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and therefore miss these trajectory-level breakdown signals. We introduce TRACER, a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for dual-control Tool-Agent-User interaction. TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, and aggregates them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies. We evaluate TRACER on $τ^2$-bench by predicting task failure and selective task execution. To this end, TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AT-RL, a lightweight framework, selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens in multimodal models, improving reasoning quality with minimal overhead by focusing on visual-textual anchors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how visual evidence integrates into reasoning in multimodal reinforcement learning, focusing on the role of cross-modal attention connectivity.

Method: The proposed Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL) uses graph-based clustering of attention topology to selectively reinforce high-connectivity tokens.

Result: AT-RL improves performance in multimodal tasks, enabling a 32B model to surpass a 72B-Instruct baseline with only 1.2% overhead. Training on low-connectivity tokens leads to severe degradation.

Conclusion: Effective multimodal reinforcement learning relies on precise credit assignment to visual-textual anchors, emphasizing the fidelity of cross-modal anchoring over token quantity.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet how visual evidence is integrated during reasoning remains poorly understood. We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Conversely, training solely on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchors. Our work reveals that reasoning quality is governed not by token quantity but by the fidelity of cross-modal anchoring.

### [299] [AgentLeak: A Full-Stack Benchmark for Privacy Leakage in Multi-Agent LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11510)
*Faouzi El Yagoubi,Ranwa Al Mallah,Godwin Badu-Marfo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentLeak is the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage in multi-agent LLM systems, revealing that internal channels (like inter-agent messages) leak more sensitive data than output channels, highlighting the need for better privacy controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current privacy benchmarks for LLMs focus only on output channels, missing risks posed by internal data pathways in multi-agent systems.

Method: AgentLeak evaluates 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, using a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline to test models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Result: Multi-agent setups reduce output leakage (27.2%) but raise total exposure to 68.9% due to internal channels like inter-agent messages (68.8%). Claude 3.5 Sonnet performs best with 3.3% external and 28.1% internal leakage.

Conclusion: Internal channels are the primary privacy vulnerability in multi-agent LLM systems, necessitating frameworks with stricter privacy controls on inter-agent communication.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems create privacy risks that current benchmarks cannot measure. When agents coordinate on tasks, sensitive data passes through inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments; pathways that output-only audits never inspect. We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection. Across all five models and four domains, the pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently, confirming that inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for coordination frameworks that incorporate internal-channel privacy protections and enforce privacy controls on inter-agent communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a human-inspired continuous learning framework that focuses on refining internal reasoning processes alongside task outputs, reducing runtime by 23.9% in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems often overlook the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures and learning mechanisms, limiting their adaptability. This paper aims to address this gap by treating internal reasoning processes as primary learning objects.

Method: The proposed framework unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. It records reasoning trajectories and interactions to optimize both task-level content and the organization of reasoning activities.

Result: Experiments on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task demonstrate a 23.9% reduction in average runtime when internal-process learning is incorporated.

Conclusion: The framework successfully evolves internal cognitive architectures while maintaining operational stability, highlighting the importance of learning internal reasoning processes for AI adaptability.

Abstract: Learning internal reasoning processes is crucial for developing AI systems capable of sustained adaptation in dynamic real-world environments. However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations, while overlooking the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability. Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal analysis workflows are technically demanding, requiring expertise in both statistics and computer science, manual algorithm selection, data handling, and complex result interpretation.

Method: CausalAgent integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to automate tasks from data cleaning to report generation via natural language interaction.

Result: Users can upload datasets and ask questions in natural language to receive rigorous, interactive analysis reports, lowering the barrier to causal analysis.

Conclusion: CausalAgent offers a user-centered, collaborative AI approach that ensures rigor and interpretability while making causal analysis more accessible.

Abstract: Causal inference holds immense value in fields such as healthcare, economics, and social sciences. However, traditional causal analysis workflows impose significant technical barriers, requiring researchers to possess dual backgrounds in statistics and computer science, while manually selecting algorithms, handling data quality issues, and interpreting complex results. To address these challenges, we propose CausalAgent, a conversational multi-agent system for end-to-end causal inference. The system innovatively integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to achieve automation from data cleaning and causal structure learning to bias correction and report generation through natural language interaction. Users need only upload a dataset and pose questions in natural language to receive a rigorous, interactive analysis report. As a novel user-centered human-AI collaboration paradigm, CausalAgent explicitly models the analysis workflow. By leveraging interactive visualizations, it significantly lowers the barrier to entry for causal analysis while ensuring the rigor and interpretability of the process.

TL;DR: INTENT is an inference-time planning framework designed for budget-constrained tool-augmented agents, improving task success while enforcing budget feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of solving multi-step tasks with external tools under strict monetary budgets, where direct planning is intractable due to large state-action spaces and high variance.

Method: The authors propose INTENT, which uses an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage and risk-calibrated costs, guiding decisions online.

Result: INTENT outperforms baselines in task success while ensuring budget feasibility and remains robust under dynamic tool price changes and varying budgets.

Conclusion: INTENT effectively solves budget-constrained tool-augmented tasks by leveraging hierarchical planning and anticipating costs, demonstrating robustness in dynamic conditions.

Abstract: We study budget-constrained tool-augmented agents, where a large language model must solve multi-step tasks by invoking external tools under a strict monetary budget. We formalize this setting as sequential decision making in context space with priced and stochastic tool executions, making direct planning intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high variance of outcomes and prohibitive exploration cost. To address these challenges, we propose INTENT, an inference-time planning framework that leverages an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage, risk-calibrated cost, and guide decisions online. Across cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts such as tool price changes and varying budgets.

TL;DR: SemaPop-GAN integrates LLMs with generative population modeling to synthesize populations by capturing semantic and statistical patterns, achieving better alignment with target distributions while maintaining feasibility and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing population synthesis methods focus on structured attributes and statistical constraints, lacking semantic-conditioned generation that captures abstract behavioral patterns from survey data.

Method: Proposes SemaPop-GAN, a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty, which uses high-level persona representations from surveys as semantic conditioning signals and enforces alignment with target marginals.

Result: SemaPop-GAN shows improved generative performance, aligning closely with target distributions and maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning.

Conclusion: SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis by fusing semantic-statistical information, providing a foundation for generative population projection systems.

Abstract: Population synthesis is a critical component of individual-level socio-economic simulation, yet remains challenging due to the need to jointly represent statistical structure and latent behavioral semantics. Existing population synthesis approaches predominantly rely on structured attributes and statistical constraints, leaving a gap in semantic-conditioned population generation that can capture abstract behavioral patterns implicitly in survey data. This study proposes SemaPop, a semantic-statistical population synthesis model that integrates large language models (LLMs) with generative population modeling. SemaPop derives high-level persona representations from individual survey records and incorporates them as semantic conditioning signals for population generation, while marginal regularization is introduced to enforce alignment with target population marginals. In this study, the framework is instantiated using a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) backbone, referred to as SemaPop-GAN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance, yielding closer alignment with target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning. Ablation studies further confirm the contribution of semantic persona conditioning and architectural design choices to balancing marginal consistency and structural realism. These results demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical information fusion. SemaPop-GAN also provides a promising modular foundation for developing generative population projection systems that integrate individual-level behavioral semantics with population-level statistical constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARC is a reinforcement learning-based system that dynamically configures LLM-based agents per query, outperforming static templates and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static configurations for LLM-based agents are inefficient and brittle, leading to unnecessary compute and poor performance on varying query difficulties.

Method: ARC learns a hierarchical policy via reinforcement learning to tailor agent configurations (workflows, tools, token budgets, prompts) per query.

Result: ARC achieves up to 25% higher task accuracy and reduces token/runtime costs across reasoning and tool-augmented QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dynamic, query-wise agent configuration via learning is superior to fixed templates.

Abstract: Configuring LLM-based agent systems involves choosing workflows, tools, token budgets, and prompts from a large combinatorial design space, and is typically handled today by fixed large templates or hand-tuned heuristics. This leads to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute, since the same cumbersome configuration is often applied to both easy and hard input queries. We formulate agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduce ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor these configurations. Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs. These results demonstrate that learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how communication reduces uncertainty and enables collaboration in dynamic, partially observable environments drives the analysis.

Method: The survey uses the Five Ws framework (who, what, when, why) to review MA-Comm evolution in MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems.

Result: Highlights task-specific limitations in MARL, grounding issues in EL, and LLMs' potential for open-ended collaboration.

Conclusion: Future hybrid systems should combine learning, language, and control for scalable, interpretable multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Multi-agent sequential decision-making powers many real-world systems, from autonomous vehicles and robotics to collaborative AI assistants. In dynamic, partially observable environments, communication is often what reduces uncertainty and makes collaboration possible. This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved. We distill practical design patterns and open challenges to support future hybrid systems that combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAPLE introduces a modality-aware post-training system for multimodal language models, improving efficiency and robustness by focusing on task-relevant signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL post-training pipelines treat all input signals equally, ignoring task-specific modality requirements, leading to inefficiencies and reduced robustness.

Method: MAPLE includes MAPLE-bench for benchmarking signal combinations, MAPO for modality-aware policy optimization, and adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling.

Result: MAPLE reduces uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations.

Conclusion: MAPLE provides a comprehensive solution for deployment-ready multimodal RL post-training, enhancing performance and robustness.

Abstract: Multimodal language models now integrate text, audio, and video for unified reasoning. Yet existing RL post-training pipelines treat all input signals as equally relevant, ignoring which modalities each task actually requires. This modality-blind training inflates policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and degrades robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted. We introduce MAPLE, a complete modality-aware post-training and learning ecosystem comprising: (1) MAPLE-bench, the first benchmark explicitly annotating minimal signal combinations required per task; (2) MAPO, a modality-aware policy optimization framework that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance from heterogeneous group advantages; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations. Systematic analysis across loss aggregation, clipping, sampling, and curriculum design establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy. Adaptive weighting and curriculum focused learning further boost performance across signal combinations. MAPLE narrows uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations under realistic reduced signal access. MAPLE constitutes a complete recipe for deployment-ready multimodal RL post-training.

TL;DR: scPilot is a framework enabling LLMs to perform single-cell RNA-seq analyses through natural language, improving accuracy and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between LLMs and omics data by allowing direct interaction with bioinformatics tools and raw data.

Method: Converts single-cell analyses into reasoning problems, uses LLMs to solve, justify, and revise with evidence.

Result: Iterative reasoning improves accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation and reduces graph-edit distance by 30%.

Conclusion: scPilot enhances interpretability and diagnostic utility of single-cell analyses by grounding LLMs in omics data.

Abstract: We present scPilot, the first systematic framework to practice omics-native reasoning: a large language model (LLM) converses in natural language while directly inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and on-demand bioinformatics tools. scPilot converts core single-cell analyses, i.e., cell-type annotation, developmental-trajectory reconstruction, and transcription-factor targeting, into step-by-step reasoning problems that the model must solve, justify, and, when needed, revise with new evidence.
  To measure progress, we release scBench, a suite of 9 expertly curated datasets and graders that faithfully evaluate the omics-native reasoning capability of scPilot w.r.t various LLMs. Experiments with o1 show that iterative omics-native reasoning lifts average accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation and Gemini-2.5-Pro cuts trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% versus one-shot prompting, while generating transparent reasoning traces explain marker gene ambiguity and regulatory logic. By grounding LLMs in raw omics data, scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses.

### [308] [When Agents Disagree With Themselves: Measuring Behavioral Consistency in LLM-Based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11619)
*Aman Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents exhibit inconsistent behavior across multiple runs of the same task, with variance predicting task failure accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the consistency of LLM agent behavior across repeated task executions and its impact on task accuracy.

Method: Conducted 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA using ReAct-style agents.

Result: Agents produce 2.0--4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs. Consistency predicts accuracy: tasks with ≤2 unique paths achieve 80--92% accuracy, while ≥6 paths achieve 25--60%. Variance often originates at step 2.

Conclusion: Monitoring behavioral consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability.

Abstract: Run the same LLM agent on the same task twice: do you get the same behavior? We find the answer is often no. In a study of 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA, we observe that ReAct-style agents produce 2.0--4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs on average, even with identical inputs. More importantly, this variance predicts failure: tasks with consistent behavior ($\leq$2 unique paths) achieve 80--92% accuracy, while highly inconsistent tasks ($\geq$6 unique paths) achieve only 25--60%, a 32--55 percentage point gap depending on model. We trace variance to early decisions: 69% of divergence occurs at step 2, the first search query. Our results suggest that monitoring behavioral consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability.

*Yipeng Huang,Dejun Xu,Zexin Lin,Zhenzhong Wang,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NMIPS, a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver framework, to address inefficiencies and interpretability issues in traditional and machine learning PDE solvers for PDE families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PDE solvers are computationally expensive for PDE families, while machine learning methods lack interpretability. NMIPS aims to combine efficiency and analytical insight.

Method: NMIPS uses multifactorial optimization to discover analytical solutions simultaneously and employs an affine transfer method to reuse learned structures across PDEs.

Result: The framework shows a ~35.7% accuracy improvement over baselines while providing interpretable solutions.

Conclusion: NMIPS successfully balances computational efficiency and analytical interpretability for solving PDE families.

Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is fundamental to numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. A common challenge arises from solving the PDE families, which are characterized by sharing an identical mathematical structure but varying in specific parameters. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method, need to independently solve each instance within a PDE family, which incurs massive computational cost. On the other hand, while recent advancements in machine learning PDE solvers offer impressive computational speed and accuracy, their inherent ``black-box" nature presents a considerable limitation. These methods primarily yield numerical approximations, thereby lacking the crucial interpretability provided by analytical expressions, which are essential for deeper scientific insight. To address these limitations, we propose a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver framework for PDE family solving, dubbed NMIPS. In particular, we employ multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover the analytical solutions of PDEs. To enhance computational efficiency, we devise an affine transfer method by transferring learned mathematical structures among PDEs in a family, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch. Experimental results across multiple cases demonstrate promising improvements over existing baselines, achieving up to a $\sim$35.7% increase in accuracy while providing interpretable analytical solutions.

TL;DR: MathSpatial evaluates and improves spatial reasoning in MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap compared to humans and offering a benchmark, training dataset, and structured reasoning method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with mathematical spatial reasoning, lagging behind human performance. MathSpatial aims to address this gap by providing tools for evaluation and improvement.

Method: MathSpatial includes a benchmark (MathSpatial-Bench), a training dataset (MathSpatial-Corpus), and a structured reasoning method (MathSpatial-SRT) with atomic operations. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B demonstrates effectiveness.

Result: Fine-tuning on MathSpatial improves accuracy and reduces token usage by 25%, showcasing the framework's utility in enhancing spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: MathSpatial is a pioneering resource for disentangling perception from reasoning, enabling precise evaluation and advancement of spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on perception-oriented tasks, yet their ability to perform mathematical spatial reasoning, defined as the capacity to parse and manipulate two- and three-dimensional relations, remains unclear. Humans easily solve textbook-style spatial reasoning problems with over 95\% accuracy, but we find that most leading MLLMs fail to reach even 60\% on the same tasks. This striking gap highlights spatial reasoning as a fundamental weakness of current models. To investigate this gap, we present MathSpatial, a unified framework for evaluating and improving spatial reasoning in MLLMs. MathSpatial includes three complementary components: (i) MathSpatial-Bench, a benchmark of 2K problems across three categories and eleven subtypes, designed to isolate reasoning difficulty from perceptual noise; (ii) MathSpatial-Corpus, a training dataset of 8K additional problems with verified solutions; and (iii) MathSpatial-SRT, which models reasoning as structured traces composed of three atomic operations--Correlate, Constrain, and Infer. Experiments show that fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25\%. MathSpatial provides the first large-scale resource that disentangles perception from reasoning, enabling precise measurement and comprehensive understanding of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in aligning large language models for medical QA by proposing a multi-dimensional alignment matrix and a unified optimization mechanism to handle heterogeneous reward signals effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning paradigms for language model alignment are inadequate for medical QA due to expensive human feedback, lack of automatic verifiers, and multi-objective optimization conflicts.

Method: The authors introduce a medical alignment matrix categorizing objectives into four areas and a unified optimization mechanism with Reference-Frozen Normalization and Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting.

Result: The proposed paradigm shows effectiveness in real-world medical evaluations, offering a robust solution for complex alignment in specialized domains.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new approach for medical alignment, addressing scale mismatch and optimization conflicts, and demonstrates practical viability in medical QA.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning for large language model alignment has progressed rapidly in recent years, transferring these paradigms to high-stakes medical question answering reveals a fundamental paradigm mismatch. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on preference annotations that are prohibitively expensive and often fail to reflect the absolute correctness of medical facts. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards lacks effective automatic verifiers and struggles to handle complex clinical contexts. Meanwhile, medical alignment requires the simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, yet multi-objective heterogeneous reward signals are prone to scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose a robust medical alignment paradigm. We first construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that decomposes alignment objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Within each category, we establish a closed loop of where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which in turn drives optimizable rewards, thereby providing fine-grained, high-resolution supervision signals for subsequent iterative optimization. To resolve gradient domination and optimization instability problem caused by heterogeneous signals, we further propose a unified optimization mechanism. This mechanism employs Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and implements a Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting strategy to achieve collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains.

*E Fan,Lisong Shi,Zhengtong Li,Chih-yung Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhyNiKCE bridges the gap between probabilistic LLMs and strict CFD requirements by decoupling neural planning from symbolic validation, improving robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with enforcing physical laws in CFD, leading to invalid configurations due to a Semantic-Physical Disconnect.

Method: PhyNiKCE uses a neurosymbolic framework with a Symbolic Knowledge Engine and Deterministic RAG Engine to enforce physical constraints.

Result: 96% improvement over baselines, 59% fewer self-correction loops, and 17% lower LLM token usage.

Conclusion: Decoupling neural and symbolic processes enhances trustworthiness and scalability for industrial automation beyond CFD.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous agents for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is critically limited by the probabilistic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), which struggle to enforce the strict conservation laws and numerical stability required for physics-based simulations. Reliance on purely semantic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often leads to "context poisoning," where agents generate linguistically plausible but physically invalid configurations due to a fundamental Semantic-Physical Disconnect. To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering. Unlike standard black-box agents, PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%. These results demonstrate that decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency. While validated on CFD, this architecture offers a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in broader industrial automation.

*Longyuan Zhu,Hairan Hua,Linlin Miao,Bing Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a data-driven framework to assess the reliability of benchmarks used for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks suffer from issues like score inflation and selective reporting, making it hard to determine trustworthy evaluation results.

Method: BHI evaluates benchmarks along three axes: Capability Discrimination (separation of model performance beyond noise), Anti-Saturation (remaining headroom before ceiling effects), and Impact (influence across ecosystems).

Result: Analyzing 106 benchmarks from 91 models, BHI provides a macro-level quantification of benchmark health.

Conclusion: BHI offers a principled approach for benchmark selection and lifecycle management, addressing current reliability concerns.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, yet the benchmarks used to measure this progress are becoming increasingly unreliable. Score inflation and selective reporting have eroded the authority of standard benchmarks, leaving the community uncertain about which evaluation results remain trustworthy. We introduce the Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a pure data-driven framework for auditing evaluation sets along three orthogonal and complementary axes: (1) Capability Discrimination, measuring how sharply a benchmark separates model performance beyond noise; (2) Anti-Saturation, estimating remaining headroom before ceiling effects erode resolution and thus the benchmark's expected longevity; and (3) Impact, quantifying influence across academic and industrial ecosystems via adoption breadth and practice-shaping power. By distilling 106 validated benchmarks from the technical reports of 91 representative models in 2025, we systematically characterize the evaluation landscape. BHI is the first framework to quantify benchmark health at a macro level, providing a principled basis for benchmark selection and enabling dynamic lifecycle management for next-generation evaluation protocols.

### [314] [Right for the Wrong Reasons: Epistemic Regret Minimization for Causal Rung Collapse in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11675)
*Edward Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies a flaw in autoregressive training called Rung Collapse, where models rely on shortcuts rather than true causal reasoning, leading to poor performance under distributional shifts. It introduces Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM) to address this, proving its effectiveness in recovering true causal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of machine learning systems achieving high performance through flawed reasoning (shortcuts) that fail under distributional shifts, termed Rung Collapse and Aleatoric Entrenchment.

Method: Proposes Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective, and a three-layer architecture with contributions including a Physical Grounding Theorem, ERM as a causal belief revision operator, and a failure mode taxonomy.

Result: ERM recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails, proving asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds.

Conclusion: ERM effectively prevents flawed reasoning in models, especially in advanced systems, and bridges the gap between action languages and causal reasoning.

Abstract: Machine learning systems that are "right for the wrong reasons" achieve high performance through shortcuts that collapse under distributional shift. We show this pathology has a precise causal origin: autoregressive training provides no gradient signal to distinguish association P(Y|X) from intervention P(Y|do(X)), a failure we formalize as Rung Collapse. When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline to address structural blindness in MLLMs by converting CAD diagrams into property graphs, significantly improving accuracy in engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack the ability to capture structural relationships in engineering schematics due to their pixel-driven approach, limiting their practical use in engineering domains.

Method: The authors propose a V2G pipeline that transforms CAD diagrams into property graphs, explicitly representing components (nodes) and connectivity (edges) to enable structural reasoning.

Result: V2G achieves large accuracy improvements in electrical compliance checks, outperforming state-of-the-art MLLMs, which perform near chance level.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the limitations of pixel-based MLLMs and highlights structure-aware representations as a viable solution for practical engineering applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual understanding, yet they suffer from a critical limitation: structural blindness. Even state-of-the-art models fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics, as their pixel-driven paradigm discards the explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning. To overcome this, we propose a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable. On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level. These results highlight the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods and demonstrate that structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains. To facilitate further research, we release our benchmark and implementation at https://github.com/gm-embodied/V2G-Audit.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkRouter improves reasoning efficiency by switching between latent and discrete token spaces based on model confidence, outperforming baselines in accuracy and generation length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent reasoning's inconsistent effectiveness and noise propagation issues inspire a confidence-aware routing mechanism for more reliable and efficient reasoning.

Method: ThinkRouter dynamically routes reasoning to latent or discrete token spaces depending on model confidence levels.

Result: ThinkRouter achieves a 19.70-point average improvement in Pass@1 and reduces generation length by up to 15.55%, outperforming explicit CoT and other baselines.

Conclusion: ThinkRouter effectively calibrates errors from explicit CoT and latent reasoning while accelerating reasoning by managing model confidence.

Abstract: Recent work explores latent reasoning to improve reasoning efficiency by replacing explicit reasoning trajectories with continuous representations in a latent space, yet its effectiveness varies across settings. Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.

TL;DR: SCF-RKL improves model merging by using sparse, distribution-aware updates to reduce interference, outperforming existing methods across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods cause interference, degrading performance. SCF-RKL aims to address this by controlling functional interference.

Method: SCF-RKL measures functional divergence using reverse KL divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters for sparse updates.

Result: SCF-RKL outperforms existing methods on 24 benchmarks, maintaining generalization and stable generation.

Conclusion: SCF-RKL offers an effective framework for merging models with minimal interference and improved performance.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising paradigm for composing the capabilities of large language models by directly operating in weight space, enabling the integration of specialized models without costly retraining. However, existing merging methods largely rely on parameter-space heuristics, which often introduce severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors such as repetition and incoherent outputs. In this work, we propose Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Instead of assuming linear additivity in parameter space, SCF-RKL measures the functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters. This mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design effectively preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities. We evaluate SCF-RKL across a wide range of model scales and architectures, covering both reasoning-focused and instruction-tuned models. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety demonstrate, vision classification that SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand model diffing beyond base vs. finetune comparisons by addressing cross-architecture differences and uncovering safety-critical behaviors in new models.

Method: Proposes Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification to isolate unique features, and applies crosscoders to cross-architecture comparisons.

Result: Identified unsupervised features such as political alignment (Chinese Communist Party, American exceptionalism) and a copyright refusal mechanism in various AI models.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing as an effective tool for meaningful behavioral analysis of AI models.

Abstract: Model diffing, the process of comparing models' internal representations to identify their differences, is a promising approach for uncovering safety-critical behaviors in new models. However, its application has so far been primarily focused on comparing a base model with its finetune. Since new LLM releases are often novel architectures, cross-architecture methods are essential to make model diffing widely applicable. Crosscoders are one solution capable of cross-architecture model diffing but have only ever been applied to base vs finetune comparisons. We provide the first application of crosscoders to cross-architecture model diffing and introduce Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification designed to better isolate features unique to one model. Using this technique, we find in an unsupervised fashion features including Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and a copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B. Together, our results work towards establishing cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing as an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models.

TL;DR: Text2GQL-Bench is introduced as a unified benchmark for Text-to-GQL systems, addressing limitations in domain coverage and evaluation metrics. It includes a multi-GQL dataset and a scalable framework for dataset generation. The evaluation reveals challenges in ISO-GQL generation by LLMs, showing improved accuracy with few-shot prompts and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by inadequate datasets and evaluation methods. Text2GQL-Bench aims to provide a comprehensive benchmark to systematically assess model capabilities across domains and graph query languages.

Method: Text2GQL-Bench integrates a dataset of 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains and introduces a scalable framework for generating datasets. An evaluation method assesses grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy.

Result: LLMs struggle with ISO-GQL generation (4% execution accuracy zero-shot), but performance improves with few-shot prompts (~50% accuracy) and fine-tuning (45.1% execution accuracy, 90.8% grammatical validity).

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights the need for better ISO-GQL support in LLMs and demonstrates that exposure to examples significantly improves performance. Text2GQL-Bench facilitates systematic evaluation and advancement of Text-to-GQL systems.

Abstract: Graph models are fundamental to data analysis in domains rich with complex relationships. Text-to-Graph-Query-Language (Text-to-GQL) systems act as a translator, converting natural language into executable graph queries. This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations. Text2GQL-Bench couples a multi-GQL dataset that has 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets in different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources. To support compre-hensive assessment, we introduce an evaluation method that goes beyond a single end-to-end metric by jointly reporting grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy. Our evaluation uncovers a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: even strong LLMs achieve only at most 4% execution accuracy (EX) in zero-shot settings, though a fixed 3-shot prompt raises accuracy to around 50%, the grammatical validity remains lower than 70%. Moreover, a fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% EX, and 90.8% grammatical validity, demonstrating that most of the performance jump is unlocked by exposure to sufficient ISO-GQL examples.

*Zibo Xiao,Jun Sun,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces AIR, the first incident response framework for LLM agents, achieving over 90% success in detection, remediation, and eradication of incidents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety mechanisms for LLM agents focus on preventing failures in advance but lack effective post-incident response capabilities. This gap motivates the need for a dedicated incident response framework to enhance agent safety.

Method: The paper presents AIR, a framework that integrates a domain-specific language into LLM agents' execution loop. AIR detects incidents via semantic checks, guides containment and recovery actions, and synthesizes guardrail rules to prevent future incidents.

Result: AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates exceeding 90% across three representative agent types. LLM-generated rules also approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules.

Conclusion: The study confirms that incident response is feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving the safety of LLM agents, with AIR demonstrating both efficacy and moderate overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in practice across a wide range of autonomous applications. Yet current safety mechanisms for LLM agents focus almost exclusively on preventing failures in advance, providing limited capabilities for responding to, containing, or recovering from incidents after they inevitably arise. In this work, we introduce AIR, the first incident response framework for LLM agent systems. AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains. These results show that incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving agent safety.

Motivation: Multi-turn RL faces challenges like sparse rewards and stochastic environments, which naive sampling exacerbates by hindering exploitation and causing mode collapse.

Method: TSR repurposes test-time scaling ideas for training, performing lightweight tree-style search to select high-scoring actions per turn, paired with PPO and GRPO optimizers.

Result: Up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks with a one-time compute increase.

Conclusion: TSR offers a simple, general solution for stronger multi-turn agent learning by moving search to training rollouts, complementing existing frameworks.

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) are driving a shift toward using reinforcement learning (RL) to train agents from iterative, multi-turn interactions across tasks. However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MaxExp and SSE, two methods for converting probabilistic species distribution model outputs into binary presence-absence maps, outperforming traditional thresholding methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current binarization methods in SDMs are heuristic and distort species prevalence and community composition, necessitating more accurate and flexible solutions.

Method: MaxExp maximizes chosen evaluation metrics to predict species assemblages without calibration data. SSE is a computationally efficient alternative based on expected species richness.

Result: MaxExp outperforms traditional methods, especially under class imbalance and high rarity, while SSE provides a simpler, competitive option.

Conclusion: MaxExp and SSE offer robust, reproducible tools for multispecies SDM binarization, improving ecological inference and conservation planning.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) commonly produce probabilistic occurrence predictions that must be converted into binary presence-absence maps for ecological inference and conservation planning. However, this binarization step is typically heuristic and can substantially distort estimates of species prevalence and community composition. We present MaxExp, a decision-driven binarization framework that selects the most probable species assemblage by directly maximizing a chosen evaluation metric. MaxExp requires no calibration data and is flexible across several scores. We also introduce the Set Size Expectation (SSE) method, a computationally efficient alternative that predicts assemblages based on expected species richness. Using three case studies spanning diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, we show that MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods, especially under strong class imbalance and high rarity. SSE offers a simpler yet competitive option. Together, these methods provide robust, reproducible tools for multispecies SDM binarization.

*Jinfang Wang,Jiajie Liu,Jianwei Wu,Ziqin Luo,Zhen Chen,Chunlei Li,Biao Han,Tao Deng,Yi Li,Shuanglong Li,Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RELATE is an RL-based framework unifying ad text generation and performance alignment, improving conversion and compliance over traditional two-stage systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ad text systems separate generation and alignment, leading to inefficiencies and misaligned objectives.

Method: RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives into text generation via RL, using multi-dimensional rewards.

Result: Experiments show RELATE outperforms baselines; online deployment improves CTCVR under policy constraints.

Conclusion: RELATE effectively unifies generation and alignment, enhancing ad performance and compliance in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In online advertising, advertising text plays a critical role in attracting user engagement and driving advertiser value. Existing industrial systems typically follow a two-stage paradigm, where candidate texts are first generated and subsequently aligned with online performance metrics such as click-through rate(CTR). This separation often leads to misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality.
  To address these limitations, we propose RELATE, a reinforcement learning-based end-to-end framework that unifies generation and objective alignment within a single model. Instead of decoupling text generation from downstream metric alignment, RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into the generation process via policy learning. To better capture ultimate advertiser value beyond click-level signals, We incorporate conversion-oriented metrics into the objective and jointly model them with compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards, enabling the model to generate high-quality ad texts that improve conversion performance under policy constraints.
  Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that RELATE consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore, online deployment on a production advertising platform yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate(CTCVR) under strict policy constraints, validating the robustness and real-world effectiveness of the proposed framework.

*Yihao Liu,Ziyun Zhang,Zile He,Huaqian Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Execute-Summarize (ES) framework to decouple task execution from workflow construction, improving accuracy and robustness in generating structured workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately translating LLM solutions into structured workflows is challenging due to interference between solving tasks and constructing workflows.

Method: The ES framework first completes tasks using tools and later reconstructs workflows from execution traces, separating the two processes.

Result: Experiments on FlowBench show ES outperforms existing methods, enhancing workflow reliability.

Conclusion: The ES framework provides a reliable way to ground free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.

Abstract: LLMs can solve complex tasks through reasoning and tool use, but accurately translating these solutions into structured workflows remains challenging. We model workflows as sequences of tool use and reformulate the problem as designing a mechanism that can both solve tasks and reliably construct workflows. Prior approaches that build workflows during execution often suffer from inaccuracies due to interference between the two processes. We propose an Execute-Summarize(ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: the model first completes the task using available tools, then independently reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces. This separation improves workflow accuracy and robustness. We introduce FlowBench and show through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms existing methods, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.

*Lingyong Yan,Jiulong Wu,Dong Xie,Weixian Shi,Deguo Xia,Jizhou Huang*

TL;DR: LAVES is a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system designed to generate high-quality instructional videos efficiently, addressing limitations in procedural fidelity, cost, and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models lack logical rigor and precision in educational contexts, prompting the need for improved instructional video production.

Method: LAVES uses specialized agents (Solution, Illustration, Narration) supervised by an Orchestrating Agent, with quality checks and executable script compilation.

Result: LAVES achieves over one million videos/day with a 95% cost reduction compared to industry standards, maintaining high acceptance rates.

Conclusion: LAVES successfully automates educational video production with high fidelity and cost efficiency, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Although recent end-to-end video generation models demonstrate impressive performance in visually oriented content creation, they remain limited in scenarios that require strict logical rigor and precise knowledge representation, such as instructional and educational media. To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Min-$k$NN Distance, a black-box detector to identify benchmark contamination in RLVR-trained models by analyzing generation diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to detect contamination in RLVR-trained models due to reliance on token-level probabilities, highlighting the need for a new detection approach.

Method: Proposes Min-$k$NN Distance, which measures generation diversity by calculating the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances for multiple completions.

Result: Min-$k$NN Distance effectively distinguishes RL-seen from unseen prompts and outperforms existing baselines in detecting contamination.

Conclusion: The method offers a reliable, black-box solution for detecting benchmark contamination in RLVR-trained models without needing model internals.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is central to training modern reasoning models, but the undisclosed training data raises concerns about benchmark contamination. Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-$k$NN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-$k$NN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.

*Pingjun Pan,Tingting Zhou,Peiyao Lu,Tingting Fei,Hongxiang Chen,Chuanjiang Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hi-SAM is a framework for multi-modal recommendation that addresses suboptimal tokenization and architecture-data mismatch by introducing a Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer and a Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer, improving performance in cold-start scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-modal recommendation struggle with disentangling shared cross-modal semantics from modality-specific details and fail to account for the hierarchical nature of user interactions and items, leading to redundancy or collapse in tokenization and noisy attention in Transformers.

Method: The Hi-SAM framework includes (1) a Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST) that unifies modalities with geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and (2) a Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT) that splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces and uses Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployment on a large-scale social platform resulted in a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.

Conclusion: Hi-SAM effectively addresses the challenges of multi-modal recommendation by providing a hierarchical and disentangled approach, leading to significant performance improvements in both experimental and real-world settings.

Abstract: Multi-modal recommendation has gained traction as items possess rich attributes like text and images. Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy. It inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for the current item while accessing history only through compressed summaries. Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over SOTA baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployed on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users, Hi-SAM achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PuYun-LDM improves latent diffusability in high-resolution weather forecasting by integrating a 3D-MAE and VA-MFM strategy, outperforming ENS at short lead times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited diffusability in LDMs for weather forecasting due to lack of task-agnostic foundation models and inter-variable spectral heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes PuYun-LDM with 3D-MAE encoding weather-state features and VA-MFM for adaptive spectral regularization.

Result: Superior to ENS at short lead times, comparable at longer horizons; generates forecasts efficiently on a single GPU.

Conclusion: PuYun-LDM enhances diffusability and performance in ensemble weather forecasting.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) suffer from limited diffusability in high-resolution (<=0.25°) ensemble weather forecasting, where diffusability characterizes how easily a latent data distribution can be modeled by a diffusion process. Unlike natural image fields, meteorological fields lack task-agnostic foundation models and explicit semantic structures, making VFM-based regularization inapplicable. Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. PuYun-LDM generates a 15-day global forecast with a 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, while ensemble forecasts can be efficiently produced in parallel.

TL;DR: A lightweight framework introduces EGTP and PLP for efficient length prediction in LLM inference, reducing computational waste and achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational waste caused by excessive padding in batched inference due to long-tailed sequence lengths in LLM serving and RL sampling.

Method: Utilizes Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP) for static prediction and Progressive Length Prediction (PLP) for dynamic length estimation.

Result: EGTP reduces MAE by 29.16% over baselines; integration with a scheduler improves throughput.

Conclusion: Provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference.

Abstract: The long-tailed distribution of sequence lengths in LLM serving and reinforcement learning (RL) sampling causes significant computational waste due to excessive padding in batched inference. Existing methods rely on auxiliary models for static length prediction, but they incur high overhead, generalize poorly, and fail in stochastic "one-to-many" sampling scenarios. We introduce a lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction. Our framework features two core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP), which uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for highly accurate static prediction with negligible cost, and 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP), which dynamically estimates the remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation. To validate our approach, we build and release ForeLen, a comprehensive benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data. On ForeLen, EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing MAE by 29.16\% over the best baseline. Integrating our methods with a length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains. Our work provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REVIS reduces object hallucination in LVLMs by reactivating suppressed visual information through orthogonal projection and sparse intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from object hallucination due to intertwined visual and textual features in deeper layers.

Method: REVIS uses orthogonal projection to extract pure visual information and performs sparse intervention at specific depths.

Result: REVIS reduces hallucination by ~19% while maintaining general reasoning, with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: REVIS effectively addresses object hallucination in LVLMs efficiently and preserves model capabilities.

Abstract: Despite the advanced capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they frequently suffer from object hallucination. One reason is that visual features and pretrained textual representations often become intertwined in the deeper network layers. To address this, we propose REVIS, a training-free framework designed to explicitly re-activate this suppressed visual information. Rooted in latent space geometry, REVIS extracts the pure visual information vector via orthogonal projection and employs a calibrated strategy to perform sparse intervention only at the precise depth where suppression occurs. This surgical approach effectively restores visual information with minimal computational cost. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while preserving general reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: ProtoT is a new autoregressive LM architecture using prototypes for interpretable reasoning, scaling linearly with sequence length and performing comparably to SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address opacity in autoregressive LMs, which undermines trust and risks like deception, by introducing ProtoT for interpretable reasoning.

Method: ProtoT replaces self-attention with prototypes capturing concepts through two-way communication, enabling interpretability and targeted edits.

Result: ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length, performs well on text generation and tasks (GLUE), and shows robustness with interpretable pathways.

Conclusion: ProtoT offers a well-performing, interpretable alternative to SOTA autoregressive LMs, bridging performance and transparency gaps.

Abstract: While state-of-the-art language models (LMs) surpass the vast majority of humans in certain domains, their reasoning remains largely opaque, undermining trust in their output. Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. "woman") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VRCsim and Talk2DM to enhance dynamic maps with natural-language support for autonomous driving systems, achieving high query accuracy with efficient response times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic maps lack natural-language-supported interfaces, limiting human interaction and querying capabilities in autonomous driving.

Method: Developed VRCsim for simulating data, created VRC-QA dataset, and proposed Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module using a chain-of-prompt mechanism with LLMs.

Result: Talk2DM achieved over 93% query accuracy with 2-5 seconds response time across different LLMs, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: Talk2DM effectively integrates natural-language querying into dynamic maps, demonstrating practical potential for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Dynamic maps (DM) serve as the fundamental information infrastructure for vehicle-road-cloud (VRC) cooperative autonomous driving in China and Japan. By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation. Our results reveal that Talk2DM, powered by Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss models, achieves over 93\% NLS query accuracy with an average response time of only 2-5 seconds, indicating strong practical potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing task decomposition and delegation methods lack adaptability and robustness for handling dynamic environments and failures.

Method: Introduces an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation, incorporating task allocation, authority transfer, and trust mechanisms.

Result: The framework supports human and AI delegators/delegatees in complex networks, aiming to guide protocol development for the agentic web.

Conclusion: The adaptive framework enhances delegation capabilities, fostering reliable and dynamic task management in complex scenarios.

Abstract: AI agents are able to tackle increasingly complex tasks. To achieve more ambitious goals, AI agents need to be able to meaningfully decompose problems into manageable sub-components, and safely delegate their completion across to other AI agents and humans alike. Yet, existing task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics, and are not able to dynamically adapt to environmental changes and robustly handle unexpected failures. Here we propose an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation - a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, that also incorporates transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear specifications regarding roles and boundaries, clarity of intent, and mechanisms for establishing trust between the two (or more) parties. The proposed framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees in complex delegation networks, aiming to inform the development of protocols in the emerging agentic web.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE) to capture hierarchical feature structures in LLMs, improving upon isolated feature extraction of traditional SAEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAEs extract monosemantic features in isolation, but evidence suggests LLMs capture hierarchical natural language structures.

Method: HSAE jointly learns SAEs and parent-child feature relationships using structural constraint loss and random feature perturbation.

Result: HSAE recovers meaningful hierarchies while maintaining reconstruction fidelity and interpretability across LLMs and layers.

Conclusion: HSAE is a scalable tool for discovering and analyzing multi-scale conceptual structures in LLM representations.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven effective for extracting monosemantic features from large language models (LLMs), yet these features are typically identified in isolation. However, broad evidence suggests that LLMs capture the intrinsic structure of natural language, where the phenomenon of "feature splitting" in particular indicates that such structure is hierarchical. To capture this, we propose the Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE), which jointly learns a series of SAEs and the parent-child relationships between their features. HSAE strengthens the alignment between parent and child features through two novel mechanisms: a structural constraint loss and a random feature perturbation mechanism. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and layers demonstrate that HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies, supported by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics. At the same time, HSAE preserves the reconstruction fidelity and interpretability of standard SAEs across different dictionary sizes. Our work provides a powerful, scalable tool for discovering and analyzing the multi-scale conceptual structures embedded in LLM representations.

*Shani Goren,Ido Galil,Ran El-Yaniv*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Selective Abstraction (SA) enhances LLM reliability by reducing detail in uncertain content, outperforming binary abstention methods in long-form settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce factual errors, limiting trust and adoption in high-risk scenarios. Binary uncertainty mechanisms discard valuable information, prompting the need for a more nuanced approach.

Method: Introduces Selective Abstraction (SA), which trades specificity for reliability, specifically Atom-wise SA—decomposing responses into atomic claims and replacing uncertain ones with higher-confidence abstractions.

Result: SA improves the area under the risk-coverage curve by up to 27.73% over claim removal, boosting accuracy and reliability while retaining most original meaning.

Conclusion: Atom-wise SA offers a scalable solution to mitigate factual errors in LLMs, preserving information and enhancing reliability without full abstention.

Abstract: LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary "all-or-nothing" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning.

TL;DR: AlphaPROBE introduces a DAG-based framework for alpha factor mining, overcoming redundancy and limited diversity in existing methods by leveraging global evolutionary topology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of global structural view in existing alpha factor mining paradigms, which leads to redundant search and limited diversity.

Method: AlphaPROBE uses a Bayesian Factor Retriever for high-potential seeds and a DAG-aware Factor Generator for context-aware optimizations.

Result: Outperforms 8 baselines in predictive accuracy, return stability, and training efficiency on Chinese stock market datasets.

Conclusion: Global evolutionary topology is crucial for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery.

Abstract: Extracting signals through alpha factor mining is a fundamental challenge in quantitative finance. Existing automated methods primarily follow two paradigms: Decoupled Factor Generation, which treats factor discovery as isolated events, and Iterative Factor Evolution, which focuses on local parent-child refinements. However, both paradigms lack a global structural view, often treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, which leads to redundant search and limited diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AlphaPROBE (Alpha Mining via Principled Retrieval and On-graph Biased Evolution), a framework that reframes alpha mining as the strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By modeling factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges, AlphaPROBE treats the factor pool as a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The framework consists of two core components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through a posterior probability model, and a DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages the full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations.

*Taian Guo,Haiyang Shen,Junyu Luo,Zhongshi Xing,Hanchun Lian,Jinsheng Huang,Binqi Chen,Luchen Liu,Yun Ma,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MEME, a Logic-Oriented framework for financial markets, outperforming current methods by modeling market dynamics as evolving investment narratives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in LLM-based financial models by focusing on underlying reasoning and adapting to market changes.

Method: MEME uses multi-agent extraction, Gaussian Mixture Modeling, and temporal alignment to model evolving investment narratives.

Result: MEME outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in experiments on Chinese stock pools.

Conclusion: MEME effectively identifies and adapts to market consensus, offering robust portfolio guidance.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in quantitative finance by processing vast unstructured data to emulate human-like analytical workflows. However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Gaia2 is a benchmark for evaluating LLM agents in dynamic, asynchronous environments, highlighting trade-offs in reasoning, efficiency, and robustness among top models like GPT-5, Claude-4 Sonnet, and Kimi-K2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for evaluating LLM agents in realistic, asynchronous settings where environments evolve independently and agents face temporal constraints and dynamic events.

Method: Gaia2 pairs scenarios with write-action verifiers for fine-grained evaluation, enabling reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. Built on the open-source Agents Research Environments platform.

Result: GPT-5 has the highest overall score (42% pass@1) but struggles with time-sensitive tasks. Claude-4 Sonnet balances accuracy, speed, and cost, while Kimi-K2 leads open-source models (21% pass@1).

Conclusion: Gaia2 exposes trade-offs in agent capabilities and challenges in bridging the 'sim2real' gap. Its open-source design aims to foster development of practical agent systems.

Abstract: We introduce Gaia2, a benchmark for evaluating large language model agents in realistic, asynchronous environments. Unlike prior static or synchronous evaluations, Gaia2 introduces scenarios where environments evolve independently of agent actions, requiring agents to operate under temporal constraints, adapt to noisy and dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents. Each scenario is paired with a write-action verifier, enabling fine-grained, action-level evaluation and making Gaia2 directly usable for reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models shows that no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) reaches the strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy and speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads among open-source models with 21% pass@1. These results highlight fundamental trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness, and expose challenges in closing the "sim2real" gap. Gaia2 is built on a consumer environment with the open-source Agents Research Environments platform and designed to be easy to extend. By releasing Gaia2 alongside the foundational ARE framework, we aim to provide the community with a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training the next generation of practical agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CSEval, a framework using language models to evaluate clinical semantic alignment in text-to-image generation for healthcare, addressing gaps in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for text-to-image generation in medicine focus on realism/diversity but neglect clinical semantics (e.g., anatomy, pathology).

Method: Proposes CSEval, leveraging language models to assess alignment between generated images and their prompts for clinical semantics.

Result: CSEval detects semantic inconsistencies missed by other metrics and aligns with expert judgments.

Conclusion: CSEval offers a scalable, clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation tools, aiding safe adoption of generative models in healthcare.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has been increasingly applied in medical domains for various purposes such as data augmentation and education. Evaluating the quality and clinical reliability of these generated images is essential. However, existing methods mainly assess image realism or diversity, while failing to capture whether the generated images reflect the intended clinical semantics, such as anatomical location and pathology. In this study, we propose the Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval), a framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between the generated images and their conditioning prompts. Our experiments show that CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and correlates with expert judgment. CSEval provides a scalable and clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation methods, supporting the safe adoption of generative models in healthcare.

*Xiuping Wu,Zhao Yu,Yuxin Cheng,Ngai Wong,Liangjun Ke,Tapas Mishra,Konstantinos V. Katsikopoulos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how behavioral patterns influence reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and introduces two parameter-free optimization methods—InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt—to enhance reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing behavior-related prompt adjustments for reasoning are intuitive but lack systematic analysis. The study aims to systematically analyze underlying behavioral patterns and their impact on reasoning.

Method: Two optimization methods are proposed: InjectCorrect (imitates past correct answer patterns) and InjectRLOpt (learns a value function from historical behavior patterns using Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy).

Result: Both methods improve reasoning performance without parameter updates, achieving gains of up to 5.34% (InjectCorrect) and 8.67% (InjectRLOpt) across various tasks.

Conclusion: Systematic behavioral pattern analysis and injection can significantly enhance LLM reasoning, offering parameter-free optimization solutions.

Abstract: Reasoning can significantly enhance the performance of Large Language Models. While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process. Our experiments demonstrate that both methods can improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without requiring any modifications to model parameters, achieving gains of up to 5.34% and 8.67%, respectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LawThinker improves legal reasoning by verifying intermediate steps, achieving significant performance gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing legal reasoning methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate steps, leading to undetected errors.

Method: LawThinker uses an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy with a DeepVerifier module for accuracy, relevance, and compliance checks.

Result: LawThinker showed a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and 11% over workflow-based methods on dynamic benchmarks.

Conclusion: LawThinker effectively enhances legal reasoning accuracy and procedural compliance, with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires not only correct outcomes but also procedurally compliant reasoning processes. However, existing methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors such as inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. A DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks further confirm its generalization capability. The code is available at https://github.com/yxy-919/LawThinker-agent .

*Antonin Sulc*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Differentiable Modal Logic (DML) via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs) to debug semantic failures in multi-agent AI systems by learning trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional modal logic requires manual specification of dynamic relationship structures, which is impractical for real-world systems. DML addresses this by automating the learning process.

Method: The framework uses MLNNs to unify neurosymbolic debugging across epistemic, temporal, deontic, and doxastic modalities, demonstrated in multi-agent scenarios.

Result: Key contributions include interpretable learned structures, knowledge injection via axioms, multi-modal reasoning, and practical deployment patterns for multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: DML provides a scalable and interpretable solution for debugging semantic failures in complex AI systems, with practical applications demonstrated through complete implementations.

Abstract: As multi-agent AI systems evolve from simple chatbots to autonomous swarms, debugging semantic failures requires reasoning about knowledge, belief, causality, and obligation, precisely what modal logic was designed to formalize. However, traditional modal logic requires manual specification of relationship structures that are unknown or dynamic in real systems. This tutorial demonstrates differentiable modal logic (DML), implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs), enabling systems to learn trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data alone.
  We present a unified neurosymbolic debugging framework through four modalities: epistemic (who to trust), temporal (when events cause failures), deontic (what actions are permitted), and doxastic (how to interpret agent confidence). Each modality is demonstrated on concrete multi-agent scenarios, from discovering deceptive alliances in diplomacy games to detecting LLM hallucinations, with complete implementations showing how logical contradictions become learnable optimization objectives. Key contributions for the neurosymbolic community: (1) interpretable learned structures where trust and causality are explicit parameters, not opaque embeddings; (2) knowledge injection via differentiable axioms that guide learning with sparse data (3) compositional multi-modal reasoning that combines epistemic, temporal, and deontic constraints; and (4) practical deployment patterns for monitoring, active control and communication of multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StateLM is a new foundation model with internal reasoning to manage its own state, outperforming standard LLMs in tasks like long-document QA and chat memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models lack the ability to actively manage their memory or context, akin to Dumbledore without a wand. The goal is to empower models with active memory management tools.

Method: Introduces StateLM, a model with an internal reasoning loop and memory tools like context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, trained to dynamically engineer its own context.

Result: StateLM outperforms standard LLMs across tasks: significant improvements in long-document QA, 10-20% absolute accuracy in chat memory, and up to 52% accuracy in BrowseComp-Plus.

Conclusion: StateLM transforms LLMs into state-aware agents, making reasoning a stateful and manageable process, overcoming limitations of fixed-context models.

Abstract: In the world of Harry Potter, when Dumbledore's mind is overburdened, he extracts memories into a Pensieve to be revisited later. In the world of AI, while we possess the Pensieve-mature databases and retrieval systems, our models inexplicably lack the "wand" to operate it. They remain like a Dumbledore without agency, passively accepting a manually engineered context as their entire memory. This work finally places the wand in the model's hand. We introduce StateLM, a new class of foundation models endowed with an internal reasoning loop to manage their own state. We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools. By learning to dynamically engineering its own context, our model breaks free from the architectural prison of a fixed window. Experiments across various model sizes demonstrate StateLM's effectiveness across diverse scenarios. On long-document QA tasks, StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales; on the chat memory task, they achieve absolute accuracy improvements of 10% to 20% over standard LLMs. On the deep research task BrowseComp-Plus, the performance gap becomes even more pronounced: StateLM achieves up to 52% accuracy, whereas standard LLM counterparts struggle around 5%. Ultimately, our approach shifts LLMs from passive predictors to state-aware agents where reasoning becomes a stateful and manageable process.

*Zewei Yu,Lirong Gao,Yuke Zhu,Bo Zheng,Sheng Guo,Haobo Wang,Junbo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARLCP addresses over-long reasoning chains in LRMs by dynamically balancing efficiency and accuracy, reducing response length by up to 53.1% while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models often generate excessive, inefficient reflections, increasing computational overhead without accuracy gains.

Method: ARLCP uses adaptive reflection and length penalties to optimize reasoning paths, evaluated on mathematical benchmarks with distilled Qwen models.

Result: For 1.5B and 7B models, ARLCP reduces response length by 53.1% and 35.0% respectively, while improving accuracy by 5.8% and 2.7%.

Conclusion: ARLCP effectively balances reasoning efficiency and accuracy, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks by employing test-time scaling. However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain. The code is released at https://github.com/ZeweiYu1/ARLCP .

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores zero-shot forecasting methods for university enrolments, addressing data-sparsity challenges with leakage-safe covariates and introduces a novel Institutional Operating Conditions Index.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Universities need accurate enrolment forecasts amidst financial pressures, but face data-sparsity and instability in traditional methods.

Method: Benchmarks TSFMs in zero-shot settings, uses leakage-safe covariates, and introduces IOCI and Google Trends proxies.

Result: Covariate-conditioned TSFMs perform comparably to classical benchmarks without institution-specific training.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer reliable forecasting alternatives despite short samples and structural breaks.

Abstract: Many universities face increasing financial pressure and rely on accurate forecasts of commencing enrolments. However, enrolment forecasting in higher education is often data-sparse; annual series are short and affected by reporting changes and regime shifts. Popular classical approaches can be unreliable, as parameter estimation and model selection are unstable with short samples, and structural breaks degrade extrapolation. Recently, TSFMs have provided zero-shot priors, delivering strong gains in annual, data-sparse institutional forecasting under leakage-disciplined covariate construction. We benchmark multiple TSFM families in a zero-shot setting and test a compact, leakage-safe covariate set and introduce the Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI), a transferable 0-100 regime covariate derived from time-stamped documentary evidence available at each forecast origin, alongside Google Trends demand proxies with stabilising feature engineering. Using an expanding-window backtest with strict vintage alignment, covariate-conditioned TSFMs perform on par with classical benchmarks without institution-specific training, with performance differences varying by cohort and model.

*Hanno Ackermann,Hong Cai,Mohsen Ghafoorian,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA) introduces a nonlinearity applied after pairwise similarity computation, improving softmax approximation compared to linear attention, and is efficient for large-scale applications like video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard quadratic attention in transformers is computationally expensive, prompting the need for efficient approximations like linear attention. HLA aims to enhance linear attention by better approximating softmax.

Method: HLA applies nonlinearity after computing pairwise similarities, unlike linear attention that applies it separately to queries and keys. This results in a higher-degree rational function approximation of softmax.

Result: HLA is computationally efficient, avoiding tensor reshaping issues, and is successfully applied to a large diffusion transformer for video generation.

Conclusion: HLA improves softmax approximation in linear attention, offering efficiency and scalability for applications with large token sets.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is an important reason for the success of transformers. It relies on computing pairwise relations between tokens. To reduce the high computational cost of standard quadratic attention, linear attention has been proposed as an efficient approximation. It employs kernel functions that are applied independently to the inputs before the pairwise similarities are calculated. That allows for an efficient computational procedure which, however, amounts to a low-degree rational function approximating softmax.
  We propose Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA). Unlike previous works on linear attention, the nonlinearity in HLA is not applied separately to queries and keys, but, analogously to standard softmax attention, after the pairwise similarities have been computed. It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention. In contrast to other approaches, no time-consuming tensor reshaping is necessary to apply the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves very large amounts of tokens.

TL;DR: The study reveals gender and skin-tone biases in commercial image generators, showing that neutral prompts produce polarized defaults, with strong 'default white' bias and divergent gender preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs in commercial image generators and quantify biases.

Method: Generated 3,200 images using neutral prompts, analyzed with hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and skin-tone quantification (Monk, PERLA, Fitzpatrick scales).

Result: Neutral prompts led to highly polarized defaults: a strong 'default white' bias (>96%) and divergent gender biases (Gemini favored female, GPT favored male with lighter skin tones).

Conclusion: Neutral prompts act as diagnostic probes, not neutral instructions. The study provides a framework for auditing algorithmic biases and challenges the assumption of inclusive representation from unmarked language.

Abstract: This study quantifies gender and skin-tone bias in two widely deployed commercial image generators - Gemini Flash 2.5 Image (NanoBanana) and GPT Image 1.5 - to test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs. We generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts. The analysis employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using the Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales. Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults. Both models exhibited a strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones. This research provides a large-scale, comparative audit of state-of-the-art models using an illumination-aware colorimetric methodology, distinguishing aesthetic rendering from underlying pigmentation in synthetic imagery. The study demonstrates that neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions. It offers a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.

*Jiajun Chen,Hua Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Value Alignment Tax (VAT) framework to measure how alignment interventions reshape interconnected values, revealing structured co-movement among values that conventional evaluations miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current value alignment research overlooks the dynamic effects of interventions like prompting or fine-tuning on broader value systems, necessitating a framework to measure these changes.

Method: The authors use a controlled scenario-action dataset based on Schwartz value theory, collect paired pre-post normative judgments, and analyze alignment effects across models, values, and strategies.

Result: Alignment often causes uneven, structured co-movement among values, which conventional target-only evaluation fails to detect.

Conclusion: VAT highlights systemic alignment risks and provides deeper insights into the dynamics of value alignment in LLMs.

Abstract: Existing work on value alignment typically characterizes value relations statically, ignoring how interventions - such as prompting, fine-tuning, or preference optimization - reshape the broader value system. We introduce the Value Alignment Tax (VAT), a framework that measures how alignment-induced changes propagate across interconnected values relative to achieved on-target gain. VAT captures the dynamics of value expression under alignment pressure. Using a controlled scenario-action dataset grounded in Schwartz value theory, we collect paired pre-post normative judgments and analyze alignment effects across models, values, and alignment strategies. Our results show that alignment often produces uneven, structured co-movement among values. These effects are invisible under conventional target-only evaluation, revealing systemic, process-level alignment risks and offering new insights into the dynamics of value alignment in LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STAR combines statistical and knowledge-driven reasoning to predict model performance from limited observations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of large model evaluation and the limitations of current methods (statistical struggles with shifts/sparsity, LLMs' unreliability) drive the need for a better approach.

Method: STAR integrates data-driven statistical expectations (via CPMF with semantic features) and knowledge-driven reasoning (guided by EVT) to refine predictions with explanations.

Result: STAR surpasses baselines, achieving a 14.46% improvement in total score under extreme sparsity (1-2 observations per model).

Conclusion: STAR effectively bridges statistical and knowledge-driven approaches for accurate and explainable model performance prediction.

Abstract: As comprehensive large model evaluation becomes prohibitively expensive, predicting model performance from limited observations has become essential. However, existing statistical methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation, while pure LLM methods remain unreliable. We propose STAR, a framework that bridges data-driven STatistical expectations with knowledge-driven Agentic Reasoning. STAR leverages specialized retrievers to gather external knowledge and embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) to generate statistical expectations with uncertainty. A reasoning module guided by Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) then refines predictions through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation, producing adjustments with traceable explanations. Extensive experiments show that STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, delivering a 14.46% gain in total score over the strongest statistical method under extreme sparsity, with only 1--2 observed scores per test model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel lossless compression method using Reinforcement Learning with a T5 language model improves efficiency by preserving token-based structure, achieving higher compression ratios than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compression techniques struggle with complex data structures, and deep learning methods often obscure token-based formats. This paper aims to leverage Reinforcement Learning to enhance compression while preserving data integrity.

Method: The paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning-based approach applied to a T5 language model. It compresses data into token sequences instead of vectors, optimizing sequence length to reduce redundancy.

Result: The method achieves higher compression ratios compared to conventional techniques while maintaining semantic integrity, without relying on external knowledge.

Conclusion: This Reinforcement Learning-driven approach offers a robust and practical solution for lossless compression, with potential applications across diverse fields.

Abstract: Efficient lossless compression is essential for minimizing storage costs and transmission overhead while preserving data integrity. Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications.

TL;DR: LLMs show social proficiency but lack a consistent or domain-general Theory of Mind (ToM), failing logically equivalent tasks despite approximating human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs possess a genuine Theory of Mind (ToM) beyond superficial social task performance.

Method: Developed a cognitively-grounded ToM evaluation framework testing LLMs for coherent, domain-general, and consistent mental state representations.

Result: LLMs approximated human judgments in simple tasks but failed logically equivalent ones, showing inconsistency in mental state inferences.

Conclusion: LLMs' social proficiency stems from superficial approximations, not a genuine or consistent ToM.

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) possess a Theory of Mind (ToM)? Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities, and co-evolving paradigms have shown promising results in domains such as code and math. However, in scientific reasoning tasks, these models remain fragile due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies. In this work, we propose Sci-CoE, a two-stage scientific co-evolving framework that enables models to self-evolve as both solver and verifier through a transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning. In the first stage, the model uses a small set of annotated data to establish fundamental correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier. In the second stage, we introduce a geometric reward mechanism that jointly considers consensus, reliability, and diversity, driving large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data. Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate that Sci-CoE enhances complex reasoning capabilities and exhibits strong scalability, facilitating the construction of more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

### [353] [Statistical Parsing for Logical Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12170)
*Greg Coppola*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper extends the Quantified Boolean Bayesian Network (QBBN) to include negation/backward reasoning and introduces a parser for natural language, addressing gaps from previous work. It demonstrates successful inference, semantics, and syntax integration, leveraging LLMs for preprocessing and disambiguation while confirming the necessity of grammars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in the QBBN model (lack of negation/backward reasoning and natural language parsing) and integrate formal semantics with modern NLP techniques like LLMs.

Method: Extends QBBN with NEG factors for backward reasoning, introduces a typed logical language for semantics, and develops a typed slot grammar for syntax. Combines LLMs for preprocessing and disambiguation with grammars for parsing.

Result: Successfully handles 44/44 inference test cases, achieves 33/33 correct parses, and leverages LLMs for disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy). LLMs alone struggle with structured parsing (12.4% UAS).

Conclusion: The approach bridges formal semantics and modern NLP, using LLMs as annotators and QBBN as verifiers, validating the necessity of grammars while benefiting from LLMs.

Abstract: In previous work (Coppola, 2024) we introduced the Quantified Boolean Bayesian Network (QBBN), a logical graphical model that implements the forward fragment of natural deduction (Prawitz, 1965) as a probabilistic factor graph. That work left two gaps: no negation/backward reasoning, and no parser for natural language.
  This paper addresses both gaps across inference, semantics, and syntax. For inference, we extend the QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning (modus tollens) via backward lambda messages, completing Prawitz's simple elimination rules. The engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. For semantics, we present a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness following Prawitz: first-order quantification, propositions as arguments, and predicate quantification via lambda abstraction. For syntax, we present a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form (33/33 correct, zero ambiguity). LLMs handle disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy) but cannot produce structured parses directly (12.4% UAS), confirming grammars are necessary. The architecture: LLM preprocesses, grammar parses, LLM reranks, QBBN infers.
  We argue this reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's "bitter lesson" (2019): LLMs eliminate the annotation bottleneck that killed formal NLP, serving as annotator while the QBBN serves as verifier. Code: https://github.com/gregorycoppola/world

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework (IOA) inspired by educational principles for distilling knowledge from LLMs to smaller models, improving efficiency and performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distillation methods lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off task rather than a systematic learning process.

Method: Proposes a three-stage pipeline (IOA) integrating Bloom's and Vygotsky's theories, focusing on identifying deficiencies, organizing knowledge delivery, and adapting representations.

Result: IOA achieves 94.7% of teacher performance with fewer parameters, excels in reasoning tasks (19.2% on MATH, 22.3% on HumanEval).

Conclusion: The framework advances distillation by mimicking educational processes, proving effective for complex tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller models has emerged as a critical technique for deploying efficient AI systems. However, current methods for distillation via synthetic data lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis and training task rather than a systematic learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters. Our framework particularly excels in complex reasoning tasks, showing 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAM3-LiteText reduces the over-provisioned text encoder in vision-language segmentation models by using a lightweight MobileCLIP student, cutting parameters by 88% without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language segmentation models like SAM3 use large, general-purpose text encoders for short, structured prompts, leading to redundant computational and memory overhead.

Method: The authors analyzed 404,796 real prompts, identified redundancy in text encoding, and replaced SAM3's text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student optimized via knowledge distillation.

Result: SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, significantly lowering memory usage while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to the original SAM3.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that lightweight text encoders can effectively replace over-provisioned ones in vision-language segmentation, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-language segmentation models such as SAM3 enable flexible, prompt-driven visual grounding, but inherit large, general-purpose text encoders originally designed for open-ended language understanding. In practice, segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to substantial over-provisioning in text encoder capacity and persistent computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we perform a large-scale anatomical analysis of text prompting in vision-language segmentation, covering 404,796 real prompts across multiple benchmarks. Our analysis reveals severe redundancy: most context windows are underutilized, vocabulary usage is highly sparse, and text embeddings lie on low-dimensional manifold despite high-dimensional representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose SAM3-LiteText, a lightweight text encoding framework that replaces the original SAM3 text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student that is optimized by knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on image and video segmentation benchmarks show that SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint, while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to the original model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Speech recognition systems perform poorly on short, high-stakes utterances like street names, with a 44% error rate. Errors disproportionately affect non-English speakers, but synthetic data can reduce errors by 60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems, especially for high-stakes tasks like street name transcription.

Method: Evaluated 15 commercial speech recognition models on diverse U.S. speaker recordings, quantified errors by location, and introduced synthetic data generation for fine-tuning.

Result: A 44% average transcription error rate was found, with routing distance errors twice as large for non-English speakers. Fine-tuning with synthetic data improved accuracy by 60%.

Conclusion: The study reveals systemic speech recognition flaws and offers a scalable solution using synthetic data to reduce high-stakes errors.

Abstract: Despite speech recognition systems achieving low word error rates on standard benchmarks, they often fail on short, high-stakes utterances in real-world deployments. Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. To mitigate this harm, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach that produces diverse pronunciations of named entities using open-source text-to-speech models. Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers. Our results highlight a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems and demonstrate a simple, scalable path to reducing high-stakes transcription errors.

*Jianke Yang,Ohm Venkatachalam,Mohammad Kianezhad,Sharvaree Vadgama,Rose Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KeplerAgent is a framework that mimics scientific reasoning by inferring physical properties before deriving symbolic equations, outperforming existing LLM and traditional methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to improve symbolic equation discovery by modeling the multi-step reasoning process scientists use, leveraging physical properties as priors.

Method: KeplerAgent infers intermediate physical properties (e.g., symmetries) and uses them to configure symbolic regression tools like PySINDy and PySR.

Result: It achieves higher symbolic accuracy and better noise robustness compared to LLM and traditional baselines.

Conclusion: KeplerAgent's structured reasoning approach enhances the accuracy and reliability of symbolic equation discovery.

Abstract: Explaining observed phenomena through symbolic, interpretable formulas is a fundamental goal of science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations. We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints. Across a suite of physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines.

TL;DR: CM2 is an RL framework for AI agents that replaces verifiable rewards with checklist rewards, improving performance over supervised fine-tuning in multi-turn tool-use tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world AI tasks lack verifiable rewards and require open-ended behaviors, making RL challenging. CM2 addresses this by focusing on checklist rewards and scalable training.

Method: CM2 decomposes behaviors into binary criteria with evidence grounding, uses sparse rewards but dense evaluation, and trains in an LLM-simulated tool environment.

Result: CM2 improves performance by 8-12 points over SFT benchmarks and matches or outperforms open-source baselines.

Conclusion: CM2 offers a scalable solution for optimizing tool-using agents without verifiable rewards.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used to solve real-world tasks by reasoning over multi-turn user interactions and invoking external tools. However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

TL;DR: CATTS dynamically allocates compute for multi-step agents using vote-derived uncertainty, improving efficiency and performance over uniform scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling improves neural network performance, but its behavior in multi-step tasks is less understood, with compounding errors and diminishing returns for naive uniform scaling.

Method: Empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents, investigation of aggregation strategies (e.g., LLM-based Arbiter), and introduction of CATTS using vote-derived uncertainty for dynamic compute allocation.

Result: CATTS improves performance by up to 9.1% over React on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse while using 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling.

Conclusion: CATTS offers efficiency gains and interpretable decision rules by focusing compute on contentious decisions.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has become a standard way to improve performance and boost reliability of neural network models. However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule.
