However, their enormous parameter sizes and memory demands pose major challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Vector Quantization (VQ) offers a promising approach for ultra-low-bit compression in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging a codebook, where weight vectors are mapped to the most similar discrete codewords. Yet, directly applying VQ to MoEs often leads to substantial performance degradation due to two critical obstacles: (1) redundant representations among experts cause VQ to repeatedly quantize similar representations for each expert, resulting in inefficient use of limited codebook capacity; and (2) cumulative output bias is amplified by expert aggregation in MoE layers, leading to distributional shifts in the quantized outputs. To address these issues, we propose KBVQ-MoE, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit quantization for MoE-based LLMs. KBVQ-MoE integrates two techniques: (1) input-driven redundancy elimination, where a Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) guided singular value decomposition (SVD) extracts dominant weight components and shares them across experts; and (2) bias-corrected output stabilization, where vector quantization is applied only to expert-specific (non-redundant) representations and the quantized outputs are corrected via channel-wise affine compensation.

Upon burning, soil on the surface or immediately beneath becomes hydrophobic, a phenomenon that occurs predominantly on sand-based hillslopes.

Soil hydrophobicity enhances erosion, resulting in post-wildfire debris flows that differ from natural mudflows in intensity, duration, and destructiveness. Thus, it is crucial to understand the timing and conditions of debris-flow onset, driven by the coupled effects of critical parameters: varying rain intensities (RI), slope gradients, water-entry values, and grain sizes (D50). Machine Learning (ML) techniques have become increasingly valuable in geotechnical engineering due to their ability to model complex systems without predefined assumptions. This study applies multiple ML algorithms: multiple linear regression (MLR), logistic regression (LR), support vector classifier (SVC), K-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to predict and classify outcomes from laboratory experiments that model field conditions using a rain device on various soils in sloped flumes. While MLR effectively predicted total discharge, erosion predictions were less accurate, especially for coarse sand. LR and SVC achieved good accuracy in classifying failure outcomes, supported by clustering and dimensionality reduction. Sensitivity analysis revealed that fine sand is highly susceptible to erosion, particularly under low-intensity, long-duration rainfall.

While existing methods typically rely on dedicated models for achieving specific compression ratios, they are often limited in flexibility and generalization.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel and flexible Arbitrary Ratio Feature Compression (ARFC) framework, which supports any compression ratio with a single model, eliminating the need for multiple specialized models. At its core, the Arbitrary Ratio Compressor (ARC) is an auto-regressive model that performs compression via next-token prediction. This allows the compression ratio to be controlled at inference simply by adjusting the number of generated tokens. To enhance the quality of the compressed features, two key modules are introduced. The Mixture of Solutions (MoS) module refines the compressed tokens by utilizing multiple compression results (solutions), reducing uncertainty and improving robustness. The Entity Relation Graph Constraint (ERGC) is integrated into the training process to preserve semantic and structural relationships during compression. Extensive experiments on cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and image retrieval tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches at various compression ratios.

When downstream data exhibit a substantial distribution shift from the model's prior training distribution, SFT can induce catastrophic forgetting. To narrow this gap, data rewriting has been proposed as a data-centric approach that rewrites downstream training data prior to SFT. However, existing methods typically sample rewrites from a prompt-induced conditional distribution, so the resulting targets are not necessarily aligned with the model's natural QA-style generation distribution. Moreover, reliance on fixed templates can lead to diversity collapse. To address these issues, we cast data rewriting as a policy learning problem and learn a rewriting policy that better matches the backbone's QA-style generation distribution while preserving diversity. Since distributional alignment, diversity and task consistency are automatically evaluable but difficult to optimize end-to-end with differentiable objectives, we leverage reinforcement learning to optimize the rewrite distribution under reward feedback and propose an RL-based data-rewriting agent.

We separate the hypothesis into two claims: linear representation (features are linearly embedded in neuron activations) and linear accessibility (features can be linearly decoded). We then ask: How many neurons $d$ suffice to both linearly represent and linearly access $m$ features? Classical results in compressed sensing imply that for $k$-sparse inputs, $d = O(k\\log (m/k))$ suffices if we allow non-linear decoding algorithms (Candes and Tao, 2006; Candes et al., 2006; Donoho, 2006). However, the additional requirement of linear decoding takes the problem out of the classical compressed sensing, into linear compressed sensing.\n  Our main theoretical result establishes nearly-matching upper and lower bounds for linear compressed sensing. We prove that $d = \u03a9_\u03b5(\\frac{k^2}{\\log k}\\log (m/k))$ is required while $d = O_\u03b5(k^2\\log m)$ suffices. The lower bound establishes a quantitative gap between classical and linear compressed setting, illustrating how linear accessibility is a meaningfully stronger hypothesis than linear representation alone. The upper bound confirms that neurons can store an exponential number of features under the LRH, giving theoretical evidence for the \"superposition hypothesis\" (Elhage et al., 2022).\n  The upper bound proof uses standard random constructions of matrices with approximately orthogonal columns. The lower bound proof uses rank bounds for near-identity matrices (Alon, 2003) together with Tur\u00e1n's theorem (bounding the number of edges in clique-free graphs).

By integrating Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning (DL), vision-based SHM can automatically identify and localize visual patterns associated with structural damage. However, previous works typically generate only discrete outputs, such as damage class labels and damage region coordinates, requiring engineers to further reorganize and analyze these results for evaluation and decision-making. In late 2022, Large Language Models (LLMs) became popular across multiple fields, providing new insights into AI-aided vision-based SHM. In this study, a novel LLM-based Disaster Reconnaissance Summarization (LLM-DRS) framework is proposed. It introduces a standard reconnaissance plan in which the collection of vision data and corresponding metadata follows a well-designed on-site investigation process. Text-based metadata and image-based vision data are then processed and integrated into a unified format, where well-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks extract key attributes, including damage state, material type, and damage level. Finally, all data are fed into an LLM with carefully designed prompts, enabling the LLM-DRS to generate summary reports for individual structures or affected regions based on aggregated attributes and metadata.

In medicine, such interventions arise in physiological regulation (e.g., cardiovascular system under fluid administration) and pharmacokinetics, among others. Propofol administration is an anesthetic intervention, where the challenge is to estimate the optimal dose required to achieve a target brain concentration for anesthesia, given patient characteristics, while avoiding under- or over-dosing. The pharmacokinetic state is characterized by drug concentrations across tissues, and its dynamics are governed by prior states, patient covariates, drug clearance, and drug administration. While data-driven models can capture complex dynamics, they often fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Mechanistic models on the other hand are typically robust, but might be oversimplified. We propose a hybrid mechanistic-data-driven approach to estimate time-dependent intervention outcomes. Our approach decomposes the dynamical system's transition operator into parametric and nonparametric components, further distinguishing between intervention-related and unrelated dynamics. This structure leverages mechanistic anchors while learning residual patterns from data. For scenarios where mechanistic parameters are unknown, we introduce a two-stage procedure: first, pre-training an encoder on simulated data, and subsequently learning corrections from observed data. Two regimes with incomplete mechanistic knowledge are considered: periodic pendulum and Propofol bolus injections.

Transferable concept vectors: a concept direction in activation space once learned transfers across both {timesteps} and {samples}; the same fixed steering vector learned near low noise level remains effective when injected at intermediate noise levels for every generation trajectory, providing refined conditional control with efficiency. Such concept directions can be efficiently and reliably identified via Recursive Feature Machine (RFM), a light-weight backpropagation-free feature learning method.

Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. \"woman\") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability.

Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution.

One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low.

We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Selective Abstraction (SA) enhances LLM reliability by reducing detail in uncertain content, outperforming binary abstention methods in long-form settings.", "motivation": "LLMs often produce factual errors, limiting trust and adoption in high-risk scenarios.

We introduce SkillRater, a framework that decomposes data filtering into specialized raters - one per capability, each trained via meta-learning on a disjoint validation objective - and composes their scores through a progressive selection rule: at each training stage, a sample is retained if any rater ranks it above a threshold that tightens over time, preserving diversity early while concentrating on high-value samples late.

Under this setting, we study the fundamental question of \\emph{which tokens an SLM can and should learn} during pretraining, versus \\emph{which ones it should delegate} via a \\texttt{<CALL>} token.

However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models.

To address those limitation, we proposes Targeted Interpretable Perturbation (TIP), a novel defense framework that integrates model interpretability with frequency domain analysis.

Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning. Leveraging this representation, we train a diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets to refine and enhance textures produced by multi-view diffusion methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

In this paper, we define \\emph{token overflow} as a regime in which compressed representations no longer contain sufficient information to answer a given query, and propose a methodology to characterize and detect it. In the xRAG soft-compression setting, we find that query-agnostic saturation statistics reliably separate compressed from uncompressed token representations, providing a practical tool for identifying compressed tokens but showing limited overflow detection capability. Lightweight probing classifiers over both query and context xRAG representations detect overflow with 0.72 AUC-ROC on average on HotpotQA, SQuADv2, and TriviaQA datasets, demonstrating that incorporating query information improves detection performance.

The observation noise covariance of a Bayesian filter is modulated by the local value of a known or assumed potential energy function: observations are trusted when the state is near a potential minimum and progressively discounted as it approaches the barrier separating metastable wells. This physics-based mechanism differs from purely statistical robust filters, which treat all regions of state space identically, and from constrained filters, which impose hard bounds on states rather than modulating observation trust. We implement the gating within Extended, Unscented, Ensemble, and Adaptive Kalman filters and particle filters, requiring only two additional hyperparameters. Synthetic benchmarks on a Ginzburg-Landau double-well process with 10% outlier contamination and Monte Carlo validation over 100 replications show 57-80% RMSE improvement over the standard Extended Kalman Filter, all statistically significant (p < 10^{-15}, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). A naive topological baseline using only distance to the nearest well achieves 57%, confirming that the continuous energy landscape adds an additional ~21 percentage points. The method is robust to misspecification: even when assumed potential parameters deviate by 50% from their true values, improvement never falls below 47%.

In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious.

We introduce MUSE, a model serving framework that enables seamless model updates by decoupling model scores from client decision boundaries.

In the light of this issue, many methods have been proposed to enhance the fairness guarantees of classifiers. Most of the existing interventions assume access to group information for all instances, a requirement rarely met in practice. Fairness without access to demographic information has often been approached through robust optimization techniques,which target worst-case outcomes over a set of plausible distributions known as the uncertainty set. However, their effectiveness is strongly influenced by the chosen uncertainty set. In fact, existing approaches often overemphasize outliers or overly pessimistic scenarios, compromising both overall performance and fairness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPECTRE, a minimax-fair method that adjusts the spectrum of a simple Fourier feature mapping and constrains the extent to which the worst-case distribution can deviate from the empirical distribution. We perform extensive experiments on the American Community Survey datasets involving 20 states. The safeness of SPECTRE comes as it provides the highest average values on fairness guarantees together with the smallest interquartile range in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches, even compared to those with access to demographic group information.

We introduce Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing (APST), a depth-oriented evaluation framework inspired by reliability engineering.

Rather than treating failures as isolated events, APST models them as stochastic outcomes of independent inference events. We formalize safety failures using Bernoulli and binomial models to estimate per-inference failure probabilities, enabling quantitative comparison of reliability across models and decoding configurations.

DPO weighs each update relative to a reference, which stabilizes the training by regularizing the updates within a trusted region. This reliance becomes problematic for pessimistic pairs, where the reference model prefers the rejected response. For these pairs, DPO prematurely attenuates the gradient as soon as the policy margin ($\u0394_\u03b8$) merely beats the reference margin ($\u0394_{\\mathrm{ref}}$) even if the policy is still wrong ($\u0394_\u03b8<0$). We name this failure premature satisfaction, which is a concrete form of the training-inference mismatch. Reference-free objectives remove this mismatch by optimizing the absolute margin, but at the cost of discarding the stabilizing signal of the reference. We mitigate this tension with Hybrid-DPO (HyPO), a drop-in modification to DPO that applies reference conditionally: HyPO behaves exactly like DPO when the reference is optimistic or neutral, and it treats the reference as neutral when it is pessimistic by replacing $\u0394_\u03b8-\u0394_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ with $\u0394_\u03b8-\\max\\{0,\u0394_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\}$. This one-line change strictly strengthens per-example learning signals on pessimistic pairs while preserving DPO's objective form and computational cost.

We establish that the low-dimensional temporal structure underlying model evolution can be preserved under parameter-efficient reparameterization, enabling temporal modeling without operating in the ambient parameter space. Building on this principle, we propose Manifold-aware Temporal LoRA (MaT-LoRA), which constrains temporal updates to a shared low-dimensional manifold within a low-rank adaptation subspace, and models its evolution through a structured temporal core. This reparameterization dramatically reduces temporal modeling complexity while retaining expressive power. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including scientific documents, news publishers, and review ratings, demonstrate that MaT-LoRA achieves superior temporal generalization performance with practical scalability for LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "MaT-LoRA is a parameter-efficient method for temporal domain generalization in LLMs, leveraging low-dimensional manifolds to reduce complexity while maintaining performance.", "motivation": "Address the computational infeasibility of existing Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) approaches in large parameter spaces of LLMs by introducing a geometric reformulation.", "method": "Proposes Manifold-aware Temporal LoRA (MaT-LoRA), which confines temporal updates to a low-dimensional manifold within a low-rank adaptation subspace using a structured temporal core.", "result": "Demonstrates superior temporal generalization performance and practical scalability on synthetic and real-world datasets.", "conclusion": "MaT-LoRA efficiently models temporal evolution in LLMs with reduced complexity, offering a scalable solution for real-world deployments."}}

In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i.e., reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings. In particular, in the setting where we merge the knowledge from different domain experts, obtained by applying domain-specific RL to the same student model, back into the original student, ExOPD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's performance boundary and outperform the domain teachers. (2) Building on ExOPD, we further find that in the strong-to-weak distillation setting (i.e., distilling a smaller student from a larger teacher), performing reward correction by choosing the reference model as the teacher's base model before RL yields a more accurate reward signal and further improves distillation performance.

To overcome these challenges, this study introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based Feature Interaction Framework (KAN-FIF), a lightweight multimodal architecture that integrates MLP and CNN layers with spline-parameterized KAN layers. For Maximum Sustained Wind (MSW) prediction, experiments demonstrate that the KAN-FIF framework achieves a $94.8\\%$ reduction in parameters (0.99MB vs 19MB) and $68.7\\%$ faster inference per sample (2.3ms vs 7.35ms) compared to baseline model Phy-CoCo, while maintaining superior accuracy with $32.5\\%$ lower MAE. The offline deployment experiment of the FY-4 series meteorological satellite processor on the Qingyun-1000 development board achieved a 14.41ms per-sample inference latency with the KAN-FIF framework, demonstrating promising feasibility for operational TC monitoring and extending deployability to edge-device AI applications.
