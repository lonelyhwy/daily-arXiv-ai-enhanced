### [1] [Beyond Ground: Map-Free LiDAR Relocalization for UAVs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13267)
*Hengyu Mu,Jianshi Wu,Yuxin Guo,XianLian Lin,Qingyong Hu,Chenglu Wen,Cheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAILS is a novel map-free LiDAR relocalization framework for UAVs, addressing accuracy gaps in existing methods by introducing locally discriminative feature extraction and robust handling of UAV flight dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR relocalization methods, optimized for autonomous driving, perform poorly in UAV scenarios due to sparse point clouds and UAV-specific flight dynamics like yaw rotations and altitude changes.

Method: MAILS includes a Locality-Preserving Sliding Window Attention module for feature extraction, a coordinate-independent feature initialization module, and a locally invariant positional encoding mechanism to handle UAV flight challenges. A new UAV-specific dataset is also introduced.

Result: MAILS achieves high localization precision and outperforms existing methods significantly in UAV scenarios.

Conclusion: MAILS provides an effective solution for UAV relocalization in GNSS-challenged environments, with robust feature extraction and a tailored dataset enhancing performance.

Abstract: Localization is a fundamental capability in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. Map-free LiDAR relocalization offers an effective solution for achieving high-precision positioning in environments with weak or unavailable GNSS signals. However, existing LiDAR relocalization methods are primarily tailored to autonomous driving, exhibiting significantly degraded accuracy in UAV scenarios. In this paper, we propose MAILS, a novel map-free LiDAR relocalization framework for UAVs. A Locality-Preserving Sliding Window Attention module is first introduced to extract locally discriminative geometric features from sparse point clouds. To handle substantial yaw rotations and altitude variations encountered during UAV flight, we then design a coordinate-independent feature initialization module and a locally invariant positional encoding mechanism, which together significantly enhance the robustness of feature extraction. Furthermore, existing LiDAR-based relocalization datasets fail to capture real-world UAV flight characteristics, such as irregular trajectories and varying altitudes. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale LiDAR localization dataset for UAVs, which comprises four scenes and various flight trajectories, designed to evaluate UAV relocalization performance under realistic conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves satisfactory localization precision and consistently outperforms existing techniques by a significant margin. Our code and dataset will be released soon.

### [2] [Explanatory Interactive Machine Learning for Bias Mitigation in Visual Gender Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13286)
*Nathanya Satriani,Djordje Slijepčević,Markus Schedl,Matthias Zeppelzauer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Explanatory interactive learning (XIL) helps mitigate bias and spurious correlations in visual classifiers by incorporating user feedback on model explanations. Evaluated methods (CAIPI, RRR, and a hybrid) effectively guide models to focus on relevant features and reduce bias, with CAIPI potentially improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address bias and spurious correlations in ML models, especially in gender classification, by leveraging user feedback on explanations to improve fairness and transparency.

Method: Evaluates two XIL strategies (CAIPI and RRR) and a hybrid approach, comparing their effectiveness using GradCAM and BLA explanations.

Result: CAIPI performs best in guiding models to relevant features and reducing bias, while maintaining or improving accuracy. Other methods slightly decrease performance but enhance fairness.

Conclusion: XIL methods, particularly CAIPI, show promise in improving fairness and transparency in gender classifiers, though some trade-offs in performance may occur.

Abstract: Explanatory interactive learning (XIL) enables users to guide model training in machine learning (ML) by providing feedback on the model's explanations, thereby helping it to focus on features that are relevant to the prediction from the user's perspective. In this study, we explore the capability of this learning paradigm to mitigate bias and spurious correlations in visual classifiers, specifically in scenarios prone to data bias, such as gender classification. We investigate two methodologically different state-of-the-art XIL strategies, i.e., CAIPI and Right for the Right Reasons (RRR), as well as a novel hybrid approach that combines both strategies. The results are evaluated quantitatively by comparing segmentation masks with explanations generated using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM) and Bounded Logit Attention (BLA). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in (i) guiding ML models to focus on relevant image features, particularly when CAIPI is used, and (ii) reducing model bias (i.e., balancing the misclassification rates between male and female predictions). Our analysis further supports the potential of XIL methods to improve fairness in gender classifiers. Overall, the increased transparency and fairness obtained by XIL leads to slight performance decreases with an exception being CAIPI, which shows potential to even improve classification accuracy.

### [3] [COOPERTRIM: Adaptive Data Selection for Uncertainty-Aware Cooperative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13287)
*Shilpa Mukhopadhyay,Amit Roy-Chowdhury,Hang Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COOPERTRIM is an adaptive feature selection framework for cooperative perception that reduces bandwidth by dynamically sharing only relevant features, maintaining accuracy while drastically cutting bandwidth usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the tension between limited communication bandwidth and rich sensor data in cooperative perception by avoiding redundant transmissions of static information.

Method: Introduces a conformal temporal uncertainty metric to gauge feature relevance and a data-driven mechanism to dynamically adjust sharing quantity.

Result: Achieves up to 80.28% bandwidth reduction in semantic segmentation and 72.52% in 3D detection while maintaining comparable accuracy. Also improves IoU by 45.54% with less bandwidth.

Conclusion: COOPERTRIM effectively adapts to environmental dynamics, reducing bandwidth without compromising performance, making it suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Cooperative perception enables autonomous agents to share encoded representations over wireless communication to enhance each other's live situational awareness. However, the tension between the limited communication bandwidth and the rich sensor information hinders its practical deployment. Recent studies have explored selection strategies that share only a subset of features per frame while striving to keep the performance on par. Nevertheless, the bandwidth requirement still stresses current wireless technologies. To fundamentally ease the tension, we take a proactive approach, exploiting the temporal continuity to identify features that capture environment dynamics, while avoiding repetitive and redundant transmission of static information. By incorporating temporal awareness, agents are empowered to dynamically adapt the sharing quantity according to environment complexity. We instantiate this intuition into an adaptive selection framework, COOPERTRIM, which introduces a novel conformal temporal uncertainty metric to gauge feature relevance, and a data-driven mechanism to dynamically determine the sharing quantity. To evaluate COOPERTRIM, we take semantic segmentation and 3D detection as example tasks. Across multiple open-source cooperative segmentation and detection models, COOPERTRIM achieves up to 80.28% and 72.52% bandwidth reduction respectively while maintaining a comparable accuracy. Relative to other selection strategies, COOPERTRIM also improves IoU by as much as 45.54% with up to 72% less bandwidth. Combined with compression strategies, COOPERTRIM can further reduce bandwidth usage to as low as 1.46% without compromising IoU performance. Qualitative results show COOPERTRIM gracefully adapts to environmental dynamics, localization error, and communication latency, demonstrating flexibility and paving the way for real-world deployment.

### [4] [NutVLM: A Self-Adaptive Defense Framework against Full-Dimension Attacks for Vision Language Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13293)
*Xiaoxu Peng,Dong Zhou,Jianwen Zhang,Guanghui Sun,Anh Tu Ngo,Anupam Chattopadhyay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NutVLM is a self-adaptive defense framework for Vision Language Models in autonomous driving, combining detection, purification, and adversarial prompt tuning to improve robustness without compromising clean-sample performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense methods for VLMs in autonomous driving lack robustness and balance between threat mitigation and performance on clean samples.

Method: NutVLM uses NutNet++ for three-way classification, grayscale masking for localized threats, and Expert-guided Adversarial Prompt Tuning (EAPT) for global perturbations.

Result: NutVLM achieves a 4.89% improvement in overall metrics on the Dolphins benchmark, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: NutVLM is a scalable security solution for intelligent transportation, enhancing VLM robustness without full-model retraining.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have advanced perception in autonomous driving (AD), but they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats. These risks range from localized physical patches to imperceptible global perturbations. Existing defense methods for VLMs remain limited and often fail to reconcile robustness with clean-sample performance. To bridge these gaps, we propose NutVLM, a comprehensive self-adaptive defense framework designed to secure the entire perception-decision lifecycle. Specifically, we first employ NutNet++ as a sentinel, which is a unified detection-purification mechanism. It identifies benign samples, local patches, and global perturbations through three-way classification. Subsequently, localized threats are purified via efficient grayscale masking, while global perturbations trigger Expert-guided Adversarial Prompt Tuning (EAPT). Instead of the costly parameter updates of full-model fine-tuning, EAPT generates "corrective driving prompts" via gradient-based latent optimization and discrete projection. These prompts refocus the VLM's attention without requiring exhaustive full-model retraining. Evaluated on the Dolphins benchmark, our NutVLM yields a 4.89% improvement in overall metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Language Score, and GPT Score). These results validate NutVLM as a scalable security solution for intelligent transportation. Our code is available at https://github.com/PXX/NutVLM.

### [5] [VisPhyWorld: Probing Physical Reasoning via Code-Driven Video Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13294)
*Jiarong Liang,Max Ku,Ka-Hei Hui,Ping Nie,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisPhyWorld is an execution-based framework evaluating MLLMs' physical reasoning by generating executable simulator code from visuals. VisPhyBench, derived from it, shows MLLMs struggle with accurate parameter inference and dynamics simulation despite strong semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for MLLMs' physical reasoning, like VQA and VoE, lack explicit, testable hypotheses, necessitating a more rigorous evaluation method.

Method: The authors propose VisPhyWorld, requiring models to generate executable simulator code from visuals, ensuring inspectable and falsifiable representations. VisPhyBench, with 209 scenes, evaluates reconstruction and plausible motion.

Result: VisPhyBench achieves 97.7% valid reconstructed videos, but MLLMs struggle with physical parameter inference and consistent dynamics simulation.

Conclusion: While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding, their physical reasoning lacks accuracy, highlighting the need for frameworks like VisPhyWorld.

Abstract: Evaluating whether Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) genuinely reason about physical dynamics remains challenging. Most existing benchmarks rely on recognition-style protocols such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Violation of Expectation (VoE), which can often be answered without committing to an explicit, testable physical hypothesis. We propose VisPhyWorld, an execution-based framework that evaluates physical reasoning by requiring models to generate executable simulator code from visual observations. By producing runnable code, the inferred world representation is directly inspectable, editable, and falsifiable. This separates physical reasoning from rendering. Building on this framework, we introduce VisPhyBench, comprising 209 evaluation scenes derived from 108 physical templates and a systematic protocol that evaluates how well models reconstruct appearance and reproduce physically plausible motion. Our pipeline produces valid reconstructed videos in 97.7% on the benchmark. Experiments show that while state-of-the-art MLLMs achieve strong semantic scene understanding, they struggle to accurately infer physical parameters and to simulate consistent physical dynamics.

### [6] [MFN Decomposition and Related Metrics for High-Resolution Range Profiles Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13296)
*Edwyn Brient,Santiago Velasco-Forero,Rami Kassab*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes metrics for evaluating high-resolution range profile (HRRP) data decomposition into mask, features, and noise, addressing limitations of black-box classification models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HRRP generation evaluation relies on black-box classification models, lacking explainability and multi-level assessment.

Method: The work decomposes HRRP data into mask, features, and noise, proposing two metrics based on their physical interpretation.

Result: The proposed metrics demonstrate discriminative ability on a challenging task using an expensive dataset.

Conclusion: The decomposition and metrics offer improved evaluation for HRRP data generation, surpassing black-box methods.

Abstract: High-resolution range profile (HRRP ) data are in vogue in radar automatic target recognition (RATR). With the interest in classifying models using HRRP, filling gaps in datasets using generative models has recently received promising contributions. Evaluating generated data is a challenging topic, even for explicit data like face images. However, the evaluation methods used in the state-ofthe-art of HRRP generation rely on classification models. Such models, called ''black-box'', do not allow either explainability on generated data or multi-level evaluation. This work focuses on decomposing HRRP data into three components: the mask, the features, and the noise. Using this decomposition, we propose two metrics based on the physical interpretation of those data. We take profit from an expensive dataset to evaluate our metrics on a challenging task and demonstrate the discriminative ability of those.

### [7] [Conditional Generative Models for High-Resolution Range Profiles: Capturing Geometry-Driven Trends in a Large-Scale Maritime Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13297)
*Edwyn Brient,Santiago Velasco-Forero,Rami Kassab*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study focuses on HRRP synthesis using a large maritime dataset to improve robustness by conditioning on geometric variables like ship dimensions and aspect angle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HRRPs are sensitive to acquisition conditions, limiting robustness; conditional HRRP generation can address this, but prior studies lacked diverse datasets.

Method: Analyzed HRRP synthesis on a large maritime database, identifying geometric variables (ship dimensions, aspect angle) as key drivers. Trained generative models conditioned on these variables.

Result: Synthesized signatures matched the geometric trend seen in real data.

Conclusion: Acquisition geometry is crucial for robust HRRP generation.

Abstract: High-resolution range profiles (HRRPs) enable fast onboard processing for radar automatic target recognition, but their strong sensitivity to acquisition conditions limits robustness across operational scenarios. Conditional HRRP generation can mitigate this issue, yet prior studies are constrained by small, highly specific datasets. We study HRRP synthesis on a largescale maritime database representative of coastal surveillance variability. Our analysis indicates that the fundamental scenario drivers are geometric: ship dimensions and the desired aspect angle. Conditioning on these variables, we train generative models and show that the synthesized signatures reproduce the expected line-of-sight geometric trend observed in real data. These results highlight the central role of acquisition geometry for robust HRRP generation.

### [8] [Effect of Convolutional Depth on Image Recognition Performance: VGG vs. ResNet vs. GoogLeNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13298)
*Manfred M. Fischer,Joshua Pitts*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study compares VGG, ResNet, and GoogLeNet to show that effective depth, not nominal depth, determines the benefits of increased network depth in CNNs, with residual and inception architectures offering better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how depth affects classification performance, convergence, and computational efficiency in CNNs, distinguishing between nominal and effective depth.

Method: A controlled comparative study of VGG, ResNet, and GoogLeNet architectures using standardized training protocols.

Result: Residual and inception-based architectures improve accuracy at lower effective depth and better computational efficiency, unlike plain deep networks.

Conclusion: Effective depth is key for productive scaling in CNNs, with architectural mechanisms playing a critical role.

Abstract: Increasing convolutional depth has been central to advances in image recognition, yet deeper networks do not uniformly yield higher accuracy, stable optimization, or efficient computation. We present a controlled comparative study of three canonical convolutional neural network architectures - VGG, ResNet, and GoogLeNet - to isolate how depth influences classification performance, convergence behavior, and computational efficiency. By standardizing training protocols and explicitly distinguishing between nominal and effective depth, we show that the benefits of depth depend critically on architectural mechanisms that constrain its effective manifestation during training rather than on nominal depth alone. Although plain deep networks exhibit early accuracy saturation and optimization instability, residual and inception-based architectures consistently translate additional depth into improved accuracy at lower effective depth and favorable accuracy-compute trade-offs. These findings demonstrate that effective depth, not nominal depth, is the operative quantity governing depth's role as a productive scaling dimension in convolutional networks.

### [9] [KidMesh: Computational Mesh Reconstruction for Pediatric Congenital Hydronephrosis Using Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13299)
*Haoran Sun,Zhanpeng Zhu,Anguo Zhang,Bo Liu,Zhaohua Lin,Liqin Huang,Mingjing Yang,Lei Liu,Shan Lin,Wangbin Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KidMesh is an end-to-end deep learning method for reconstructing pediatric congenital hydronephrosis meshes directly from MRU images, eliminating the need for post-processing and enabling functional assessments like urodynamic simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing voxel-based segmentation methods for CH focus on morphological features and require complex post-processing for functional assessments. KidMesh aims to address this by directly generating mesh-level representations from MRU images.

Method: KidMesh uses deep neural networks to extract feature maps from MRU images, converts them into feature vertices, and deforms a template mesh to create CH-specific meshes. It trains without accurate mesh annotations.

Result: KidMesh reconstructs CH meshes in 0.4 seconds, matches conventional methods' performance, avoids self-intersections, and achieves high accuracy (Dice score 0.86). Meshes are usable for urine flow simulations.

Conclusion: KidMesh efficiently reconstructs CH meshes from MRU images, outperforming traditional methods and enabling direct clinical applications like urodynamic simulations.

Abstract: Pediatric congenital hydronephrosis (CH) is a common urinary tract disorder, primarily caused by obstruction at the renal pelvis-ureter junction. Magnetic resonance urography (MRU) can visualize hydronephrosis, including renal pelvis and calyces, by utilizing the natural contrast provided by water. Existing voxel-based segmentation approaches can extract CH regions from MRU, facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, these segmentation methods predominantly focus on morphological features, such as size, shape, and structure. To enable functional assessments, such as urodynamic simulations, external complex post-processing steps are required to convert these results into mesh-level representations. To address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end method based on deep neural networks, namely KidMesh, which could automatically reconstruct CH meshes directly from MRU. Generally, KidMesh extracts feature maps from MRU images and converts them into feature vertices through grid sampling. It then deforms a template mesh according to these feature vertices to generate the specific CH meshes of MRU images. Meanwhile, we develop a novel schema to train KidMesh without relying on accurate mesh-level annotations, which are difficult to obtain due to the sparsely sampled MRU slices. Experimental results show that KidMesh could reconstruct CH meshes in an average of 0.4 seconds, and achieve comparable performance to conventional methods without requiring post-processing. The reconstructed meshes exhibited no self-intersections, with only 3.7% and 0.2% of the vertices having error distances exceeding 3.2mm and 6.4mm, respectively. After rasterization, these meshes achieved a Dice score of 0.86 against manually delineated CH masks. Furthermore, these meshes could be used in renal urine flow simulations, providing valuable urodynamic information for clinical practice.

### [10] [DriveMamba: Task-Centric Scalable State Space Model for Efficient End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13301)
*Haisheng Su,Wei Wu,Feixiang Song,Junjie Zhang,Zhenjie Yang,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveMamba introduces a task-centric scalable paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving, addressing limitations like information loss and inefficiency in existing unified frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current E2E-AD frameworks suffer from manual ordering designs, information loss, and inefficiencies due to quadratic-complexity attention mechanisms and insufficient training of image backbones.

Method: DriveMamba integrates dynamic task relation modeling, implicit view correspondence learning, and long-term temporal fusion into a single-stage Unified Mamba decoder using linear-complexity operators and token-level sparse representations.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes and Bench2Drive datasets show DriveMamba's superiority, generalizability, and efficiency.

Conclusion: DriveMamba offers a scalable and efficient solution for E2E-AD by addressing key challenges in modular designs and computational inefficiencies.

Abstract: Recent advances towards End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E-AD) have been often devoted on integrating modular designs into a unified framework for joint optimization e.g. UniAD, which follow a sequential paradigm (i.e., perception-prediction-planning) based on separable Transformer decoders and rely on dense BEV features to encode scene representations. However, such manual ordering design can inevitably cause information loss and cumulative errors, lacking flexible and diverse relation modeling among different modules and sensors. Meanwhile, insufficient training of image backbone and quadratic-complexity of attention mechanism also hinder the scalability and efficiency of E2E-AD system to handle spatiotemporal input. To this end, we propose DriveMamba, a Task-Centric Scalable paradigm for efficient E2E-AD, which integrates dynamic task relation modeling, implicit view correspondence learning and long-term temporal fusion into a single-stage Unified Mamba decoder. Specifically, both extracted image features and expected task outputs are converted into token-level sparse representations in advance, which are then sorted by their instantiated positions in 3D space. The linear-complexity operator enables efficient long-context sequential token modeling to capture task-related inter-dependencies simultaneously. Additionally, a bidirectional trajectory-guided "local-to-global" scan method is designed to preserve spatial locality from ego-perspective, thus facilitating the ego-planning. Extensive experiments conducted on nuScenes and Bench2Drive datasets demonstrate the superiority, generalizability and great efficiency of DriveMamba.

### [11] [Spectral Collapse in Diffusion Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13303)
*Nicolas Bourriez,Alexandre Verine,Auguste Genovesio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OVG addresses spectral collapse in diffusion inversion for image translation, preserving structure while restoring textures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard deterministic inversion fails in spectrally sparse source domains, causing oversmoothed outputs.

Method: Proposes Orthogonal Variance Guidance (OVG) to correct ODE dynamics and enforce Gaussian noise.

Result: OVG restores photorealistic textures while maintaining structural fidelity in tests.

Conclusion: OVG resolves the structure-texture trade-off in diffusion inversion for image translation.

Abstract: Conditional diffusion inversion provides a powerful framework for unpaired image-to-image translation. However, we demonstrate through an extensive analysis that standard deterministic inversion (e.g. DDIM) fails when the source domain is spectrally sparse compared to the target domain (e.g., super-resolution, sketch-to-image). In these contexts, the recovered latent from the input does not follow the expected isotropic Gaussian distribution. Instead it exhibits a signal with lower frequencies, locking target sampling to oversmoothed and texture-poor generations. We term this phenomenon spectral collapse. We observe that stochastic alternatives attempting to restore the noise variance tend to break the semantic link to the input, leading to structural drift. To resolve this structure-texture trade-off, we propose Orthogonal Variance Guidance (OVG), an inference-time method that corrects the ODE dynamics to enforce the theoretical Gaussian noise magnitude within the null-space of the structural gradient. Extensive experiments on microscopy super-resolution (BBBC021) and sketch-to-image (Edges2Shoes) demonstrate that OVG effectively restores photorealistic textures while preserving structural fidelity.

*Jiahao Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCReg-Net is a progressive contrast-guided registration framework for high-speed OR-PAM, improving alignment quality and achieving superior performance metrics like NCC, SSIM, and PSNR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited alignment quality in bidirectional raster scanning OR-PAM caused by domain shift and geometric misalignment, beyond the constraints of brightness constancy assumptions.

Method: PCReg-Net employs a coarse-to-fine alignment approach with four modules: a registration U-Net, a reference feature extractor, a contrast module, and a refinement U-Net, plus new evaluation metrics TNCC and TNCG.

Result: Achieves NCC of 0.983, SSIM of 0.982, and PSNR of 46.96 dB on OR-PAM-Reg-4K, surpassing state-of-the-art by over 14 dB at real-time speed.

Conclusion: PCReg-Net significantly improves alignment quality in high-speed OR-PAM, demonstrating superior performance and real-time capability.

Abstract: High-speed optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) with bidirectional raster scanning doubles imaging speed but introduces coupled domain shift and geometric misalignment between forward and backward scan lines. Existing methods, constrained by brightness constancy assumptions, achieve limited alignment quality (NCC~$\leq 0.96$). We propose PCReg-Net, a progressive contrast-guided registration framework that performs coarse-to-fine alignment through four lightweight modules: (1)~a registration U-Net for coarse alignment, (2)~a reference feature extractor capturing multi-scale structural cues, (3)~a contrast module that identifies residual misalignment by comparing coarse-registered and reference features, and (4)~a refinement U-Net with feature injection for high-fidelity output. We further propose the Temporal NCC (TNCC) and Temporal NCC Gap (TNCG) for reference-free evaluation of inter-frame temporal consistency. On OR-PAM-Reg-4K (432 test samples), PCReg-Net achieves NCC of 0.983, SSIM of 0.982, and PSNR of 46.96 dB, surpassing the state-of-the-art by over 14 dB at real-time speed.

*Aydin Ayanzadeh,Prakhar Dixit,Sadia Kamal,Milton Halem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WildfireVLM is an AI framework combining satellite imagery detection and language-driven risk assessment for early wildfire monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildfires are increasingly threatening ecosystems and infrastructure, but early detection via satellites is challenging due to faint signals and dynamic conditions.

Method: WildfireVLM uses YOLOv12 for detecting fire zones/smoke in satellite imagery and integrates MLLMs for contextualized risk assessments.

Result: The system provides real-time processing, risk dashboards, and long-term tracking, validated via LLM-as-judge evaluation.

Conclusion: Combining computer vision and language-based reasoning enables scalable wildfire monitoring.

Abstract: Wildfires are a growing threat to ecosystems, human lives, and infrastructure, with their frequency and intensity rising due to climate change and human activities. Early detection is critical, yet satellite-based monitoring remains challenging due to faint smoke signals, dynamic weather conditions, and the need for real-time analysis over large areas. We introduce WildfireVLM, an AI framework that combines satellite imagery wildfire detection with language-driven risk assessment. We construct a labeled wildfire and smoke dataset using imagery from Landsat-8/9, GOES-16, and other publicly available Earth observation sources, including harmonized products with aligned spectral bands. WildfireVLM employs YOLOv12 to detect fire zones and smoke plumes, leveraging its ability to detect small, complex patterns in satellite imagery. We integrate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that convert detection outputs into contextualized risk assessments and prioritized response recommendations for disaster management. We validate the quality of risk reasoning using an LLM-as-judge evaluation with a shared rubric. The system is deployed using a service-oriented architecture that supports real-time processing, visual risk dashboards, and long-term wildfire tracking, demonstrating the value of combining computer vision with language-based reasoning for scalable wildfire monitoring.

*Zhehan Zhang,Meihua Qian,Li Luo,Siyu Huang,Chaoyi Zhou,Ripon Saha,Xinxin Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated creativity assessment for paintings using fine-tuned vision-language model Qwen2-VL-7B achieves high accuracy and generates rubric-aligned feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual scoring of artistic creativity is labor-intensive; prior machine-learning approaches lack explanatory feedback.

Method: Fine-tuned Qwen2-VL-7B with multi-task learning on a dataset of 1000 scored paintings and descriptions. Added regression head for numerical scoring and feedback generation.

Result: Strong accuracy (Pearson r > 0.97, MAE ≈ 3.95), with feedback semantically close to expert critiques (SBERT similarity = 0.798).

Conclusion: The framework bridges computer vision and art assessment, offering scalable tools for creativity research and education.

Abstract: Assessing artistic creativity is foundational to creativity research and arts education, yet manual scoring (e.g., Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking) is labor-intensive at scale. Prior machine-learning approaches show promise for visual creativity scoring, but many rely mainly on image features and provide limited or no explanatory feedback. We propose a framework for automated creativity assessment of human paintings by fine-tuning the vision-language model Qwen2-VL-7B with multi-task learning. Our dataset contains 1000 human-created paintings scored on a 1-100 scale and paired with a short human-written description (content or artist explanation). Two expert raters evaluated each work using a five-dimension rubric (originality, color, texture, composition, content) and provided written critiques; we use an 80/20 train-test split. We add a lightweight regression head on the visual encoder output so the model can predict a numerical score and generate rubric-aligned feedback in a single forward pass. By embedding the structured rubric and the artwork description in the system prompt, we constrain the generated text to match the quantitative prediction. Experiments show strong accuracy, achieving Pearson r > 0.97 and MAE about 3.95 on the 100-point scale. Qualitative evaluation indicates the generated feedback is semantically close to expert critiques (average SBERT cosine similarity = 0.798). The proposed approach bridges computer vision and art assessment and offers a scalable tool for creativity research and classroom feedback.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Visual Para-Thinker, a parallel reasoning framework for MLLMs, addressing limitations of depth-based scaling by leveraging visual partitioning and parallel thinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome plateaus in exploration caused by vertical scaling in LLMs and extend parallel reasoning benefits to the visual domain.

Method: Proposes two visual partitioning strategies, integrates Pa-Attention with LPRoPE for path independence and diversity, and implements high-efficiency parallel processing via vLLM.

Result: Achieves success on benchmarks like V*, CountBench, RefCOCO, and HallusionBench, validating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Visual Para-Thinker effectively brings parallel reasoning to multimodal LLMs, enhancing exploration and diversity in visual tasks.

Abstract: Existing LLM test-time scaling laws emphasize the emergence of self-reflective behaviors through extended reasoning length. Nevertheless, this vertical scaling strategy often encounters plateaus in exploration as the model becomes locked into specific thinking pattern. By shifting from depth to parallelism, parallel thinking mitigates the narrowing of exploration. However, the extension of this paradigm to visual domain remains an open research question. In this paper, we first examine the role of visual partitioning in parallelized reasoning and subsequently propose two distinct strategies. Based on the above, we introduce Visual Para-Thinker, representing the inaugural parallel reasoning framework for MLLMs. To maintain path independence and promote diversity in reasoning, our approach integrates Pa-Attention alongside LPRoPE. Leveraging the vLLM framework, we have developed a native multimodal implementation that facilitates high-efficiency parallel processing. Empirical results on benchmark datasets such as V*, CountBench, RefCOCO, and HallusionBench confirm that Visual Para-Thinker successfully extends the benefits of parallel reasoning to the visual domain.

*Heng Zhao,Yew-Soon Ong,Joey Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASTG framework leverages multimodal LLMs with specialized agents for spatio-temporal video grounding, achieving superior performance with minimal supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing STVG methods suffer from redundant computation, heavy supervision, and limited generalization due to frame-wise localization. Weakly-supervised variants reduce annotation costs but remain dataset-dependent.

Method: ASTG introduces Spatial Reasoning Agent (SRA) and Temporal Reasoning Agent (TRA) built on MLLMs. It follows a propose-and-evaluate paradigm to automate tube extraction and verification.

Result: ASTG outperforms weakly-supervised and zero-shot methods and matches some fully-supervised approaches on benchmarks.

Conclusion: ASTG offers a training-free, open-world solution for STVG, enhancing retrieval efficiency and reducing supervision needs.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to retrieve the spatio-temporal tube of a target object or person in a video given a text query. Most existing approaches perform frame-wise spatial localization within a predicted temporal span, resulting in redundant computation, heavy supervision requirements, and limited generalization. Weakly-supervised variants mitigate annotation costs but remain constrained by the dataset-level train-and-fit paradigm with an inferior performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Agentic Spatio-Temporal Grounder (ASTG) framework for the task of STVG towards an open-world and training-free scenario. Specifically, two specialized agents SRA (Spatial Reasoning Agent) and TRA (Temporal Reasoning Agent) constructed leveraging on modern Multimoal Large Language Models (MLLMs) work collaboratively to retrieve the target tube in an autonomous and self-guided manner. Following a propose-and-evaluation paradigm, ASTG duly decouples spatio-temporal reasoning and automates the tube extraction, verification and temporal localization processes. With a dedicate visual memory and dialogue context, the retrieval efficiency is significantly enhanced. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach where it outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot approaches by a margin and is comparable to some of the fully-supervised methods.

*Emily Bejerano,Federico Tondolo,Aayan Qayyum,Xiaofan Yu,Xiaofan Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sim2Radar is a framework that synthesizes radar data from RGB images to overcome the scarcity of annotated radar datasets, improving radar perception through physics-based simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity and high cost of collecting and annotating large-scale radar datasets hinder learning-based radar perception, especially in visually degraded indoor environments.

Method: Sim2Radar reconstructs material-aware 3D scenes from RGB images using depth estimation, segmentation, and vision-language reasoning, then simulates mmWave propagation with a physics-based ray tracer.

Result: Pre-training a radar detection model on synthetic data and fine-tuning on real data improves 3D object detection by up to +3.7 AP (IoU 0.3), with better spatial localization.

Conclusion: Physics-based, vision-driven radar simulation can provide geometric priors for radar learning and enhance performance when real-data supervision is limited.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar provides reliable perception in visually degraded indoor environments (e.g., smoke, dust, and low light), but learning-based radar perception is bottlenecked by the scarcity and cost of collecting and annotating large-scale radar datasets. We present Sim2Radar, an end-to-end framework that synthesizes training radar data directly from single-view RGB images, enabling scalable data generation without manual scene modeling. Sim2Radar reconstructs a material-aware 3D scene by combining monocular depth estimation, segmentation, and vision-language reasoning to infer object materials, then simulates mmWave propagation with a configurable physics-based ray tracer using Fresnel reflection models parameterized by ITU-R electromagnetic properties. Evaluated on real-world indoor scenes, Sim2Radar improves downstream 3D radar perception via transfer learning: pre-training a radar point-cloud object detection model on synthetic data and fine-tuning on real radar yields up to +3.7 3D AP (IoU 0.3), with gains driven primarily by improved spatial localization. These results suggest that physics-based, vision-driven radar simulation can provide effective geometric priors for radar learning and measurably improve performance under limited real-data supervision.

### [18] [IDPruner: Harmonizing Importance and Diversity in Visual Token Pruning for MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13315)
*Yifan Tan,Yifu Sun,Shirui Huang,Hong Liu,Guanghua Yu,Jianchen Zhu,Yangdong Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDPruner balances token importance and diversity for efficient MLLM inference, achieving high performance retention even under extreme pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational bottlenecks in MLLMs by optimizing visual token pruning.

Method: Uses Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) to balance token importance and diversity.

Result: Retains 95.18% performance at 75% pruning and 86.40% at 90% pruning.

Conclusion: IDPruner is effective and compatible with efficient deployment methods like FlashAttention.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet they encounter significant computational bottlenecks due to the massive volume of visual tokens. Consequently, visual token pruning, which substantially reduces the token count, has emerged as a critical technique for accelerating MLLM inference. Existing approaches focus on token importance, diversity, or an intuitive combination of both, without a principled framework for their optimal integration. To address this issue, we first conduct a systematic analysis to characterize the trade-off between token importance and semantic diversity. Guided by this analysis, we propose the \textbf{I}mportance and \textbf{D}iversity Pruner (\textbf{IDPruner}), which leverages the Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm to achieve a Pareto-optimal balance between these two objectives. Crucially, our method operates without requiring attention maps, ensuring full compatibility with FlashAttention and efficient deployment via one-shot pruning. We conduct extensive experiments across various model architectures and multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating that IDPruner achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior generalization across diverse architectures and tasks. Notably, on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, IDPruner retains 95.18\% of baseline performance when pruning 75\% of the tokens, and still maintains 86.40\% even under an extreme 90\% pruning ratio.

*Datorien L. Anderson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The abstract introduces the PSI dataset to test topological invariance in vision models and shows the Eidos architecture excels in accuracy and zero-shot transfer, supporting the 'Form-First' hypothesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to isolate topological invariance from textural correlations in vision benchmarks, addressing limitations in standard datasets.

Method: The method involves creating the PSI dataset with three diagnostic probes: polygon classification, zero-shot font transfer, and geometric collapse mapping, tested using the Eidos architecture.

Result: Results show >99% accuracy on PSI and 81.67% zero-shot transfer across 30 unseen typefaces, validating geometric integrity over statistical scale.

Conclusion: The conclusion supports the 'Form-First' hypothesis, emphasizing geometric integrity as key for generalization in structurally constrained architectures.

Abstract: We present the PolyShapes-Ideal (PSI) dataset, a suite of diagnostic benchmarks designed to isolate topological invariance -- the ability to maintain structural identity across affine transformations -- from the textural correlations that dominate standard vision benchmarks. Through three diagnostic probes (polygon classification under noise, zero-shot font transfer from MNIST, and geometric collapse mapping under progressive deformation), we demonstrate that the Eidos architecture achieves >99% accuracy on PSI and 81.67% zero-shot transfer across 30 unseen typefaces without pre-training. These results validate the "Form-First" hypothesis: generalization in structurally constrained architectures is a property of geometric integrity, not statistical scale.

*Jesse Barkley,Abraham George,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical, zero-shot framework combines lightweight object detection with compact VLMs for edge robotics in military environments, achieving high accuracy in tasks like false-positive filtering and damage assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges of scarce training data and computational limits in edge robotics for military use.

Method: Uses Grounding DINO for high-recall region proposals and VLMs (Qwen, Gemma) for semantic verification, tested on synthetic Battlefield 6 videos.

Result: Achieves up to 100% accuracy in false-positive filtering, 97.5% in damage assessment, and 55-90% in vehicle classification. Also demonstrates effective agentic workflow with high reasoning scores.

Conclusion: Validates hierarchical zero-shot architectures for edge autonomy and provides a diagnostic framework for VLM suitability in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Deploying autonomous edge robotics in dynamic military environments is constrained by both scarce domain-specific training data and the computational limits of edge hardware. This paper introduces a hierarchical, zero-shot framework that cascades lightweight object detection with compact Vision-Language Models (VLMs) from the Qwen and Gemma families (4B-12B parameters). Grounding DINO serves as a high-recall, text-promptable region proposer, and frames with high detection confidence are passed to edge-class VLMs for semantic verification. We evaluate this pipeline on 55 high-fidelity synthetic videos from Battlefield 6 across three tasks: false-positive filtering (up to 100% accuracy), damage assessment (up to 97.5%), and fine-grained vehicle classification (55-90%). We further extend the pipeline into an agentic Scout-Commander workflow, achieving 100% correct asset deployment and a 9.8/10 reasoning score (graded by GPT-4o) with sub-75-second latency. A novel "Controlled Input" methodology decouples perception from reasoning, revealing distinct failure phenotypes: Gemma3-12B excels at tactical logic but fails in visual perception, while Gemma3-4B exhibits reasoning collapse even with accurate inputs. These findings validate hierarchical zero-shot architectures for edge autonomy and provide a diagnostic framework for certifying VLM suitability in safety-critical applications.

*Xirui Hu,Yanbo Ding,Jiahao Wang,Tingting Shi,Yali Wang,Guo Zhi Zhi,Weizhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionWeaver introduces unified motion representations and a 4D-anchored paradigm to address multi-humanoid image animation challenges, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are limited to single-human settings and struggle with diverse humanoid forms, interactions, and occlusions in multi-humanoid scenarios.

Method: MotionWeaver uses identity-agnostic motion representations and a shared 4D space with hierarchical supervision to handle interactions and occlusions.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods on a curated benchmark and generalizes well across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: MotionWeaver advances multi-humanoid image animation by effectively addressing generalization and interaction challenges.

Abstract: Character image animation, which synthesizes videos of reference characters driven by pose sequences, has advanced rapidly but remains largely limited to single-human settings. Existing methods struggle to generalize to multi-humanoid scenarios, which involve diverse humanoid forms, complex interactions, and frequent occlusions. We address this gap with two key innovations. First, we introduce unified motion representations that extract identity-agnostic motions and explicitly bind them to corresponding characters, enabling generalization across diverse humanoid forms and seamless extension to multi-humanoid scenarios. Second, we propose a holistic 4D-anchored paradigm that constructs a shared 4D space to fuse motion representations with video latents, and further reinforces this process with hierarchical 4D-level supervision to better handle interactions and occlusions. We instantiate these ideas in MotionWeaver, an end-to-end framework for multi-humanoid image animation. To support this setting, we curate a 46-hour dataset of multi-human videos with rich interactions, and construct a 300-video benchmark featuring paired humanoid characters. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that MotionWeaver not only achieves state-of-the-art results on our benchmark but also generalizes effectively across diverse humanoid forms, complex interactions, and challenging multi-humanoid scenarios.

TL;DR: HiST-VLA improves autonomous driving by enhancing spatial-temporal reasoning and computational efficiency through hierarchical planning and dynamic token sparsification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of Vision-Language-Action models in safety-critical scenarios, such as imprecise numerical reasoning and weak 3D spatial awareness.

Method: Integrate geometric awareness, fine-grained driving commands, and state history prompting. Use dynamic token sparsification and hierarchical transformer-based planner.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on NAVSIM v2 benchmark (EPDMS of 88.6 on Navtest, 50.9 on Navhard).

Conclusion: HiST-VLA reliably generates trajectories, overcoming VLA model limitations for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer promising capabilities for autonomous driving through multimodal understanding. However, their utilization in safety-critical scenarios is constrained by inherent limitations, including imprecise numerical reasoning, weak 3D spatial awareness, and high sensitivity to context. To address these challenges, we propose HiST-VLA, a novel Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal VLA model designed for reliable trajectory generation.
  Our framework enhances 3D spatial and temporal reasoning by integrating geometric awareness with fine-grained driving commands and state history prompting. To ensure computational efficiency, we integrate dynamic token sparsification into the VLA architecture. This approach fuses redundant tokens rather than filtering them, effectively reducing redundancy without sacrificing model performance. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical transformer-based planner to progressively refine coarse VLA waypoints into fine-grained trajectories. Crucially, the planner utilizes dynamic latent regularization to incorporate language commands, ensuring strict spatial grounding and temporal coherence. Extensive evaluation on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Navtest, achieving an EPDMS of 88.6, and EPDMS of 50.9 on pseudo closed-loop Navhard benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedScope introduces a tool-using clinical video reasoning model for accurate, evidence-grounded predictions in long-form videos, optimized with GA-GRPO and tested on ClinVideoSuite.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models lack iterative, temporally targeted evidence grounding in clinical videos, limiting accuracy and trustworthiness.

Method: Proposes MedScope, a coarse-to-fine reasoning model with tool calls and verification, trained using GA-GRPO on ClinVideoSuite.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in in-domain and out-of-domain video understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: MedScope enhances medical AI by enabling tool-integrated reasoning for evidence-based predictions.

Abstract: Long-form clinical videos are central to visual evidence-based decision-making, with growing importance for applications such as surgical robotics and related settings. However, current multimodal large language models typically process videos with passive sampling or weakly grounded inspection, which limits their ability to iteratively locate, verify, and justify predictions with temporally targeted evidence. To close this gap, we propose MedScope, a tool-using clinical video reasoning model that performs coarse-to-fine evidence seeking over long-form procedures. By interleaving intermediate reasoning with targeted tool calls and verification on retrieved observations, MedScope produces more accurate and trustworthy predictions that are explicitly grounded in temporally localized visual evidence. To address the lack of high-fidelity supervision, we build ClinVideoSuite, an evidence-centric, fine-grained clinical video suite. We then optimize MedScope with Grounding-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GA-GRPO), which directly reinforces tool use with grounding-aligned rewards and evidence-weighted advantages. On full and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, MedScope achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely "think with videos" through tool-integrated reasoning. We will release our code, models, and data.

TL;DR: A collaborative inference framework combines lightweight edge ViT with near-edge expert ViTs, using dynamic routing and progressive training to improve accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers (ViTs) face challenges in edge deployment due to computational complexity, while cloud offloading introduces latency. The aim is to balance accuracy and efficiency by leveraging collaborative inference.

Method: Proposes a framework with a lightweight generalist ViT on the edge and medium-sized expert ViTs on near-edge accelerators. Uses Top-k predictions for dynamic expert selection and progressive training for expert specialization.

Result: Achieves 4.12% higher accuracy on target subsets, 2.76% overall accuracy improvement, 45% latency reduction, and 46% energy savings compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances accuracy and efficiency for ViT deployment on edge devices, demonstrating significant improvements in performance and resource usage.

Abstract: Deploying Vision Transformers on edge devices is challenging due to their high computational complexity, while full offloading to cloud resources presents significant latency overheads. We propose a novel collaborative inference framework, which orchestrates a lightweight generalist ViT on an edge device and multiple medium-sized expert ViTs on a near-edge accelerator. A novel routing mechanism uses the edge model's Top-$\mathit{k}$ predictions to dynamically select the most relevant expert for samples with low confidence. We further design a progressive specialist training strategy to enhance expert accuracy on dataset subsets. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset using a real-world edge and near-edge testbed demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Specifically, the proposed training strategy improves expert specialization accuracy by 4.12% on target subsets and enhances overall accuracy by 2.76% over static experts. Moreover, our method reduces latency by up to 45% compared to edge execution, and energy consumption by up to 46% compared to just near-edge offload.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate diagnosis of meningiomas is crucial for treatment and prognosis, especially given the variability in their biological behavior and treatment response based on grade.

Method: A feature fusion architecture with adaptive weights for different frequency band and spatial domain information, validated on a new MRI dataset and compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing methods across three datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in meningioma classification.

Conclusion: The adaptive feature fusion approach enhances classification performance, highlighting its potential for improving meningioma diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: The biological behavior and treatment response of meningiomas depend on their grade, making an accurate diagnosis essential for treatment planning and prognosis assessment. We observed that the weighted fusion of spatial-frequency domain features significantly influences meningioma classification performance. Notably, the contribution of specific frequency bands obtained by discrete wavelet transform varies considerably across different images. A feature fusion architecture with adaptive weights of different frequency band information and spatial domain information is proposed for few-shot meningioma learning. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a new MRI dataset of meningiomas is introduced. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with existing state-of-the-art methods in three datasets.

*Lishan Sun,Yujia Cheng,Pengfei Cui,Lei Han,Mohamed Abdel-Aty,Yunhan Zheng,Xingchen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study uses semantic segmentation and machine learning to analyze how visual environmental features, like greenery, causally impact regional traffic crashes, finding greenery significantly reduces crashes, especially in dense urban areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current traffic safety models ignore drivers' visual perception, which impacts crashes. The study aims to quantify causal effects of visual features like greenery on crashes.

Method: Applied semantic segmentation on Google Street View images to extract features, used Double Machine Learning for causality, SHAP for nonlinear influences, and causal forests for conditional effects.

Result: Greenery has a significant negative effect on crashes (Average Treatment Effect = -6.38, p = 0.005), especially in dense urban areas, but limited protection for vulnerable road users.

Conclusion: Greening is a viable safety intervention, but designs need optimization to better protect vulnerable road users, highlighting spatial heterogeneity in effects.

Abstract: Macroscopic traffic safety modeling aims to identify critical risk factors for regional crashes, thereby informing targeted policy interventions for safety improvement. However, current approaches rely heavily on static sociodemographic and infrastructure metrics, frequently overlooking the impacts from drivers' visual perception of driving environment. Although visual environment features have been found to impact driving and traffic crashes, existing evidence remains largely observational, failing to establish the robust causality for traffic policy evaluation under complex spatial environment. To fill these gaps, we applied semantic segmentation on Google Street View imageries to extract visual environmental features and proposed a Double Machine Learning framework to quantify their causal effects on regional crashes. Meanwhile, we utilized SHAP values to characterize the nonlinear influence mechanisms of confounding variables in the models and applied causal forests to estimate conditional average treatment effects. Leveraging crash records from the Miami metropolitan area, Florida, and 220,000 street view images, evidence shows that greenery proportion exerts a significant and robust negative causal effect on traffic crashes (Average Treatment Effect = -6.38, p = 0.005). This protective effect exhibits spatial heterogeneity, being most pronounced in densely populated and socially vulnerable urban cores. While greenery significantly mitigates angle and rear-end crashes, its protective benefit for vulnerable road users (VRUs) remains limited. Our findings provide causal evidence for greening as a potential safety intervention, prioritizing hazardous visual environments while highlighting the need for distinct design optimizations to protect VRUs.

Abstract: We present FireRed-Image-Edit, a diffusion transformer for instruction-based image editing that achieves state-of-the-art performance through systematic optimization of data curation, training methodology, and evaluation design. We construct a 1.6B-sample training corpus, comprising 900M text-to-image and 700M image editing pairs from diverse sources. After rigorous cleaning, stratification, auto-labeling, and two-stage filtering, we retain over 100M high-quality samples balanced between generation and editing, ensuring strong semantic coverage and instruction alignment. Our multi-stage training pipeline progressively builds editing capability via pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. To improve data efficiency, we introduce a Multi-Condition Aware Bucket Sampler for variable-resolution batching and Stochastic Instruction Alignment with dynamic prompt re-indexing. To stabilize optimization and enhance controllability, we propose Asymmetric Gradient Optimization for DPO, DiffusionNFT with layout-aware OCR rewards for text editing, and a differentiable Consistency Loss for identity preservation. We further establish REDEdit-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 15 editing categories, including newly introduced beautification and low-level enhancement tasks. Extensive experiments on REDEdit-Bench and public benchmarks (ImgEdit and GEdit) demonstrate competitive or superior performance against both open-source and proprietary systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated warehouses need to anticipate bin layouts after stow operations to optimize planning and execution.

Method: FOREST uses item-aligned instance masks and a latent diffusion transformer to predict post-stow configurations from observed context.

Result: FOREST improves geometric agreement with true layouts and shows modest performance loss in downstream tasks like load-quality assessment.

Conclusion: FOREST provides reliable foresight for warehouse planning, demonstrating practical value in real-world applications.

Abstract: Automated warehouses execute millions of stow operations, where robots place objects into storage bins. For these systems it is valuable to anticipate how a bin will look from the current observations and the planned stow behavior before real execution. We propose FOREST, a stow-intent-conditioned world model that represents bin states as item-aligned instance masks and uses a latent diffusion transformer to predict the post-stow configuration from the observed context. Our evaluation shows that FOREST substantially improves the geometric agreement between predicted and true post-stow layouts compared with heuristic baselines. We further evaluate the predicted post-stow layouts in two downstream tasks, in which replacing the real post-stow masks with FOREST predictions causes only modest performance loss in load-quality assessment and multi-stow reasoning, indicating that our model can provide useful foresight signals for warehouse planning.

Conclusion: The pipeline successfully blends efficiency and human oversight, enhancing scalability and quality in marketing image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have made significant strides, producing impressive results in generating images from textual descriptions. However, creating a scalable pipeline for deploying these models in production remains a challenge. Achieving the right balance between automation and human feedback is critical to maintain both scale and quality. While automation can handle large volumes, human oversight is still an essential component to ensure that the generated images meet the desired standards and are aligned with the creative vision. This paper presents a new pipeline that offers a fully automated, scalable solution for generating marketing images of commercial products using text-to-image models. The proposed system maintains the quality and fidelity of images, while also introducing sufficient creative variation to adhere to marketing guidelines. By streamlining this process, we ensure a seamless blend of efficiency and human oversight, achieving a $30.77\%$ increase in marketing object fidelity using DINOV2 and a $52.00\%$ increase in human preference over the generated outcome.

Abstract: Automated image captioning using the content from the image is very appealing when done by harnessing the capability of computer vision and natural language processing. Extensive research has been done in the field with a major focus on the English language which gives the scope for further developments in the same with consideration of popular foreign languages. This research utilizes distinct models for translating the image caption into Hindi, the fourth most popular language across the world. Exploring the multi-modal architectures this research comprises local visual features, global visual features, attention mechanisms, and pre-trained models. Using google cloud translator on the image dataset from Flickr8k, Hindi image descriptions have been generated. Pre-trained CNNs like VGG16, ResNet50, and Inception V3 helped in retrieving image characteristics, while the uni-directional and bi-directional techniques of text encoding are used for the text encoding process.

*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu,Ben Lengerich,Ying Nian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaCorrection is an adaptive framework for efficient cache reuse in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), maintaining high fidelity while reducing computational costs during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs suffer from expensive inference due to iterative denoising, and prior cache reuse methods lead to quality degradation due to drift and misalignment.

Method: AdaCorrection uses lightweight spatio-temporal signals to estimate cache validity and adaptively blends cached and fresh activations per timestep.

Result: The method maintains near-original FID scores with minimal overhead, providing moderate acceleration and improved generation quality.

Conclusion: AdaCorrection effectively balances efficiency and fidelity in DiTs, demonstrating consistent performance gains across benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity image and video generation but suffer from expensive inference due to their iterative denoising structure. While prior methods accelerate sampling by caching intermediate features, they rely on static reuse schedules or coarse-grained heuristics, which often lead to temporal drift and cache misalignment that significantly degrade generation quality. We introduce \textbf{AdaCorrection}, an adaptive offset cache correction framework that maintains high generation fidelity while enabling efficient cache reuse across Transformer layers during diffusion inference. At each timestep, AdaCorrection estimates cache validity with lightweight spatio-temporal signals and adaptively blends cached and fresh activations. This correction is computed on-the-fly without additional supervision or retraining. Our approach achieves strong generation quality with minimal computational overhead, maintaining near-original FID while providing moderate acceleration. Experiments on image and video diffusion benchmarks show that AdaCorrection consistently improves generation performance.

### [34] [An Online Reference-Free Evaluation Framework for Flowchart Image-to-Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13376)
*Giang Son Nguyen,Zi Pong Lim,Sarthak Ketanbhai Modi,Yon Shin Teo,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reference-free evaluation framework for flowchart image-to-code conversion using Vision-Language Models, introducing automated metrics Recall_OCR and Precision_VE for quality assessment without ground-truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing output quality in flowchart image-to-code conversion is challenging due to the lack of ground-truth data in production settings.

Method: The framework uses OCR for content coverage (Recall_OCR) and Visual Entailment for detecting hallucinations (Precision_VE), combining them into an F1 score (F1_OCR-VE).

Result: Validation shows strong agreement with ground-truth metrics (Pearson's r: 0.97, 0.91, 0.94 for Recall, Precision, F1), proving its reliability.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical, reference-free solution for continuous quality monitoring in production pipelines.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used in document processing pipelines to convert flowchart images into structured code (e.g., Mermaid). In production, these systems process arbitrary inputs for which no ground-truth code exists, making output quality difficult to assess. We propose a reference-free evaluation framework that monitors flowchart image-to-code generation quality at inference time, using only the input image and the generated output. The framework introduces two automated metrics: $\text{Recall}{\text{OCR}}$, which estimates content coverage by extracting text from the input image via OCR as a proxy reference, and $\text{Precision}{\text{VE}}$, which detects hallucinated elements through Visual Entailment against the original image. Their harmonic mean, $\text{F1}{\text{OCR-VE}}$, provides a unified quality score. Validation on the FlowVQA dataset shows strong agreement with ground-truth metrics (average Pearson's $r = 0.97$, $0.91$, and $0.94$ for Recall, Precision, and F1, respectively), confirming the framework's reliability as a practical, reference-free alternative for continuous quality monitoring in production settings.

### [35] [LAF-YOLOv10 with Partial Convolution Backbone, Attention-Guided Feature Pyramid, Auxiliary P2 Head, and Wise-IoU Loss for Small Object Detection in Drone Aerial Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13378)
*Sohail Ali Farooqui,Zuhair Ahmed Khan Taha,Mohammed Mudassir Uddin,Shahnawaz Alam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAF-YOLOv10, an improved YOLOv10-based detector, addresses UAV-specific challenges in aerial object detection through four integrated techniques, achieving higher accuracy and computational efficiency.



<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current aerial object detectors struggle with UAV-specific issues like tiny targets, cluttered backgrounds, occlusion, and limited onboard computation. This study aims to enhance small-object detection in drone imagery.


Method: LAF-YOLOv10 incorporates four techniques: Partial Convolution C2f (PC-C2f) for computation reduction, Attention-Guided Feature Pyramid Network (AG-FPN) for refined feature fusion, an auxiliary P2 head for detecting tiny objects, and Wise-IoU v3 for stable bounding box regression.


Result: The model achieves 35.1% mAP@0.5 on VisDrone-DET2019 and 35.8% on UAVDT, outperforming YOLOv10n by 3.3 points. It runs at 24.3 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, proving its feasibility for UAV deployment.


Conclusion: LAF-YOLOv10 effectively integrates existing techniques within YOLOv10 to address UAV-specific detection challenges, demonstrating improved performance and computational efficiency for embedded systems.


Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles serve as primary sensing platforms for surveillance, traffic monitoring, and disaster response, making aerial object detection a central problem in applied computer vision. Current detectors struggle with UAV-specific challenges: targets spanning only a few pixels, cluttered backgrounds, heavy occlusion, and strict onboard computational budgets. This study introduces LAF-YOLOv10, built on YOLOv10n, integrating four complementary techniques to improve small-object detection in drone imagery. A Partial Convolution C2f (PC-C2f) module restricts spatial convolution to one quarter of backbone channels, reducing redundant computation while preserving discriminative capacity. An Attention-Guided Feature Pyramid Network (AG-FPN) inserts Squeeze-and-Excitation channel gates before multi-scale fusion and replaces nearest-neighbor upsampling with DySample for content-aware interpolation. An auxiliary P2 detection head at 160$\times$160 resolution extends localization to objects below 8$\times$8 pixels, while the P5 head is removed to redistribute parameters. Wise-IoU v3 replaces CIoU for bounding box regression, attenuating gradients from noisy annotations in crowded aerial scenes. The four modules address non-overlapping bottlenecks: PC-C2f compresses backbone computation, AG-FPN refines cross-scale fusion, the P2 head recovers spatial resolution, and Wise-IoU stabilizes regression under label noise. No individual component is novel; the contribution is the joint integration within a single YOLOv10 framework. Across three training runs (seeds 42, 123, 256), LAF-YOLOv10 achieves 35.1$\pm$0.3\% mAP@0.5 on VisDrone-DET2019 with 2.3\,M parameters, exceeding YOLOv10n by 3.3 points. Cross-dataset evaluation on UAVDT yields 35.8$\pm$0.4\% mAP@0.5. Benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano confirm 24.3 FPS at FP16, demonstrating viability for embedded UAV deployment.

*Ha-Hieu Pham,Hai-Dang Nguyen,Thanh-Huy Nguyen,Min Xu,Ulas Bagci,Trung-Nghia Le,Huy-Hieu Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Chest X-ray classification due to long-tailed distributions and missing annotations, proposing solutions for long-tailed multi-label learning and zero-shot OOD recognition, achieving top performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical CXR classification faces issues like long-tailed disease distributions and missing annotations for rare findings, prompting the need for robust solutions.

Method: Imbalance-aware multi-label learning for Task 1; a prediction approach for zero-shot OOD recognition in Task 2 without using OOD class labels/examples.

Result: Achieves strong performance, ranking first in the challenge's development phase with macro-averaged mAP.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively tackle the challenges, offering practical solutions for real-world CXR classification.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) classification in clinical practice is often limited by imperfect supervision, arising from (i) extreme long-tailed multi-label disease distributions and (ii) missing annotations for rare or previously unseen findings. The CXR-LT 2026 challenge addresses these issues on a PadChest-based benchmark with a 36-class label space split into 30 in-distribution classes for training and 6 out-of-distribution (OOD) classes for zero-shot evaluation. We present task-specific solutions tailored to the distinct supervision regimes. For Task 1 (long-tailed multi-label classification), we adopt an imbalance-aware multi-label learning strategy to improve recognition of tail classes while maintaining stable performance on frequent findings. For Task 2 (zero-shot OOD recognition), we propose a prediction approach that produces scores for unseen disease categories without using any supervised labels or examples from the OOD classes during training. Evaluated with macro-averaged mean Average Precision (mAP), our method achieves strong performance on both tasks, ranking first on the public leaderboard of the development phase.

*Sebastian-Ion Nae,Mihai-Eugen Barbu,Sebastian Mocanu,Marius Leordeanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an indoor UAV video dataset for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) and benchmarks three replay-based CIL strategies under tight memory budgets, showing Forgetting-Aware Replay (FAR) as the most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents like indoor drones need to learn new object classes in real-time while avoiding catastrophic forgetting, yet existing UAV datasets lack temporally coherent indoor videos.

Method: The authors present a dataset of 14,400 frames with semi-automatic annotations and benchmark ER, MIR, and FAR using YOLOv11-nano for resource-efficient detection.

Result: FAR outperforms other methods under 5-10% replay budgets, achieving 82.96% average accuracy. Grad-CAM reveals attention shifts affecting drone localization.

Conclusion: Replay-based continual learning is viable for edge aerial systems, and the work provides a valuable indoor UAV dataset and CIL evaluation under limited replay budgets.

Abstract: Autonomous agents such as indoor drones must learn new object classes in real-time while limiting catastrophic forgetting, motivating Class-Incremental Learning (CIL). However, most unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) datasets focus on outdoor scenes and offer limited temporally coherent indoor videos. We introduce an indoor dataset of $14,400$ frames capturing inter-drone and ground vehicle footage, annotated via a semi-automatic workflow with a $98.6\%$ first-pass labeling agreement before final manual verification. Using this dataset, we benchmark 3 replay-based CIL strategies: Experience Replay (ER), Maximally Interfered Retrieval (MIR), and Forgetting-Aware Replay (FAR), using YOLOv11-nano as a resource-efficient detector for deployment-constrained UAV platforms. Under tight memory budgets ($5-10\%$ replay), FAR performs better than the rest, achieving an average accuracy (ACC, $mAP_{50-95}$ across increments) of $82.96\%$ with $5\%$ replay. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) analysis shows attention shifts across classes in mixed scenes, which is associated with reduced localization quality for drones. The experiments further demonstrate that replay-based continual learning can be effectively applied to edge aerial systems. Overall, this work contributes an indoor UAV video dataset with preserved temporal coherence and an evaluation of replay-based CIL under limited replay budgets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid architecture balances high-resolution OCR for text recognition and low-resolution video streaming for visual context in Video LLMs, reducing power consumption by 0.49x while maintaining 72% accuracy in Text VQA tasks on wearables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying Text VQA on wearable devices, where high-resolution video drains battery and existing models struggle with temporal coherence in real-time streams.

Method: Use a hybrid architecture that selectively performs high-resolution OCR on-device and streams low-resolution video for visual context, leveraging asymmetric resolution needs of text recognition and scene understanding.

Result: Achieves 72% accuracy at 0.49x the power consumption of full-resolution streaming, enabling sustained VQA sessions on wearables without compromising text understanding.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively resolves the tension between resolution and power constraints, enhancing the practicality of Video LLMs on resource-constrained wearables.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in understanding and reasoning about visual content, particularly in tasks involving text recognition and text-based visual question answering (Text VQA). However, deploying Text VQA on wearable devices faces a fundamental tension: text recognition requires high-resolution video, but streaming high-quality video drains battery and causes thermal throttling. Moreover, existing models struggle to maintain coherent temporal context when processing text across multiple frames in real-time streams. We observe that text recognition and visual reasoning have asymmetric resolution requirements - OCR needs fine detail while scene understanding tolerates coarse features. We exploit this asymmetry with a hybrid architecture that performs selective high-resolution OCR on-device while streaming low-resolution video for visual context. On a benchmark of text-based VQA samples across five task categories, our system achieves 72% accuracy at 0.49x the power consumption of full-resolution streaming, enabling sustained VQA sessions on resource-constrained wearables without sacrificing text understanding quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates seven video foundation models (VFMs) for Parkinson's disease (PD) screening using a large dataset of 32,847 videos from 1,888 participants. Findings show model-dependent task saliency, with varying performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the effectiveness of different VFM architectures for PD screening and establish benchmarks for remote neurological monitoring.

Method: Analyzed seven VFMs (e.g., VideoPrism, V-JEPA) on a dataset of 16 standardized clinical tasks using frozen embeddings and linear classification.

Result: Model performance varied by task: VideoPrism excelled in facial expressivity, V-JEPA in upper-limb tasks, and TimeSformer in rhythmic tasks. AUCs ranged 76.4-85.3%, with high specificity (90.3%) but lower sensitivity (43.2-57.3%).

Conclusion: VFMs show promise for PD screening but require task-aware calibration and multimodal integration. This study provides a baseline and roadmap for future work.

Abstract: Remote, video-based assessments offer a scalable pathway for Parkinson's disease (PD) screening. While traditional approaches rely on handcrafted features mimicking clinical scales, recent advances in video foundation models (VFMs) enable representation learning without task-specific customization. However, the comparative effectiveness of different VFM architectures across diverse clinical tasks remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale systematic study using a novel video dataset from 1,888 participants (727 with PD), comprising 32,847 videos across 16 standardized clinical tasks. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art VFMs -- including VideoPrism, V-JEPA, ViViT, and VideoMAE -- to determine their robustness in clinical screening. By evaluating frozen embeddings with a linear classification head, we demonstrate that task saliency is highly model-dependent: VideoPrism excels in capturing visual speech kinematics (no audio) and facial expressivity, while V-JEPA proves superior for upper-limb motor tasks. Notably, TimeSformer remains highly competitive for rhythmic tasks like finger tapping. Our experiments yield AUCs of 76.4-85.3% and accuracies of 71.5-80.6%. While high specificity (up to 90.3%) suggests strong potential for ruling out healthy individuals, the lower sensitivity (43.2-57.3%) highlights the need for task-aware calibration and integration of multiple tasks and modalities. Overall, this work establishes a rigorous baseline for VFM-based PD screening and provides a roadmap for selecting suitable tasks and architectures in remote neurological monitoring.

*Jintao Zhang,Kai Jiang,Chendong Xiang,Weiqi Feng,Yuezhou Hu,Haocheng Xi,Jianfei Chen,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free sparse attention methods accelerate diffusion models; trainable sparse attention improves sparsity and quality. SpargeAttention2 proposes hybrid masking, efficient implementation, and distillation-inspired fine-tuning to achieve 95% sparsity and 16.2x speedup without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance sparsity and generation quality in diffusion models by addressing failures of common masking rules (Top-k, Top-p), understanding trainable sparse attention's advantages, and resolving fine-tuning limitations.

Method: SpargeAttention2 introduces a hybrid masking rule (Top-k + Top-p), efficient trainable sparse attention implementation, and distillation-inspired fine-tuning objective.

Result: Achieves 95% attention sparsity and 16.2x speedup while preserving generation quality, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: SpargeAttention2 effectively combines robustness, efficiency, and quality preservation, advancing trainable sparse attention for diffusion models.

Abstract: Many training-free sparse attention methods are effective for accelerating diffusion models. Recently, several works suggest that making sparse attention trainable can further increase sparsity while preserving generation quality. We study three key questions: (1) when do the two common masking rules, i.e., Top-k and Top-p, fail, and how can we avoid these failures? (2) why can trainable sparse attention reach higher sparsity than training-free methods? (3) what are the limitations of fine-tuning sparse attention using the diffusion loss, and how can we address them? Based on this analysis, we propose SpargeAttention2, a trainable sparse attention method that achieves high sparsity without degrading generation quality. SpargeAttention2 includes (i) a hybrid masking rule that combines Top-k and Top-p for more robust masking at high sparsity, (ii) an efficient trainable sparse attention implementation, and (iii) a distillation-inspired fine-tuning objective to better preserve generation quality during fine-tuning using sparse attention. Experiments on video diffusion models show that SpargeAttention2 reaches 95% attention sparsity and a 16.2x attention speedup while maintaining generation quality, consistently outperforming prior sparse attention methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method integrating physically based rendering into 3D Gaussian Splatting to enhance nighttime scene reconstruction for autonomous driving, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nighttime driving scenes pose challenges due to complex lighting and appearance conditions, causing performance degradation in existing methods.

Method: The approach integrates physically based rendering into 3D Gaussian Splatting, jointly optimizing BRDF-based material properties and modeling diffuse and specular components explicitly.

Result: The method improves reconstruction quality for nighttime scenes while maintaining real-time rendering, validated on nuScenes and Waymo datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses nighttime scene reconstruction challenges, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This paper focuses on scene reconstruction under nighttime conditions in autonomous driving simulation. Recent methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved photorealistic modeling in autonomous driving scene reconstruction, but they primarily focus on normal-light conditions. Low-light driving scenes are more challenging to model due to their complex lighting and appearance conditions, which often causes performance degradation of existing methods. To address this problem, this work presents a novel approach that integrates physically based rendering into 3DGS to enhance nighttime scene reconstruction for autonomous driving. Specifically, our approach integrates physically based rendering into composite scene Gaussian representations and jointly optimizes Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) based material properties. We explicitly model diffuse components through a global illumination module and specular components by anisotropic spherical Gaussians. As a result, our approach improves reconstruction quality for outdoor nighttime driving scenes, while maintaining real-time rendering. Extensive experiments across diverse nighttime scenarios on two real-world autonomous driving datasets, including nuScenes and Waymo, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

*Song Wang,Lingling Li,Marcus Santos,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Privacy-Concealing Cooperation (PCC) framework is proposed for BEV semantic segmentation in autonomous driving to protect privacy while maintaining segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cooperative perception systems improve autonomous driving but risk privacy leakage from shared visual data. The goal is to prevent image reconstruction from shared features without compromising segmentation.

Method: The PCC framework uses a hiding network and adversarial learning to conceal visual clues in BEV features, integrated with a perception network for end-to-end optimization.

Result: Experimental results show PCC degrades image reconstruction quality minimally affecting segmentation, ensuring privacy protection.

Conclusion: The PCC framework balances privacy protection and segmentation performance in cooperative perception systems.

Abstract: Cooperative perception systems for autonomous driving aim to overcome the limited perception range of a single vehicle by communicating with adjacent agents to share sensing information. While this improves perception performance, these systems also face a significant privacy-leakage issue, as sensitive visual content can potentially be reconstructed from the shared data. In this paper, we propose a novel Privacy-Concealing Cooperation (PCC) framework for Bird's Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation. Based on commonly shared BEV features, we design a hiding network to prevent an image reconstruction network from recovering the input images from the shared features. An adversarial learning mechanism is employed to train the network, where the hiding network works to conceal the visual clues in the BEV features while the reconstruction network attempts to uncover these clues. To maintain segmentation performance, the perception network is integrated with the hiding network and optimized end-to-end. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PCC framework effectively degrades the quality of the reconstructed images with minimal impact on segmentation performance, providing privacy protection for cooperating vehicles. The source code will be made publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: Diff-Aid is a lightweight method for improving text-to-image diffusion models by dynamically adjusting text-image interactions across blocks and timesteps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models struggle with complex textual descriptions due to insufficient flexibility in text-image interactions.

Method: Diff-Aid adaptively adjusts per-token text and image interactions across transformer blocks and denoising stages.

Result: Experiments show Diff-Aid improves prompt adherence, visual quality, and human preference in models like SD 3.5 and FLUX.

Conclusion: Diff-Aid offers a plug-and-play solution for enhancing text-to-image models and provides interpretable insights into semantic alignment.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable advancement, yet faithfully following complex textual descriptions remains challenging due to insufficient interactions between textual and visual features. Prior approaches enhance such interactions via architectural design or handcrafted textual condition weighting, but lack flexibility and overlook the dynamic interactions across different blocks and denoising stages. To provide a more flexible and efficient solution to this problem, we propose Diff-Aid, a lightweight inference-time method that adaptively adjusts per-token text and image interactions across transformer blocks and denoising timesteps. Beyond improving generation quality, Diff-Aid yields interpretable modulation patterns that reveal how different blocks, timesteps, and textual tokens contribute to semantic alignment during denoising. As a plug-and-play module, Diff-Aid can be seamlessly integrated into downstream applications for further improvement, including style LoRAs, controllable generation, and zero-shot editing. Experiments on strong baselines (SD 3.5 and FLUX) demonstrate consistent improvements in prompt adherence, visual quality, and human preference across various metrics. Our code and models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by the human visual system's dual-stream processing for contextual and spatial understanding, TwInS aims to enhance simultaneous scene parsing and geometric vision tasks.

Method: TwInS uses a unified architecture where contextual features guide geometric refinement and geometric features enhance scene parsing via a cross-task adapter. It employs a semi-supervised training strategy to avoid reliance on annotated data.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show TwInS's superior performance over existing methods, validating its core components.

Conclusion: TwInS successfully integrates dual-task learning, demonstrates self-evolution potential, and achieves state-of-the-art results without expensive annotations.

Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system, which operates on two parallel yet interactive streams for contextual and spatial understanding, this article presents Two Interactive Streams (TwInS), a novel bio-inspired joint learning framework capable of simultaneously performing scene parsing and geometric vision tasks. TwInS adopts a unified, general-purpose architecture in which multi-level contextual features from the scene parsing stream are infused into the geometric vision stream to guide its iterative refinement. In the reverse direction, decoded geometric features are projected into the contextual feature space for selective heterogeneous feature fusion via a novel cross-task adapter, which leverages rich cross-view geometric cues to enhance scene parsing. To eliminate the dependence on costly human-annotated correspondence ground truth, TwInS is further equipped with a tailored semi-supervised training strategy, which unleashes the potential of large-scale multi-view data and enables continuous self-evolution without requiring ground-truth correspondences. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of TwInS's core components and demonstrate its superior performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches.

*Jiacheng Zhang,Feng Liu,Chao Du,Tianyu Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaVBoost is a token-level visual attention boosting framework that adaptively adjusts boosting intensity based on Visual Grounding Entropy (VGE) to reduce hallucinations in LVLMs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual attention boosting methods use predefined scaling, which can be ineffective or cause new hallucinations. AdaVBoost addresses this trade-off by dynamically adjusting boosting intensity.

Method: AdaVBoost introduces VGE to estimate hallucination risk and uses it to guide adaptive visual attention boosting at each generation step.

Result: AdaVBoost significantly outperforms baseline methods on multiple LVLMs and hallucination benchmarks.

Conclusion: AdaVBoost's adaptive approach effectively mitigates hallucinations in LVLMs by dynamically adjusting visual attention boosting.

Abstract: Visual attention boosting has emerged as a promising direction for mitigating hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where existing methods primarily focus on where to boost by applying a predefined scaling to the attention of method-specific visual tokens during autoregressive generation. In this paper, we identify a fundamental trade-off in these methods: a predefined scaling factor can be too weak at some generation steps, leaving hallucinations unresolved, yet too strong at others, leading to new hallucinations. Motivated by this finding, we propose AdaVBoost, a token-level visual attention boosting framework that adaptively determines how much attention to boost at each generation step. Specifically, we introduce Visual Grounding Entropy (VGE) to estimate hallucination risk, which leverages visual grounding as a complementary signal to capture evidence mismatches beyond entropy. Guided by VGE, AdaVBoost applies stronger visual attention boosting to high-risk tokens and weaker boosting to low-risk tokens, enabling token-level adaptive intervention at each generation step. Extensive experiments show that AdaVBoost significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple LVLMs and hallucination benchmarks.

TL;DR: REVISE is a multi-round agent for VQA that selects informative frames, maintains summaries, and stops early, improving accuracy while reducing resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance video question answering efficiency by focusing on sparse, informative frames and reducing computational overhead.

Method: REVISE selects key frames, maintains summaries, and uses EAGER for reinforcement fine-tuning with confidence gain, summary sufficiency, and correct-and-early-stop rewards.

Result: Improved accuracy with fewer frames, rounds, and prompt tokens across VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: REVISE demonstrates efficient sparse video reasoning, balancing performance and resource use.

Abstract: We present \revise (\underline{Re}asoning with \underline{Vi}deo \underline{S}parsity), a multi-round agent for video question answering (VQA). Instead of uniformly sampling frames, \revise selects a small set of informative frames, maintains a summary-as-state across rounds, and stops early when confident. It supports proprietary vision-language models (VLMs) in a ``plug-and-play'' setting and enables reinforcement fine-tuning for open-source models. For fine-tuning, we introduce EAGER (Evidence-Adjusted Gain for Efficient Reasoning), an annotation-free reward with three terms: (1) Confidence gain: after new frames are added, we reward the increase in the log-odds gap between the correct option and the strongest alternative; (2) Summary sufficiency: at answer time we re-ask using only the last committed summary and reward success; (3) Correct-and-early stop: answering correctly within a small turn budget is rewarded. Across multiple VQA benchmarks, \revise improves accuracy while reducing frames, rounds, and prompt tokens, demonstrating practical sparse video reasoning.

TL;DR: ZEN is a generalizable foundation model for surgical video understanding, trained on diverse data and outperforming existing models across multiple tasks and settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing variability in surgical perception and the lack of generalizable AI models in minimally invasive surgery.

Method: Trained ZEN on 4M+ frames from 21 procedures using self-supervised multi-teacher distillation. Evaluated multiple representation learning strategies.

Result: ZEN outperforms existing models in 20 downstream tasks, showing robust cross-procedure generalization.

Conclusion: ZEN advances unified surgical scene understanding, aiding intraoperative assistance and training assessment.

Abstract: In minimally invasive surgery, clinical decisions depend on real-time visual interpretation, yet intraoperative perception varies substantially across surgeons and procedures. This variability limits consistent assessment, training, and the development of reliable artificial intelligence systems, as most surgical AI models are designed for narrowly defined tasks and do not generalize across procedures or institutions. Here we introduce ZEN, a generalizable foundation model for intraoperative surgical video understanding trained on more than 4 million frames from over 21 procedures using a self-supervised multi-teacher distillation framework. We curated a large and diverse dataset and systematically evaluated multiple representation learning strategies within a unified benchmark. Across 20 downstream tasks and full fine-tuning, frozen-backbone, few-shot and zero-shot settings, ZEN consistently outperforms existing surgical foundation models and demonstrates robust cross-procedure generalization. These results suggest a step toward unified representations for surgical scene understanding and support future applications in intraoperative assistance and surgical training assessment.

TL;DR: DCDM is a framework addressing semantic, geometric, and identity consistency in video generation via dedicated components for intra-clip, inter-clip, and inter-shot challenges, validated on AAAI'26 data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inconsistencies in current video generative models regarding semantic, geometric, and identity coherence.

Method: Divides consistency modeling into intra-clip (language model parsing), inter-clip (camera representation), and inter-shot (scene generation) components, using a unified backbone.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on the AAAI'26 CVM Competition test set.

Conclusion: DCDM successfully tackles key video generation consistency challenges with a system-level approach.

Abstract: Recent video generative models have demonstrated impressive visual fidelity, yet they often struggle with semantic, geometric, and identity consistency. In this paper, we propose a system-level framework, termed the Divide-and-Conquer Diffusion Model (DCDM), to address three key challenges: (1) intra-clip world knowledge consistency, (2) inter-clip camera consistency, and (3) inter-shot element consistency. DCDM decomposes video consistency modeling under these scenarios into three dedicated components while sharing a unified video generation backbone. For intra-clip consistency, DCDM leverages a large language model to parse input prompts into structured semantic representations, which are subsequently translated into coherent video content by a diffusion transformer. For inter-clip camera consistency, we propose a temporal camera representation in the noise space that enables precise and stable camera motion control, along with a text-to-image initialization mechanism to further enhance controllability. For inter-shot consistency, DCDM adopts a holistic scene generation paradigm with windowed cross-attention and sparse inter-shot self-attention, ensuring long-range narrative coherence while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate our framework on the test set of the CVM Competition at AAAI'26, and the results demonstrate that the proposed strategies effectively address these challenges.

TL;DR: KorMedMCQA-V is a Korean multimodal medical QA benchmark with 1,534 questions and 2,043 images, evaluating 50+ VLMs. Top models achieve up to 96.9% accuracy, but Korean-specialized models lag. Reasoning variants outperform instruction-tuned ones, and multi-image questions challenge all models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on Korean medical licensing-exam-style questions, addressing multimodal reasoning needs.

Method: Constructed from Korean Medical Licensing Exams (2012-2023), the dataset includes 1,534 questions and 2,043 images across clinical modalities. Over 50 VLMs were benchmarked under zero-shot evaluation.

Result: Gemini-3.0-Pro (proprietary) scored 96.9%, Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking (open-source) 83.7%, and VARCO-VISION-2.0-14B (Korean-specialized) 43.2%. Reasoning variants and modality-specific performance variations were noted.

Conclusion: KorMedMCQA-V complements text-only benchmarks, revealing gaps in Korean-specialized models and challenges in multi-image reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce KorMedMCQA-V, a Korean medical licensing-exam-style multimodal multiple-choice question answering benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs). The dataset consists of 1,534 questions with 2,043 associated images from Korean Medical Licensing Examinations (2012-2023), with about 30% containing multiple images requiring cross-image evidence integration. Images cover clinical modalities including X-ray, computed tomography (CT), electrocardiography (ECG), ultrasound, endoscopy, and other medical visuals. We benchmark over 50 VLMs across proprietary and open-source categories-spanning general-purpose, medical-specialized, and Korean-specialized families-under a unified zero-shot evaluation protocol. The best proprietary model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) achieves 96.9% accuracy, the best open-source model (Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking) 83.7%, and the best Korean-specialized model (VARCO-VISION-2.0-14B) only 43.2%. We further find that reasoning-oriented model variants gain up to +20 percentage points over instruction-tuned counterparts, medical domain specialization yields inconsistent gains over strong general-purpose baselines, all models degrade on multi-image questions, and performance varies notably across imaging modalities. By complementing the text-only KorMedMCQA benchmark, KorMedMCQA-V forms a unified evaluation suite for Korean medical reasoning across text-only and multimodal conditions.

TL;DR: An RL-based method for personalized echocardiography view selection reduces acquisition time by 32% while maintaining diagnostic accuracy for heart failure assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To streamline POCUS workflows under time and effort constraints by optimizing view acquisition for heart failure diagnosis.

Method: Uses an RL agent to sequentially select views or terminate acquisition, followed by a multi-view transformer for multi-task inference (AS severity and LVEF) with uncertainty output.

Result: Achieves 77.2% mean balanced accuracy with 32% fewer videos, matching full-study performance.

Conclusion: Personalized, cost-aware acquisition improves efficiency without compromising diagnostic quality, with potential for broader cardiac applications.

Abstract: Purpose: Echocardiography with point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) must support clinical decision-making under tight bedside time and operator-effort constraints. We introduce a personalized data acquisition strategy in which an RL agent, given a partially observed multi-view study, selects the next view to acquire or terminates acquisition to support heart-failure (HF) assessment. Upon termination, a diagnostic model jointly predicts aortic stenosis (AS) severity and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), two key HF biomarkers, and outputs uncertainty, enabling an explicit trade-off between diagnostic performance and acquisition cost. Methods: We model POCUS as a sequential acquisition problem: at each step, a video selector (RL agent) chooses the next view to acquire or terminates acquisition. Upon termination, a shared multi-view transformer performs multi-task inference with two heads, ordinal AS classification, and LVEF regression, and outputs Gaussian predictive distributions yielding ordinal probabilities over AS classes and EF thresholds. These probabilities drive a reward that balances expected diagnostic benefit against acquisition cost, producing patient-specific acquisition pathways. Results: The dataset comprises 12,180 patient-level studies, split into training/validation/test sets (75/15/15). On the 1,820 test studies, our method matches full-study performance while using 32% fewer videos, achieving 77.2% mean balanced accuracy (bACC) across AS severity classification and LVEF estimation, demonstrating robust multi-task performance under acquisition budgets. Conclusion: Patient-tailored, cost-aware acquisition can streamline POCUS workflows while preserving decision quality, producing interpretable scan pathways suited to bedside use. The framework is extensible to additional cardiac endpoints and merits prospective evaluation for clinical integration.

TL;DR: Introduces LeafNet dataset and LeafBench benchmark to evaluate VLMs in plant pathology, revealing performance gaps and multimodal advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of large-scale multimodal datasets and benchmarks for VLMs in agricultural tasks like plant pathology.

Method: Develops LeafNet (186K images, 97 disease classes) and LeafBench (13,950 QA pairs) to benchmark 12 VLMs across six tasks.

Result: VLMs outperform vision-only models; binary classification excels (>90% accuracy), but fine-grained tasks lag (<65%).

Conclusion: LeafBench exposes gaps in VLMs for plant pathology, advocating multimodal integration for better diagnostic precision.

Abstract: Foundation models and vision-language pre-training have significantly advanced Vision-Language Models (VLMs), enabling multimodal processing of visual and linguistic data. However, their application in domain-specific agricultural tasks, such as plant pathology, remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, comprehensive multimodal image--text datasets and benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce LeafNet, a comprehensive multimodal dataset, and LeafBench, a visual question-answering benchmark developed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of VLMs in understanding plant diseases. The dataset comprises 186,000 leaf digital images spanning 97 disease classes, paired with metadata, generating 13,950 question-answer pairs spanning six critical agricultural tasks. The questions assess various aspects of plant pathology understanding, including visual symptom recognition, taxonomic relationships, and diagnostic reasoning. Benchmarking 12 state-of-the-art VLMs on our LeafBench dataset, we reveal substantial disparity in their disease understanding capabilities. Our study shows performance varies markedly across tasks: binary healthy--diseased classification exceeds 90\% accuracy, while fine-grained pathogen and species identification remains below 65\%. Direct comparison between vision-only models and VLMs demonstrates the critical advantage of multimodal architectures: fine-tuned VLMs outperform traditional vision models, confirming that integrating linguistic representations significantly enhances diagnostic precision. These findings highlight critical gaps in current VLMs for plant pathology applications and underscore the need for LeafBench as a rigorous framework for methodological advancement and progress evaluation toward reliable AI-assisted plant disease diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal video generation models suffer from high latency and poor temporal stability, especially in streaming inference, leading to issues like spatial blurring and lip desynchronization.

Method: EchoTorrent's fourfold design includes (1) Multi-Teacher Training, (2) Adaptive CFG Calibration, (3) Hybrid Long Tail Forcing, and (4) VAE Decoder Refiner to enhance performance and efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show EchoTorrent achieves few-pass autoregressive generation with improved temporal consistency, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization.

Conclusion: EchoTorrent effectively resolves the efficiency-performance trade-off in multi-modal video generation, enabling high-quality real-time deployment.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal video generation models have achieved high visual quality, but their prohibitive latency and limited temporal stability hinder real-time deployment. Streaming inference exacerbates these issues, leading to pronounced multimodal degradation, such as spatial blurring, temporal drift, and lip desynchronization, which creates an unresolved efficiency-performance trade-off. To this end, we propose EchoTorrent, a novel schema with a fourfold design: (1) Multi-Teacher Training fine-tunes a pre-trained model on distinct preference domains to obtain specialized domain experts, which sequentially transfer domain-specific knowledge to a student model; (2) Adaptive CFG Calibration (ACC-DMD), which calibrates the audio CFG augmentation errors in DMD via a phased spatiotemporal schedule, eliminating redundant CFG computations and enabling single-pass inference per step; (3) Hybrid Long Tail Forcing, which enforces alignment exclusively on tail frames during long-horizon self-rollout training via a causal-bidirectional hybrid architecture, effectively mitigates spatiotemporal degradation in streaming mode while enhancing fidelity to reference frames; and (4) VAE Decoder Refiner through pixel-domain optimization of the VAE decoder to recover high-frequency details while circumventing latent-space ambiguities. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that EchoTorrent achieves few-pass autoregressive generation with substantially extended temporal consistency, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Ensemble Learning approach combining U-Net and FPN models for improved waste segmentation accuracy, achieving higher IoU and lower Dice loss values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Environmental pollution necessitates efficient recycling, where waste segregation is crucial. Accurate segmentation aids robots in sorting waste effectively.

Method: An Ensemble Learning model (EL-4) combines U-Net and FPN using weighted averaging to leverage their strengths in detail capture and scale variation handling.

Result: EL-4 achieved an IoU of 0.8306 (improved from U-Net's 0.8065) and reduced Dice loss to 0.09019 (from FPN's 0.1183).

Conclusion: The ensemble model enhances waste segregation accuracy, improving recycling efficiency and throughput at Material Recovery Facilities.

Abstract: Environmental pollution is a critical global issue, with recycling emerging as one of the most viable solutions. This study focuses on waste segregation, a crucial step in recycling processes to obtain raw material. Recent advancements in computer vision have significantly contributed to waste classification and recognition. In waste segregation, segmentation masks are essential for robots to accurately localize and pick objects from conveyor belts. The complexity of real-world waste environments, characterized by deformed items without specific patterns and overlapping objects, further complicates waste segmentation tasks. This paper proposes an Ensemble Learning approach to improve segmentation accuracy by combining high performing segmentation models, U-Net and FPN, using a weighted average method. U-Net excels in capturing fine details and boundaries in segmentation tasks, while FPN effectively handles scale variation and context in complex environments, and their combined masks result in more precise predictions. The dataset used closely mimics real-life waste scenarios, and preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance feature learning for deep learning segmentation models. The ensemble model, referred to as EL-4, achieved an IoU value of 0.8306, an improvement over U-Net's 0.8065, and reduced Dice loss to 0.09019 from FPN's 0.1183. This study could contribute to the efficiency of waste sorting at Material Recovery Facility, facilitating better raw material acquisition for recycling with minimal human intervention and enhancing the overall throughput.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (WDLoRA)-based multimodal generative framework for synthesizing clinically accurate CCM images, improving diagnostic and segmentation performance in DPN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of limited labeled data and fine-grained variability in CCM images for DPN diagnosis by leveraging AI-driven generative models while preserving anatomical fidelity.

Method: Uses WDLoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning mechanism, to decouple magnitude and directional weight updates for synthesizing medically realistic images, conditioned on nerve segmentation masks and clinical prompts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art visual fidelity (FID: 5.18) and structural integrity (SSIM: 0.630), preserves clinical biomarkers, and improves downstream diagnostic and segmentation accuracy by 2.1% and 2.2%, respectively.

Conclusion: The framework effectively alleviates data bottlenecks in medical AI by generating high-quality synthetic CCM images, enhancing diagnostic and segmentation tasks for DPN.

Abstract: Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) is a sensitive tool for assessing small-fiber damage in Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN), yet the development of robust, automated deep learning-based diagnostic models is limited by scarce labelled data and fine-grained variability in corneal nerve morphology. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven foundation generative models excel at natural image synthesis, they often struggle in medical imaging due to limited domain-specific training, compromising the anatomical fidelity required for clinical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (WDLoRA)-based multimodal generative framework for clinically guided CCM image synthesis. WDLoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) mechanism that decouples magnitude and directional weight updates, enabling foundation generative models to independently learn the orientation (nerve topology) and intensity (stromal contrast) required for medical realism. By jointly conditioning on nerve segmentation masks and disease-specific clinical prompts, the model synthesises anatomically coherent images across the DPN spectrum (Control, T1NoDPN, T1DPN). A comprehensive three-pillar evaluation demonstrates that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art visual fidelity (Fréchet Inception Distance (FID): 5.18) and structural integrity (Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM): 0.630), significantly outperforming GAN and standard diffusion baselines. Crucially, the synthetic images preserve gold-standard clinical biomarkers and are statistically equivalent to real patient data. When used to train automated diagnostic models, the synthetic dataset improves downstream diagnostic accuracy by 2.1% and segmentation performance by 2.2%, validating the framework's potential to alleviate data bottlenecks in medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soil-transmitted helminth infections are widespread but difficult to diagnose manually due to labor-intensive and error-prone processes.

Method: A fine-tuned vision language model (Microsoft Florence) is used to localize parasitic eggs in microscopic images.

Result: The VLM outperforms other object detection methods like EfficientDet, achieving an mIOU of 0.94.

Conclusion: The VLM shows potential as a scalable solution for automated parasitological diagnosis.

Abstract: Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections continuously affect a large proportion of the global population, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions, where access to specialized diagnostic expertise is limited. Although manual microscopic diagnosis of parasitic eggs remains the diagnostic gold standard, the approach can be labour-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. This paper aims to utilize a vision language model (VLM) such as Microsoft Florence that was fine-tuned to localize all parasitic eggs within microscopic images. The preliminary results show that our localization VLM performs comparatively better than the other object detection methods, such as EfficientDet, with an mIOU of 0.94. This finding demonstrates the potential of the proposed VLM to serve as a core component of an automated framework, offering a scalable engineering solution for intelligent parasitological diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical smoke degrades endoscopic video feeds, compromising teleoperation and surgical outcomes in robotic systems.

Method: RGA-Net employs a hierarchical encoder-decoder with Dual-Stream Hybrid Attention (DHA) and Axis-Decomposed Attention (ADA) modules for feature modulation.

Result: RGA-Net outperforms benchmarks on surgical datasets, enhancing visual clarity for robotic surgery integration.

Conclusion: The framework improves surgeon-robot interfaces, reduces cognitive burden, and lays groundwork for safer robotic systems.

Abstract: Robotic surgical systems rely heavily on high-quality visual feedback for precise teleoperation; yet, surgical smoke from energy-based devices significantly degrades endoscopic video feeds, compromising the human-robot interface and surgical outcomes. This paper presents RGA-Net (Reciprocal Gating and Attention-fusion Network), a novel deep learning framework specifically designed for smoke removal in robotic surgery workflows. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of surgical smoke-including dense, non-homogeneous distribution and complex light scattering-through a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture featuring two key innovations: (1) a Dual-Stream Hybrid Attention (DHA) module that combines shifted window attention with frequency-domain processing to capture both local surgical details and global illumination changes, and (2) an Axis-Decomposed Attention (ADA) module that efficiently processes multi-scale features through factorized attention mechanisms. These components are connected via reciprocal cross-gating blocks that enable bidirectional feature modulation between encoder and decoder pathways. Extensive experiments on the DesmokeData and LSD3K surgical datasets demonstrate that RGA-Net achieves superior performance in restoring visual clarity suitable for robotic surgery integration. Our method enhances the surgeon-robot interface by providing consistently clear visualization, laying a technical foundation for alleviating surgeons' cognitive burden, optimizing operation workflows, and reducing iatrogenic injury risks in minimally invasive procedures. These practical benefits could be further validated through future clinical trials involving surgeon usability assessments. The proposed framework represents a significant step toward more reliable and safer robotic surgical systems through computational vision enhancement.

TL;DR: IGOFormer is a query-based oriented object detector that improves performance for arbitrary-oriented objects by integrating intrinsic geometry into feature decoding and enhancing inter-stage matching stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing query-based detectors struggle with arbitrary-oriented and tiny objects due to underutilized geometry and inter-stage matching inconsistency.

Method: IGOFormer uses an Intrinsic Geometry-aware Decoder and Momentum-based Bipartite Matching to address these issues.

Result: Achieves 78.00% AP$_{50}$ on DOTA-V1.0 with Swin-T backbone.

Conclusion: IGOFormer outperforms existing methods by leveraging geometry and stable matching.

Abstract: Recent query-based detectors have achieved remarkable progress, yet their performance remains constrained when handling objects with arbitrary orientations, especially for tiny objects capturing limited texture information. This limitation primarily stems from the underutilization of intrinsic geometry during pixel-based feature decoding and the occurrence of inter-stage matching inconsistency caused by stage-wise bipartite matching. To tackle these challenges, we present IGOFormer, a novel query-based oriented object detector that explicitly integrates intrinsic geometry into feature decoding and enhances inter-stage matching stability. Specifically, we design an Intrinsic Geometry-aware Decoder, which enhances the object-related features conditioned on an object query by injecting complementary geometric embeddings extrapolated from their correlations to capture the geometric layout of the object, thereby offering a critical geometric insight into its orientation. Meanwhile, a Momentum-based Bipartite Matching scheme is developed to adaptively aggregate historical matching costs by formulating an exponential moving average with query-specific smoothing factors, effectively preventing conflicting supervisory signals arising from inter-stage matching inconsistency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our IGOFormer for aerial oriented object detection, achieving an AP$_{50}$ score of 78.00\% on DOTA-V1.0 using Swin-T backbone under the single-scale setting. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper explores latent representations in generative models for medical imaging, focusing on VAEs for 3D brain MRI scans. It evaluates reconstruction quality, latent space structure, and classification effectiveness, showing promising results for clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance generative models in neuroimaging by understanding latent representations' structure and applicability for clinical tasks.

Method: Developed multiple VAEs to encode 3D brain MRI scans, evaluating representations through reconstruction quality, PCA visualization, and classification tasks.

Result: VAEs successfully capture essential brain features with high reconstruction fidelity. Latent space shows clear clustering, aiding in distinguishing Down syndrome from controls.

Conclusion: The study highlights VAEs' potential in neuroimaging, with latent spaces offering valuable insights for clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as powerful tools in medical imaging, enabling tasks such as segmentation, anomaly detection, and high-quality synthetic data generation. These models typically rely on learning meaningful latent representations, which are particularly valuable given the high-dimensional nature of 3D medical images like brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Despite their potential, latent representations remain underexplored in terms of their structure, information content, and applicability to downstream clinical tasks. Investigating these representations is crucial for advancing the use of generative models in neuroimaging research and clinical decision-making. In this work, we develop multiple variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode 3D brain MRI scans into compact latent space representations for generative and predictive applications. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the learned representations through three key analyses: (i) a quantitative and qualitative assessment of MRI reconstruction quality, (ii) a visualisation of the latent space structure using Principal Component Analysis, and (iii) downstream classification tasks on a proprietary dataset of euploid and Down syndrome individuals brain MRI scans. Our results demonstrate that the VAE successfully captures essential brain features while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity. The latent space exhibits clear clustering patterns, particularly in distinguishing individuals with Down syndrome from euploid controls.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of text-to-motion generation lack systematic assessment of model generalization and motion generation under complex OOD conditions.

Method: The authors propose a benchmark with an OOD prompt dataset (1,025 descriptions) and a unified evaluation framework combining LLM-based Evaluation, Multi-factor Motion evaluation, and Fine-grained Accuracy Evaluation.

Conclusion: The findings expose limitations of current methods in OOD scenarios and provide guidance for improving future text-to-motion models.

Abstract: Most existing evaluations of text-to-motion generation focus on in-distribution textual inputs and a limited set of evaluation criteria, which restricts their ability to systematically assess model generalization and motion generation capabilities under complex out-of-distribution (OOD) textual conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a benchmark specifically designed for OOD text-to-motion evaluation, which includes a comprehensive analysis of 14 representative baseline models and the two datasets derived from evaluation results. Specifically, we construct an OOD prompt dataset consisting of 1,025 textual descriptions. Based on this prompt dataset, we introduce a unified evaluation framework that integrates LLM-based Evaluation, Multi-factor Motion evaluation, and Fine-grained Accuracy Evaluation. Our experimental results reveal that while different baseline models demonstrate strengths in areas such as text-to-motion semantic alignment, motion generalizability, and physical quality, most models struggle to achieve strong performance with Fine-grained Accuracy Evaluation. These findings highlight the limitations of existing methods in OOD scenarios and offer practical guidance for the design and evaluation of future production-level text-to-motion models.

*Haoyi Tao,Chaozheng Huang,Nan Wang,Han Lyu,Linfeng Zhang,Guolin Ke,Xi Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniScience is introduced to address MLLMs' limitations in scientific image understanding, offering a high-quality dataset and a dynamic re-captioning pipeline, leading to improved model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with scientific images due to poor dataset quality and domain coverage. OmniScience aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Developed a dynamic model-routing re-captioning pipeline to generate dense captions and rigorously filtered the dataset for quality.

Result: Improved image-text similarity to 0.956 and notable performance gains on benchmarks (e.g., +0.378 on MM-MT-Bench).

Conclusion: OmniScience enhances MLLMs' capability for scientific image understanding through improved data quality and methodology.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models demonstrate strong performance on natural image understanding, yet exhibit limited capability in interpreting scientific images, including but not limited to schematic diagrams, experimental characterizations, and analytical charts. This limitation is particularly pronounced in open-source MLLMs. The gap largely stems from existing datasets with limited domain coverage, coarse structural annotations, and weak semantic grounding. We introduce OmniScience, a large-scale, high-fidelity multi-modal dataset comprising 1.5 million figure-caption-context triplets, spanning more than 10 major scientific disciplines. To obtain image caption data with higher information density and accuracy for multi-modal large-model training, we develop a dynamic model-routing re-captioning pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models to generate dense, self-contained descriptions by jointly synthesizing visual features, original figure captions, and corresponding in-text references authored by human scientists. The pipeline is further reinforced with rigorous quality filtering and alignment with human expert judgments, ensuring both factual accuracy and semantic completeness, and boosts the image-text multi-modal similarity score from 0.769 to 0.956. We further propose a caption QA protocol as a proxy task for evaluating visual understanding. Under this setting, Qwen2.5-VL-3B model finetuned on OmniScience show substantial gains over baselines, achieving a gain of 0.378 on MM-MT-Bench and a gain of 0.140 on MMMU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM4Dcap is an open-source framework for estimating biomechanical metrics from monocular video, integrating 4D human mesh recovery with biomechanical simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional biomechanical analysis is costly and lab-restricted; SAM4Dcap aims to enable accessible, non-laboratory motion analysis.

Method: Combines SAM-Body4D's 4D mesh recovery with OpenSim solver, converting meshes into biomechanically compatible trajectories.

Result: Achieves knee kinematic predictions close to multi-view systems, though hip flexion and jitter issues persist.

Conclusion: SAM4Dcap bridges computer vision and biomechanics for flexible, practical motion analysis outside labs.

Abstract: Quantitative biomechanical analysis is essential for clinical diagnosis and injury prevention but is often restricted to laboratories due to the high cost of optical motion capture systems. While multi-view video approaches have lowered barriers, they remain impractical for home-based scenarios requiring monocular capture. This paper presents SAM4Dcap, an open-source, end-to-end framework for estimating biomechanical metrics from monocular video without additional training. SAM4Dcap integrates the temporally consistent 4D human mesh recovery of SAM-Body4D with the OpenSim biomechanical solver. The pipeline converts reconstructed meshes into trajectory files compatible with diverse musculoskeletal models. We introduce automated prompting strategies and a Linux-native build for processing. Preliminary evaluations on walking and drop-jump tasks indicate that SAM4Dcap has the potential to achieve knee kinematic predictions comparable to multi-view systems, although some discrepancies in hip flexion and residual jitter remain. By bridging advanced computer vision with established biomechanical simulation, SAM4Dcap provides a flexible, accessible foundation for non-laboratory motion analysis.

*Jidong Jia,Youjian Zhang,Huan Fu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the skeleton-to-mesh gap in dance generation by using physics-based rewards and reinforcement learning fine-tuning to improve physical plausibility and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dance generation methods focus on skeletal domains, ignoring mesh-level physical constraints, leading to self-penetration and foot-ground contact anomalies.

Method: The authors use physics-based rewards (imitation and foot-ground deviation) and reinforcement learning fine-tuning to guide a diffusion model toward plausible motion synthesis. An anti-freezing reward is also introduced to avoid motion freezing.

Result: Experiments on multiple dance datasets show significant improvement in physical plausibility and realism of generated motions.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges the skeleton-to-mesh gap, producing more aesthetically pleasing and realistic dances.

Abstract: Despite advances in dance generation, most methods are trained in the skeletal domain and ignore mesh-level physical constraints. As a result, motions that look plausible as joint trajectories often exhibit body self-penetration and Foot-Ground Contact (FGC) anomalies when visualized with a human body mesh, reducing the aesthetic appeal of generated dances and limiting their real-world applications. We address this skeleton-to-mesh gap by deriving physics-based rewards from the body mesh and applying Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) to steer the diffusion model toward physically plausible motion synthesis under mesh visualization. Our reward design combines (i) an imitation reward that measures a motion's general plausibility by its imitability in a physical simulator (penalizing penetration and foot skating), and (ii) a Foot-Ground Deviation (FGD) reward with test-time FGD guidance to better capture the dynamic foot-ground interaction in dance. However, we find that the physics-based rewards tend to push the model to generate freezing motions for fewer physical anomalies and better imitability. To mitigate it, we propose an anti-freezing reward to preserve motion dynamics while maintaining physical plausibility. Experiments on multiple dance datasets consistently demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the physical plausibility of generated motions, yielding more realistic and aesthetically pleasing dances.

TL;DR: PerASCD is a semantic change detection method leveraging the RS foundation model PerA, featuring a Cascaded Gated Decoder and Soft Semantic Consistency Loss, achieving SOTA performance with simplified paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SCD methods struggle with performance and complexity due to limited semantic understanding and task complexity.

Method: Proposes PerASCD with a Cascaded Gated Decoder and Soft Semantic Consistency Loss for enhanced multi-scale semantic understanding.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on two public benchmarks, showcasing simplified paradigm and adaptability.

Conclusion: PerASCD effectively improves SCD performance and reduces complexity, validated by benchmarks.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) change detection methods can extract critical information on surface dynamics and are an essential means for humans to understand changes in the earth's surface and environment. Among these methods, semantic change detection (SCD) can more effectively interpret the multi-class information contained in bi-temporal RS imagery, providing semantic-level predictions that support dynamic change monitoring. However, due to the limited semantic understanding capability of the model and the inherent complexity of the SCD tasks, existing SCD methods face significant challenges in both performance and paradigm complexity. In this paper, we propose PerASCD, a SCD method driven by RS foundation model PerA, designed to enhance the multi-scale semantic understanding and overall performance. We introduce a modular Cascaded Gated Decoder (CG-Decoder) that simplifies complex SCD decoding pipelines while promoting effective multi-level feature interaction and fusion. In addition, we propose a Soft Semantic Consistency Loss (SSCLoss) to mitigate the numerical instability commonly encountered during SCD training. We further explore the applicability of multiple existing RS foundation models on the SCD task when equipped with the proposed decoder. Experimental results demonstrate that our decoder not only effectively simplifies the paradigm of SCD, but also achieves seamless adaptation across various vision encoders. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public benchmark datasets, validating its effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/SathShen/PerASCD.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiWR is a robust method for reconstructing watertight surfaces from unoriented point clouds with non-uniform sampling, noise, and outliers, using joint optimization of orientations, weights, and confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with non-uniform sampling, noise, and outliers in point clouds, requiring separate preprocessing steps.

Method: DiWR uses generalized winding number (GWN) field optimization with Dirichlet energy minimization and GWN-based constraints.

Result: DiWR outperforms traditional multi-stage pipelines and recent joint orientation-reconstruction methods on challenging inputs.

Conclusion: DiWR is effective for reconstructing watertight surfaces without preprocessing and handles noise and outliers robustly.

Abstract: We propose Dirichlet Winding Reconstruction (DiWR), a robust method for reconstructing watertight surfaces from unoriented point clouds with non-uniform sampling, noise, and outliers. Our method uses the generalized winding number (GWN) field as the target implicit representation and jointly optimizes point orientations, per-point area weights, and confidence coefficients in a single pipeline. The optimization minimizes the Dirichlet energy of the induced winding field together with additional GWN-based constraints, allowing DiWR to compensate for non-uniform sampling, reduce the impact of noise, and downweight outliers during reconstruction, with no reliance on separate preprocessing. We evaluate DiWR on point clouds from 3D Gaussian Splatting, a computer-vision pipeline, and corrupted graphics benchmarks. Experiments show that DiWR produces plausible watertight surfaces on these challenging inputs and outperforms both traditional multi-stage pipelines and recent joint orientation-reconstruction methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-scale dynamics mechanism for 4D reconstruction from monocular videos, leveraging Gaussian sequences and multi-modal priors for improved accuracy and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic scene understanding from monocular videos is crucial for scalable robot learning but remains challenging due to ill-posed reconstruction.

Method: The authors propose Gaussian sequences with multi-scale dynamics, factorizing complex motion fields and incorporating multi-modal priors from vision foundation models.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in dynamic novel-view synthesis on benchmarks and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The approach enables accurate and globally consistent 4D reconstruction from monocular videos, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic scenes from casual videos is critical for scalable robot learning, yet four-dimensional (4D) reconstruction under strictly monocular settings remains highly ill-posed. To address this challenge, our key insight is that real-world dynamics exhibits a multi-scale regularity from object to particle level. To this end, we design the multi-scale dynamics mechanism that factorizes complex motion fields. Within this formulation, we propose Gaussian sequences with multi-scale dynamics, a novel representation for dynamic 3D Gaussians derived through compositions of multi-level motion. This layered structure substantially alleviates ambiguity of reconstruction and promotes physically plausible dynamics. We further incorporate multi-modal priors from vision foundation models to establish complementary supervision, constraining the solution space and improving the reconstruction fidelity. Our approach enables accurate and globally consistent 4D reconstruction from monocular casual videos. Experiments of dynamic novel-view synthesis (NVS) on benchmark and real-world manipulation datasets demonstrate considerable improvements over existing methods.

TL;DR: VAR-3D improves text-to-3D generation by addressing bottlenecks in learning discrete 3D representations and introduces a view-aware VQ-VAE and rendering-supervised training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for text-to-3D generation suffer from information loss during encoding, representational distortion, and objective mismatch between stages.

Method: Proposes VAR-3D with a view-aware 3D VQ-VAE for discrete token conversion and a rendering-supervised training strategy.

Result: VAR-3D outperforms existing methods in generation quality and text-3D alignment.

Conclusion: The approach effectively preserves visual fidelity and structural consistency in text-conditioned 3D generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in auto-regressive transformers have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling. However, text-to-3D generation remains challenging, primarily due to bottlenecks in learning discrete 3D representations. Specifically, existing approaches often suffer from information loss during encoding, causing representational distortion before the quantization process. This effect is further amplified by vector quantization, ultimately degrading the geometric coherence of text-conditioned 3D shapes. Moreover, the conventional two-stage training paradigm induces an objective mismatch between reconstruction and text-conditioned auto-regressive generation. To address these issues, we propose View-aware Auto-Regressive 3D (VAR-3D), which intergrates a view-aware 3D Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) to convert the complex geometric structure of 3D models into discrete tokens. Additionally, we introduce a rendering-supervised training strategy that couples discrete token prediction with visual reconstruction, encouraging the generative process to better preserve visual fidelity and structural consistency relative to the input text. Experiments demonstrate that VAR-3D significantly outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and text-3D alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reasoning-driven Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME) framework using EG-RL to optimize T-CoT, enhancing cross-modal task performance with improved semantic consistency and fine-grained matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative embedding methods generate reasoning CoTs limited to textual analysis, lacking relevance to retrieval targets. The aim is to improve multimodal embedding quality by integrating retrieval-aligned reasoning.

Method: Introduces EG-RL to supervise the Reasoner in producing evidential T-CoT, which extracts multimodal cues relevant to retrieval tasks. The framework aligns reasoning traces with embedding objectives.

Result: Outperforms pioneering models on MMEB-V2 and UVRB benchmarks despite limited resources, showing enhanced semantic consistency and fine-grained matching.

Conclusion: Targeted reasoning optimization improves UME quality, offering a practical solution for reasoning-driven multimodal embedding development.

Abstract: Leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has become pivotal for advancing Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME) in addressing diverse cross-modal tasks. Recent studies demonstrate that incorporating generative Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can substantially enhance task-specific representations compared to discriminative methods. However, the generated reasoning CoTs of existing generative embedding methods are limited to the textual analysis of queries and are irrelevant to the retrieval of the targets. To address these limitations, we propose a reasoning-driven UME framework that integrates Embedder-Guided Reinforcement Learning (EG-RL) to optimize the Reasoner to produce evidential Traceability CoT (T-CoT). Our key contributions are threefold: (1) We design an EG-RL framework where the Embedder provides explicit supervision to the Reasoner, ensuring the generated CoT traces are aligned with embedding tasks. (2) We introduce T-CoT, which extracts critical multimodal cues to focus on retrieval-relevant elements and provides multimodal inputs for the Embedder. (3) With limited computational resources, our framework outperforms the pioneering embedding model on both MMEB-V2 and UVRB benchmarks. The integration of multimodal evidence in structured reasoning, paired with retrieval-oriented alignment, effectively strengthens cross-modal semantic consistency and boosts the fine-grained matching capability of the model as well as the generalization across complex scenarios. Our work demonstrates that targeted reasoning optimization can significantly improve multimodal embedding quality, providing a practical and efficient solution for reasoning-driven UME development.

### [69] [Prior-guided Hierarchical Instance-pixel Contrastive Learning for Ultrasound Speckle Noise Suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13831)
*Zhenyu Bu,Yuanxin Xie,Guang-Quan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A prior-guided hierarchical instance-pixel contrastive learning model for ultrasound denoising is proposed, combining Transformer-CNN architecture to enhance noise suppression while preserving structural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speckle patterns in ultrasound images degrade quality but also contain essential texture and anatomical details. Balancing noise suppression with structure preservation is challenging.

Method: Uses pixel-level and instance-level contrastive learning to distinguish noisy/clean samples, employs a memory bank for feature-space learning, and adopts a hybrid Transformer-CNN architecture for global and local context modeling.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on two publicly available ultrasound datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in noise suppression and structure preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed model provides a robust solution for ultrasound denoising, effectively balancing noise reduction with the retention of critical anatomical details.

Abstract: Ultrasound denoising is essential for mitigating speckle-induced degradations, thereby enhancing image quality and improving diagnostic reliability. Nevertheless, because speckle patterns inherently encode both texture and fine anatomical details, effectively suppressing noise while preserving structural fidelity remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a prior-guided hierarchical instance-pixel contrastive learning model for ultrasound denoising, designed to promote noise-invariant and structure-aware feature representations by maximizing the separability between noisy and clean samples at both pixel and instance levels. Specifically, a statistics-guided pixel-level contrastive learning strategy is introduced to enhance distributional discrepancies between noisy and clean pixels, thereby improving local structural consistency. Concurrently, a memory bank is employed to facilitate instance-level contrastive learning in the feature space, encouraging representations that more faithfully approximate the underlying data distribution. Furthermore, a hybrid Transformer-CNN architecture is adopted, coupling a Transformer-based encoder for global context modeling with a CNN-based decoder optimized for fine-grained anatomical structure restoration, thus enabling complementary exploitation of long-range dependencies and local texture details. Extensive evaluations on two publicly available ultrasound datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness and superiority.

Result: Achieves strong perceptual quality, semantic fidelity, and temporal consistency at ultra-low bitrates (< 0.0003 bpp), outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The framework efficiently combines semantic and low-resolution data for superior video generation under strict constraints.

Abstract: We introduce a video diffusion model for high-fidelity, causal, and real-time video generation under ultra-low-bitrate semantic communication constraints. Our approach utilizes lossy semantic video coding to transmit the semantic scene structure, complemented by a stream of highly compressed, low-resolution frames that provide sufficient texture information to preserve fidelity. Building on these inputs, we introduce a modular video diffusion model that contains Semantic Control, Restoration Adapter, and Temporal Adapter. We further introduce an efficient temporal distillation procedure that enables extension to real-time and causal synthesis, reducing trainable parameters by 300x and training time by 2x, while adhering to communication constraints. Evaluated across diverse datasets, the framework achieves strong perceptual quality, semantic fidelity, and temporal consistency at ultra-low bitrates (< 0.0003 bpp), outperforming classical, neural, and generative baselines in extensive quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations.

Motivation: PVR is a common complication after TAVI with significant impact on long-term outcomes, prompting the need for predictive tools.

Method: Used 3D convolutional neural networks trained on isotropic CT volumes from preoperative TAVI patients.

Result: Deep learning successfully identified subtle anatomical features to predict PVR.

Conclusion: Volumetric deep learning offers potential for personalized risk assessment and procedural optimization in TAVI.

Abstract: Severe aortic stenosis is a common and life-threatening condition in elderly patients, often treated with Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). Despite procedural advances, paravalvular aortic regurgitation (PVR) remains one of the most frequent post-TAVI complications, with a proven impact on long-term prognosis.
  In this work, we investigate the potential of deep learning to predict the occurrence of PVR from preoperative cardiac CT. To this end, a dataset of preoperative TAVI patients was collected, and 3D convolutional neural networks were trained on isotropic CT volumes. The results achieved suggest that volumetric deep learning can capture subtle anatomical features from pre-TAVI imaging, opening new perspectives for personalized risk assessment and procedural optimization.

Conclusion: The framework offers scalable, reproducible tools for surgical computer vision research.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive workflow for generating and validating a synthetic dataset designed for robotic surgery instrument segmentation. A 3D reconstruction of the Da Vinci robotic arms was refined and animated in Autodesk Maya through a fully automated Python-based pipeline capable of producing photorealistic, labeled video sequences. Each scene integrates randomized motion patterns, lighting variations, and synthetic blood textures to mimic intraoperative variability while preserving pixel-accurate ground truth masks. To validate the realism and effectiveness of the generated data, several segmentation models were trained under controlled ratios of real and synthetic data. Results demonstrate that a balanced composition of real and synthetic samples significantly improves model generalization compared to training on real data only, while excessive reliance on synthetic data introduces a measurable domain shift. The proposed framework provides a reproducible and scalable tool for surgical computer vision, supporting future research in data augmentation, domain adaptation, and simulation-based pretraining for robotic-assisted surgery.

Conclusion: SSL is effective for CO prediction even with limited data, offering a promising non-invasive alternative.

Abstract: Cardiac Output (CO) is a key parameter in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular diseases. However, its accurate measurement requires right-heart catheterization, an invasive and time-consuming procedure, motivating the development of reliable non-invasive alternatives using echocardiography. In this work, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) pretraining strategy based on SimCLR to improve CO prediction from apical four-chamber echocardiographic videos. The pretraining is performed using the same limited dataset available for the downstream task, demonstrating the potential of SSL even under data scarcity.

*Max Wolff,Thomas Klein,Evgenia Rusak,Felix Wichmann,Wieland Brendel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reveals that the improved alignment of generative models with human visual behavior is due to a resizing operation acting as a low-pass filter, and similar effects can be achieved in discriminative models by blurring images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) underperform in modeling human visual behavior, prompting the need to understand why generative models show better alignment and whether similar improvements can be applied to discriminative models.

Method: Controlled experiments were conducted by removing high-frequency spatial information from discriminative models (e.g., CLIP) using low-pass filters. The study also optimized filters for alignment and analyzed their spectral properties.

Result: Blurring images at test-time significantly improved behavioral alignment, halving the gap between DNNs and human observers. Optimized low-pass filters matched human visual system properties, achieving state-of-the-art alignment.

Conclusion: The alignment of models with human vision is heavily influenced by the frequency spectrum of visual inputs, and optimal low-pass filters can bridge the gap between DNNs and human performance.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance on computer vision benchmarks, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) still fall short of adequately modeling human visual behavior, as measured by error consistency and shape bias. Recent work hypothesized that behavioral alignment can be drastically improved through \emph{generative} -- rather than \emph{discriminative} -- classifiers, with far-reaching implications for models of human vision.
  Here, we instead show that the increased alignment of generative models can be largely explained by a seemingly innocuous resizing operation in the generative model which effectively acts as a low-pass filter. In a series of controlled experiments, we show that removing high-frequency spatial information from discriminative models like CLIP drastically increases their behavioral alignment. Simply blurring images at test-time -- rather than training on blurred images -- achieves a new state-of-the-art score on the model-vs-human benchmark, halving the current alignment gap between DNNs and human observers. Furthermore, low-pass filters are likely optimal, which we demonstrate by directly optimizing filters for alignment. To contextualize the performance of optimal filters, we compute the frontier of all possible pareto-optimal solutions to the benchmark, which was formerly unknown.
  We explain our findings by observing that the frequency spectrum of optimal Gaussian filters roughly matches the spectrum of band-pass filters implemented by the human visual system. We show that the contrast sensitivity function, describing the inverse of the contrast threshold required for humans to detect a sinusoidal grating as a function of spatiotemporal frequency, is approximated well by Gaussian filters of the specific width that also maximizes error consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study comparing human and DNN model performance in color constancy tasks using VR, showing strong alignment in behavior under various conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how well a DNN model replicates human color constancy mechanisms like local surround, maximum flux, and spatial mean.

Method: Used a pre-trained ResNet-based U-Net to predict reflectance, fine-tuned on VR images, and tested it with an achromatic object selection task mirroring human experiments.

Result: The model closely matched human performance, excelling in baseline conditions and showing similar declines when key color cues were removed.

Conclusion: The DNN model effectively parallels human color constancy, validating its use for studying visual mechanisms.

Abstract: We previously investigated color constancy in photorealistic virtual reality (VR) and developed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that predicts reflectance from rendered images. Here, we combine both approaches to compare and study a model and human performance with respect to established color constancy mechanisms: local surround, maximum flux and spatial mean. Rather than evaluating the model against physical ground truth, model performance was assessed using the same achromatic object selection task employed in the human experiments. The model, a ResNet based U-Net from our previous work, was pre-trained on rendered images to predict surface reflectance. We then applied transfer learning, fine-tuning only the network's decoder on images from the baseline VR condition. To parallel the human experiment, the model's output was used to perform the same achromatic object selection task across all conditions. Results show a strong correspondence between the model and human behavior. Both achieved high constancy under baseline conditions and showed similar, condition-dependent performance declines when the local surround or spatial mean color cues were removed.

*Ruggiero Santeramo,Igor Zubarev,Florian Jug*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MamaDino combines convolutional and transformer-based models with explicit contralateral asymmetry modelling to achieve state-of-the-art breast cancer risk prediction using lower-resolution mammograms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve breast cancer screening by developing a risk-adapted and personalized strategy that matches high-resolution model performance with lower-resolution inputs, leveraging explicit contralateral asymmetry modelling.

Method: MamaDino fuses self-supervised DINOv3 ViT-S features with a trainable CNN encoder at 512x512 resolution, using a BilateralMixer for bilateral breast information aggregation.

Result: MamaDino matches Mirai's performance with ~13x fewer input pixels and improves discrimination (AUC 0.736 vs 0.713 in-distribution, 0.677 vs 0.666 out-of-distribution).

Conclusion: Explicit contralateral modelling and complementary inductive biases enable accurate predictions with lower-resolution mammograms, offering a more efficient screening approach.

Abstract: Breast cancer screening programmes increasingly seek to move from one-size-fits-all interval to risk-adapted and personalized strategies. Deep learning (DL) has enabled image-based risk models with stronger 1- to 5-year prediction than traditional clinical models, but leading systems (e.g., Mirai) typically use convolutional backbones, very high-resolution inputs (>1M pixels) and simple multi-view fusion, with limited explicit modelling of contralateral asymmetry.
  We hypothesised that combining complementary inductive biases (convolutional and transformer-based) with explicit contralateral asymmetry modelling would allow us to match state-of-the-art 3-year risk prediction performance even when operating on substantially lower-resolution mammograms, indicating that using less detailed images in a more structured way can recover state-of-the-art accuracy.
  We present MamaDino, a mammography-aware multi-view attentional DINO model. MamaDino fuses frozen self-supervised DINOv3 ViT-S features with a trainable CNN encoder at 512x512 resolution, and aggregates bilateral breast information via a BilateralMixer to output a 3-year breast cancer risk score. We train on 53,883 women from OPTIMAM (UK) and evaluate on matched 3-year case-control cohorts: an in-distribution test set from four screening sites and an external out-of-distribution cohort from an unseen site.
  At breast-level, MamaDino matches Mirai on both internal and external tests while using ~13x fewer input pixels. Adding the BilateralMixer improves discrimination to AUC 0.736 (vs 0.713) in-distribution and 0.677 (vs 0.666) out-of-distribution, with consistent performance across age, ethnicity, scanner, tumour type and grade. These findings demonstrate that explicit contralateral modelling and complementary inductive biases enable predictions that match Mirai, despite operating on substantially lower-resolution mammograms.

TL;DR: STAMP integrates spatial transcriptomics with pathology images for molecule-guided multimodal learning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models rely on vision and language, lacking molecular specificity and pathological supervision, causing representational bottlenecks.

Method: STAMP uses self-supervised, gene-guided training with hierarchical multi-scale contrastive alignment and cross-scale patch localization.

Result: STAMP achieves strong performance across six datasets and four downstream tasks, demonstrating enhanced generalizability.

Conclusion: Integrating spatially resolved molecular supervision is valuable for advancing multimodal learning in computational pathology.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in multimodal learning within computational pathology. Existing models primarily rely on vision and language modalities; however, language alone lacks molecular specificity and offers limited pathological supervision, leading to representational bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose STAMP, a Spatial Transcriptomics-Augmented Multimodal Pathology representation learning framework that integrates spatially-resolved gene expression profiles to enable molecule-guided joint embedding of pathology images and transcriptomic data. Our study shows that self-supervised, gene-guided training provides a robust and task-agnostic signal for learning pathology image representations. Incorporating spatial context and multi-scale information further enhances model performance and generalizability. To support this, we constructed SpaVis-6M, the largest Visium-based spatial transcriptomics dataset to date, and trained a spatially-aware gene encoder on this resource. Leveraging hierarchical multi-scale contrastive alignment and cross-scale patch localization mechanisms, STAMP effectively aligns spatial transcriptomics with pathology images, capturing spatial structure and molecular variation. We validate STAMP across six datasets and four downstream tasks, where it consistently achieves strong performance. These results highlight the value and necessity of integrating spatially resolved molecular supervision for advancing multimodal learning in computational pathology. The code is included in the supplementary materials. The pretrained weights and SpaVis-6M are available at: https://github.com/Hanminghao/STAMP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for planetary science focus on closed-set supervised visual tasks and lack support for text-guided retrieval in geospatial discovery.

Method: MarsRetrieval includes three tasks evaluated using a unified retrieval-centric protocol, benchmarking multimodal embedding architectures like contrastive encoders and generative models.

Result: The benchmark proves challenging, with even strong models struggling to capture domain-specific geomorphic distinctions, highlighting the need for domain-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Domain-specific fine-tuning is essential for effective geospatial discovery in planetary settings, as demonstrated by MarsRetrieval's findings.

Abstract: Data-driven approaches like deep learning are rapidly advancing planetary science, particularly in Mars exploration. Despite recent progress, most existing benchmarks remain confined to closed-set supervised visual tasks and do not support text-guided retrieval for geospatial discovery. We introduce MarsRetrieval, a retrieval benchmark for evaluating vision-language models for Martian geospatial discovery. MarsRetrieval includes three tasks: (1) paired image-text retrieval, (2) landform retrieval, and (3) global geo-localization, covering multiple spatial scales and diverse geomorphic origins. We propose a unified retrieval-centric protocol to benchmark multimodal embedding architectures, including contrastive dual-tower encoders and generative vision-language models. Our evaluation shows MarsRetrieval is challenging: even strong foundation models often fail to capture domain-specific geomorphic distinctions. We further show that domain-specific fine-tuning is critical for generalizable geospatial discovery in planetary settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/ml-stat-Sustech/MarsRetrieval

TL;DR: E-DiT is an adaptive acceleration framework for Diffusion Transformers (DiT) that dynamically skips computations and adjusts MLP widths based on input-dependent sparsity, achieving up to 2× speedup without significant quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DiT acceleration methods are rigid and degrade quality. E-DiT addresses this by leveraging observed sparsity variability across samples.

Method: E-DiT uses lightweight routers in DiT blocks to dynamically identify sparsity and adjust MLP widths, with a block-level caching mechanism for inference efficiency.

Result: Experiments on 2D/3D datasets show E-DiT achieves ~2× speedup with minimal quality degradation.

Conclusion: E-DiT offers a flexible, efficient solution for accelerating DiTs while preserving generative quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities but remain highly computationally expensive. Previous acceleration methods, such as pruning and distillation, typically rely on a fixed computational capacity, leading to insufficient acceleration and degraded generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{Elastic Diffusion Transformer (E-DiT)}, an adaptive acceleration framework for DiT that effectively improves efficiency while maintaining generation quality. Specifically, we observe that the generative process of DiT exhibits substantial sparsity (i.e., some computations can be skipped with minimal impact on quality), and this sparsity varies significantly across samples. Motivated by this observation, E-DiT equips each DiT block with a lightweight router that dynamically identifies sample-dependent sparsity from the input latent. Each router adaptively determines whether the corresponding block can be skipped. If the block is not skipped, the router then predicts the optimal MLP width reduction ratio within the block. During inference, we further introduce a block-level feature caching mechanism that leverages router predictions to eliminate redundant computations in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments across 2D image (Qwen-Image and FLUX) and 3D asset (Hunyuan3D-3.0) demonstrate the effectiveness of E-DiT, achieving up to $\sim$2$\times$ speedup with negligible loss in generation quality. Code will be available at https://github.com/wangjiangshan0725/Elastic-DiT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialID is a training-free framework for personalized text-to-image generation that spatially adapts identity injection to avoid contaminating non-facial regions, achieving top performance in text adherence, visual consistency, and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods contaminate non-facial regions with identity features, degrading text adherence. SpatialID aims to address this without costly fine-tuning.

Method: SpatialID uses a Spatial Mask Extractor to decouple identity injection into face-relevant and context-free regions, along with a Temporal-Spatial Scheduling strategy for dynamic adjustment.

Result: SpatialID outperforms existing methods in text adherence (CLIP-T: 0.281), visual consistency (CLIP-I: 0.827), and image quality (IQ: 0.523), reducing background contamination.

Conclusion: SpatialID effectively preserves identity while enhancing text adherence and image quality, offering a training-free solution for personalized text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to integrate specific identities into arbitrary contexts. However, existing tuning-free methods typically employ Spatially Uniform Visual Injection, causing identity features to contaminate non-facial regions (e.g., backgrounds and lighting) and degrading text adherence. To address this without expensive fine-tuning, we propose SpatialID, a training-free spatially-adaptive identity modulation framework. SpatialID fundamentally decouples identity injection into face-relevant and context-free regions using a Spatial Mask Extractor derived from cross-attention responses. Furthermore, we introduce a Temporal-Spatial Scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts spatial constraints - transitioning from Gaussian priors to attention-based masks and adaptive relaxation - to align with the diffusion generation dynamics. Extensive experiments on IBench demonstrate that SpatialID achieves state-of-the-art performance in text adherence (CLIP-T: 0.281), visual consistency (CLIP-I: 0.827), and image quality (IQ: 0.523), significantly eliminating background contamination while maintaining robust identity preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of existing pathology foundation models limits their clinical accessibility and scalability, necessitating a more efficient solution.

Method: LitePath integrates LiteFM, a compact model distilled from large PFMs, and APS for task-specific patch selection, reducing parameters and FLOPs.

Result: LitePath achieves 28x fewer parameters, 403.5x lower FLOPs, processes slides faster, and consumes less energy while retaining 99.71% of Virchow2's AUC.

Conclusion: LitePath offers a viable, efficient alternative to large PFMs, balancing accuracy and deployability, and reducing the carbon footprint of AI deployment.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have enabled robust generalization in computational pathology through large-scale datasets and expansive architectures, but their substantial computational cost, particularly for gigapixel whole slide images, limits clinical accessibility and scalability. Here, we present LitePath, a deployment-friendly foundational framework designed to mitigate model over-parameterization and patch level redundancy. LitePath integrates LiteFM, a compact model distilled from three large PFMs (Virchow2, H-Optimus-1 and UNI2) using 190 million patches, and the Adaptive Patch Selector (APS), a lightweight component for task-specific patch selection. The framework reduces model parameters by 28x and lowers FLOPs by 403.5x relative to Virchow2, enabling deployment on low-power edge hardware such as the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super. On this device, LitePath processes 208 slides per hour, 104.5x faster than Virchow2, and consumes 0.36 kWh per 3,000 slides, 171x lower than Virchow2 on an RTX3090 GPU. We validated accuracy using 37 cohorts across four organs and 26 tasks (26 internal, 9 external, and 2 prospective), comprising 15,672 slides from 9,808 patients disjoint from the pretraining data. LitePath ranks second among 19 evaluated models and outperforms larger models including H-Optimus-1, mSTAR, UNI2 and GPFM, while retaining 99.71% of the AUC of Virchow2 on average. To quantify the balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Deployability Score (D-Score), defined as the weighted geometric mean of normalized AUC and normalized FLOP, where LitePath achieves the highest value, surpassing Virchow2 by 10.64%. These results demonstrate that LitePath enables rapid, cost-effective and energy-efficient pathology image analysis on accessible hardware while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art PFMs and reducing the carbon footprint of AI deployment.

TL;DR: Flow4R is a unified framework using camera-space scene flow as a central representation for 3D structure and motion, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods decouple geometry and motion in dynamic 3D scenes, creating inefficiencies. Flow4R aims to unify these aspects.

Method: Flow4R predicts per-pixel properties (3D position, scene flow, pose weight, confidence) from two-view inputs using a Vision Transformer, enabling symmetric inference of geometry and motion.

Result: Flow4R outperforms existing methods in 4D reconstruction and tracking tasks.

Conclusion: The flow-centric representation proves effective for unified spatiotemporal scene understanding.

Abstract: Reconstructing and tracking dynamic 3D scenes remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Existing approaches often decouple geometry from motion: multi-view reconstruction methods assume static scenes, while dynamic tracking frameworks rely on explicit camera pose estimation or separate motion models. We propose Flow4R, a unified framework that treats camera-space scene flow as the central representation linking 3D structure, object motion, and camera motion. Flow4R predicts a minimal per-pixel property set-3D point position, scene flow, pose weight, and confidence-from two-view inputs using a Vision Transformer. This flow-centric formulation allows local geometry and bidirectional motion to be inferred symmetrically with a shared decoder in a single forward pass, without requiring explicit pose regressors or bundle adjustment. Trained jointly on static and dynamic datasets, Flow4R achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4D reconstruction and tracking tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the flow-central representation for spatiotemporal scene understanding.

TL;DR: FLEX is a training-free framework for long video generation that addresses extrapolation failure in autoregressive models by adapting low-frequency components and injecting dynamic priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive video diffusion models struggle with extrapolation failure due to spectral bias and lack of dynamic priors.

Method: FLEX introduces Frequency-aware RoPE Modulation, Antiphase Noise Sampling, and Inference-only Attention Sink to improve long-term video generation.

Result: FLEX outperforms state-of-the-art models at 6× extrapolation and matches fine-tuned baselines at 12×. It enables 4-minute video synthesis.

Conclusion: FLEX effectively bridges the gap between short-term training and long-term inference, offering a plug-and-play solution for horizon extension.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have emerged as a scalable paradigm for long video generation. However, they often suffer from severe extrapolation failure, where rapid error accumulation leads to significant temporal degradation when extending beyond training horizons. We identify that this failure primarily stems from the \textit{spectral bias} of 3D positional embeddings and the lack of \textit{dynamic priors} in noise sampling. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{FLEX} (\textbf{F}requency-aware \textbf{L}ength \textbf{EX}tension), a training-free inference-time framework that bridges the gap between short-term training and long-term inference. FLEX introduces Frequency-aware RoPE Modulation to adaptively interpolate under-trained low-frequency components while extrapolating high-frequency ones to preserve multi-scale temporal discriminability. This is integrated with Antiphase Noise Sampling (ANS) to inject high-frequency dynamic priors and Inference-only Attention Sink to anchor global structure. Extensive evaluations on VBench demonstrate that FLEX significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models at $6\times$ extrapolation (30s duration) and matches the performance of long-video fine-tuned baselines at $12\times$ scale (60s duration). As a plug-and-play augmentation, FLEX seamlessly integrates into existing inference pipelines for horizon extension. It effectively pushes the generation limits of models such as LongLive, supporting consistent and dynamic video synthesis at a 4-minute scale.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An explainability-inspired pruning framework improves efficiency in object detection by using gradient-activation attribution to assess layer importance, outperforming traditional L1-norm methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pruning methods rely on weight magnitudes, which may not reflect functional contributions to performance, prompting a need for data-driven approaches.

Method: A SHAP-inspired gradient-activation attribution is used to estimate layer importance for pruning, tested on various architectures like ResNet-50 and YOLOv8.

Result: The method outperforms L1-norm pruning, improving speed (e.g., 10% faster inference for ShuffleNetV2) and preserving accuracy (e.g., baseline mAP for RetinaNet).

Conclusion: Explainability-inspired pruning offers a principled way to compress DNNs for edge deployment, maintaining performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in object detection tasks, but their increasing complexity poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained platforms. While model compression techniques such as pruning have emerged as essential tools, traditional magnitude-based pruning methods do not necessarily align with the true functional contribution of network components to task-specific performance. In this work, we present an explainability-inspired, layer-wise pruning framework tailored for efficient object detection. Our approach leverages a SHAP-inspired gradient--activation attribution to estimate layer importance, providing a data-driven proxy for functional contribution rather than relying solely on static weight magnitudes. We conduct comprehensive experiments across diverse object detection architectures, including ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and YOLOv8, evaluating performance on the Microsoft COCO 2017 validation set. The results show that the proposed attribution-inspired pruning consistently identifies different layers as least important compared to L1-norm-based methods, leading to improved accuracy--efficiency trade-offs. Notably, for ShuffleNetV2, our method yields a 10\% empirical increase in inference speed, whereas L1-pruning degrades performance by 13.7\%. For RetinaNet, the proposed approach preserves the baseline mAP (0.151) with negligible impact on inference speed, while L1-pruning incurs a 1.3\% mAP drop for a 6.2\% speed increase. These findings highlight the importance of data-driven layer importance assessment and demonstrate that explainability-inspired compression offers a principled direction for deploying deep neural networks on edge and resource-constrained platforms while preserving both performance and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating high-resolution images efficiently using autoregressive models by leveraging binary tokens and diffusion techniques.

Method: BitDance predicts binary visual tokens instead of codebook indices, uses a binary diffusion head for token generation, and introduces next-patch diffusion for parallel token prediction.

Result: Achieves FID of 1.24 on ImageNet 256x256, outperforms parallel AR models with fewer parameters (260M vs. 1.4B), and achieves 8.7x speedup. For 1024x1024 images, achieves 30x speedup.

Conclusion: BitDance demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency, speed, and performance for autoregressive image generation, making it a promising foundation model for further research.

Abstract: We present BitDance, a scalable autoregressive (AR) image generator that predicts binary visual tokens instead of codebook indices. With high-entropy binary latents, BitDance lets each token represent up to $2^{256}$ states, yielding a compact yet highly expressive discrete representation. Sampling from such a huge token space is difficult with standard classification. To resolve this, BitDance uses a binary diffusion head: instead of predicting an index with softmax, it employs continuous-space diffusion to generate the binary tokens. Furthermore, we propose next-patch diffusion, a new decoding method that predicts multiple tokens in parallel with high accuracy, greatly speeding up inference. On ImageNet 256x256, BitDance achieves an FID of 1.24, the best among AR models. With next-patch diffusion, BitDance beats state-of-the-art parallel AR models that use 1.4B parameters, while using 5.4x fewer parameters (260M) and achieving 8.7x speedup. For text-to-image generation, BitDance trains on large-scale multimodal tokens and generates high-resolution, photorealistic images efficiently, showing strong performance and favorable scaling. When generating 1024x1024 images, BitDance achieves a speedup of over 30x compared to prior AR models. We release code and models to facilitate further research on AR foundation models.

*Kai Guan,Rongyuan Wu,Shuai Li,Wentao Zhu,Wenjun Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RASS integrates semantic image restoration with segmentation to improve performance on low-quality images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current restoration models lack semantic recovery, and segmentation models fail under real-world degradations.

Method: Introduce Semantic-Constrained Restoration (SCR) and LoRA-based knowledge transfer in RASS.

Result: SCR and RASS outperform state-of-the-art methods in segmentation and restoration.

Conclusion: RASS effectively enhances semantic segmentation robustness for low-quality images.

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, the performance of semantic segmentation often deteriorates when processing low-quality (LQ) images, which may lack clear semantic structures and high-frequency details. Although image restoration techniques offer a promising direction for enhancing degraded visual content, conventional real-world image restoration (Real-IR) models primarily focus on pixel-level fidelity and often fail to recover task-relevant semantic cues, limiting their effectiveness when directly applied to downstream vision tasks. Conversely, existing segmentation models trained on high-quality data lack robustness under real-world degradations. In this paper, we propose Restoration Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (RASS), which effectively integrates semantic image restoration into the segmentation process, enabling high-quality semantic segmentation on the LQ images directly. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic-Constrained Restoration (SCR) model, which injects segmentation priors into the restoration model by aligning its cross-attention maps with segmentation masks, encouraging semantically faithful image reconstruction. Then, RASS transfers semantic restoration knowledge into segmentation through LoRA-based module merging and task-specific fine-tuning, thereby enhancing the model's robustness to LQ images. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct a real-world LQ image segmentation dataset with high-quality annotations, and conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world LQ benchmarks. The results show that SCR and RASS significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in segmentation and restoration tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing models often alter unintended regions while editing, lacking content consistency.

Method: Uses refined datasets, pixel-level similarity rewards, and region-based regularizers to ensure editing quality and consistency.

Result: Achieves competitive editing scores and better content consistency on benchmarks like GEdit-Bench and ImgEdit-Bench.

Conclusion: CoCoEdit improves content consistency in image editing without compromising editing quality.

Abstract: Image editing has achieved impressive results with the development of large-scale generative models. However, existing models mainly focus on the editing effects of intended objects and regions, often leading to unwanted changes in unintended regions. We present a post-training framework for Content-Consistent Editing (CoCoEdit) via region regularized reinforcement learning. We first augment existing editing datasets with refined instructions and masks, from which 40K diverse and high quality samples are curated as training set. We then introduce a pixel-level similarity reward to complement MLLM-based rewards, enabling models to ensure both editing quality and content consistency during the editing process. To overcome the spatial-agnostic nature of the rewards, we propose a region-based regularizer, aiming to preserve non-edited regions for high-reward samples while encouraging editing effects for low-reward samples. For evaluation, we annotate editing masks for GEdit-Bench and ImgEdit-Bench, introducing pixel-level similarity metrics to measure content consistency and editing quality. Applying CoCoEdit to Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, we achieve not only competitive editing scores with state-of-the-art models, but also significantly better content consistency, measured by PSNR/SSIM metrics and human subjective ratings.

TL;DR: ForgeryVCR enhances MLLMs for image forgery by using visual-centric reasoning and a forensic toolbox, outperforming text-centric methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-centric CoT paradigms in MLLMs struggle with detecting fine-grained pixel-level inconsistencies, leading to hallucinations.

Method: Integrates a forensic toolbox for visual intermediates and employs Strategic Tool Learning (SFT + RL) for efficient tool use.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance in detection and localization, with superior generalization and minimal tool redundancy.

Conclusion: ForgeryVCR’s visual-centric approach and tool learning significantly improve forgery detection and localization.

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for image forgery detection and localization predominantly operate under a text-centric Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm. However, forcing these models to textually characterize imperceptible low-level tampering traces inevitably leads to hallucinations, as linguistic modalities are insufficient to capture such fine-grained pixel-level inconsistencies. To overcome this, we propose ForgeryVCR, a framework that incorporates a forensic toolbox to materialize imperceptible traces into explicit visual intermediates via Visual-Centric Reasoning. To enable efficient tool utilization, we introduce a Strategic Tool Learning post-training paradigm, encompassing gain-driven trajectory construction for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimization guided by a tool utility reward. This paradigm empowers the MLLM to act as a proactive decision-maker, learning to spontaneously invoke multi-view reasoning paths including local zoom-in for fine-grained inspection and the analysis of invisible inconsistencies in compression history, noise residuals, and frequency domains. Extensive experiments reveal that ForgeryVCR achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both detection and localization tasks, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness with minimal tool redundancy.

TL;DR: GeoFusionLRM introduces a geometry-aware self-correction framework to improve 3D reconstruction fidelity by leveraging normal and depth predictions for refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large reconstruction models (LRMs) often produce geometric inconsistencies and misaligned details, limiting the fidelity of 3D reconstructions.

Method: GeoFusionLRM uses the model's own normal and depth predictions to refine structural accuracy. It incorporates geometric cues through a transformer and fusion module, correcting errors and aligning with the input image.

Result: The framework achieves sharper geometry, more consistent normals, and higher fidelity compared to state-of-the-art LRM baselines.

Conclusion: GeoFusionLRM enhances 3D reconstruction quality by self-correcting geometric inconsistencies without requiring additional supervision or external signals.

Abstract: Single-image 3D reconstruction with large reconstruction models (LRMs) has advanced rapidly, yet reconstructions often exhibit geometric inconsistencies and misaligned details that limit fidelity. We introduce GeoFusionLRM, a geometry-aware self-correction framework that leverages the model's own normal and depth predictions to refine structural accuracy. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on features extracted from the input image, GeoFusionLRM feeds back geometric cues through a dedicated transformer and fusion module, enabling the model to correct errors and enforce consistency with the conditioning image. This design improves the alignment between the reconstructed mesh and the input views without additional supervision or external signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoFusionLRM achieves sharper geometry, more consistent normals, and higher fidelity than state-of-the-art LRM baselines.

*Bingwen Zhu,Yuqian Fu,Qiaole Dong,Guolei Sun,Tianwen Qian,Yuzheng Wu,Danda Pani Paudel,Xiangyang Xue,Yanwei Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoSound is a new benchmark for evaluating egocentric sound understanding in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), featuring 7 tasks across 900 videos, revealing current models' limitations in fine-grained spatial and causal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human perception is multisensory, integrating sight, sound, and motion. Sound provides critical cues in egocentric settings, but current MLLMs lack benchmarks for evaluating sound understanding.

Method: EgoSound unifies data from Ego4D and EgoBlind, defines a 7-task taxonomy, and uses a multi-stage auto-generative pipeline to create 7315 QA pairs.

Result: Tests on 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs show emerging auditory reasoning abilities but limitations in spatial and causal understanding.

Conclusion: EgoSound provides a foundation for advancing multisensory egocentric intelligence in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in vision-language understanding. Yet, human perception is inherently multisensory, integrating sight, sound, and motion to reason about the world. Among these modalities, sound provides indispensable cues about spatial layout, off-screen events, and causal interactions, particularly in egocentric settings where auditory and visual signals are tightly coupled. To this end, we introduce EgoSound, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate egocentric sound understanding in MLLMs. EgoSound unifies data from Ego4D and EgoBlind, encompassing both sighted and sound-dependent experiences. It defines a seven-task taxonomy spanning intrinsic sound perception, spatial localization, causal inference, and cross-modal reasoning. Constructed through a multi-stage auto-generative pipeline, EgoSound contains 7315 validated QA pairs across 900 videos. Comprehensive experiments on nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that current models exhibit emerging auditory reasoning abilities but remain limited in fine-grained spatial and causal understanding. EgoSound establishes a challenging foundation for advancing multisensory egocentric intelligence, bridging the gap between seeing and truly hearing the world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenseMLLM enables MLLMs to perform fine-grained dense predictions without task-specific decoders, maintaining simplicity and competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs require complex, task-specific decoders for dense predictions, limiting their practicality and deviating from generalist design.

Method: Introduces DenseMLLM with a novel vision token supervision strategy for multiple labels/tasks, avoiding architectural specialization.

Result: Achieves competitive performance across dense prediction and vision-language benchmarks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that standard MLLMs can support dense perception effectively without specialized decoders.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in high-level visual understanding. However, extending these models to fine-grained dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, typically necessitates the incorporation of complex, task-specific decoders and other customizations. This architectural fragmentation increases model complexity and deviates from the generalist design of MLLMs, ultimately limiting their practicality. In this work, we challenge this paradigm by accommodating standard MLLMs to perform dense predictions without requiring additional task-specific decoders. The proposed model is called DenseMLLM, grounded in the standard architecture with a novel vision token supervision strategy for multiple labels and tasks. Despite its minimalist design, our model achieves highly competitive performance across a wide range of dense prediction and vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that a standard, general-purpose MLLM can effectively support dense perception without architectural specialization.

Motivation: To address the high cost and inefficiency of traditional mechanized chestnut harvesting by developing low-cost, vision-guided automated harvesting technology.

Method: The study collected 319 images with 6524 annotated chestnuts and systematically evaluated 29 state-of-the-art real-time object detectors (YOLO and RT-DETR families) for detection accuracy and inference speed.

Result: YOLOv12m achieved the highest mAP@0.5 (95.1%), and YOLOv11x scored best in mAP@[0.5:0.95] (80.1%). YOLO models surpassed RT-DETR models in both accuracy and inference speed.

Conclusion: YOLO models are better suited for real-time chestnut detection and on-board deployment. The dataset and software have been shared publicly to support further research.

Abstract: Traditional mechanized chestnut harvesting is too costly for small producers, non-selective, and prone to damaging nuts. Accurate, reliable detection of chestnuts on the orchard floor is crucial for developing low-cost, vision-guided automated harvesting technology. However, developing a reliable chestnut detection system faces challenges in complex environments with shading, varying natural light conditions, and interference from weeds, fallen leaves, stones, and other foreign on-ground objects, which have remained unaddressed. This study collected 319 images of chestnuts on the orchard floor, containing 6524 annotated chestnuts. A comprehensive set of 29 state-of-the-art real-time object detectors, including 14 in the YOLO (v11-13) and 15 in the RT-DETR (v1-v4) families at varied model scales, was systematically evaluated through replicated modeling experiments for chestnut detection. Experimental results show that the YOLOv12m model achieves the best mAP@0.5 of 95.1% among all the evaluated models, while the RT-DETRv2-R101 was the most accurate variant among RT-DETR models, with mAP@0.5 of 91.1%. In terms of mAP@[0.5:0.95], the YOLOv11x model achieved the best accuracy of 80.1%. All models demonstrate significant potential for real-time chestnut detection, and YOLO models outperformed RT-DETR models in terms of both detection accuracy and inference, making them better suited for on-board deployment. Both the dataset and software programs in this study have been made publicly available at https://github.com/AgFood-Sensing-and-Intelligence-Lab/ChestnutDetection.

Result: Accurate overlay of trocar sites on phantoms achieved, showing consistent spatial alignment between virtual plans and real anatomy.

Conclusion: ARport offers a marker-free, hardware-minimal solution for visualizing trocar plans, enhancing clinical workflow efficiency.

Abstract: Purpose: Precise port placement is a critical step in robot-assisted surgery, where port configuration influences both visual access to the operative field and instrument maneuverability. To bridge the gap between preoperative planning and intraoperative execution, we present ARport, an augmented reality (AR) system that automatically maps pre-planned trocar layouts onto the patient's body surface, providing intuitive spatial guidance during surgical preparation. Methods: ARport, implemented on an optical see-through head-mounted display (OST-HMD), operates without any external sensors or markers, simplifying setup and enhancing workflow integration. It reconstructs the operative scene from RGB, depth, and pose data captured by the OST-HMD, extracts the patient's body surface using a foundation model, and performs surface-based markerless registration to align preoperative anatomical models to the extracted patient's body surface, enabling in-situ visualization of planned trocar layouts. A demonstration video illustrating the overall workflow is available online. Results: In full-scale human-phantom experiments, ARport accurately overlaid pre-planned trocar sites onto the physical phantom, achieving consistent spatial correspondence between virtual plans and real anatomy. Conclusion: ARport provides a fully marker-free and hardware-minimal solution for visualizing preoperative trocar plans directly on the patient's body surface. The system facilitates efficient intraoperative setup and demonstrates potential for seamless integration into routine clinical workflows.

TL;DR: Text-driven image/video editing is framed as inpainting, with recent methods using costly VJP computations. This paper improves efficiency and extends evaluation, showing test-time guidance can match or outperform training-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of costly VJP computations in test-time guidance for diffusion and flow models, making text-driven editing more practical.

Method: Builds on Moufad et al.'s VJP-free approximation, extends empirical evaluation to large-scale benchmarks.

Result: Test-time guidance achieves performance comparable or superior to training-based methods.

Conclusion: Efficient test-time guidance is viable for high-quality text-driven image/video editing, reducing reliance on costly computations.

Abstract: Text-driven image and video editing can be naturally cast as inpainting problems, where masked regions are reconstructed to remain consistent with both the observed content and the editing prompt. Recent advances in test-time guidance for diffusion and flow models provide a principled framework for this task; however, existing methods rely on costly vector--Jacobian product (VJP) computations to approximate the intractable guidance term, limiting their practical applicability. Building upon the recent work of Moufad et al. (2025), we provide theoretical insights into their VJP-free approximation and substantially extend their empirical evaluation to large-scale image and video editing benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that test-time guidance alone can achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases surpass, training-based methods.

TL;DR: SEAL is a self-supervised learning framework integrating spatial transcriptomics with pathology vision encoders, enhancing molecular and morphological coupling for improved histological representations and cross-modal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage spatially resolved gene expression data (ST) for improving pathology vision encoders by systematically integrating molecular and morphological information.

Method: SEAL, a parameter-efficient finetuning method, trains on 700,000 paired gene expression-tissue region examples and is tested on slide- and patch-level tasks.

Result: SEAL outperforms vision-only and ST baselines across molecular status, pathway activity, treatment response, and gene expression prediction tasks, with robust domain generalization and cross-modal capabilities.

Conclusion: SEAL demonstrates the effectiveness of augmenting pathology models with molecular supervision, enhancing visual representations and cross-modal utility.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides spatially resolved measurements of gene expression, enabling characterization of the molecular landscape of human tissue beyond histological assessment as well as localized readouts that can be aligned with morphology. Concurrently, the success of multimodal foundation models that integrate vision with complementary modalities suggests that morphomolecular coupling between local expression and morphology can be systematically used to improve histological representations themselves. We introduce Spatial Expression-Aligned Learning (SEAL), a vision-omics self-supervised learning framework that infuses localized molecular information into pathology vision encoders. Rather than training new encoders from scratch, SEAL is designed as a parameter-efficient vision-omics finetuning method that can be flexibly applied to widely used pathology foundation models. We instantiate SEAL by training on over 700,000 paired gene expression spot-tissue region examples spanning tumor and normal samples from 14 organs. Tested across 38 slide-level and 15 patch-level downstream tasks, SEAL provides a drop-in replacement for pathology foundation models that consistently improves performance over widely used vision-only and ST prediction baselines on slide-level molecular status, pathway activity, and treatment response prediction, as well as patch-level gene expression prediction tasks. Additionally, SEAL encoders exhibit robust domain generalization on out-of-distribution evaluations and enable new cross-modal capabilities such as gene-to-image retrieval. Our work proposes a general framework for ST-guided finetuning of pathology foundation models, showing that augmenting existing models with localized molecular supervision is an effective and practical step for improving visual representations and expanding their cross-modal utility.

Motivation: Existing visual tokenizers struggle to balance high-fidelity reconstruction, semantic extraction, and generative suitability. UniWeTok aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Employs a massive binary codebook, Pre-Post Distillation, Generative-Aware Prior, a convolution-attention hybrid architecture with SigLu activation, and a three-stage training framework.

Result: Achieves SOTA image generation (FID: 1.38), competitive multimodal understanding, and editing scores. Requires fewer training tokens (33B vs. 262B).

Conclusion: UniWeTok effectively unifies conflicting objectives, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency, with released code and models for community use.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require a visual representation that simultaneously supports high-fidelity reconstruction, complex semantic extraction, and generative suitability. However, existing visual tokenizers typically struggle to satisfy these conflicting objectives within a single framework. In this paper, we introduce UniWeTok, a unified discrete tokenizer designed to bridge this gap using a massive binary codebook ($\mathit{2^{128}}$). For training framework, we introduce Pre-Post Distillation and a Generative-Aware Prior to enhance the semantic extraction and generative prior of the discrete tokens. In terms of model architecture, we propose a convolution-attention hybrid architecture with the SigLu activation function. SigLu activation not only bounds the encoder output and stabilizes the semantic distillation process but also effectively addresses the optimization conflict between token entropy loss and commitment loss. We further propose a three-stage training framework designed to enhance UniWeTok's adaptability cross various image resolutions and perception-sensitive scenarios, such as those involving human faces and textual content. On ImageNet, UniWeTok achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance (FID: UniWeTok 1.38 vs. REPA 1.42) while requiring a remarkably low training compute (Training Tokens: UniWeTok 33B vs. REPA 262B). On general-domain, UniWeTok demonstrates highly competitive capabilities across a broad range of tasks, including multimodal understanding, image generation (DPG Score: UniWeTok 86.63 vs. FLUX.1 [Dev] 83.84), and editing (GEdit Overall Score: UniWeTok 5.09 vs. OmniGen 5.06). We release code and models to facilitate community exploration of unified tokenizer and MLLM.

Motivation: Existing methods struggle with consistency across multiple conditions due to limited interaction between reference inputs.

Method: Introduces SELF for unified input representation and a two-stage training framework (SFT and RL with MSGRPO) to improve consistency and visual fidelity.

Result: Achieves improved compositional consistency and visual fidelity by dynamically serializing references and progressive training.

Conclusion: UniRef-Image-Edit effectively unifies single and multi-image tasks, offering open-source resources for community research.

Abstract: We present UniRef-Image-Edit, a high-performance multi-modal generation system that unifies single-image editing and multi-image composition within a single framework. Existing diffusion-based editing methods often struggle to maintain consistency across multiple conditions due to limited interaction between reference inputs. To address this, we introduce Sequence-Extended Latent Fusion (SELF), a unified input representation that dynamically serializes multiple reference images into a coherent latent sequence. During a dedicated training stage, all reference images are jointly constrained to fit within a fixed-length sequence under a global pixel-budget constraint. Building upon SELF, we propose a two-stage training framework comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we jointly train on single-image editing and multi-image composition tasks to establish a robust generative prior. We adopt a progressive sequence length training strategy, in which all input images are initially resized to a total pixel budget of $1024^2$, and are then gradually increased to $1536^2$ and $2048^2$ to improve visual fidelity and cross-reference consistency. This gradual relaxation of compression enables the model to incrementally capture finer visual details while maintaining stable alignment across references. For the RL stage, we introduce Multi-Source GRPO (MSGRPO), to our knowledge the first reinforcement learning framework tailored for multi-reference image generation. MSGRPO optimizes the model to reconcile conflicting visual constraints, significantly enhancing compositional consistency. We will open-source the code, models, training data, and reward data for community research purposes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zoom-enabled MLLMs fail due to Tool Usage Homogenization, limiting effective evidence acquisition in UHR remote sensing VQA.

Method: GeoEyes uses a staged training framework with UHR-CoZ dataset and AdaZoom-GRPO reinforcement learning to reward evidence gain and answer improvement.

Result: The model achieves 54.23% accuracy on XLRS-Bench.

Conclusion: GeoEyes successfully addresses tool homogenization, enabling effective zooming behavior for UHR remote sensing tasks.

Abstract: The "thinking-with-images" paradigm enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to actively explore visual scenes via zoom-in tools. This is essential for ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing VQA, where task-relevant cues are sparse and tiny. However, we observe a consistent failure mode in existing zoom-enabled MLLMs: Tool Usage Homogenization, where tool calls collapse into task-agnostic patterns, limiting effective evidence acquisition. To address this, we propose GeoEyes, a staged training framework consisting of (1) a cold-start SFT dataset, UHR Chain-of-Zoom (UHR-CoZ), which covers diverse zooming regimes, and (2) an agentic reinforcement learning method, AdaZoom-GRPO, that explicitly rewards evidence gain and answer improvement during zoom interactions. The resulting model learns on-demand zooming with proper stopping behavior and achieves substantial improvements on UHR remote sensing benchmarks, with 54.23% accuracy on XLRS-Bench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct human annotation for content-aware streaming is costly, and existing saliency models perform poorly. HiVid aims to use LLMs as a scalable proxy for human-like weight generation.

Method: HiVid introduces three modules: a perception module for local context understanding, a ranking module for global consistency in VOD, and a prediction module for low-latency live streaming with future weight prediction.

Result: HiVid improves weight prediction accuracy by 11.5% for VOD and 26% for live streaming over SOTA baselines, enhancing QoE correlation by 14.7% in real-world studies.

Conclusion: HiVid effectively addresses key challenges in content-aware streaming, demonstrating superior performance and scalability using LLMs.

Abstract: Content-aware streaming requires dynamic, chunk-level importance weights to optimize subjective quality of experience (QoE). However, direct human annotation is prohibitively expensive while vision-saliency models generalize poorly. We introduce HiVid, the first framework to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as a scalable human proxy to generate high-fidelity weights for both Video-on-Demand (VOD) and live streaming. We address 3 non-trivial challenges: (1) To extend LLMs' limited modality and circumvent token limits, we propose a perception module to assess frames in a local context window, autoregressively building a coherent understanding of the video. (2) For VOD with rating inconsistency across local windows, we propose a ranking module to perform global re-ranking with a novel LLM-guided merge-sort algorithm. (3) For live streaming which requires low-latency, online inference without future knowledge, we propose a prediction module to predict future weights with a multi-modal time series model, which comprises a content-aware attention and adaptive horizon to accommodate asynchronous LLM inference. Extensive experiments show HiVid improves weight prediction accuracy by up to 11.5\% for VOD and 26\% for live streaming over SOTA baselines. Real-world user study validates HiVid boosts streaming QoE correlation by 14.7\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with static scenes or rely on motion cues, prompting the need for a single-image solution using dual-pixel sensors.

Method: The proposed Freq-DP Net combines geometric priors from defocus disparity and structural priors via Fast Fourier Convolution, fused by an attention mechanism.

Result: Experiments show Freq-DP Net surpasses baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance on single-image fence removal.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages dual-pixel sensors and innovative priors for superior fence occlusion removal.

Abstract: Removing fence occlusions from single images is a challenging task that degrades visual quality and limits downstream computer vision applications. Existing methods often fail on static scenes or require motion cues from multiple frames. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the first framework to leverage dual-pixel (DP) sensors for this problem. We propose Freq-DP Net, a novel dual-branch network that fuses two complementary priors: a geometric prior from defocus disparity, modeled using an explicit cost volume, and a structural prior of the fence's global pattern, learned via Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC). An attention mechanism intelligently merges these cues for highly accurate fence segmentation. To validate our approach, we build and release a diverse benchmark with different fence varieties. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong general-purpose baselines, establishing a new state-of-the-art for single-image, DP-based fence removal.

TL;DR: The paper introduces topologically-augmented datasets (ModelNet40 and ShapeNet) and a deep learning method (TopoGAT) to enhance 3D shape analysis by combining geometric and topological features, outperforming traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets focus on geometric details but lack topological information, limiting comprehensive 3D shape analysis. This work bridges the gap by integrating persistent homology features.

Method: The authors enrich point clouds with persistent homology features and propose TopoGAT, a deep learning method to select significant topological features automatically.

Result: TopoGAT outperforms traditional statistical methods in stability and discriminative power. It improves accuracy in classification and segmentation tasks when integrated into standard pipelines.

Conclusion: The enriched datasets and TopoGAT method facilitate unified geometry-topology learning, advancing topology-aware deep learning for 3D point cloud analysis.

Abstract: Geometry and topology constitute complementary descriptors of three-dimensional shape, yet existing benchmark datasets primarily capture geometric information while neglecting topological structure. This work addresses this limitation by introducing topologically-enriched versions of ModelNet40 and ShapeNet, where each point cloud is augmented with its corresponding persistent homology features. These benchmarks with the topological signatures establish a foundation for unified geometry-topology learning and enable systematic evaluation of topology-aware deep learning architectures for 3D shape analysis. Building on this foundation, we propose a deep learning-based significant persistent point selection method, \textit{TopoGAT}, that learns to identify the most informative topological features directly from input data and the corresponding topological signatures, circumventing the limitations of hand-crafted statistical selection criteria. A comparative study verifies the superiority of the proposed method over traditional statistical approaches in terms of stability and discriminative power. Integrating the selected significant persistent points into standard point cloud classification and part-segmentation pipelines yields improvements in both classification accuracy and segmentation metrics. The presented topologically-enriched datasets, coupled with our learnable significant feature selection approach, enable the broader integration of persistent homology into the practical deep learning workflows for 3D point cloud analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address memory bottleneck in VLMs by avoiding computational waste from reactive eviction strategies.

Method: Uses temporal (optical flow) and spatial (saliency detection) filters for proactive memory management.

Result: 2.20x memory compression, 100% accuracy on benchmarks (BLEU, ROUGE-L, Exact Match).

Conclusion: Enables efficient long-form video processing on consumer hardware without performance degradation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a critical memory bottleneck when processing long-form video content due to the linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache with sequence length. Existing solutions predominantly employ reactive eviction strategies that compute full attention matrices before discarding tokens, resulting in substantial computational waste. We propose Sali-Cache, a novel a priori optimization framework that implements dual-signal adaptive caching through proactive memory management. By integrating a temporal filter based on optical flow analysis for detecting inter-frame redundancy and a spatial filter leveraging saliency detection for identifying visually significant regions, Sali-Cache intelligently manages memory allocation before entering computationally expensive attention operations. Experimental evaluation on the LLaVA 1.6 architecture demonstrates that our method achieves a 2.20x compression ratio in effective memory usage while maintaining 100% accuracy across BLEU, ROUGE-L, and Exact Match metrics. Furthermore, under identical memory budget constraints, Sali-Cache preserves context-rich features over extended temporal durations without degrading model performance, enabling efficient processing of long-form video content on consumer-grade hardware.

Method: AbracADDbra uses touch priors for spatial grounding, a vision-language transformer for placement, and a diffusion model for object generation and masking.

Result: The framework outperforms baselines in placement accuracy and achieves high-fidelity edits, with placement accuracy strongly correlating with final edit quality.

Conclusion: This work improves accessibility and efficiency in creative tools by addressing usability issues with intuitive touch-guided methods.

Abstract: Instruction-based object addition is often hindered by the ambiguity of text-only prompts or the tedious nature of mask-based inputs. To address this usability gap, we introduce AbracADDbra, a user-friendly framework that leverages intuitive touch priors to spatially ground succinct instructions for precise placement. Our efficient, decoupled architecture uses a vision-language transformer for touch-guided placement, followed by a diffusion model that jointly generates the object and an instance mask for high-fidelity blending. To facilitate standardized evaluation, we contribute the Touch2Add benchmark for this interactive task. Our extensive evaluations, where our placement model significantly outperforms both random placement and general-purpose VLM baselines, confirm the framework's ability to produce high-fidelity edits. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong correlation between initial placement accuracy and final edit quality, validating our decoupled approach. This work thus paves the way for more accessible and efficient creative tools.

### [106] [Moving Beyond Sparse Grounding with Complete Screen Parsing Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14276)
*A. Said Gurbuz,Sunghwan Hong,Ahmed Nassar,Marc Pollefeys,Peter Staar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ScreenParse, a large-scale dataset for complete screen parsing with dense annotations, and ScreenVLM, a compact vision language model trained on it, which outperforms larger models and improves UI understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of sparse supervision in grounding datasets for computer-use agents (CUAs), which restricts coverage and generalization, and the need for efficient, low-latency on-device deployment.

Method: ScreenParse is created using Webshot, an automated pipeline for rendering URLs, extracting annotations, and applying VLM-based relabeling. ScreenVLM is trained on this dataset using a structure-aware loss for decoding ScreenTag markup.

Result: ScreenVLM outperforms larger foundation VLMs on dense parsing (e.g., 0.592 vs. 0.294 PageIoU) and shows strong transfer to public benchmarks. Finetuning foundation VLMs on ScreenParse improves their grounding performance.

Conclusion: Dense screen supervision provides transferable structural priors for UI understanding, and ScreenParse/ScreenVLM offer a scalable and efficient solution for screen parsing.

Abstract: Modern computer-use agents (CUA) must perceive a screen as a structured state, what elements are visible, where they are, and what text they contain, before they can reliably ground instructions and act. Yet, most available grounding datasets provide sparse supervision, with insufficient and low-diversity labels that annotate only a small subset of task-relevant elements per screen, which limits both coverage and generalization; moreover, practical deployment requires efficiency to enable low-latency, on-device use. We introduce ScreenParse, a large-scale dataset for complete screen parsing, with dense annotations of all visible UI elements (boxes, 55-class types, and text) across 771K web screenshots (21M elements). ScreenParse is generated by Webshot, an automated, scalable pipeline that renders diverse urls, extracts annotations and applies VLM-based relabeling and quality filtering. Using ScreenParse, we train ScreenVLM, a compact, 316M-parameter vision language model (VLM) that decodes a compact ScreenTag markup representation with a structure-aware loss that upweights structure-critical tokens. ScreenVLM substantially outperforms much larger foundation VLMs on dense parsing (e.g., 0.592 vs. 0.294 PageIoU on ScreenParse) and shows strong transfer to public benchmarks. Moreover, finetuning foundation VLMs on ScreenParse consistently improves their grounding performance, suggesting that dense screen supervision provides transferable structural priors for UI understanding.

*Andreas L. Teigen,Annette Stahl,Rudolf Mester*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores combining photometric and geometric features for relative pose optimization but finds it doesn't outperform re-projection error methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify photometric and geometric feature paradigms for improved accuracy and robustness in pose optimization.

Method: Uses densely sampled geometric descriptors to replace photometric error, enabling sub-pixel accuracy and descriptor expressiveness.

Result: The method achieves accurate tracking but doesn't surpass re-projection error-based strategies.

Conclusion: The descriptor similarity metric's slow variation may not align well with keypoint placement accuracy.

Abstract: One of the fundamental problems in computer vision is the two-frame relative pose optimization problem. Primarily, two different kinds of error values are used: photometric error and re-projection error. The selection of error value is usually directly dependent on the selection of feature paradigm, photometric features, or geometric features. It is a trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and the possibility of loop closing. We investigate a third method that combines the strengths of both paradigms into a unified approach. Using densely sampled geometric feature descriptors, we replace the photometric error with a descriptor residual from a dense set of descriptors, thereby enabling the employment of sub-pixel accuracy in differential photometric methods, along with the expressiveness of the geometric feature descriptor. Experiments show that although the proposed strategy is an interesting approach that results in accurate tracking, it ultimately does not outperform pose optimization strategies based on re-projection error despite utilizing more information. We proceed to analyze the underlying reason for this discrepancy and present the hypothesis that the descriptor similarity metric is too slowly varying and does not necessarily correspond strictly to keypoint placement accuracy.

*Areez Muhammed Shabu,Mohammad Samar Ansari,Asra Aslam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses skin tone imbalance in AI skin cancer detection by using generative augmentation with Stable Diffusion to create synthetic dark-skin images, improving segmentation and classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI tools for skin cancer detection are biased due to underrepresentation of dark skin tones in datasets, leading to unfair healthcare outcomes.

Method: A generative augmentation pipeline fine-tunes Stable Diffusion with LoRA on dark-skin subset of ISIC dataset to produce synthetic images, tested on lesion segmentation and binary classification.

Result: Models trained on augmented data showed improved segmentation metrics (IoU, Dice) and classification accuracy (92.14%).

Conclusion: Generative AI-enhanced synthetic data can mitigate bias and improve fairness in dermatological diagnostics.

Abstract: Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide and early detection is critical for effective treatment. However, current AI diagnostic tools are often trained on datasets dominated by lighter skin tones, leading to reduced accuracy and fairness for people with darker skin. The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset, one of the most widely used benchmarks, contains over 70% light skin images while dark skins fewer than 8%. This imbalance poses a significant barrier to equitable healthcare delivery and highlights the urgent need for methods that address demographic diversity in medical imaging. This paper addresses this challenge of skin tone imbalance in automated skin cancer detection using dermoscopic images. To overcome this, we present a generative augmentation pipeline that fine-tunes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the image dark-skin subset of the ISIC dataset and generates synthetic dermoscopic images conditioned on lesion type and skin tone. In this study, we investigated the utility of these images on two downstream tasks: lesion segmentation and binary classification. For segmentation, models trained on the augmented dataset and evaluated on held-out real images show consistent improvements in IoU, Dice coefficient, and boundary accuracy. These evalutions provides the verification of Generated dataset. For classification, an EfficientNet-B0 model trained on the augmented dataset achieved 92.14% accuracy. This paper demonstrates that synthetic data augmentation with Generative AI integration can substantially reduce bias with increase fairness in conventional dermatological diagnostics and open challenges for future directions.

*Shun Kato,Yasushi Kondo,Shuntaro Saito,Yoshimitsu Aoki,Mariko Isogawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for detecting rheumatoid arthritis (RA) inflammation from RGB hand images, addressing challenges like data scarcity and imbalance, and shows improved performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of RA inflammation is crucial to prevent irreversible joint damage, but specialist care delays highlight the need for accessible RGB image-based detection systems.

Method: The authors introduce a detection framework with a global-local encoder, combining self-supervised pretraining on healthy hand images and imbalance-aware training.

Result: The framework outperforms baselines, improving F1-score by 0.2 and Gmean by 0.25 points.

Conclusion: The study advances RGB-based RA inflammation detection, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by systemic joint inflammation. Early diagnosis and tight follow-up are essential to the management of RA, as ongoing inflammation can cause irreversible joint damage. The detection of arthritis is important for diagnosis and assessment of disease activity; however, it often takes a long time for patients to receive appropriate specialist care. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop systems that can detect joint inflammation easily using RGB images captured at home. Consequently, we tackle the task of RA inflammation detection from RGB hand images. This task is highly challenging due to general issues in medical imaging, such as the scarcity of positive samples, data imbalance, and the inherent difficulty of the task itself. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing work has explicitly addressed these challenges in RGB-based RA inflammation detection. This paper quantitatively demonstrates the difficulty of visually detecting inflammation by constructing a dedicated dataset, and we propose a inflammation detection framework with global local encoder that combines self-supervised pretraining on large-scale healthy hand images with imbalance-aware training to detect RA-related joint inflammation from RGB hand images. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed approach improves F1-score by 0.2 points and Gmean by 0.25 points compared with the baseline model.

*Yuliang Wu,Wei Zhai,Yuxin Cui,Tiesong Zhao,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an event-frame fusion framework for Visual Deformation Measurement (VDM), combining temporally dense motion cues from events with spatially precise estimations from frames. It introduces an Affine Invariant Simplicial (AIS) framework and a neighborhood-greedy optimization strategy to improve efficiency and reduce errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image-based VDM methods struggle with highly dynamic scenes or require costly high-speed cameras. The goal is to overcome these limitations by leveraging event and frame data for better performance and efficiency.

Method: The proposed framework fuses event and frame data, using events for dense motion cues and frames for precise spatial estimation. It employs an AIS framework for linearized sub-region partitioning and a neighborhood-greedy optimization strategy to reduce errors and improve convergence.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 1.6% in survival rate while using only 18.9% of the data storage and processing resources of high-speed video methods.

Conclusion: The event-frame fusion approach, combined with AIS and neighborhood-greedy optimization, offers an efficient and accurate solution for VDM in dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Visual Deformation Measurement (VDM) aims to recover dense deformation fields by tracking surface motion from camera observations. Traditional image-based methods rely on minimal inter-frame motion to constrain the correspondence search space, which limits their applicability to highly dynamic scenes or necessitates high-speed cameras at the cost of prohibitive storage and computational overhead. We propose an event-frame fusion framework that exploits events for temporally dense motion cues and frames for spatially dense precise estimation. Revisiting the solid elastic modeling prior, we propose an Affine Invariant Simplicial (AIS) framework. It partitions the deformation field into linearized sub-regions with low-parametric representation, effectively mitigating motion ambiguities arising from sparse and noisy events. To speed up parameter searching and reduce error accumulation, a neighborhood-greedy optimization strategy is introduced, enabling well-converged sub-regions to guide their poorly-converged neighbors, effectively suppress local error accumulation in long-term dense tracking. To evaluate the proposed method, a benchmark dataset with temporally aligned event streams and frames is established, encompassing over 120 sequences spanning diverse deformation scenarios. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by 1.6% in survival rate. Remarkably, it achieves this using only 18.9% of the data storage and processing resources of high-speed video methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We describe an adaptation of VACE (Video All-in-one Creation and Editing) for real-time autoregressive video generation. VACE provides unified video control (reference guidance, structural conditioning, inpainting, and temporal extension) but assumes bidirectional attention over full sequences, making it incompatible with streaming pipelines that require fixed chunk sizes and causal attention. The key modification moves reference frames from the diffusion latent space into a parallel conditioning pathway, preserving the fixed chunk sizes and KV caching that autoregressive models require. This adaptation reuses existing pretrained VACE weights without additional training. Across 1.3B and 14B model scales, VACE adds 20-30% latency overhead for structural control and inpainting, with negligible VRAM cost relative to the base model. Reference-to-video fidelity is severely degraded compared to batch VACE due to causal attention constraints. A reference implementation is available at https://github.com/daydreamlive/scope.

*In Chong Choi,Jiacheng Zhang,Feng Liu,Yiliao Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPA is a multi-turn adaptive prompting attack for vision-language models that alternates text-vision actions and refines attacks iteratively, improving success rates by 11-35%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-turn jailbreaks fail against vision-language models due to easily triggered defenses from malicious visuals.

Method: MAPA alternates text-vision attack actions per turn and refines trajectories iteratively to amplify maliciousness.

Result: MAPA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, increasing attack success rates by 11-35% on benchmarks.

Conclusion: MAPA effectively bypasses defenses in vision-language models through adaptive multi-turn strategies.

Abstract: Multi-turn jailbreak attacks are effective against text-only large language models (LLMs) by gradually introducing malicious content across turns. When extended to large vision-language models (LVLMs), we find that naively adding visual inputs can cause existing multi-turn jailbreaks to be easily defended. For example, overly malicious visual input will easily trigger the defense mechanism of safety-aligned LVLMs, making the response more conservative. To address this, we propose MAPA: a multi-turn adaptive prompting attack that 1) at each turn, alternates text-vision attack actions to elicit the most malicious response; and 2) across turns, adjusts the attack trajectory through iterative back-and-forth refinement to gradually amplify response maliciousness. This two-level design enables MAPA to consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods, improving attack success rates by 11-35% on recent benchmarks against LLaVA-V1.6-Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: pFedNavi proposes a personalized federated learning framework for Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) to address privacy concerns and cross-client heterogeneity, improving performance over FedAvg.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns in VLN due to large-scale trajectory data and extreme heterogeneity across clients necessitate a personalized approach.

Method: pFedNavi uses layer-wise mixing coefficients for adaptive personalization and fine-grained parameter fusion on critical components.

Result: Achieves up to 7.5% improvement in navigation success and 7.8% gain in trajectory fidelity, converging 1.38x faster under non-IID conditions.

Conclusion: pFedNavi effectively balances global knowledge sharing with local specialization, outperforming FedAvg in VLN benchmarks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation VLN requires large-scale trajectory instruction data from private indoor environments, raising significant privacy concerns. Federated Learning FL mitigates this by keeping data on-device, but vanilla FL struggles under VLNs' extreme cross-client heterogeneity in environments and instruction styles, making a single global model suboptimal. This paper proposes pFedNavi, a structure-aware and dynamically adaptive personalized federated learning framework tailored for VLN. Our key idea is to personalize where it matters: pFedNavi adaptively identifies client-specific layers via layer-wise mixing coefficients, and performs fine-grained parameter fusion on the selected components (e.g., the encoder-decoder projection and environment-sensitive decoder layers) to balance global knowledge sharing with local specialization. We evaluate pFedNavi on two standard VLN benchmarks, R2R and RxR, using both ResNet and CLIP visual representations. Across all metrics, pFedNavi consistently outperforms the FedAvg-based VLN baseline, achieving up to 7.5% improvement in navigation success rate and up to 7.8% gain in trajectory fidelity, while converging 1.38x faster under non-IID conditions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a feature recalibration-based olfactory-visual multimodal model for fine-grained rice deterioration detection, improving accuracy and simplifying the process compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal methods for rice deterioration detection are limited in representing fine-grained features, rely on costly devices, and prolong data acquisition time.

Method: Introduces FDEC for reconstructing labeled multimodal embedded-feature datasets and FDRA-Net to emphasize signal variations and increase sensitivity to fine-grained deterioration.

Result: Achieves a classification accuracy of 99.89%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while simplifying detection.

Conclusion: The method is accurate and operationally simple, with potential applications in other agrifood sectors.

Abstract: Multimodal methods are widely used in rice deterioration detection, which exhibit limited capability in representing and extracting fine-grained abnormal features. Moreover, these methods rely on devices, such as hyperspectral cameras and mass spectrometers, increasing detection costs and prolonging data acquisition time. To address these issues, we propose a feature recalibration based olfactory-visual multimodal model for fine-grained rice deterioration detection. The fine-grained deterioration embedding constructor (FDEC) is proposed to reconstruct the labeled multimodal embedded-feature dataset, enhancing sample representation. The fine-grained deterioration recalibration attention network (FDRA-Net) is proposed to emphasize signal variations and increase sensitivity to fine-grained deterioration on the rice surface. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 99.89%. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the detection accuracy is improved and the procedure is simplified. Furthermore, field detection demonstrates the advantages of accuracy and operational simplicity. The proposed method can also be extended to other agrifood in agriculture and food industry.

*Haichao Zhu,Zhaorui Yang,Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating learning-based methods with geometric algorithms for spatial perception, finding that learning alone is unreliable but benefits from geometric validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether learning components should replace geometric estimation or serve as intermediate modules in spatial perception systems.

Method: Proposes an end-to-end modular framework: learning generates hypotheses, and geometric algorithms make final decisions. Evaluated using VGGT for pose/depth proposals and RGB-D ICP backend on TUM RGB-D benchmark.

Result: Learning-based proposals alone are unreliable; misaligned geometry degrades performance; geometrically aligned learning proposals with geometric disposal improve results.

Conclusion: Geometric validation is essential for robust spatial perception, emphasizing modular, geometry-aware system design.

Abstract: Spatial perception aims to estimate camera motion and scene structure from visual observations, a problem traditionally addressed through geometric modeling and physical consistency constraints. Recent learning-based methods have demonstrated strong representational capacity for geometric perception and are increasingly used to augment classical geometry-centric systems in practice. However, whether learning components should directly replace geometric estimation or instead serve as intermediate modules within such pipelines remains an open question.
  In this work, we address this gap and investigate an end-to-end modular framework for effective spatial reasoning, where learning proposes geometric hypotheses, while geometric algorithms dispose estimation decisions. In particular, we study this principle in the context of relative camera pose estimation on RGB-D sequences. Using VGGT as a representative learning model, we evaluate learning-based pose and depth proposals under varying motion magnitudes and scene dynamics, followed by a classical point-to-plane RGB-D ICP as the geometric backend. Our experiments on the TUM RGB-D benchmark reveal three consistent findings: (1) learning-based pose proposals alone are unreliable; (2) learning-proposed geometry, when improperly aligned with camera intrinsics, can degrade performance; and (3) when learning-proposed depth is geometrically aligned and followed by a geometric disposal stage, consistent improvements emerge in moderately challenging rigid settings.
  These results demonstrate that geometry is not merely a refinement component, but an essential arbiter that validates and absorbs learning-based geometric observations. Our study highlights the importance of modular, geometry-aware system design for robust spatial perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study analyzes VIO performance under degraded sensing in XR systems, revealing visual faults cause smaller errors (~cm) while inertial faults lead to larger deviations (~100s-1000s m), emphasizing inertial reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how degraded sensing affects VIO performance in XR systems, as most evaluations focus on ideal conditions.

Method: Controlled empirical study with systematic fault injection into visual and inertial sensors, evaluating VIO behavior across operating regimes.

Result: Visual degradations cause bounded pose errors (~cm); inertial degradations result in larger trajectory deviations (~100s-1000s m).

Conclusion: Highlights the need for greater focus on inertial reliability in XR system design for industrial settings.

Abstract: Extended Reality (XR) systems deployed in industrial and operational settings rely on Visual--Inertial Odometry (VIO) for continuous six-degree-of-freedom pose tracking, yet these environments often involve sensing conditions that deviate from ideal assumptions. Despite this, most VIO evaluations emphasize nominal sensor behavior, leaving the effects of sustained sensor degradation under operational conditions insufficiently understood. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of VIO behavior under degraded sensing, examining faults affecting visual and inertial modalities across a range of operating regimes. Through systematic fault injection and quantitative evaluation, we observe a pronounced asymmetry in fault impact where degradations affecting visual sensing typically lead to bounded pose errors on the order of centimeters, whereas degradations affecting inertial sensing can induce substantially larger trajectory deviations, in some cases reaching hundreds to thousands of meters. These observations motivate greater emphasis on inertial reliability in the evaluation and design of XR systems for real-life industrial settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiVA enhances Facial Action Unit detection using hierarchical vision-language interactions and dynamic graphs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotated data poses challenges for learning discriminative AU representations, prompting the use of textual AU descriptions as semantic priors.

Method: HiVA employs a large language model for AU descriptions, an AU-aware dynamic graph module, and hierarchical cross-modal attention (DDCA and CDCA) for robust feature integration.

Result: HiVA consistently outperforms existing methods and demonstrates semantically meaningful activation patterns.

Conclusion: HiVA effectively leverages vision-language interactions for robust and interpretable AU detection.

Abstract: Facial Action Unit (AU) detection seeks to recognize subtle facial muscle activations as defined by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). A primary challenge w.r.t AU detection is the effective learning of discriminative and generalizable AU representations under conditions of limited annotated data. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Vision-language Interaction for AU Understanding (HiVA) method, which leverages textual AU descriptions as semantic priors to guide and enhance AU detection. Specifically, HiVA employs a large language model to generate diverse and contextually rich AU descriptions to strengthen language-based representation learning. To capture both fine-grained and holistic vision-language associations, HiVA introduces an AU-aware dynamic graph module that facilitates the learning of AU-specific visual representations. These features are further integrated within a hierarchical cross-modal attention architecture comprising two complementary mechanisms: Disentangled Dual Cross-Attention (DDCA), which establishes fine-grained, AU-specific interactions between visual and textual features, and Contextual Dual Cross-Attention (CDCA), which models global inter-AU dependencies. This collaborative, cross-modal learning paradigm enables HiVA to leverage multi-grained vision-based AU features in conjunction with refined language-based AU details, culminating in robust and semantically enriched AU detection capabilities. Extensive experiments show that HiVA consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, qualitative analyses reveal that HiVA produces semantically meaningful activation patterns, highlighting its efficacy in learning robust and interpretable cross-modal correspondences for comprehensive facial behavior analysis.

TL;DR: D-SECURE combines internal manipulation detection and external evidence-based reasoning to tackle multimodal misinformation, integrating HAMMER for fine-grained edits and DEFAME for broad verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing systems that rely on single evidence sources, which either miss local inconsistencies or fail to verify subtle manipulations in multimodal misinformation.

Method: D-SECURE integrates the HAMMER manipulation detector for fine-grained edits with the DEFAME retrieval pipeline for broad verification, providing a unified framework.

Result: Experiments on DGM4 and ClaimReview samples demonstrate the complementary strengths of HAMMER and DEFAME, supporting their fusion for improved detection.

Conclusion: D-SECURE offers a scalable and explainable solution for detecting and verifying multimodal misinformation by combining internal and external evidence.

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation increasingly mixes realistic im-age edits with fluent but misleading text, producing persuasive posts that are difficult to verify. Existing systems usually rely on a single evidence source. Content-based detectors identify local inconsistencies within an image and its caption but cannot determine global factual truth. Retrieval-based fact-checkers reason over external evidence but treat inputs as coarse claims and often miss subtle visual or textual manipulations. This separation creates failure cases where internally consistent fabrications bypass manipulation detectors and fact-checkers verify claims that contain pixel-level or token-level corruption. We present D-SECURE, a framework that combines internal manipulation detection with external evidence-based reasoning for news-style posts. D-SECURE integrates the HAMMER manipulation detector with the DEFAME retrieval pipeline. DEFAME performs broad verification, and HAMMER analyses residual or uncertain cases that may contain fine-grained edits. Experiments on DGM4 and ClaimReview samples highlight the complementary strengths of both systems and motivate their fusion. We provide a unified, explainable report that incorporates manipulation cues and external evidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of element-level control in image generation, allowing intuitive modifications such as adjusting shapes, colors, or adding/removing objects.

Method: The approach parses images into hierarchical vector graphics representations and designs a synthesis framework guided by these VGs, leveraging structural features for precise control.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method's effectiveness in image editing, object manipulation, and fine-grained content creation.

Conclusion: The work establishes a new paradigm for controllable image generation through vector graphics.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have achieved remarkable visual quality, while a fundamental challenge remains: Can image generation be controlled at the element level, enabling intuitive modifications such as adjusting shapes, altering colors, or adding and removing objects? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing layer-wise controllable generation through simplified vector graphics (VGs). Our approach first efficiently parses images into hierarchical VG representations that are semantic-aligned and structurally coherent. Building on this representation, we design a novel image synthesis framework guided by VGs, allowing users to freely modify elements and seamlessly translate these edits into photorealistic outputs. By leveraging the structural and semantic features of VGs in conjunction with noise prediction, our method provides precise control over geometry, color, and object semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in diverse applications, including image editing, object-level manipulation, and fine-grained content creation, establishing a new paradigm for controllable image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCoDiff is a training-free style transfer framework using pretrained latent diffusion models for fine-grained semantic stylization, outperforming existing methods without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing style transfer methods often lack region-wise or pixel-wise semantic correspondence, which CoCoDiff aims to address.

Method: CoCoDiff mines intermediate diffusion features for dense alignment and uses a cycle-consistency module for structural alignment.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and quantitative results without additional training.

Conclusion: CoCoDiff effectively preserves semantic correspondence and geometry in style transfer tasks.

Abstract: Transferring visual style between images while preserving semantic correspondence between similar objects remains a central challenge in computer vision. While existing methods have made great strides, most of them operate at global level but overlook region-wise and even pixel-wise semantic correspondence. To address this, we propose CoCoDiff, a novel training-free and low-cost style transfer framework that leverages pretrained latent diffusion models to achieve fine-grained, semantically consistent stylization. We identify that correspondence cues within generative diffusion models are under-explored and that content consistency across semantically matched regions is often neglected. CoCoDiff introduces a pixel-wise semantic correspondence module that mines intermediate diffusion features to construct a dense alignment map between content and style images. Furthermore, a cycle-consistency module then enforces structural and perceptual alignment across iterations, yielding object and region level stylization that preserves geometry and detail. Despite requiring no additional training or supervision, CoCoDiff delivers state-of-the-art visual quality and strong quantitative results, outperforming methods that rely on extra training or annotations.

Method: TikArt employs a Think-Aperture-Observe loop with Zoom and Segment actions, reinforced by AGRPO, a curriculum-based RL algorithm, to optimize reasoning tasks.

Result: TikArt outperforms the backbone model across benchmarks (V*, HR-Bench, MME-RealWorld-Lite, MMStar, RefCOCO, ReasonSeg), demonstrating interpretable reasoning paths.

Conclusion: TikArt's aperture-guided approach effectively addresses fine-grained visual reasoning challenges, offering a scalable and interpretable solution.

Abstract: We address fine-grained visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), where key evidence may reside in tiny objects, cluttered regions, or subtle markings that are lost under a single global image encoding. We introduce TikArt (Thinking Aperture), an aperture-guided agent that casts multi-step vision-language reasoning as a decision process over regions of interest. TikArt follows a Think-Aperture-Observe loop, alternating between language generation and two aperture actions: Zoom extracts rectangular crops, while Segment invokes SAM2 to obtain mask-based crops for irregular targets. After every action, the model must produce an explicit observation, turning local visual cues into persistent linguistic memory. Built on Qwen3-VL-8B, TikArt optimizes its reasoning policy with AGRPO, a GRPO-style reinforcement learning algorithm with a two-stage curriculum: it warms up segmentation actions and then jointly optimizes visual math, fine-grained VQA, and segmentation, using rewards that couple task success with purposeful aperture use. Experiments on V*, HR-Bench-4K/8K, MME-RealWorld-Lite, MMStar, RefCOCO, and ReasonSeg show consistent gains over the backbone and yield interpretable aperture trajectories for high-resolution reasoning.

*Xinpeng Liu,Fumio Okura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gaussian Mesh Renderer (GMR), a lightweight differentiable mesh renderer that integrates Gaussian and mesh representations for efficient surface reconstruction and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Triangle mesh models for surface reconstruction suffer from slow or heavy optimization in traditional mesh-based differentiable renderers. The paper aims to address this issue by leveraging the efficient rasterization process of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).

Method: The proposed Gaussian Mesh Renderer (GMR) analytically derives each Gaussian primitive from the corresponding mesh triangle, preserving structural fidelity and enabling gradient flow. This approach integrates Gaussian and mesh representations.

Result: GMR achieves smoother gradients compared to traditional mesh renderers, contributing to better optimization performance, especially with smaller batch sizes and limited memory.

Conclusion: GMR provides an efficient and lightweight solution for differentiable mesh rendering by combining the strengths of Gaussian and mesh representations, with implementation available on GitHub.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled high-fidelity virtualization with fast rendering and optimization for novel view synthesis. On the other hand, triangle mesh models still remain a popular choice for surface reconstruction but suffer from slow or heavy optimization in traditional mesh-based differentiable renderers. To address this problem, we propose a new lightweight differentiable mesh renderer leveraging the efficient rasterization process of 3DGS, named Gaussian Mesh Renderer (GMR), which tightly integrates the Gaussian and mesh representations. Each Gaussian primitive is analytically derived from the corresponding mesh triangle, preserving structural fidelity and enabling the gradient flow. Compared to the traditional mesh renderers, our method achieves smoother gradients, which especially contributes to better optimization using smaller batch sizes with limited memory. Our implementation is available in the public GitHub repository at https://github.com/huntorochi/Gaussian-Mesh-Renderer.

### [123] [Prototype Instance-semantic Disentanglement with Low-rank Regularized Subspace Clustering for WSIs Explainable Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14501)
*Chentao Li,Pan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PID-LRSC, an end-to-end framework, disentangles instance-semantic issues in tumor diagnosis using LRSC for instance entanglement and PID for semantic entanglement, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tumor diagnosis faces challenges due to instance-semantic entanglement caused by high similarity between tumor/precancerous tissues and dominance of non-tumor instances in WSIs.

Method: PID-LRSC combines low-rank regularized subspace clustering (LRSC) to address instance entanglement and enhanced contrastive learning (PID) for semantic disentanglement.

Result: Experiments on multicentre datasets show PID-LRSC outperforms SOTA methods, improving decision-making clarity and diagnostic reliability.

Conclusion: PID-LRSC effectively resolves instance-semantic entanglement, enhancing model representation and interpretability in tumor diagnosis.

Abstract: The tumor region plays a key role in pathological diagnosis. Tumor tissues are highly similar to precancerous lesions and non tumor instances often greatly exceed tumor instances in whole slide images (WSIs). These issues cause instance-semantic entanglement in multi-instance learning frameworks, degrading both model representation capability and interpretability. To address this, we propose an end-to-end prototype instance semantic disentanglement framework with low-rank regularized subspace clustering, PID-LRSC, in two aspects. First, we use secondary instance subspace learning to construct low-rank regularized subspace clustering (LRSC), addressing instance entanglement caused by an excessive proportion of non tumor instances. Second, we employ enhanced contrastive learning to design prototype instance semantic disentanglement (PID), resolving semantic entanglement caused by the high similarity between tumor and precancerous tissues. We conduct extensive experiments on multicentre pathology datasets, implying that PID-LRSC outperforms other SOTA methods. Overall, PID-LRSC provides clearer instance semantics during decision-making and significantly enhances the reliability of auxiliary diagnostic outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end MIL framework combining Grassmann re-embedding and manifold clustering for WSI analysis, improving accuracy and interpretability with acceptable resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WSI methods lack domain-specific knowledge and interpretability, while clustering approaches suffer from high dimensionality.

Method: Integrates Grassmann re-embedding and manifold adaptive clustering, with proxy instance labeling for tumor regions.

Result: Achieves better grading accuracy and interpretability; end-to-end learning refines features efficiently.

Conclusion: The framework outperforms existing methods in accuracy and interpretability with practical resource usage.

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) are the gold standard for pathological diagnosis and sub-typing. Current main-stream two-step frameworks employ offline feature encoders trained without domain-specific knowledge. Among them, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) methods are outcome-oriented and offer limited interpretability. Clustering-based approaches can provide explainable decision-making process but suffer from high dimension features and semantically ambiguous centroids. To this end, we propose an end-to-end MIL framework that integrates Grassmann re-embedding and manifold adaptive clustering, where the manifold geometric structure facilitates robust clustering results. Furthermore, we design a prior knowledge guiding proxy instance labeling and aggregation strategy to approximate patch labels and focus on pathologically relevant tumor regions. Experiments on multicentre WSI datasets demonstrate that: 1) our cluster-incorporated model achieves superior performance in both grading accuracy and interpretability; 2) end-to-end learning refines better feature representations and it requires acceptable computation resources.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unresolved challenges in medical image generation, such as architectural efficiency, data sufficiency, and principled evaluation, to improve data augmentation and privacy-preserving sharing.

Method: Develops MedVAR, an autoregressive model using next-scale prediction for hierarchical, multi-scale image synthesis, trained on 440,000 CT/MRI images across six anatomical regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, diversity, and scalability, demonstrating potential for future medical generative models.

Conclusion: MedVAR provides a scalable and efficient solution for medical image generation, setting a foundation for future advancements in the field.

Abstract: Medical image generation is pivotal in applications like data augmentation for low-resource clinical tasks and privacy-preserving data sharing. However, developing a scalable generative backbone for medical imaging requires architectural efficiency, sufficient multi-organ data, and principled evaluation, yet current approaches leave these aspects unresolved. Therefore, we introduce MedVAR, the first autoregressive-based foundation model that adopts the next-scale prediction paradigm to enable fast and scale-up-friendly medical image synthesis. MedVAR generates images in a coarse-to-fine manner and produces structured multi-scale representations suitable for downstream use. To support hierarchical generation, we curate a harmonized dataset of around 440,000 CT and MRI images spanning six anatomical regions. Comprehensive experiments across fidelity, diversity, and scalability show that MedVAR achieves state-of-the-art generative performance and offers a promising architectural direction for future medical generative foundation models.

*Aryan Das,Koushik Biswas,Swalpa Kumar Roy,Badri Narayana Patro,Vinay Kumar Verma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nexus Adapters, efficient prompt-guided adapters for diffusion-based models, improving structure-preserving conditional image generation with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for structure-preserving conditional image generation are inefficient, doubling parameters and lacking prompt awareness in adapters, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposed two adapters, Nexus Prime and Slim, using cross-attention mechanisms for multimodal conditioning, allowing better understanding of prompts while preserving structure.

Result: Nexus Prime requires only 8M additional parameters and enhances performance, while Nexus Slim reduces parameters by 18M yet achieves state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The Nexus Adapters offer efficient, prompt-aware solutions for structure-preserving conditional generation, outperforming existing methods with fewer parameters.

Abstract: We introduce the Nexus Adapters, novel text-guided efficient adapters to the diffusion-based framework for the Structure Preserving Conditional Generation (SPCG). Recently, structure-preserving methods have achieved promising results in conditional image generation by using a base model for prompt conditioning and an adapter for structure input, such as sketches or depth maps. These approaches are highly inefficient and sometimes require equal parameters in the adapter compared to the base architecture. It is not always possible to train the model since the diffusion model is itself costly, and doubling the parameter is highly inefficient. In these approaches, the adapter is not aware of the input prompt; therefore, it is optimal only for the structural input but not for the input prompt. To overcome the above challenges, we proposed two efficient adapters, Nexus Prime and Slim, which are guided by prompts and structural inputs. Each Nexus Block incorporates cross-attention mechanisms to enable rich multimodal conditioning. Therefore, the proposed adapter has a better understanding of the input prompt while preserving the structure. We conducted extensive experiments on the proposed models and demonstrated that the Nexus Prime adapter significantly enhances performance, requiring only 8M additional parameters compared to the baseline, T2I-Adapter. Furthermore, we also introduced a lightweight Nexus Slim adapter with 18M fewer parameters than the T2I-Adapter, which still achieved state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper highlights the importance of optimizer choice and learning rate in deep learning models for accurate tornado-induced building damage assessment, showing superior performance with specific settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate building damage assessment post-tornado is vital for emergency response and recovery, but current automated methods falter due to visual complexity and data imbalance.

Method: Evaluated 79 deep learning models (CNNs and Vision Transformers) on the QSTD dataset through 2,300+ experiments, focusing on optimizer impact.

Result: Optimizer choice (e.g., SGD over Adam) and low learning rates significantly improved performance, with ConvNeXt-Base excelling on cross-event testing.

Conclusion: Optimization settings are as critical as model architecture for disaster damage assessment, enabling practical deployment of automated systems.

Abstract: Rapid and accurate building damage assessment in the immediate aftermath of tornadoes is critical for coordinating life-saving search and rescue operations, optimizing emergency resource allocation, and accelerating community recovery. However, current automated methods struggle with the unique visual complexity of tornado-induced wreckage, primarily due to severe domain shift from standard pre-training datasets and extreme class imbalance in real-world disaster data. To address these challenges, we introduce a systematic experimental framework evaluating 79 open-source deep learning models, encompassing both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers, across over 2,300 controlled experiments on our newly curated Quad-State Tornado Damage (QSTD) benchmark dataset. Our findings reveal that achieving operational-grade performance hinges on a complex interaction between architecture and optimization, rather than architectural selection alone. Most strikingly, we demonstrate that optimizer choice can be more consequential than architecture: switching from Adam to SGD provided dramatic F1 gains of +25 to +38 points for Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer families, fundamentally reversing their ranking from bottom-tier to competitive with top-performing CNNs. Furthermore, a low learning rate of 1x10^(-4) proved universally critical, boosting average F1 performance by +10.2 points across all architectures. Our champion model, ConvNeXt-Base trained with these optimized settings, demonstrated strong cross-event generalization on the held-out Tuscaloosa-Moore Tornado Damage (TMTD) dataset, achieving 46.4% Macro F1 (+34.6 points over baseline) and retaining 85.5% Ordinal Top-1 Accuracy despite temporal and sensor domain shifts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares TrOCR and Qwen for OCR of 18th-century texts, highlighting trade-offs between linguistic regularization (Qwen) and orthographic fidelity (TrOCR), emphasizing the need for architecture-aware evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCR for historical texts is challenging due to degraded print quality and archaic glyphs. Current CER/WER metrics don't fully capture reliability for scholarly use.

Method: Compare TrOCR and Qwen using length-weighted accuracy metrics and hypothesis-driven error analysis on historical English texts.

Result: Qwen has lower CER/WER and handles degraded input better but alters historical forms. TrOCR preserves orthography consistently but suffers from error propagation.

Conclusion: Architectural biases influence OCR error patterns, requiring tailored evaluation for scholarly digitization workflows.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of eighteenth-century printed texts remains challenging due to degraded print quality, archaic glyphs, and non-standardized orthography. Although transformer-based OCR systems and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong aggregate accuracy, metrics such as Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) provide limited insight into their reliability for scholarly use. We compare a dedicated OCR transformer (TrOCR) and a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (Qwen) on line-level historical English texts using length-weighted accuracy metrics and hypothesis driven error analysis.
  While Qwen achieves lower CER/WER and greater robustness to degraded input, it exhibits selective linguistic regularization and orthographic normalization that may silently alter historically meaningful forms. TrOCR preserves orthographic fidelity more consistently but is more prone to cascading error propagation. Our findings show that architectural inductive biases shape OCR error structure in systematic ways. Models with similar aggregate accuracy can differ substantially in error locality, detectability, and downstream scholarly risk, underscoring the need for architecture-aware evaluation in historical digitization workflows.

*Jindong Zhao,Yuan Gao,Yang Xia,Sheng Nie,Jun Yue,Weiwei Sun,Shaobo Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CVGC improves domain-generalized LiDAR semantic segmentation by addressing cross-view challenges through geometric augmentation and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LiDAR applications require models trained on source-domain data to generalize to unseen target domains with varying viewpoints.

Method: Proposes CVGC with cross-view geometric augmentation and consistency modules to handle viewpoint-dependent variations.

Result: CVGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-view domain generalization across six datasets.

Conclusion: CVGC effectively addresses cross-view domain generalization in LiDAR semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Domain-generalized LiDAR semantic segmentation (LSS) seeks to train models on source-domain point clouds that generalize reliably to multiple unseen target domains, which is essential for real-world LiDAR applications. However, existing approaches assume similar acquisition views (e.g., vehicle-mounted) and struggle in cross-view scenarios, where observations differ substantially due to viewpoint-dependent structural incompleteness and non-uniform point density. Accordingly, we formulate cross-view domain generalization for LiDAR semantic segmentation and propose a novel framework, termed CVGC (Cross-View Geometric Consistency). Specifically, we introduce a cross-view geometric augmentation module that models viewpoint-induced variations in visibility and sampling density, generating multiple cross-view observations of the same scene. Subsequently, a geometric consistency module enforces consistent semantic and occupancy predictions across geometrically augmented point clouds of the same scene. Extensive experiments on six public LiDAR datasets establish the first systematic evaluation of cross-view domain generalization for LiDAR semantic segmentation, demonstrating that CVGC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods when generalizing from a single source domain to multiple target domains with heterogeneous acquisition viewpoints.

Result: Achieves significant improvements over baselines on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets.

Conclusion: MoRL advances motion understanding and generation by integrating reasoning and planning, supported by structured datasets and innovative reward design.

Abstract: Human motion understanding and generation are crucial for vision and robotics but remain limited in reasoning capability and test-time planning. We propose MoRL, a unified multimodal motion model trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our task-specific reward design combines semantic alignment and reasoning coherence for understanding with physical plausibility and text-motion consistency for generation, improving both logical reasoning and perceptual realism. To further enhance inference, we introduce Chain-of-Motion (CoM), a test-time reasoning method that enables step-by-step planning and reflection. We also construct two large-scale CoT datasets, MoUnd-CoT-140K and MoGen-CoT-140K, to align motion sequences with reasoning traces and action descriptions. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that MoRL achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art baselines. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/MoRL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual try-on methods are limited by their reliance on retraining for specific data conditions, hindering generalization.

Method: OmniVTON++ uses Structured Garment Morphing, Principal Pose Guidance, and Continuous Boundary Stitching to address garment alignment, structural coherence, and boundary continuity.

Result: The framework excels in cross-dataset and cross-garment-type evaluations, supporting diverse applications like multi-garment and anime try-on.

Conclusion: OmniVTON++ offers a unified, flexible solution for virtual try-on, advancing the field with its broad applicability and performance.

Abstract: Image-based Virtual Try-On (VTON) concerns the synthesis of realistic person imagery through garment re-rendering under human pose and body constraints. In practice, however, existing approaches are typically optimized for specific data conditions, making their deployment reliant on retraining and limiting their generalization as a unified solution. We present OmniVTON++, a training-free VTON framework designed for universal applicability. It addresses the intertwined challenges of garment alignment, human structural coherence, and boundary continuity by coordinating Structured Garment Morphing for correspondence-driven garment adaptation, Principal Pose Guidance for step-wise structural regulation during diffusion sampling, and Continuous Boundary Stitching for boundary-aware refinement, forming a cohesive pipeline without task-specific retraining. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse generalization settings, including cross-dataset and cross-garment-type evaluations, while reliably operating across scenarios and diffusion backbones within a single formulation. In addition to single-garment, single-human cases, the framework supports multi-garment, multi-human, and anime character virtual try-on, expanding the scope of virtual try-on applications. The source code will be released to the public.

TL;DR: DriveFine introduces a masked diffusion VLA model with self-correction and flexible decoding for autonomous driving, addressing weaknesses in existing planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative planners face issues like modality misalignment, inefficiency, and limited generalization, highlighting the need for a robust solution.

Method: Proposes DriveFine with a block-MoE design for refinement and generation, plus hybrid reinforcement learning for stable training.

Result: DriveFine shows strong efficacy and robustness across NAVSIM v1, v2, and Navhard benchmarks.

Conclusion: DriveFine's flexible decoding and self-correction capabilities effectively address limitations in existing autonomous driving planners.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving increasingly adopt generative planners trained with imitation learning followed by reinforcement learning. Diffusion-based planners suffer from modality alignment difficulties, low training efficiency, and limited generalization. Token-based planners are plagued by cumulative causal errors and irreversible decoding. In summary, the two dominant paradigms exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we propose DriveFine, a masked diffusion VLA model that combines flexible decoding with self-correction capabilities. In particular, we design a novel plug-and-play block-MoE, which seamlessly injects a refinement expert on top of the generation expert. By enabling explicit expert selection during inference and gradient blocking during training, the two experts are fully decoupled, preserving the foundational capabilities and generic patterns of the pretrained weights, which highlights the flexibility and extensibility of the block-MoE design. Furthermore, we design a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy that encourages effective exploration of refinement expert while maintaining training stability. Extensive experiments on NAVSIM v1, v2, and Navhard benchmarks demonstrate that DriveFine exhibits strong efficacy and robustness. The code will be released at https://github.com/MSunDYY/DriveFine.

Conclusion: The study offers a precise architectural comprehension of YOLO26, aiding researchers and developers in advancing the YOLO model to maintain its leadership in computer vision.

Abstract: You Only Look Once (YOLO) has been the prominent model for computer vision in deep learning for a decade. This study explores the novel aspects of YOLO26, the most recent version in the YOLO series. The elimination of Distribution Focal Loss (DFL), implementation of End-to-End NMS-Free Inference, introduction of ProgLoss + Small-Target-Aware Label Assignment (STAL), and use of the MuSGD optimizer are the primary enhancements designed to improve inference speed, which is claimed to achieve a 43% boost in CPU mode. This is designed to allow YOLO26 to attain real-time performance on edge devices or those without GPUs. Additionally, YOLO26 offers improvements in many computer vision tasks, including instance segmentation, pose estimation, and oriented bounding box (OBB) decoding. We aim for this effort to provide more value than just consolidating information already included in the existing technical documentation. Therefore, we performed a rigorous architectural investigation into YOLO26, mostly using the source code available in its GitHub repository and its official documentation. The authentic and detailed operational mechanisms of YOLO26 are inside the source code, which is seldom extracted by others. The YOLO26 architectural diagram is shown as the outcome of the investigation. This study is, to our knowledge, the first one presenting the CNN-based YOLO26 architecture, which is the core of YOLO26. Our objective is to provide a precise architectural comprehension of YOLO26 for researchers and developers aspiring to enhance the YOLO model, ensuring it remains the leading deep learning model in computer vision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VariViT is an improved Vision Transformer (ViT) model designed for variable-sized medical images, maintaining consistent patch size and reducing computational complexity. It outperforms vanilla ViTs and ResNet in medical imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images often have irregular shapes (e.g., tumors), making fixed-size patches inefficient due to variable foreground-to-background ratios and potential information loss from resizing. VariViT addresses these challenges.

Method: VariViT introduces a positional embedding resizing scheme for variable patch counts and a novel batching strategy to reduce computation time while maintaining performance.

Result: Evaluated on 3D brain MRI datasets, VariViT achieves F1-scores of 75.5% (glioma genotype prediction) and 76.3% (brain tumor classification), with a 30% reduction in computation time compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: VariViT effectively handles variable-sized medical images, improving feature representation and computational efficiency, making it superior to vanilla ViTs and ResNet in medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture in representation learning, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to excel in various tasks. ViTs split images into fixed-size patches, constraining them to a predefined size and necessitating pre-processing steps like resizing, padding, or cropping. This poses challenges in medical imaging, particularly with irregularly shaped structures like tumors. A fixed bounding box crop size produces input images with highly variable foreground-to-background ratios. Resizing medical images can degrade information and introduce artefacts, impacting diagnosis. Hence, tailoring variable-sized crops to regions of interest can enhance feature representation capabilities. Moreover, large images are computationally expensive, and smaller sizes risk information loss, presenting a computation-accuracy tradeoff. We propose VariViT, an improved ViT model crafted to handle variable image sizes while maintaining a consistent patch size. VariViT employs a novel positional embedding resizing scheme for a variable number of patches. We also implement a new batching strategy within VariViT to reduce computational complexity, resulting in faster training and inference times. In our evaluations on two 3D brain MRI datasets, VariViT surpasses vanilla ViTs and ResNet in glioma genotype prediction and brain tumor classification. It achieves F1-scores of 75.5% and 76.3%, respectively, learning more discriminative features. Our proposed batching strategy reduces computation time by up to 30% compared to conventional architectures. These findings underscore the efficacy of VariViT in image representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research treats hallucinations uniformly; VIGIL aims to fill the gap by decomposing errors into five categories for nuanced evaluation.

Method: A multi-stage detection pipeline processes images through specialized steps targeting fidelity, consistency, and omissions, using open-source models.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate the pipeline's effectiveness in identifying and explaining model failures.

Conclusion: VIGIL provides a deeper understanding of hallucinations in LMMs, releasing resources for transparency and further research.

Abstract: We introduce VIGIL (Visual Inconsistency & Generative In-context Lucidity), the first benchmark dataset and framework providing a fine-grained categorization of hallucinations in the multimodal image recontextualization task for large multimodal models (LMMs). While existing research often treats hallucinations as a uniform issue, our work addresses a significant gap in multimodal evaluation by decomposing these errors into five categories: pasted object hallucinations, background hallucinations, object omission, positional & logical inconsistencies, and physical law violations. To address these complexities, we propose a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our architecture processes recontextualized images through a series of specialized steps targeting object-level fidelity, background consistency, and omission detection, leveraging a coordinated ensemble of open-source models, whose effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experimental evaluations. Our approach enables a deeper understanding of where the models fail with an explanation; thus, we fill a gap in the field, as no prior methods offer such categorization and decomposition for this task. To promote transparency and further exploration, we openly release VIGIL, along with the detection pipeline and benchmark code, through our GitHub repository: https://github.com/mlubneuskaya/vigil and Data repository: https://huggingface.co/datasets/joannaww/VIGIL.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances photorealism and sketch adherence, advancing generative AI for freehand sketches.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in generative AI, with natural language emerging as the most common conditioning input. As underlying models grow more powerful, researchers are exploring increasingly diverse conditioning signals, such as depth maps, edge maps, camera parameters, and reference images, to give users finer control over generation. Among different modalities, sketches are a natural and long-standing form of human communication, enabling rapid expression of visual concepts. Previous literature has largely focused on edge maps, often misnamed 'sketches', yet algorithms that effectively handle true freehand sketches, with their inherent abstraction and distortions, remain underexplored. We pursue the challenging goal of balancing photorealism with sketch adherence when generating images from freehand input. A key obstacle is the absence of ground-truth, pixel-aligned images: by their nature, freehand sketches do not have a single correct alignment. To address this, we propose a modulation-based approach that prioritizes semantic interpretation of the sketch over strict adherence to individual edge positions. We further introduce a novel loss that enables training on freehand sketches without requiring ground-truth pixel-aligned images. We show that our method outperforms existing approaches in both semantic alignment with freehand sketch inputs and in the realism and overall quality of the generated images.

Conclusion: A roadmap for certifiable, trustworthy perception in real-world applications, supported by ongoing updates and tutorials.

Abstract: Global solvers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for 3D vision, offering certifiable solutions to nonconvex geometric optimization problems traditionally addressed by local or heuristic methods. This survey presents the first systematic review of global solvers in geometric vision, unifying the field through a comprehensive taxonomy of three core paradigms: Branch-and-Bound (BnB), Convex Relaxation (CR), and Graduated Non-Convexity (GNC). We present their theoretical foundations, algorithmic designs, and practical enhancements for robustness and scalability, examining how each addresses the fundamental nonconvexity of geometric estimation problems. Our analysis spans ten core vision tasks, from Wahba problem to bundle adjustment, revealing the optimality-robustness-scalability trade-offs that govern solver selection. We identify critical future directions: scaling algorithms while maintaining guarantees, integrating data-driven priors with certifiable optimization, establishing standardized benchmarks, and addressing societal implications for safety-critical deployment.

### [139] [Universal Image Immunization against Diffusion-based Image Editing via Semantic Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14679)
*Chanhui Lee,Seunghyun Shin,Donggyu Choi,Hae-gon Jeon,Jeany Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A universal image immunization framework is proposed to generate a single adversarial perturbation for protecting images against AI-driven semantic manipulation in diffusion models, outperforming existing methods in scalability and practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ethical and legal risks like deepfakes and unauthorized use of copyrighted content caused by diffusion models' image editing capabilities.

Method: Generate a universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) that embeds a semantic target into images while suppressing original content, misdirecting the model during editing.

Result: Effectively blocks malicious editing, operates data-free, and outperforms baselines in UAP settings, achieving performance comparable to image-specific methods.

Conclusion: The proposed universal immunization framework offers scalable and practical defense against AI-driven manipulation, with strong transferability across diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled powerful image editing capabilities guided by natural language prompts, unlocking new creative possibilities. However, they introduce significant ethical and legal risks, such as deepfakes and unauthorized use of copyrighted visual content. To address these risks, image immunization has emerged as a promising defense against AI-driven semantic manipulation. Yet, most existing approaches rely on image-specific adversarial perturbations that require individual optimization for each image, thereby limiting scalability and practicality. In this paper, we propose the first universal image immunization framework that generates a single, broadly applicable adversarial perturbation specifically designed for diffusion-based editing pipelines. Inspired by universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) techniques used in targeted attacks, our method generates a UAP that embeds a semantic target into images to be protected. Simultaneously, it suppresses original content to effectively misdirect the model's attention during editing. As a result, our approach effectively blocks malicious editing attempts by overwriting the original semantic content in the image via the UAP. Moreover, our method operates effectively even in data-free settings without requiring access to training data or domain knowledge, further enhancing its practicality and broad applicability in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments show that our method, as the first universal immunization approach, significantly outperforms several baselines in the UAP setting. In addition, despite the inherent difficulty of universal perturbations, our method also achieves performance on par with image-specific methods under a more restricted perturbation budget, while also exhibiting strong black-box transferability across different diffusion models.

*Willem Davison,Xinyue Hao,Laura Sevilla-Lara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Long-term motion information enhances perception tasks, outperforming image data in understanding actions, objects, materials, and spatial details, while offering better generalization and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the understudied role of temporal (motion) information in perception, leveraging advancements in point-track estimation.

Method: Utilize point-track estimation to learn temporal representations, testing on various perceptual tasks.

Result: Long-term motion representations excel in understanding diverse aspects, generalize better in low-data scenarios, and offer efficiency advantages.

Conclusion: Long-term motion information is highly valuable for perception, suggesting its integration into future models.

Abstract: Temporal information has long been considered to be essential for perception. While there is extensive research on the role of image information for perceptual tasks, the role of the temporal dimension remains less well understood: What can we learn about the world from long-term motion information? What properties does long-term motion information have for visual learning? We leverage recent success in point-track estimation, which offers an excellent opportunity to learn temporal representations and experiment on a variety of perceptual tasks. We draw 3 clear lessons: 1) Long-term motion representations contain information to understand actions, but also objects, materials, and spatial information, often even better than images. 2) Long-term motion representations generalize far better than image representations in low-data settings and in zero-shot tasks. 3) The very low dimensionality of motion information makes motion representations a better trade-off between GFLOPs and accuracy than standard video representations, and used together they achieve higher performance than video representations alone. We hope these insights will pave the way for the design of future models that leverage the power of long-term motion information for perception.

### [141] [SAILS: Segment Anything with Incrementally Learned Semantics for Task-Invariant and Training-Free Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14767)
*Shishir Muralidhara,Didier Stricker,René Schuster*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAILS is a training-free framework for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS), leveraging foundational models to avoid retraining and forgetting, outperforming existing training-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of continual learning, such as high computational costs and forgetting, hinder its real-world applicability. SAILS addresses these challenges.

Method: SAILS decouples CISS into two stages: zero-shot region extraction using SAM and semantic association via prototypes in a fixed feature space, including selective intra-class clustering.

Result: SAILS outperforms training-based methods on CISS datasets, eliminates forgetting, and shows positive backward transfer, improving past class performance.

Conclusion: SAILS provides a scalable, efficient solution for CISS without the drawbacks of continual learning, enabling consistent performance across tasks.

Abstract: Continual learning remains constrained by the need for repeated retraining, high computational costs, and the persistent challenge of forgetting. These factors significantly limit the applicability of continuous learning in real-world settings, as iterative model updates require significant computational resources and inherently exacerbate forgetting. We present SAILS -- Segment Anything with Incrementally Learned Semantics, a training-free framework for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) that sidesteps these challenges entirely. SAILS leverages foundational models to decouple CISS into two stages: Zero-shot region extraction using Segment Anything Model (SAM), followed by semantic association through prototypes in a fixed feature space. SAILS incorporates selective intra-class clustering, resulting in multiple prototypes per class to better model intra-class variability. Our results demonstrate that, despite requiring no incremental training, SAILS typically surpasses the performance of existing training-based approaches on standard CISS datasets, particularly in long and challenging task sequences where forgetting tends to be most severe. By avoiding parameter updates, SAILS completely eliminates forgetting and maintains consistent, task-invariant performance. Furthermore, SAILS exhibits positive backward transfer, where the introduction of new classes can enhance performance on previous classes.

### [142] [GOT-JEPA: Generic Object Tracking with Model Adaptation and Occlusion Handling using Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14771)
*Shih-Fang Chen,Jun-Cheng Chen,I-Hong Jhuo,Yen-Yu Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GOT-JEPA improves generic object tracking by extending JEPA to predict tracking models, enhancing generalization and occlusion perception. OccuSolver further refines occlusion handling using object priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generic object trackers lack robustness and fine-grained occlusion reasoning, limiting performance in unseen scenarios.

Method: Proposes GOT-JEPA for predicting tracking models under occlusions and OccuSolver for detailed occlusion-pattern capture.

Result: Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks demonstrate improved generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses limitations in generalization and occlusion perception for object tracking.

Abstract: The human visual system tracks objects by integrating current observations with previously observed information, adapting to target and scene changes, and reasoning about occlusion at fine granularity. In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Visual Informative Part Attention (VIPA) framework for Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which leverages visual expressions to enhance segmentation by reducing cross-modal projection variance and improving semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RIS methods underutilize visual contexts. The authors aim to exploit visual information more effectively by focusing on informative visual parts to improve fine-grained segmentation.

Method: The proposed VIPA framework uses a Visual Expression Generator (VEG) to retrieve and refine informative visual tokens, reducing noise and enhancing semantic alignment through local-global linguistic context cues.

Result: VIPA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four public RIS benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: VIPA effectively aligns network attention with fine-grained regions of interest by leveraging visual expressions and comprehensive context cues, setting a new benchmark for RIS performance.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment a target object described by a natural language expression. Existing methods have evolved by leveraging the vision information into the language tokens. To more effectively exploit visual contexts for fine-grained segmentation, we propose a novel Visual Informative Part Attention (VIPA) framework for referring image segmentation. VIPA leverages the informative parts of visual contexts, called a visual expression, which can effectively provide the structural and semantic visual target information to the network. This design reduces high-variance cross-modal projection and enhances semantic consistency in an attention mechanism of the referring image segmentation. We also design a visual expression generator (VEG) module, which retrieves informative visual tokens via local-global linguistic context cues and refines the retrieved tokens for reducing noise information and sharing informative visual attributes. This module allows the visual expression to consider comprehensive contexts and capture semantic visual contexts of informative regions. In this way, our framework enables the network's attention to robustly align with the fine-grained regions of interest. Extensive experiments and visual analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our VIPA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on four public RIS benchmarks.

### [144] [Debiasing Central Fixation Confounds Reveals a Peripheral "Sweet Spot" for Human-like Scanpaths in Hard-Attention Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14834)
*Pengcheng Pan,Yonekura Shogo,Yasuo Kuniyosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study highlights the confounding effect of center bias on scanpath metrics in visual recognition tasks, proposes a debiased metric (GCS), and identifies a peripheral sweet spot for human-like scanpaths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the strong influence of dataset-specific center bias on evaluating task-driven hard-attention models and improve the distinction between genuine behavioral alignment and central tendency.

Method: Using Gaze-CIFAR-10, the authors analyze a hard-attention classifier under varying foveal patch sizes and peripheral contexts, propose GCS (a debiased metric), and evaluate its effectiveness.

Result: A peripheral sweet spot is identified where scanpaths are both human-like and above the center baseline. GCS reveals a robust sweet spot at medium patch size and uncovers a 'shortcut regime' for large fields-of-view.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for improved metrics and benchmarks in evaluating active perception to better separate behavioral alignment from center bias.

Abstract: Human eye movements in visual recognition reflect a balance between foveal sampling and peripheral context. Task-driven hard-attention models for vision are often evaluated by how well their scanpaths match human gaze. However, common scanpath metrics can be strongly confounded by dataset-specific center bias, especially on object-centric datasets. Using Gaze-CIFAR-10, we show that a trivial center-fixation baseline achieves surprisingly strong scanpath scores, approaching many learned policies. This makes standard metrics optimistic and blurs the distinction between genuine behavioral alignment and mere central tendency. We then analyze a hard-attention classifier under constrained vision by sweeping foveal patch size and peripheral context, revealing a peripheral sweet spot: only a narrow range of sensory constraints yields scanpaths that are simultaneously (i) above the center baseline after debiasing and (ii) temporally human-like in movement statistics. To address center bias, we propose GCS (Gaze Consistency Score), a center-debiased composite metric augmented with movement similarity. GCS uncovers a robust sweet spot at medium patch size with both foveal and peripheral vision, that is not obvious from raw scanpath metrics or accuracy alone, and also highlights a "shortcut regime" when the field-of-view becomes too large. We discuss implications for evaluating active perception on object-centric datasets and for designing gaze benchmarks that better separate behavioral alignment from center bias.

TL;DR: The paper introduces STAformer and STAformer++ architectures to improve short-term object-interaction anticipation in egocentric video analysis, leveraging attention-based methods and affordance modeling for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to enhance wearable assistants and human-robot interaction by accurately predicting object interactions in egocentric videos.

Method: The proposed method includes STAformer and STAformer++ architectures with frame-guided temporal pooling, dual image-video attention, multiscale feature fusion, and novel modules for affordance modeling.

Result: The method achieves significant improvements, with gains up to +23p.p on Ego4D and +31p.p on EPIC-Kitchens datasets.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating affordance modeling and attention-based architectures for short-term interaction anticipation, with released resources to foster further research.

Abstract: Short Term object-interaction Anticipation consists in detecting the location of the next active objects, the noun and verb categories of the interaction, as well as the time to contact from the observation of egocentric video. This ability is fundamental for wearable assistants to understand user goals and provide timely assistance, or to enable human-robot interaction. In this work, we present a method to improve the performance of STA predictions. Our contributions are two-fold: 1 We propose STAformer and STAformer plus plus, two novel attention-based architectures integrating frame-guided temporal pooling, dual image-video attention, and multiscale feature fusion to support STA predictions from an image-input video pair; 2 We introduce two novel modules to ground STA predictions on human behavior by modeling affordances. First, we integrate an environment affordance model which acts as a persistent memory of interactions that can take place in a given physical scene. We explore how to integrate environment affordances via simple late fusion and with an approach which adaptively learns how to best fuse affordances with end-to-end predictions. Second, we predict interaction hotspots from the observation of hands and object trajectories, increasing confidence in STA predictions localized around the hotspot. Our results show significant improvements on Overall Top-5 mAP, with gain up to +23p.p on Ego4D and +31p.p on a novel set of curated EPIC-Kitchens STA labels. We released the code, annotations, and pre-extracted affordances on Ego4D and EPIC-Kitchens to encourage future research in this area.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MPSL for image analysis to address PCA's sensitivity to reduced dimensions by leveraging multiple dimensions and topological spectral representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome PCA's sensitivity to choice of reduced dimension, the authors propose exploiting multiple dimensions instead of averaging or selecting one.

Method: Uses MPSL on simplicial complexes to extract multiscale topological spectral features, aggregating statistical summaries across scales and dimensions.

Result: Performs more stably across reduced dimensions and improves PCA-based baselines, tested on COIL20 and ETH80 datasets.

Conclusion: MPSL provides stable and improved performance by leveraging multiscale multi-dimensional representations.

Abstract: We propose a multi-dimensional persistent sheaf Laplacian (MPSL) framework on simplicial complexes for image analysis. The proposed method is motivated by the strong sensitivity of commonly used dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), to the choice of reduced dimension. Rather than selecting a single reduced dimension or averaging results across dimensions, we exploit complementary advantages of multiple reduced dimensions. At a given dimension, image samples are regarded as simplicial complexes, and persistent sheaf Laplacians are utilized to extract a multiscale localized topological spectral representation for individual image samples. Statistical summaries of the resulting spectra are then aggregated across scales and dimensions to form multiscale multi-dimensional image representations. We evaluate the proposed framework on the COIL20 and ETH80 image datasets using standard classification protocols. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides more stable performance across a wide range of reduced dimensions and achieves consistent improvements to PCA-based baselines in moderate dimensional regimes.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) can automatically delineate lesions on computed tomography (CT) and generate radiology report content, yet progress is limited by the scarcity of publicly available CT datasets with lesion-level annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce CT-Bench, a first-of-its-kind benchmark dataset comprising two components: a Lesion Image and Metadata Set containing 20,335 lesions from 7,795 CT studies with bounding boxes, descriptions, and size information, and a multitask visual question answering benchmark with 2,850 QA pairs covering lesion localization, description, size estimation, and attribute categorization. Hard negative examples are included to reflect real-world diagnostic challenges. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art multimodal models, including vision-language and medical CLIP variants, by comparing their performance to radiologist assessments, demonstrating the value of CT-Bench as a comprehensive benchmark for lesion analysis. Moreover, fine-tuning models on the Lesion Image and Metadata Set yields significant performance gains across both components, underscoring the clinical utility of CT-Bench.

Motivation: Aligning ground-level imagery with satellite maps is challenging due to viewpoint gaps and unreliable GPS, necessitating robust solutions for mapping and navigation.

Method: Wrivinder integrates SfM reconstruction, 3D Gaussian Splatting, semantic grounding, and monocular depth cues to generate zenith-view renderings for alignment with satellite imagery.

Result: The framework achieves sub-30m geolocation accuracy in zero-shot experiments across diverse scenes.

Conclusion: Wrivinder and the MC-Sat dataset provide a strong baseline for geometry-based cross-view alignment, demonstrating the potential of geometry-driven aggregation for accurate localization.

Abstract: Aligning ground-level imagery with geo-registered satellite maps is crucial for mapping, navigation, and situational awareness, yet remains challenging under large viewpoint gaps or when GPS is unreliable. We introduce Wrivinder, a zero-shot, geometry-driven framework that aggregates multiple ground photographs to reconstruct a consistent 3D scene and align it with overhead satellite imagery. Wrivinder combines SfM reconstruction, 3D Gaussian Splatting, semantic grounding, and monocular depth--based metric cues to produce a stable zenith-view rendering that can be directly matched to satellite context for metrically accurate camera geo-localization. To support systematic evaluation of this task, which lacks suitable benchmarks, we also release MC-Sat, a curated dataset linking multi-view ground imagery with geo-registered satellite tiles across diverse outdoor environments. Together, Wrivinder and MC-Sat provide a first comprehensive baseline and testbed for studying geometry-centered cross-view alignment without paired supervision. In zero-shot experiments, Wrivinder achieves sub-30\,m geolocation accuracy across both dense and large-area scenes, highlighting the promise of geometry-based aggregation for robust ground-to-satellite localization.

*Zun Wang,Han Lin,Jaehong Yoon,Jaemin Cho,Yue Zhang,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnchorWeave replaces noisy global 3D scene reconstructions with clean local geometric memories to improve long-term video generation consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from cross-view misalignment due to pose and depth errors, leading to noisy geometry and degraded generation quality.

Method: AnchorWeave uses multiple local geometric memories and reconciles inconsistencies via coverage-driven retrieval and multi-anchor weaving control during generation.

Result: Experiments show AnchorWeave enhances long-term scene consistency and visual quality, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: AnchorWeave's local geometric conditioning and multi-anchor control effectively address cross-view inconsistencies in video generation.

Abstract: Maintaining spatial world consistency over long horizons remains a central challenge for camera-controllable video generation. Existing memory-based approaches often condition generation on globally reconstructed 3D scenes by rendering anchor videos from the reconstructed geometry in the history. However, reconstructing a global 3D scene from multiple views inevitably introduces cross-view misalignment, as pose and depth estimation errors cause the same surfaces to be reconstructed at slightly different 3D locations across views. When fused, these inconsistencies accumulate into noisy geometry that contaminates the conditioning signals and degrades generation quality. We introduce AnchorWeave, a memory-augmented video generation framework that replaces a single misaligned global memory with multiple clean local geometric memories and learns to reconcile their cross-view inconsistencies. To this end, AnchorWeave performs coverage-driven local memory retrieval aligned with the target trajectory and integrates the selected local memories through a multi-anchor weaving controller during generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorWeave significantly improves long-term scene consistency while maintaining strong visual quality, with ablation and analysis studies further validating the effectiveness of local geometric conditioning, multi-anchor control, and coverage-driven retrieval.

*Qingming Liu,Xinyue Yao,Shuyuan Zhang,Yueci Deng,Guiliang Liu,Zhen Liu,Kui Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a part-centric generative framework for creating articulated 3D objects from single images, improving accuracy, consistency, and speed over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalable production of high-fidelity articulated 3D assets is challenging due to reliance on slow optimization or inaccurate retrieval-based methods.

Method: A generative model synthesizes part geometry, composition, and articulation using latent tokens with part identity and motion cues, conditioned on a single image.

Result: The approach outperforms baselines in part accuracy, articulation plausibility, and inference speed, enabling fast feed-forward generation.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable solution for articulated object creation, balancing quality and efficiency for interactive applications.

Abstract: Articulated objects are central to interactive 3D applications, including embodied AI, robotics, and VR/AR, where functional part decomposition and kinematic motion are essential. Yet producing high-fidelity articulated assets remains difficult to scale because it requires reliable part decomposition and kinematic rigging. Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: optimization-based reconstruction or distillation, which can be accurate but often takes tens of minutes to hours per instance, and inference-time methods that rely on template or part retrieval, producing plausible results that may not match the specific structure and appearance in the input observation. We introduce a part-centric generative framework for articulated object creation that synthesizes part geometry, composition, and articulation under explicit part-aware conditioning. Our representation models an object as a set of movable parts, each encoded by latent tokens augmented with part identity and articulation cues. Conditioned on a single image, the model generates articulated 3D assets that preserve instance-level correspondence while maintaining valid part structure and motion. The resulting approach avoids per-instance optimization, enables fast feed-forward inference, and supports controllable assembly and articulation, which are important for embodied interaction. Experiments on common articulated categories (e.g., drawers and doors) show improved input consistency, part accuracy, and articulation plausibility over optimization-based and retrieval-driven baselines, while substantially reducing inference time.

*Ayush Shrivastava,Kirtan Gangani,Laksh Jain,Mayank Goel,Nipun Batra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThermEval-B is introduced as a benchmark for thermal vision language models, revealing their limitations in temperature reasoning and robustness to transformations, despite existing RGB-focused capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal imaging is crucial in scenarios like nighttime surveillance and medical screening, where RGB models fail due to differences in data encoding (temperature vs. color/texture). A dedicated benchmark is needed to evaluate VLMs for thermal understanding.

Method: ThermEval-B combines public datasets with ThermEval-D, a new dataset with 55,000 thermal Q&A pairs and per-pixel temperature maps. It evaluates 25 VLMs for temperature reasoning, robustness to colormap changes, and reliance on language priors.

Result: VLMs perform poorly on temperature-grounded reasoning, are sensitive to colormap transformations, and often default to language priors. Minimal improvements were seen with prompting or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Thermal vision requires specialized evaluation, as RGB-based benchmarks are insufficient. ThermEval-B serves as a tool to advance thermal VLMs.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on RGB imagery, but they do not generalize to thermal images. Thermal sensing plays a critical role in settings where visible light fails, including nighttime surveillance, search and rescue, autonomous driving, and medical screening. Unlike RGB imagery, thermal images encode physical temperature rather than color or texture, requiring perceptual and reasoning capabilities that existing RGB-centric benchmarks do not evaluate. We introduce ThermEval-B, a structured benchmark of approximately 55,000 thermal visual question answering pairs designed to assess the foundational primitives required for thermal vision language understanding. ThermEval-B integrates public datasets with our newly collected ThermEval-D, the first dataset to provide dense per-pixel temperature maps with semantic body-part annotations across diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Evaluating 25 open-source and closed-source VLMs, we find that models consistently fail at temperature-grounded reasoning, degrade under colormap transformations, and default to language priors or fixed responses, with only marginal gains from prompting or supervised fine-tuning. These results demonstrate that thermal understanding requires dedicated evaluation beyond RGB-centric assumptions, positioning ThermEval as a benchmark to drive progress in thermal vision language modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The Sphere Encoder is an efficient generative framework that produces high-quality images in fewer steps than diffusion models, using a spherical latent space for uniform mapping and reconstruction losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reduce the computational cost of generative models while maintaining competitive performance with state-of-the-art diffusion models.

Method: The Sphere Encoder learns an encoder to map images uniformly onto a spherical latent space and a decoder to map random latent vectors back to images. It uses reconstruction losses for training and supports conditional generation.

Result: The Sphere Encoder achieves performance comparable to diffusion models but with significantly lower inference costs, often requiring fewer than five steps.

Conclusion: The Sphere Encoder offers a computationally efficient alternative to diffusion models for high-quality image generation, with potential for further improvement through iterative encoding-decoding.

Abstract: We introduce the Sphere Encoder, an efficient generative framework capable of producing images in a single forward pass and competing with many-step diffusion models using fewer than five steps. Our approach works by learning an encoder that maps natural images uniformly onto a spherical latent space, and a decoder that maps random latent vectors back to the image space. Trained solely through image reconstruction losses, the model generates an image by simply decoding a random point on the sphere. Our architecture naturally supports conditional generation, and looping the encoder/decoder a few times can further enhance image quality. Across several datasets, the sphere encoder approach yields performance competitive with state of the art diffusions, but with a small fraction of the inference cost.

*Yehonathan Litman,Shikun Liu,Dario Seyb,Nicholas Milef,Yang Zhou,Carl Marshall,Shubham Tulsiani,Caleb Leak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EditCtrl is an efficient video inpainting framework that reduces computational costs by focusing on localized edits and maintaining global consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current high-fidelity generative video editing methods are computationally expensive because they process the entire video context, even for small edits. EditCtrl aims to address this inefficiency.

Method: EditCtrl introduces a local video context module that processes only masked tokens, reducing computation proportional to edit size. It also includes a lightweight global context embedder to ensure consistency.

Result: EditCtrl is 10 times more compute-efficient than state-of-the-art methods and improves editing quality. It also enables new capabilities like multi-region editing and autoregressive content propagation.

Conclusion: EditCtrl provides a more efficient and higher-quality solution for video inpainting, unlocking new editing possibilities while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: High-fidelity generative video editing has seen significant quality improvements by leveraging pre-trained video foundation models. However, their computational cost is a major bottleneck, as they are often designed to inefficiently process the full video context regardless of the inpainting mask's size, even for sparse, localized edits. In this paper, we introduce EditCtrl, an efficient video inpainting control framework that focuses computation only where it is needed. Our approach features a novel local video context module that operates solely on masked tokens, yielding a computational cost proportional to the edit size. This local-first generation is then guided by a lightweight temporal global context embedder that ensures video-wide context consistency with minimal overhead. Not only is EditCtrl 10 times more compute efficient than state-of-the-art generative editing methods, it even improves editing quality compared to methods designed with full-attention. Finally, we showcase how EditCtrl unlocks new capabilities, including multi-region editing with text prompts and autoregressive content propagation.

### [154] [Multimodal Consistency-Guided Reference-Free Data Selection for ASR Accent Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13263)
*Ligong Lei,Wenwen Lu,Xudong Pang,Zaokere Kadeer,Aishan Wumaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal consistency-guided pipeline for selecting reliable pseudo-labels to improve ASR performance on accented speech, achieving results close to supervised methods with much less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems perform poorly on accented speech due to acoustic-prosodic mismatches. Traditional pseudo-label selection methods are text-centric and may amplify errors.

Method: The proposed pipeline uses submodular mutual information for preselection, generates multiple pseudo-transcriptions, and scores them using speech-text alignment and predicted WER for consistency filtering.

Result: In experiments, the method achieved 10.91% WER using ~1.5k selected utterances, close to the 10.45% WER with 30k supervised labels. Cross-domain tests showed robustness to accent shifts.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively selects reliable pseudo-labels for ASR accent adaptation, offering near-supervised performance with minimal labeled data and outperforming baselines.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often degrade on accented speech because acoustic-phonetic and prosodic shifts induce a mismatch to training data, making labeled accent adaptation costly. However, common pseudo-label selection heuristics are largely text-centric (e.g., perplexity (PPL) filtering) and can prefer fluent yet acoustically mismatched hypotheses, leading to error amplification when fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce a multimodal consistency-guided, reference-free data selection pipeline for ASR accent adaptation under a transductive, label-free protocol. The pipeline starts with a target-aware preselection step based on submodular mutual information to improve query relevance and reduce downstream computation. It then generates multiple pseudo-transcriptions per utterance via perturbation-based decoding and scores each hypothesis using two reference-free signals: speech--text alignment in a shared embedding space and predicted word error rate (WER). A simple percentile-based selection rule retains reliable pseudo-labels for fine-tuning while discarding noisy utterances. In an in-domain setting, selecting ~1.5k utterances from a 30k pool achieves 10.91% WER, close to 10.45% obtained using 30k supervised labels. In a cross-domain setting with a mismatched candidate pool, consistency-filtered subsets avoid the degradation caused by unfiltered pseudo-labels under strong accent shift, and matched-hour experiments on a stronger ASR backbone further confirm gains over random sampling and recent selection baselines.

*Belu Ticona,Antonis Anastasopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs and translation systems for crisis communication, revealing performance issues and urgency distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the suitability of LLMs and translation tools in high-stakes crisis contexts, focusing on preserving urgency.

Method: Examined state-of-the-art LLMs and translation systems using multilingual crisis data and urgency-annotated datasets.

Result: Both translation models and LLMs showed performance degradation and instability; urgency was often distorted.

Conclusion: General-purpose language technologies pose risks for crisis communication, necessitating crisis-aware evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for crisis preparedness and response, particularly for multilingual communication. However, their suitability for high-stakes crisis contexts remains insufficiently evaluated. This work examines the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and machine translation systems in crisis-domain translation, with a focus on preserving urgency, which is a critical property for effective crisis communication and triaging. Using multilingual crisis data and a newly introduced urgency-annotated dataset covering over 32 languages, we show that both dedicated translation models and LLMs exhibit substantial performance degradation and instability. Crucially, even linguistically adequate translations can distort perceived urgency, and LLM-based urgency classifications vary widely depending on the language of the prompt and input. These findings highlight significant risks in deploying general-purpose language technologies for crisis communication and underscore the need for crisis-aware evaluation frameworks.

### [156] [Language Model Memory and Memory Models for Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13466)
*Benjamin L. Badger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Machine learning embeddings often retain little input information, but autoencoders excel at memory formation. Combining causal and retention objectives improves memory-rich embeddings, challenging traditional next-token prediction training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize the memory-like properties of embeddings in machine learning models and improve computational efficiency by leveraging memory formation.

Method: Introduces a parallelizable encoder-decoder architecture with combined causal and information retention objectives, along with curriculum training.

Result: Models with combined objectives learn to form and decode information-rich memories, outperforming traditional next-token prediction.

Conclusion: Next-token prediction alone is insufficient for memory formation; combined objectives and curriculum training enhance embedding fidelity.

Abstract: The ability of machine learning models to store input information in hidden layer vector embeddings, analogous to the concept of `memory', is widely employed but not well characterized. We find that language model embeddings typically contain relatively little input information regardless of data and compute scale during training. In contrast, embeddings from autoencoders trained for input regeneration are capable of nearly perfect memory formation. The substitution of memory embeddings for token sequences leads to substantial computational efficiencies, motivating the introduction of a parallelizable encoder-decoder memory model architecture. Upon causal training these models contain information-poor embeddings incapable of arbitrary information access, but by combining causal and information retention objective functions they learn to form and decode information-rich memories. Training can be further streamlined by freezing a high fidelity encoder followed by a curriculum training approach where decoders first learn to process memories and then learn to additionally predict next tokens. We introduce the perspective that next token prediction training alone is poorly suited for accurate memory formation as the objective itself is non-invertible, motivating the use of combined objective functions for models where the entire input is not exposed.

### [157] [From Perceptions To Evidence: Detecting AI-Generated Content In Turkish News Media With A Fine-Tuned Bert Classifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13504)
*Ozancan Ozdemir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study fine-tunes a Turkish BERT model to classify AI-rewritten content in Turkish news media, achieving high accuracy and revealing significant AI usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in empirical research on AI-generated content in Turkish news media, moving beyond qualitative studies.

Method: Fine-tuned a Turkish-specific BERT model on a labeled dataset of 3,600 articles for binary classification of AI-rewritten content.

Result: Achieved a 0.9708 F1 score, with consistent classification patterns on unseen articles and an estimated 2.5% AI usage.

Conclusion: First empirical measurement of AI usage in Turkish news media, demonstrating reliable detection of AI-rewritten content.

Abstract: The rapid integration of large language models into newsroom workflows has raised urgent questions about the prevalence of AI-generated content in online media. While computational studies have begun to quantify this phenomenon in English-language outlets, no empirical investigation exists for Turkish news media, where existing research remains limited to qualitative interviews with journalists or fake news detection. This study addresses that gap by fine-tuning a Turkish-specific BERT model (dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased) on a labeled dataset of 3,600 articles from three major Turkish outlets with distinct editorial orientations for binary classification of AI-rewritten content. The model achieves 0.9708 F1 score on the held-out test set with symmetric precision and recall across both classes. Subsequent deployment on over 3,500 unseen articles spanning between 2023 and 2026 reveals consistent cross-source and temporally stable classification patterns, with mean prediction confidence exceeding 0.96 and an estimated 2.5 percentage of examined news content rewritten or revised by LLMs on average. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to move beyond self-reported journalist perceptions toward empirical, data-driven measurement of AI usage in Turkish news media.

### [158] [Think Deep, Not Just Long: Measuring LLM Reasoning Effort via Deep-Thinking Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13517)
*Wei-Lin Chen,Liqian Peng,Tian Tan,Chao Zhao,Blake JianHang Chen,Ziqian Lin,Alec Go,Yu Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Deep-thinking tokens in LLMs better predict reasoning accuracy than raw token counts or confidence. Think@n uses deep-thinking ratios to optimize inference costs by focusing on promising samples early.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of raw token counts and confidence in measuring reasoning quality in LLMs, and to find a more robust metric.

Method: Identifies deep-thinking tokens (tokens with significant revisions in deeper layers) and introduces Think@n, a strategy prioritizing samples with high deep-thinking ratios.

Result: Deep-thinking ratios show consistent positive correlation with accuracy, outperforming baselines. Think@n reduces costs while matching/exceeding standard self-consistency performance.

Conclusion: Deep-thinking tokens are a reliable proxy for reasoning quality, and Think@n efficiently scales inference by focusing on high-potential samples.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities by scaling test-time compute via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, recent findings suggest that raw token counts are unreliable proxies for reasoning quality: increased generation length does not consistently correlate with accuracy and may instead signal "overthinking," leading to performance degradation. In this work, we quantify inference-time effort by identifying deep-thinking tokens -- tokens where internal predictions undergo significant revisions in deeper model layers prior to convergence. Across four challenging mathematical and scientific benchmarks (AIME 24/25, HMMT 25, and GPQA-diamond) and a diverse set of reasoning-focused models (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3), we show that deep-thinking ratio (the proportion of deep-thinking tokens in a generated sequence) exhibits a robust and consistently positive correlation with accuracy, substantially outperforming both length-based and confidence-based baselines. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Think@n, a test-time scaling strategy that prioritizes samples with high deep-thinking ratios. We demonstrate that Think@n matches or exceeds standard self-consistency performance while significantly reducing inference costs by enabling the early rejection of unpromising generations based on short prefixes.

### [159] [On Calibration of Large Language Models: From Response To Capability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13540)
*Sin-Han Yang,Cheng-Kuang Wu,Chieh-Yen Lin,Yun-Nung Chen,Hung-yi Lee,Shao-Hua Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces capability calibration for LLMs, focusing on overall accuracy per query rather than single-response correctness, improving practical applications like pass@k prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior calibration methods focused on single-response confidence, which misaligns with practical needs where overall model capability per query is more relevant.

Method: Introduces capability calibration to estimate a model's expected accuracy on a query, distinguishing it from response calibration. Evaluates various confidence estimation methods empirically.

Result: Demonstrates that capability calibration improves pass@k prediction and inference budget allocation compared to traditional response-level calibration.

Conclusion: Capability calibration offers a better foundation for practical LLM applications, with potential broader impacts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as general-purpose problem solvers, making accurate confidence estimation critical for reliable use. Prior work on LLM calibration largely focuses on response-level confidence, which estimates the correctness of a single generated output. However, this formulation is misaligned with many practical settings where the central question is how likely a model is to solve a query overall. We show that this mismatch results from the stochastic nature of modern LLM decoding, under which single-response correctness fails to reflect underlying model capability. To address this issue, we introduce capability calibration, which targets the model's expected accuracy on a query. We formally distinguish capability calibration from response calibration and show that the two differ both theoretically and empirically. We establish an empirical evaluation setup and study a range of confidence estimation methods. Our results demonstrate that capability-calibrated confidence improves pass@$k$ prediction and inference budget allocation, establishing a foundation with potential for diverse applications.

### [160] [Small Reward Models via Backward Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13551)
*Yike Wang,Faeze Brahman,Shangbin Feng,Teng Xiao,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FLIP is a reference-free and rubric-free reward modeling approach that outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge baselines by 79.6% and improves downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models rely on large models or require reference responses/rubrics, limiting flexibility. FLIP aims to address these limitations by reformulating reward modeling through backward inference.

Method: FLIP uses backward inference to infer the instruction most likely to produce a given response, measuring the similarity between inferred and original instructions as the reward signal.

Result: FLIP outperforms baselines by an average of 79.6% across four domains using 13 small language models. It improves downstream performance and is robust to reward hacking.

Conclusion: FLIP provides a reliable and flexible reward modeling approach, especially effective in downscaled regimes where traditional methods fail.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a central role throughout the language model (LM) pipeline, particularly in non-verifiable domains. However, the dominant LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm relies on the strong reasoning capabilities of large models, while alternative approaches require reference responses or explicit rubrics, limiting flexibility and broader accessibility. In this work, we propose FLIP (FLipped Inference for Prompt reconstruction), a reference-free and rubric-free reward modeling approach that reformulates reward modeling through backward inference: inferring the instruction that would most plausibly produce a given response. The similarity between the inferred and the original instructions is then used as the reward signal. Evaluations across four domains using 13 small language models show that FLIP outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge baselines by an average of 79.6%. Moreover, FLIP substantially improves downstream performance in extrinsic evaluations under test-time scaling via parallel sampling and GRPO training. We further find that FLIP is particularly effective for longer outputs and robust to common forms of reward hacking. By explicitly exploiting the validation-generation gap, FLIP enables reliable reward modeling in downscaled regimes where judgment methods fail. Code available at https://github.com/yikee/FLIP.

*Manish Dhakal,Uthman Jinadu,Anjila Budathoki,Rajshekhar Sunderraman,Yi Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DistillLens improves Knowledge Distillation by aligning student and teacher thought processes symmetrically, avoiding overconfidence and underconfidence while preserving critical information for performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat teacher models' intermediate layers as black boxes and ignore uncertainty profiles crucial for final outputs.

Method: Projects hidden states into vocabulary space using Logit Lens and applies symmetric divergence for structural alignment.

Result: Outperforms standard KD and feature-transfer methods on GPT-2 and Llama benchmarks.

Conclusion: DistillLens effectively bridges the gap in intermediate-layer alignment, enhancing model compression and performance.

Abstract: Standard Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses Large Language Models (LLMs) by optimizing final outputs, yet it typically treats the teacher's intermediate layer's thought process as a black box. While feature-based distillation attempts to bridge this gap, existing methods (e.g., MSE and asymmetric KL divergence) ignore the rich uncertainty profiles required for the final output. In this paper, we introduce DistillLens, a framework that symmetrically aligns the evolving thought processes of student and teacher models. By projecting intermediate hidden states into the vocabulary space via the Logit Lens, we enforce structural alignment using a symmetric divergence objective. Our analysis proves that this constraint imposes a dual-sided penalty, preventing both overconfidence and underconfidence while preserving the high-entropy information conduits essential for final deduction. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 and Llama architectures demonstrate that DistillLens consistently outperforms standard KD and feature-transfer baselines on diverse instruction-following benchmarks.

*Zhipeng Song,Xiangyu Kong,Xinrui Bao,Yizhi Zhou,Jiulong Jiao,Sitong Liu,Yuhang Zhou,Heng Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM-Confidence Reranker (LCR), a training-free method leveraging LLM confidence to improve retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, enhancing document ranking without additional training or computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in knowledge-intensive tasks by large language models (LLMs) are a challenge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) helps but relies on accurate document retrieval, which current rerankers struggle with due to training needs and computational costs.

Method: LCR uses Maximum Semantic Cluster Proportion (MSCP) for black-box LLM confidence. It involves confidence assessment via multinomial sampling and clustering, followed by binning and multi-level sorting based on query and document confidence thresholds.

Result: LCR improves NDCG@5 by up to 20.6% on BEIR and TREC benchmarks with BM25 and Contriever retrievers, using only 7--9B-parameter LLMs, without performance degradation.

Conclusion: LCR efficiently enhances RAG systems by leveraging LLM confidence, mitigating hallucinations while remaining computationally efficient and broadly compatible.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet hallucinations in knowledge-intensive tasks remain a critical challenge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external knowledge, but its efficacy depends on accurate document retrieval and ranking. Although existing rerankers demonstrate effectiveness, they frequently necessitate specialized training, impose substantial computational expenses, and fail to fully exploit the semantic capabilities of LLMs, particularly their inherent confidence signals. We propose the LLM-Confidence Reranker (LCR), a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm that enhances reranking in RAG systems by leveraging black-box LLM confidence derived from Maximum Semantic Cluster Proportion (MSCP). LCR employs a two-stage process: confidence assessment via multinomial sampling and clustering, followed by binning and multi-level sorting based on query and document confidence thresholds. This approach prioritizes relevant documents while preserving original rankings for high-confidence queries, ensuring robustness. Evaluated on BEIR and TREC benchmarks with BM25 and Contriever retrievers, LCR--using only 7--9B-parameter pre-trained LLMs--consistently improves NDCG@5 by up to 20.6% across pre-trained LLM and fine-tuned Transformer rerankers, without degradation. Ablation studies validate the hypothesis that LLM confidence positively correlates with document relevance, elucidating LCR's mechanism. LCR offers computational efficiency, parallelism for scalability, and broad compatibility, mitigating hallucinations in applications like medical diagnosis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Elo-Evolve introduces a co-evolutionary framework for LLM alignment using dynamic multi-agent competition, eliminating static reward functions and leveraging pairwise comparisons for noise reduction and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment methods suffer from data scarcity, noise sensitivity, and instability due to static reward functions. Elo-Evolve aims to address these issues through dynamic competition.

Method: The framework uses pairwise comparisons for learning and Elo-orchestrated opponent selection for adaptive curriculum learning, grounded in PAC learning theory.

Result: Experimental results show a 4.5x noise reduction and superior performance hierarchy (Elo-Evolve > static pairwise > point-based) across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Elo-Evolve demonstrates the advantages of dynamic opponent selection and pairwise comparisons for improving LLM alignment efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Current alignment methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on compressing vast amounts of human preference data into static, absolute reward functions, leading to data scarcity, noise sensitivity, and training instability. We introduce Elo-Evolve, a co-evolutionary framework that redefines alignment as dynamic multi-agent competition within an adaptive opponent pool. Our approach makes two key innovations: (1) eliminating Bradley-Terry model dependencies by learning directly from binary win/loss outcomes in pairwise competitions, and (2) implementing Elo-orchestrated opponent selection that provides automatic curriculum learning through temperature-controlled sampling. We ground our approach in PAC learning theory, demonstrating that pairwise comparison achieves superior sample complexity and empirically validate a 4.5x noise reduction compared to absolute scoring approaches. Experimentally, we train a Qwen2.5-7B model using our framework with opponents including Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, and Qwen3-8B models. Results demonstrate a clear performance hierarchy: point-based methods < static pairwise training < Elo-Evolve across Alpaca Eval 2.0 and MT-Bench, validating the progressive benefits of pairwise comparison and dynamic opponent selection for LLM alignment.

*Veronica Mangiaterra,Chiara Barattieri di San Pietro,Paolo Canal,Valentina Bambini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how literary metaphors' processing demands changed over time and across genres in Italian, using diachronic distributional semantics. Findings show stable semantic similarity over time but varied processing demands by genre, influenced by linguistic changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To experimentally assess whether the processing costs of literary metaphors vary over historical periods and genres, addressing gaps in psycholinguistic and computational studies that overlooked temporal dimensions.

Method: Trained word embeddings on 19th- and 21st-century Italian corpora (124M tokens) and modeled semantic similarity between topics and vehicles of 515 literary metaphors as a proxy for processing demands.

Result: Semantic similarity remained stable over time, but genre influenced processing demands: metaphors were harder in modern literature, easier in modern nonliterary language, and shaped by semantic features of terms.

Conclusion: The findings reflect broader linguistic trends in Italian, like stylistic simplification in modern literature and the Web's creative language, impacting metaphor accessibility.

Abstract: Metaphors are a distinctive feature of literary language, yet they remain less studied experimentally than everyday metaphors. Moreover, previous psycholinguistic and computational approaches overlooked the temporal dimension, although many literary metaphors were coined centuries apart from contemporary readers. This study innovatively applies tools from diachronic distributional semantics to assess whether the processing costs of literary metaphors varied over time and genre. Specifically, we trained word embeddings on literary and nonliterary Italian corpora from the 19th and 21st centuries, for a total of 124 million tokens, and modeled changes in the semantic similarity between topics and vehicles of 515 19th-century literary metaphors, taking this measure as a proxy of metaphor processing demands. Overall, semantic similarity, and hence metaphor processing demands, remained stable over time. However, genre played a key role: metaphors appeared more difficult (i.e., lower topic-vehicle similarity) in modern literary contexts than in 19th-century literature, but easier (i.e., higher topic-vehicle similarity) in today's nonliterary language (e.g., the Web) than in 19th-century nonliterary texts. This pattern was further shaped by semantic features of metaphors' individual terms, such as vector coherence and semantic neighborhood density. Collectively, these findings align with broader linguistic changes in Italian, such as the stylistic simplification of modern literature, which may have increased metaphor processing demands, and the high creativity of the Web's language, which seems to render metaphor more accessible.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent framework to quantify the benefits of using theoretical knowledge for identifying rephrasing functions in discourse, showing that RAG-enhanced LLMs outperform baselines significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of identifying strategic reformulation functions in discourse, beyond surface-level similarity detection by LLMs.

Method: Comparative evaluation of two LLM-based agent systems (one with RAG-enhanced argumentation theory, the other zero-shot) on annotated political debates, classifying rephrase functions (D-I-S-G-O).

Result: RAG-enhanced agents outperformed baselines by nearly 30% Macro F1-score, especially excelling in Intensification and Generalisation detection.

Conclusion: Theoretical grounding is essential for function-aware discourse analysis, and the framework advances scalable, theoretically informed computational tools.

Abstract: Identifying the strategic uses of reformulation in discourse remains a key challenge for computational argumentation. While LLMs can detect surface-level similarity, they often fail to capture the pragmatic functions of rephrasing, such as its role within rhetorical discourse. This paper presents a comparative multi-agent framework designed to quantify the benefits of incorporating explicit theoretical knowledge for this task. We utilise an dataset of annotated political debates to establish a new standard encompassing four distinct rephrase functions: Deintensification, Intensification, Specification, Generalisation, and Other, which covers all remaining types (D-I-S-G-O). We then evaluate two parallel LLM-based agent systems: one enhanced by argumentation theory via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and an identical zero-shot baseline. The results reveal a clear performance gap: the RAG-enhanced agents substantially outperform the baseline across the board, with particularly strong advantages in detecting Intensification and Generalisation context, yielding an overall Macro F1-score improvement of nearly 30\%. Our findings provide evidence that theoretical grounding is not only beneficial but essential for advancing beyond mere paraphrase detection towards function-aware analysis of argumentative discourse. This comparative multi-agent architecture represents a step towards scalable, theoretically informed computational tools capable of identifying rhetorical strategies in contemporary discourse.

*Yongkang Jin,Jianwen Luo,Jingjing Wang,Jianmin Yao,Yu Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RMPL proposes a progressive learning framework for Multimedia Event Extraction (MEE) under low-resource conditions, improving event and argument grounding across text and images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in MEE is hindered by limited annotated data, weak grounding in existing methods, and reliance on cross-modal alignment or prompting.

Method: RMPL uses heterogeneous supervision from unimodal tasks and stage-wise training to learn shared event representations, followed by fine-tuning with mixed data.

Result: Experiments on M2E2 show consistent improvements across modalities with various Vision--Language Models.

Conclusion: RMPL effectively addresses low-resource challenges in MEE, enhancing event and argument grounding.

Abstract: Multimedia Event Extraction (MEE) aims to identify events and their arguments from documents that contain both text and images. It requires grounding event semantics across different modalities. Progress in MEE is limited by the lack of annotated training data. M2E2 is the only established benchmark, but it provides annotations only for evaluation. This makes direct supervised training impractical. Existing methods mainly rely on cross-modal alignment or inference-time prompting with Vision--Language Models (VLMs). These approaches do not explicitly learn structured event representations and often produce weak argument grounding in multimodal settings. To address these limitations, we propose RMPL, a Relation-aware Multi-task Progressive Learning framework for MEE under low-resource conditions. RMPL incorporates heterogeneous supervision from unimodal event extraction and multimedia relation extraction with stage-wise training. The model is first trained with a unified schema to learn shared event-centric representations across modalities. It is then fine-tuned for event mention identification and argument role extraction using mixed textual and visual data. Experiments on the M2E2 benchmark with multiple VLMs show consistent improvements across different modality settings.

*Melis Çelikkol,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sign language lexicography improves by analyzing word-to-sign mappings, identifying underrepresented polysemous/homonymous cases. A study on German/DGS using computational methods (SBERT embeddings) outperforms exact matching, revealing identifiable patterns and enriching resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address underrepresentation of polysemous and homonymous word-to-sign mappings in bilingual dictionaries by adopting a usage-based approach.

Method: Analyzed German and German Sign Language (DGS), manually annotating 1,404 word-to-sign mappings from D-WUG and DW-DGS, identifying three correspondence types, and evaluating EM vs. SS methods.

Result: Semantic Similarity (SS) outperforms Exact Match (EM) (88.52% vs. 71.31%), especially for Type 1 (+52.1 pp), revealing identifiable patterns.

Conclusion: Established the first annotated dataset for cross-modal sense correspondence, demonstrating the effectiveness of SS over EM and enriching lexicographic resources.

Abstract: Sign language lexicographers construct bilingual dictionaries by establishing word-to-sign mappings, where polysemous and homonymous words corresponding to different signs across contexts are often underrepresented. A usage-based approach examining how word senses map to signs can identify such novel mappings absent from current dictionaries, enriching lexicographic resources. We address this by analyzing German and German Sign Language (Deutsche Gebärdensprache, DGS), manually annotating 1,404 word use-to-sign ID mappings derived from 32 words from the German Word Usage Graph (D-WUG) and 49 signs from the Digital Dictionary of German Sign Language (DW-DGS). We identify three correspondence types: Type 1 (one-to-many), Type 2 (many-to-one), and Type 3 (one-to-one), plus No Match cases. We evaluate computational methods: Exact Match (EM) and Semantic Similarity (SS) using SBERT embeddings. SS substantially outperforms EM overall 88.52% vs. 71.31%), with dramatic gains for Type 1 (+52.1 pp). Our work establishes the first annotated dataset for cross-modal sense correspondence and reveals which correspondence patterns are computationally identifiable. Our code and dataset are made publicly available.

TL;DR: OMGs is an AI framework simulating multidisciplinary tumor boards for ovarian cancer management, showing performance comparable to expert consensus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of timely expert consensus in resource-constrained settings for ovarian tumour management.

Method: Developed OMGs, a multi-agent AI system evaluated using SPEAR criteria (Safety, Personalization, Evidence, Actionability, Robustness).

Result: OMGs matched expert MDT performance (4.45 vs. 4.53) and improved Evidence scores (4.57 vs. 3.92), with high concordance in real cases.

Conclusion: OMGs can expand access to specialized oncology expertise, particularly improving Evidence and Robustness in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Ovarian tumour management has increasingly relied on multidisciplinary tumour board (MDT) deliberation to address treatment complexity and disease heterogeneity. However, most patients worldwide lack access to timely expert consensus, particularly in resource-constrained centres where MDT resources are scarce or unavailable. Here we present OMGs (Ovarian tumour Multidisciplinary intelligent aGent System), a multi-agent AI framework where domain-specific agents deliberate collaboratively to integrate multidisciplinary evidence and generate MDT-style recommendations with transparent rationales. To systematically evaluate MDT recommendation quality, we developed SPEAR (Safety, Personalization, Evidence, Actionability, Robustness) and validated OMGs across diverse clinical scenarios spanning the care continuum. In multicentre re-evaluation, OMGs achieved performance comparable to expert MDT consensus ($4.45 \pm 0.30$ versus $4.53 \pm 0.23$), with higher Evidence scores (4.57 versus 3.92). In prospective multicentre evaluation (59 patients), OMGs demonstrated high concordance with routine MDT decisions. Critically, in paired human-AI studies, OMGs most substantially enhanced clinicians' recommendations in Evidence and Robustness, the dimensions most compromised when multidisciplinary expertise is unavailable. These findings suggest that multi-agent deliberative systems can achieve performance comparable to expert MDT consensus, with potential to expand access to specialized oncology expertise in resource-limited settings.

*Muneef Y. Alsawsh,Mohammed Q. Shormani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates how Yemeni learners of English acquire irregular inflections, focusing on L1 transfer and UG-driven processes. Findings show initial L1 dominance, later UG sensitivity, but persistent challenges due to input and instruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how L1 transfer and UG principles influence the acquisition of English irregular inflections by Yemeni L2 learners.

Method: Analyzes learner errors across two stages (stage 1 and stage 2) using Feature Reassembly Hypothesis and one-way ANOVA for statistical analysis.

Result: Stage 1 shows strong L1 influence; stage 2 reveals improved UG sensitivity. Errors stem from interlingual and intralingual sources. Challenges persist due to poor input and instruction.

Conclusion: Appropriate input and instruction are crucial for UG-driven feature reassembly in adult L2 learners despite initial L1 dominance.

Abstract: This study examines the acquisition of English irregular inflections by Yemeni learners of English as a second language (L2), utilizing a Universal Grammar (UG) approach. Within the UG approach, the study considers Feature Reassembly Hypothesis (FRH) (Lardiere, 2008, 2009) part of UG, focusing on the roles of first language (L1) transfer and L2 developmental influence. It analyzes learner errors across two developmental stages. Stage 1 data reveal a dominant influence of L1 transfer, particularly in phonological and structural mismatches, while stage 2 data demonstrate increased learner sensitivity to UG properties and morphological reconfiguration toward the target language. Findings reveal that errors in irregular inflectional morphology are attributed to both interlingual and intralingual sources, with overgeneralization of L2 rules as a common developmental strategy. Statistical analysis, including a one-way ANOVA, indicates significant improvement in the production of well-formed irregular inflections from stage 1 to stage 2, underscoring learners' continued access to UG. However, persistent difficulties with consonant change, zero-morpheme, and -a plural inflections suggest that limited exposure, ineffective input modeling, and insufficient instructional quality constrain full UG access. The study concludes that while L1 transfer and L2 developmental factors influence initial stages of acquisition, appropriate linguistic input and instruction are critical for facilitating UG-driven feature reassembly in adult L2 learners.

### [170] [Beyond Words: Evaluating and Bridging Epistemic Divergence in User-Agent Interaction via Theory of Mind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13832)
*Minyuan Ruan,Ziyue Wang,Kaiming Liu,Yunghwei Lai,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of LLMs in understanding imprecise user needs by formalizing Theory of Mind (ToM) as a tool for epistemic divergence detection. It introduces a benchmark and a dataset to improve ToM in LLMs, showing enhanced performance in real-world interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to comprehend imprecise user intentions, causing a gap between user beliefs and actual states. The study aims to leverage ToM to bridge this gap and improve interaction.

Method: The authors formalize ToM for LLMs, propose a benchmark (enchname) to evaluate belief reconciliation, and curate a trajectory-based dataset for reinforcement learning.

Result: Testing 11 models reveals limitations in detecting cognitive gaps. Training on the new dataset improves reasoning about user mental states and downstream task performance.

Conclusion: ToM is valuable as an interaction-level mechanism, not just a reasoning skill. The work demonstrates its practical utility in enhancing LLM performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly and are widely applied to both general-purpose and professional tasks to assist human users. However, they still struggle to comprehend and respond to the true user needs when intentions and instructions are imprecisely conveyed, leading to a divergence between subjective user believes and true environment states. Resolving this epistemic divergence requires Theory of Mind (ToM), yet existing ToM evaluations for LLMs primarily focus on isolated belief inference, overlooking its functional utility in real-world interaction. To this end, we formalize ToM for LLMs as a mechanism for epistemic divergence detection and resolution, and propose a benchmark, \benchname, to assess how models reconcile user beliefs and profiles in practice. Results across 11 leading models reveal a significant limitation to identify underlying cognitive gaps that impede task success. To bridge this gap, we further curate a trajectory-based ToM dataset linking belief tracking with task-related state inference. The model trained on this data via reinforcement learning shows consistent improvement in reasoning about user mental states, leading to enhanced downstream performance. Our work highlights the practical value of ToM as an essential interaction-level mechanism rather than as a standalone reasoning skill.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpecVocab improves speculative decoding by dynamically selecting vocabulary subsets per step, boosting throughput over EAGLE-3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the bottleneck in draft model output distribution without compromising speculation effectiveness by avoiding reduced vocabularies.

Method: Proposes SpecVocab, which selects a vocabulary subset per decoding step dynamically.

Result: Achieves higher acceptance length and up to 8.1% increased throughput compared to EAGLE-3.

Conclusion: Vocabulary speculation via SpecVocab is a more effective alternative to reducing draft model vocabulary.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has rapidly emerged as a leading approach for accelerating language model (LM) inference, as it offers substantial speedups while yielding identical outputs. This relies upon a small draft model, tasked with predicting the outputs of the target model. State-of-the-art speculative decoding methods use a draft model consisting of a single decoder layer and output embedding matrix, with the latter dominating drafting time for the latest LMs. Recent work has sought to address this output distribution bottleneck by reducing the vocabulary of the draft model. Although this can improve throughput, it compromises speculation effectiveness when the target token is out-of-vocabulary. In this paper, we argue for vocabulary speculation as an alternative to a reduced vocabulary. We propose SpecVocab, an efficient and effective method that selects a vocabulary subset per decoding step. Across a variety of tasks, we demonstrate that SpecVocab can achieve a higher acceptance length than state-of-the-art speculative decoding approach, EAGLE-3. Notably, this yields up to an 8.1% increase in average throughput over EAGLE-3.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrivAct is a framework integrating contextual privacy into LLM agents, reducing leakage rates by up to 12.32% while maintaining helpfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing privacy methods for LLM agents are brittle and scenario-specific, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: PrivAct embeds privacy preferences directly into agents' generation behavior via multi-agent learning.

Result: Experiments show improved privacy preservation (12.32% leakage reduction) without compromising helpfulness.

Conclusion: PrivAct offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for LLM agents with zero-shot generalization.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in personalized tasks involving sensitive, context-dependent information, where privacy violations may arise in agents' action due to the implicitness of contextual privacy. Existing approaches rely on external, inference-time interventions which are brittle, scenario-specific, and may expand the privacy attack surface. We propose PrivAct, a contextual privacy-aware multi-agent learning framework that internalizes contextual privacy preservation directly into models' generation behavior for privacy-compliant agentic actions. By embedding privacy preferences into each agent, PrivAct enhances system-wide contextual integrity while achieving a more favorable privacy-helpfulness tradeoff. Experiments across multiple LLM backbones and benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in contextual privacy preservation, reducing leakage rates by up to 12.32% while maintaining comparable helpfulness, as well as zero-shot generalization and robustness across diverse multi-agent topologies.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 'Responsible Intelligence' framework to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) for real-world use by ensuring contextual awareness, safety, and cultural inclusivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for LLMs that are technically precise, ethically rigorous, and culturally aligned for global deployment.

Method: Combines domain adaptation, ethical safeguards, and cultural/multilingual alignment, using supervised adaptation, decoding-time alignment, and human feedback modeling.

Result: A framework that improves LLM performance in specific domains while ensuring safety and inclusivity.

Conclusion: The 'Responsible Intelligence' framework advances LLMs toward practical, ethical, and culturally sensitive applications.

Abstract: The overarching research direction of this work is the development of a ''Responsible Intelligence'' framework designed to reconcile the immense generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the stringent requirements of real-world deployment. As these models become a transformative force in artificial intelligence, there is an urgent need to move beyond general-purpose architectures toward systems that are contextually aware, inherently safer, and deeply respectful of global cultural nuances. This research navigates three interconnected threads: domain adaptation to ensure technical precision, ethical rigor to mitigate adversarial vulnerabilities, and cultural/multilingual alignment to promote global inclusivity. The methodological trajectory moves from classical supervised adaptation for task-specific demands to decoding-time alignment for safety, finally leveraging human feedback and preference modeling to achieve sociolinguistic acuity.

TL;DR: A multi-agent medical QA framework combines LLMs with evidence retrieval, uncertainty estimation, and bias checks, improving reliability and achieving 87% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of LLMs in healthcare (weak verification, insufficient evidence grounding, unreliable confidence) by enhancing answer reliability through specialized agents and verification layers.

Method: Fine-tuning GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek R1 on medical QA data; implementing a modular pipeline with Clinical Reasoning, Evidence Retrieval, and Refinement agents; adding safety mechanisms (uncertainty scoring, bias detection).

Result: DeepSeek R1 outperforms BioGPT (ROUGE-1 0.536); full system achieves 87% accuracy, reduces uncertainty (perplexity 4.13), and has 36.5s latency.

Conclusion: Agent specialization and verification mitigate single-model limitations, providing an extensible design for reliable, evidence-based medical AI.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for healthcare question answering, but clinical use is limited by weak verification, insufficient evidence grounding, and unreliable confidence signalling. We propose a multi-agent medical QA framework that combines complementary LLMs with evidence retrieval, uncertainty estimation, and bias checks to improve answer reliability. Our approach has two phases. First, we fine-tune three representative LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek R1) on MedQuAD-derived medical QA data (20k+ question-answer pairs across multiple NIH domains) and benchmark generation quality. DeepSeek R1 achieves the strongest scores (ROUGE-1 0.536 +- 0.04; ROUGE-2 0.226 +-0.03; BLEU 0.098 -+ 0.018) and substantially outperforms the specialised biomedical baseline BioGPT in zero-shot evaluation. Second, we implement a modular multi-agent pipeline in which a Clinical Reasoning agent (fine-tuned LLaMA) produces structured explanations, an Evidence Retrieval agent queries PubMed to ground responses in recent literature, and a Refinement agent (DeepSeek R1) improves clarity and factual consistency; an optional human validation path is triggered for high-risk or high-uncertainty cases. Safety mechanisms include Monte Carlo dropout and perplexity-based uncertainty scoring, plus lexical and sentiment-based bias detection supported by LIME/SHAP-based analyses. In evaluation, the full system achieves 87% accuracy with relevance around 0.80, and evidence augmentation reduces uncertainty (perplexity 4.13) compared to base responses, with mean end-to-end latency of 36.5 seconds under the reported configuration. Overall, the results indicate that agent specialisation and verification layers can mitigate key single-model limitations and provide a practical, extensible design for evidence-based and bias-aware medical AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Summarizes issues with LLM safety pipelines favoring high-resource languages, highlighting risks for low-resource languages and proposing localized solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in LLM safety pipelines that neglect low-resource languages and cultural contexts, aiming for equitable AI globally.

Method: Synthesizes recent findings on weakened safety guardrails and proposes solutions like culturally grounded evaluation and participatory workflows.

Result: Identifies three key issues: weakened safety guardrails, persistent harmful behavior, and failed knowledge transfer in low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Advocates for multilingual safety as a core requirement in AI, emphasizing localized solutions and community participation for equitable outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being deployed across the Global South, where everyday use involves low-resource languages, code-mixing, and culturally specific norms. Yet safety pipelines, benchmarks, and alignment still largely target English and a handful of high-resource languages, implicitly assuming safety and factuality ''transfer'' across languages. Evidence increasingly shows they do not. We synthesize recent findings indicating that (i) safety guardrails weaken sharply on low-resource and code-mixed inputs, (ii) culturally harmful behavior can persist even when standard toxicity scores look acceptable, and (iii) English-only knowledge edits and safety patches often fail to carry over to low-resource languages. In response, we outline a practical agenda for researchers and students in the Global South: parameter-efficient safety steering, culturally grounded evaluation and preference data, and participatory workflows that empower local communities to define and mitigate harm. Our aim is to make multilingual safety a core requirement-not an add-on-for equitable AI in underrepresented regions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ADAB, a new annotated Arabic dataset for politeness detection, covering diverse Arabic dialects and linguistic features, with benchmarks for various NLP models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of Arabic-language resources for politeness detection despite the rich politeness expressions in Arabic communication.

Method: Collected and annotated 10,000 samples from four online platforms, using Arabic linguistic traditions and pragmatic theory for classification (polite, impolite, neutral). Benchmarking involved 40 model configurations.

Result: Achieved substantial inter-annotator agreement (kappa = 0.703) and provided a diverse dataset covering Modern Standard Arabic and multiple dialects.

Conclusion: ADAB supports research on politeness-aware Arabic NLP, filling a gap in culturally-aware resources.

Abstract: The growing importance of culturally-aware natural language processing systems has led to an increasing demand for resources that capture sociopragmatic phenomena across diverse languages. Nevertheless, Arabic-language resources for politeness detection remain under-explored, despite the rich and complex politeness expressions embedded in Arabic communication. In this paper, we introduce ADAB (Arabic Politeness Dataset), a new annotated Arabic dataset collected from four online platforms, including social media, e-commerce, and customer service domains, covering Modern Standard Arabic and multiple dialects (Gulf, Egyptian, Levantine, and Maghrebi). The dataset was annotated based on Arabic linguistic traditions and pragmatic theory, resulting in three classes: polite, impolite, and neutral. It contains 10,000 samples with linguistic feature annotations across 16 politeness categories and achieves substantial inter-annotator agreement (kappa = 0.703). We benchmark 40 model configurations, including traditional machine learning, transformer-based models, and large language models. The dataset aims to support research on politeness-aware Arabic NLP.

TL;DR: This paper explores optimizing prompt templates for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in Small Language Models (SLMs) for multi-hop QA tasks, showing significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the research gap in optimizing RAG for SLMs, particularly in complex tasks requiring reasoning, focusing on prompt templates.

Method: Conducted a large-scale empirical study evaluating 24 prompt templates (including standard, literature-based, and novel hybrids) on HotpotQA using Qwen2.5-3B Instruct and Gemma3-4B-It SLMs.

Result: Achieved performance gains up to 83% (Qwen2.5) and 84.5% (Gemma3-4B-It), improving by 6% over standard prompts.

Conclusion: Provides actionable recommendations for designing efficient prompts for SLM-based RAG systems in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach for enhancing the factual grounding of language models by integrating external knowledge. While widely studied for large language models, the optimization of RAG for Small Language Models (SLMs) remains a critical research gap, particularly in complex, multi-hop question-answering tasks that require sophisticated reasoning. In these systems, prompt template design is a crucial yet under-explored factor influencing performance. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study to investigate this factor, evaluating 24 different prompt templates on the HotpotQA dataset. The set includes a standard RAG prompt, nine well-formed techniques from the literature, and 14 novel hybrid variants, all tested on two prominent SLMs: Qwen2.5-3B Instruct and Gemma3-4B-It. Our findings, based on a test set of 18720 instances, reveal significant performance gains of up to 83% on Qwen2.5 and 84.5% on Gemma3-4B-It, yielding an improvement of up to 6% for both models compared to the Standard RAG prompt. This research also offers concrete analysis and actionable recommendations for designing effective and efficient prompts for SLM-based RAG systems, practically for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: Introducing Pre-Editorial Normalization (PEN) to bridge the gap between palaeographic fidelity and normalized usability in ATR outputs, featuring a new dataset and ByT5-based models achieving a 6.7% CER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the usability gap between palaeographic transcriptions and normalized digital editions in ATR outputs.

Method: Introduces PEN, uses CoMMA corpus-derived dataset, aligns with Old French and Latin editions, and benchmarks with ByT5 models.

Result: Achieves a 6.7% CER, outperforming previous models, and provides a silver corpus (4.66M samples) and gold set (1.8k samples).

Conclusion: PEN effectively balances palaeographic fidelity with normalized usability, demonstrated by improved performance and new datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in Automatic Text Recognition (ATR) have improved access to historical archives, yet a methodological divide persists between palaeographic transcriptions and normalized digital editions. While ATR models trained on more palaeographically-oriented datasets such as CATMuS have shown greater generalizability, their raw outputs remain poorly compatible with most readers and downstream NLP tools, thus creating a usability gap. On the other hand, ATR models trained to produce normalized outputs have been shown to struggle to adapt to new domains and tend to over-normalize and hallucinate. We introduce the task of Pre-Editorial Normalization (PEN), which consists in normalizing graphemic ATR output according to editorial conventions, which has the advantage of keeping an intermediate step with palaeographic fidelity while providing a normalized version for practical usability. We present a new dataset derived from the CoMMA corpus and aligned with digitized Old French and Latin editions using passim. We also produce a manually corrected gold-standard evaluation set. We benchmark this resource using ByT5-based sequence-to-sequence models on normalization and pre-annotation tasks. Our contributions include the formal definition of PEN, a 4.66M-sample silver training corpus, a 1.8k-sample gold evaluation set, and a normalization model achieving a 6.7% CER, substantially outperforming previous models for this task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce noise and bias in the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark, which distorts evaluations and cross-model comparisons.

Method: A two-stage workflow: Stage I validates items through expert review and model checks; Stage II revises flawed items while preserving original intent, resulting in verified and certified items.

Result: HLE-Verified shows an average accuracy gain of 7--10 percentage points for models, with even higher gains (30--40 points) on previously erroneous items.

Conclusion: HLE-Verified enhances evaluation fidelity by reducing noise, enabling more accurate measurement of model capabilities.

Abstract: Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) has become a widely used benchmark for evaluating frontier large language models on challenging, multi-domain questions. However, community-led analyses have raised concerns that HLE contains a non-trivial number of noisy items, which can bias evaluation results and distort cross-model comparisons. To address this challenge, we introduce HLE-Verified, a verified and revised version of HLE with a transparent verification protocol and fine-grained error taxonomy. Our construction follows a two-stage validation-and-repair workflow resulting in a certified benchmark. In Stage I, each item undergoes binary validation of the problem and final answer through domain-expert review and model-based cross-checks, yielding 641 verified items. In Stage II, flawed but fixable items are revised under strict constraints preserving the original evaluation intent, through dual independent expert repairs, model-assisted auditing, and final adjudication, resulting in 1,170 revised-and-certified items. The remaining 689 items are released as a documented uncertain set with explicit uncertainty sources and expertise tags for future refinement. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art language models on HLE and HLE-Verified, observing an average absolute accuracy gain of 7--10 percentage points on HLE-Verified. The improvement is particularly pronounced on items where the original problem statement and/or reference answer is erroneous, with gains of 30--40 percentage points. Our analyses further reveal a strong association between model confidence and the presence of errors in the problem statement or reference answer, supporting the effectiveness of our revisions. Overall, HLE-Verified improves HLE-style evaluations by reducing annotation noise and enabling more faithful measurement of model capabilities.

TL;DR: Proposes using LLMs for Chain-of-Thought reasoning on clinical EHRs to improve Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, achieving better performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AD diagnosis is resource-intensive and limited. LLMs offer potential for leveraging EHRs but need better methods for complex AD factors.

Method: Uses LLM-generated CoT reasoning paths on EHRs to provide explicit diagnostic rationale, followed by structured CoT-based predictions.

Result: Significantly improves stability and diagnostic performance, with up to 15% F1 score boost over zero-shot baselines.

Conclusion: CoT-based LLM approach enhances AD diagnosis by addressing complexity and improving interpretability.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Traditional diagnosis still relies heavily on medical imaging and clinical assessment by physicians, which is often time-consuming and resource-intensive in terms of both human expertise and healthcare resources. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to the medical field using electronic health records (EHRs), yet their application in Alzheimer's disease assessment remains limited, particularly given that AD involves complex multifactorial etiologies that are difficult to observe directly through imaging modalities. In this work, we propose leveraging LLMs to perform Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning on patients' clinical EHRs. Unlike direct fine-tuning of LLMs on EHR data for AD classification, our approach utilizes LLM-generated CoT reasoning paths to provide the model with explicit diagnostic rationale for AD assessment, followed by structured CoT-based predictions. This pipeline not only enhances the model's ability to diagnose intrinsically complex factors but also improves the interpretability of the prediction process across different stages of AD progression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CoT-based diagnostic framework significantly enhances stability and diagnostic performance across multiple CDR grading tasks, achieving up to a 15% improvement in F1 score compared to the zero-shot baseline method.

*Ali Zahedzadeh,Behnam Bahrak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Examining the balance between explanation sufficiency and conciseness in Large Language Models, the study finds that shorter explanations often maintain accuracy, but excessive compression harms performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and costliness of verbose self-explanations in Large Language Models (LLMs) while ensuring they still justify correct answers.

Method: Introduced an evaluation pipeline using the ARC Challenge dataset, applying length constraints to explanations and assessing sufficiency with multiple LLMs across English and Persian languages.

Result: Concise explanations frequently retain sufficient accuracy, significantly reducing length without degrading performance, but over-compression leads to accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Striking the right balance between explanation length and sufficiency can enhance LLM efficiency without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models increasingly rely on self-explanations, such as chain of thought reasoning, to improve performance on multi step question answering. While these explanations enhance accuracy, they are often verbose and costly to generate, raising the question of how much explanation is truly necessary. In this paper, we examine the trade-off between sufficiency, defined as the ability of an explanation to justify the correct answer, and conciseness, defined as the reduction in explanation length. Building on the information bottleneck principle, we conceptualize explanations as compressed representations that retain only the information essential for producing correct answers.To operationalize this view, we introduce an evaluation pipeline that constrains explanation length and assesses sufficiency using multiple language models on the ARC Challenge dataset. To broaden the scope, we conduct experiments in both English, using the original dataset, and Persian, as a resource-limited language through translation. Our experiments show that more concise explanations often remain sufficient, preserving accuracy while substantially reducing explanation length, whereas excessive compression leads to performance degradation.

Conclusion: BERT-based models excel in NER for payment data; PaymentBERT sets new benchmarks, aiding AML compliance and payment automation.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) has emerged as a critical component in automating financial transaction processing, particularly in extracting structured information from unstructured payment data. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art NER algorithms specifically designed for payment data extraction, including Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with CRF (BiLSTM-CRF), and transformer-based models such as BERT and FinBERT. We conduct extensive experiments on a dataset of 50,000 annotated payment transactions across multiple payment formats including SWIFT MT103, ISO 20022, and domestic payment systems. Our experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned BERT models achieve an F1-score of 94.2% for entity extraction, outperforming traditional CRF-based approaches by 12.8 percentage points. Furthermore, we introduce PaymentBERT, a novel hybrid architecture combining domain-specific financial embeddings with contextual representations, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 95.7% F1-score while maintaining real-time processing capabilities. We provide detailed analysis of cross-format generalization, ablation studies, and deployment considerations. This research provides practical insights for financial institutions implementing automated sanctions screening, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and payment processing systems.

*Sen Yang,Shanbo Cheng,Lu Xu,Jianbing Zhang,Shujian Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRRM, a Group Quality Metric paradigm, enhances GRPO for LLM post-training by improving intra-group ranking accuracy in Machine Translation through comparative analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Scalar Quality Metrics (SQM) fail to capture fine-grained linguistic nuances due to their isolated evaluation approach, necessitating a comparative context for accurate ranking.

Method: Introduce Group Quality Metric (GQM) via Group Relative Reward Model (GRRM), which jointly processes candidate groups for comparative analysis and integrates into GRPO training loops.

Result: GRRM achieves competitive ranking accuracy and improves translation quality, with reasoning capabilities matching state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The GRRM framework effectively addresses SQM limitations, enhancing GRPO performance in Machine Translation and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offers a powerful framework for LLM post-training, its effectiveness in open-ended domains like Machine Translation hinges on accurate intra-group ranking. We identify that standard Scalar Quality Metrics (SQM) fall short in this context; by evaluating candidates in isolation, they lack the comparative context necessary to distinguish fine-grained linguistic nuances. To address this, we introduce the Group Quality Metric (GQM) paradigm and instantiate it via the Group Relative Reward Model (GRRM). Unlike traditional independent scorers, GRRM processes the entire candidate group jointly, leveraging comparative analysis to rigorously resolve relative quality and adaptive granularity. Empirical evaluations confirm that GRRM achieves competitive ranking accuracy among all baselines. Building on this foundation, we integrate GRRM into the GRPO training loop to optimize the translation policy. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only improves general translation quality but also unlocks reasoning capabilities comparable to state-of-the-art reasoning models. We release codes, datasets, and model checkpoints at https://github.com/NJUNLP/GRRM.

### [184] [Geometry-Preserving Aggregation for Mixture-of-Experts Embedding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14039)
*Sajjad Kachuee,Mohammad Sharifkhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reveals that linear aggregation in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) embedding models distorts geometry, leading to reduced embedding comparability. It proposes Spherical Barycentric Aggregation (SBA) to preserve hyperspherical structure, improving performance without added training cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE models assume linear subspace structure, which contradicts actual geometric properties of expert representations, causing distortion in embeddings.

Method: Spherical Barycentric Aggregation (SBA) is introduced, separating radial and angular components to maintain hyperspherical consistency while integrating with existing routing mechanisms.

Result: Experiments on MTEB tasks show SBA improves performance in semantic similarity, clustering, and duplicate question detection while preventing aggregation-induced collapse.

Conclusion: Geometry-aware aggregation like SBA is crucial for MoE embeddings to maintain hyperspherical consistency and enhance comparability without extra training costs.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) embedding models combine expert outputs using weighted linear summation, implicitly assuming a linear subspace structure in the embedding space. This assumption is shown to be inconsistent with the geometry of expert representations. Geometric analysis of a modern MoE embedding model reveals that expert outputs lie on a shared hyperspherical manifold characterized by tightly concentrated norms and substantial angular separation. Under this geometry, linear aggregation induces inward collapse toward the manifold interior, distorting vector magnitude and direction and reducing embedding comparability. To address this inconsistency, Spherical Barycentric Aggregation (SBA) is introduced as a geometry-preserving aggregation operator that separates radial and angular components to maintain hyperspherical structure while remaining fully compatible with existing routing mechanisms. Experiments on selected tasks from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), including semantic similarity, clustering, and duplicate question detection, demonstrate consistent performance improvements with identical training cost and full stability. Additional geometric analyses confirm that SBA prevents aggregation-induced collapse and preserves hyperspherical consistency, highlighting the importance of geometry-aware aggregation in MoE embedding architectures.

*Pietro Bernardelle,Stefano Civelli,Kevin Roitero,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show factual knowledge but perform worse as context length grows, with evidence placement near prompt edges boosting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how context length and evidence placement affect LLM-based fact verification performance.

Method: Evaluated five open-source LLMs using three datasets, testing parametric knowledge and evidence placement across varying context lengths.

Result: Verification accuracy declines with longer contexts; evidence placement near prompt edges improves accuracy.

Conclusion: Prompt structure is crucial for retrieval-augmented fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning abilities across diverse tasks, yet their performance on extended contexts remains inconsistent. While prior research has emphasized mid-context degradation in question answering, this study examines the impact of context in LLM-based fact verification. Using three datasets (HOVER, FEVEROUS, and ClimateFEVER) and five open-source models accross different parameters sizes (7B, 32B and 70B parameters) and model families (Llama-3.1, Qwen2.5 and Qwen3), we evaluate both parametric factual knowledge and the impact of evidence placement across varying context lengths. We find that LLMs exhibit non-trivial parametric knowledge of factual claims and that their verification accuracy generally declines as context length increases. Similarly to what has been shown in previous works, in-context evidence placement plays a critical role with accuracy being consistently higher when relevant evidence appears near the beginning or end of the prompt and lower when placed mid-context. These results underscore the importance of prompt structure in retrieval-augmented fact-checking systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LogitsCoder is a novel framework that improves code generation by balancing reasoning depth and efficiency through logit-level control mechanisms, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address underthinking (shallow reasoning) and overthinking (inefficient verbose reasoning) in code generation tasks.

Method: Uses Logits Preference Decoding, Logits Rank Based Path Selection, and Thoughts Aggregation to iteratively refine reasoning steps.

Result: Produces more efficient and higher-quality reasoning chains, leading to better code generation performance.

Conclusion: LogitsCoder effectively balances reasoning depth and efficiency, outperforming baseline methods in code generation.

Abstract: Code generation remains a challenging task that requires precise and structured reasoning. Existing Test Time Scaling (TTS) methods, including structured tree search, have made progress in exploring reasoning paths but still face two major challenges: (1) underthinking, where reasoning chains tend to be shallow and fail to capture the full complexity of problems; and (2) overthinking, where overly verbose reasoning leads to inefficiency and increased computational costs. To address these issues, we propose LogitsCoder, a novel framework that enhances chain-of-thought reasoning through lightweight, logit-level control mechanisms for code generation. LogitsCoder iteratively generates and refines reasoning steps by first steering token selection toward statistically preferred patterns via Logits Preference Decoding, then selecting and aggregating diverse reasoning paths using Logits Rank Based Path Selection and Thoughts Aggregation. This results in coherent and effective reasoning chains that balance depth and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogitsCoder produces more efficient and higher-quality reasoning chains, leading to superior code generation performance compared to baseline methods.

*Yang Liu,Jiaye Yang,Weikang Li,Jiahui Liang,Yang Li,Lingyong Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LM-Lexicon improves definition modeling using clustering, expert learning, and model merging, achieving significant gains in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance definition modeling by decomposing tasks into semantic domains and training specialized language models.

Method: Uses clustering, semantic expert learning, and sparse mixture-of-experts architecture.

Result: Achieves +7% BLEU score over prior models, with 10% improvement in definition quality and higher expert efficacy.

Conclusion: Advances definition modeling and offers insights for efficient language models in semantic-intensive applications.

Abstract: We introduce LM-Lexicon, an innovative definition modeling approach that incorporates data clustering, semantic expert learning, and model merging using a sparse mixture-of-experts architecture. By decomposing the definition modeling task into specialized semantic domains, where small language models are trained as domain experts, LM-Lexicon achieves substantial improvements (+7% BLEU score compared with the prior state-of-the-art model) over existing methods on five widely used benchmarks. Empirically, we demonstrate that 1) the clustering strategy enables fine-grained expert specialization with nearly 10% improvement in definition quality; 2) the semantic-aware domain-level routing mechanism achieves higher expert efficacy (+1%) than conventional token-level routing; and 3) further performance gains can be obtained through test-time compute and semantic expert scaling. Our work advances definition modeling while providing insights into the development of efficient language models for semantic-intensive applications.

*Jandad Jahani,Mursal Dawodi,Jawid Ahmad Baktash*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the Pashto component of the Mozilla Common Voice corpus, documenting rapid growth and highlighting challenges like contributor inequality and incomplete metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale openly licensed speech data for Pashto, essential for ASR development.

Method: Release-level analysis focusing on version 24.0, examining growth, validation throughput, contributor participation, metadata completeness, and textual concentration.

Result: Significant growth in recorded hours (1.49 to 2,768.7), but high contributor inequality (Gini = 0.941), skewed demographics, and incomplete metadata (41.97% lack gender labels).

Conclusion: The study quantifies the corpus's growth and identifies priorities like improving validation capacity and broadening demographic participation for better dataset maturity.

Abstract: Large, openly licensed speech datasets are essential for building automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, yet many widely spoken languages remain underrepresented in public resources. Pashto, spoken by more than 60 million people, has historically lacked large-scale openly licensed speech data suitable for modern ASR development.
  This paper presents a release-level analysis of the Pashto component of the Mozilla Common Voice corpus, focusing on version 24.0 (December 2025) and contextualizing trends across major releases. We document rapid growth from 1.49 recorded hours in mid-2023 to 2,768.7 total hours in 2025, including 975.89 validated hours available for supervised ASR training.
  Beyond scale, we analyze validation throughput, contributor participation inequality, demographic metadata completeness, and sentence-level concentration in the validated subset. We find that participation is extremely concentrated (Gini = 0.941), age representation is strongly skewed toward young adults, and 41.97\% of clips lack self-reported gender labels, limiting subgroup auditing based on metadata. At the textual level, prompt reuse is moderate: 35.88\% of unique sentences account for 50\% of validated clips, suggesting that structural concentration is driven primarily by uneven contributor activity rather than dominance of a small prompt set.
  These results provide a quantitative audit of a rapidly scaling low-resource speech corpus and highlight practical priorities for improving dataset maturity, including expanded validation capacity and broader demographic participation.

*Ruipeng Jia,Yunyi Yang,Yuxin Wu,Yongbo Gai,Siyuan Tao,Mengyu Zhou,Jianhe Lin,Xiaoxi Jiang,Guanjun Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes OpenRS, a rubrics-based LLM framework for robust alignment, replacing scalar rewards with explicit reasoning under inspectable principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalar reward models create information bottlenecks leading to brittleness and reward hacking, necessitating a more robust alignment approach.

Method: OpenRS uses Pairwise Adaptive Meta-Rubrics (PAMR) and Pointwise Verifiable Rubrics (PVRs) for explicit reasoning, meta-rubric refinement, and pairwise comparisons.

Result: The framework improves discriminability in open-ended settings and ensures consistent yet editable principles across domains.

Conclusion: OpenRS offers a plug-and-play solution for robust alignment by leveraging inspectable principles and verifiable rewards.

Abstract: Scalar reward models compress multi-dimensional human preferences into a single opaque score, creating an information bottleneck that often leads to brittleness and reward hacking in open-ended alignment. We argue that robust alignment for non-verifiable tasks is fundamentally a principle generalization problem: reward should not be a learned function internalized into a judge, but an explicit reasoning process executed under inspectable principles. To operationalize this view, we present the Open Rubric System (OpenRS), a plug-and-play, rubrics-based LLM-as-a-Judge framework built around Pairwise Adaptive Meta-Rubrics (PAMR) and lightweight Pointwise Verifiable Rubrics (PVRs), which provide both hard-constraint guardrails and verifiable reward components when ground-truth or programmatic checks are available. OpenRS uses an explicit meta-rubric -- a constitution-like specification that governs how rubrics are instantiated, weighted, and enforced -- and instantiates adaptive rubrics on the fly by conditioning on the semantic differences between two candidate responses. It then performs criterion-wise pairwise comparisons and aggregates criterion-level preferences externally, avoiding pointwise weighted scalarization while improving discriminability in open-ended settings. To keep principles consistent yet editable across various domains, we introduce a two-level meta-rubric refinement pipeline (automated evolutionary refinement for general principles and a reproducible human-in-the-loop procedure for domain principles), complemented with pointwise verifiable rubrics that act as both guardrails against degenerate behaviors and a source of verifiable reward for objective sub-tasks. Finally, we instantiate OpenRS as reward supervision in pairwise RL training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper adapts LLaVA-Next methodology to create Polish VLMs using automated translation and synthetic data, achieving improved performance (+9.5%) and linguistic correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: English-centric VLMs limit usability for non-English speakers and hinder diverse linguistic and cultural representation.

Method: Uses automated translation and filtering of multimodal datasets, supplemented with synthetic Polish data for OCR and cultural tasks.

Result: +9.5% improvement over LLaVA-1.6-Vicuna-13B on Polish-adapted MMBench, higher-quality captions judged by human annotators.

Conclusion: Automated translation with lightweight filtering can bootstrap high-quality VLMs for low-resource languages, though cultural coverage and evaluation challenges remain.

Abstract: Most vision-language models (VLMs) are trained on English-centric data, limiting their performance in other languages and cultural contexts. This restricts their usability for non-English-speaking users and hinders the development of multimodal systems that reflect diverse linguistic and cultural realities. In this work, we reproduce and adapt the LLaVA-Next methodology to create a set of Polish VLMs. We rely on a fully automated pipeline for translating and filtering existing multimodal datasets, and complement this with synthetic Polish data for OCR and culturally specific tasks. Despite relying almost entirely on automatic translation and minimal manual intervention to the training data, our approach yields strong results: we observe a +9.5% improvement over LLaVA-1.6-Vicuna-13B on a Polish-adapted MMBench, along with higher-quality captions in generative evaluations, as measured by human annotators in terms of linguistic correctness. These findings highlight that large-scale automated translation, combined with lightweight filtering, can effectively bootstrap high-quality multimodal models for low-resource languages. Some challenges remain, particularly in cultural coverage and evaluation. To facilitate further research, we make our models and evaluation dataset publicly available.

*Nitay Calderon,Eyal Ben-David,Zorik Gekhman,Eran Ofek,Gal Yona*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces WikiProfile, a benchmark to profile LLMs' factual knowledge by distinguishing between encoding and accessibility issues, revealing that recall failures, not lack of knowledge, are the primary bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations overlook whether LLM errors stem from missing knowledge or inaccessible facts, motivating a framework to distinguish these causes.

Method: Developed WikiProfile, an automated benchmark using prompted LLMs grounded in web search, profiling facts by encoding and accessibility levels (unrecallable, directly recallable, inferable).

Result: Frontier models encode 95--98% of facts, but recall remains a bottleneck, especially for long-tail facts and reverse questions. Improved inference-time computation ('thinking') enhances recall.

Conclusion: Future LLM improvements may depend more on enhancing access to encoded knowledge rather than scaling, addressing systematic recall failures.

Abstract: Standard factuality evaluations of LLMs treat all errors alike, obscuring whether failures arise from missing knowledge (empty shelves) or from limited access to encoded facts (lost keys). We propose a behavioral framework that profiles factual knowledge at the level of facts rather than questions, characterizing each fact by whether it is encoded, and then by how accessible it is: cannot be recalled, can be directly recalled, or can only be recalled with inference-time computation (thinking). To support such profiling, we introduce WikiProfile, a new benchmark constructed via an automated pipeline with a prompted LLM grounded in web search. Across 4 million responses from 13 LLMs, we find that encoding is nearly saturated in frontier models on our benchmark, with GPT-5 and Gemini-3 encoding 95--98% of facts. However, recall remains a major bottleneck: many errors previously attributed to missing knowledge instead stem from failures to access it. These failures are systematic and disproportionately affect long-tail facts and reverse questions. Finally, we show that thinking improves recall and can recover a substantial fraction of failures, indicating that future gains may rely less on scaling and more on methods that improve how models utilize what they already encode.

*Shangqing Zhao,Yupei Ren,Yuhao Zhou,Xiaopeng Bai,Man Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CCiV, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-generated classical Chinese Ci poetry across structure, rhythm, and quality, revealing challenges in tonal adherence and alignment between correctness and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate and improve LLMs' capability in generating classical Chinese Ci poetry, which requires structural, rhythmic, and artistic sophistication.

Method: Developed CCiV benchmark to assess 17 LLMs on 30 Cipai forms, focusing on structure, rhythm, and quality. Used form-aware prompting to test improvements.

Result: Found models often produce historically unexpected variants, tonal patterns are harder than structural rules, and alignment between correctness and quality is weak.

Conclusion: CCiV underscores the need for variant-aware evaluation and holistic methods for constrained creative generation.

Abstract: The generation of classical Chinese \textit{Ci} poetry, a form demanding a sophisticated blend of structural rigidity, rhythmic harmony, and artistic quality, poses a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs). To systematically evaluate and advance this capability, we introduce \textbf{C}hinese \textbf{Ci}pai \textbf{V}ariants (\textbf{CCiV}), a benchmark designed to assess LLM-generated \textit{Ci} poetry across these three dimensions: structure, rhythm, and quality. Our evaluation of 17 LLMs on 30 \textit{Cipai} reveals two critical phenomena: models frequently generate valid but unexpected historical variants of a poetic form, and adherence to tonal patterns is substantially harder than structural rules. We further show that form-aware prompting can improve structural and tonal control for stronger models, while potentially degrading weaker ones. Finally, we observe weak and inconsistent alignment between formal correctness and literary quality in our sample. CCiV highlights the need for variant-aware evaluation and more holistic constrained creative generation methods.

### [193] [Character-aware Transformers Learn an Irregular Morphological Pattern Yet None Generalize Like Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14100)
*Akhilesh Kakolu Ramarao,Kevin Tang,Dinah Baer-Henney*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether neural networks can model human-like morphological learning, focusing on the Spanish L-shaped morphome. It compares encoder-decoder transformers and finds positional encoding critical, but models still fail to generalize like humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if neural networks can generalize morphological patterns akin to humans, specifically examining the Spanish L-shaped morphome.

Method: Five encoder-decoder transformers are tested with variations in positional encoding (sequential vs. position-invariant) and tag representations (atomic vs. decomposed).

Result: Position-invariant models better recover the L-shaped paradigm but generalize incorrectly, extending the pattern mood-based rather than morphomic. No model matches human generalization preferences.

Conclusion: Neural networks struggle to reproduce human-like morphological abstraction, highlighting limitations in their cognitive modeling capabilities for such tasks.

Abstract: Whether neural networks can serve as cognitive models of morphological learning remains an open question. Recent work has shown that encoder-decoder models can acquire irregular patterns, but evidence that they generalize these patterns like humans is mixed. We investigate this using the Spanish \emph{L-shaped morphome}, where only the first-person singular indicative (e.g., \textit{pongo} `I put') shares its stem with all subjunctive forms (e.g., \textit{ponga, pongas}) despite lacking apparent phonological, semantic, or syntactic motivation. We compare five encoder-decoder transformers varying along two dimensions: sequential vs. position-invariant positional encoding, and atomic vs. decomposed tag representations. Positional encoding proves decisive: position-invariant models recover the correct L-shaped paradigm clustering even when L-shaped verbs are scarce in training, whereas sequential positional encoding models only partially capture the pattern. Yet none of the models productively generalize this pattern to novel forms. Position-invariant models generalize the L-shaped stem across subjunctive cells but fail to extend it to the first-person singular indicative, producing a mood-based generalization rather than the L-shaped morphomic pattern. Humans do the opposite, generalizing preferentially to the first-person singular indicative over subjunctive forms. None of the models reproduce the human pattern, highlighting the gap between statistical pattern reproduction and morphological abstraction.

### [194] [Index Light, Reason Deep: Deferred Visual Ingestion for Visual-Dense Document Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14162)
*Tao Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deferred Visual Ingestion (DVI), a demand-side approach for multimodal document QA, reducing VLM token costs and improving reliability by deferring visual analysis to query time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pre-ingestion methods are costly, unreliable, and irrecoverable due to extensive VLM usage upfront and retrieval mismatches.

Method: DVI indexes only metadata for localization, using BM25 search, and sends original images to VLMs when specific questions arise.

Result: DVI matched pre-ingestion accuracy (46.7% vs. 48.9%) with zero ingestion cost, 50% effectiveness on visual queries, and 100% page localization.

Conclusion: DVI shifts the problem from QA accuracy to page localization, enabling cost-effective, reliable, and interactive document QA.

Abstract: Existing multimodal document question answering methods universally adopt a supply-side ingestion strategy: running a Vision-Language Model (VLM) on every page during indexing to generate comprehensive descriptions, then answering questions through text retrieval. However, this "pre-ingestion" approach is costly (a 113-page engineering drawing package requires approximately 80,000 VLM tokens), end-to-end unreliable (VLM outputs may fail to be correctly retrieved due to format mismatches in the retrieval infrastructure), and irrecoverable once it fails. This paper proposes the Deferred Visual Ingestion (DVI) framework, adopting a demand-side ingestion strategy: the indexing phase performs only lightweight metadata extraction, deferring visual understanding to the moment users pose specific questions. DVI's core principle is "Index for locating, not understanding"--achieving page localization through structured metadata indexes and BM25 full-text search, then sending original images along with specific questions to a VLM for targeted analysis. Experiments on two real industrial engineering drawings (113 pages + 7 pages) demonstrate that DVI achieves comparable overall accuracy at zero ingestion VLM cost (46.7% vs. 48.9%), an effectiveness rate of 50% on visually necessary queries (vs. 0% for pre-ingestion), and 100% page localization (98% search space compression). DVI also supports interactive refinement and progressive caching, transforming the "QA accuracy" problem into a "page localization" problem--once the correct drawing page is found, obtaining the answer becomes a matter of interaction rounds.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates four LLMs (Grok-4, GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, GPT-5) on long-context tasks, revealing a performance drop beyond 5K posts (70K tokens), especially in depression detection. GPT-5 maintains high precision despite accuracy decline, suggesting utility for sensitive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the practical ability of LLMs to handle long-context tasks despite theoretical capacity, focusing on tasks requiring detailed understanding.

Method: Used three datasets (culinary recipes, math problems, social media posts) to test models' performance, particularly evaluating depression detection on 20K posts.

Result: Performance degrades beyond 5K posts (70K tokens), with accuracy dropping to 50-53% for 20K posts. GPT-5 maintains high precision (~95%), indicating potential for sensitive applications.

Conclusion: Highlights the gap between theoretical and practical model performance, emphasizing the need for nuanced metrics beyond accuracy, especially in sensitive tasks.

Abstract: With the significant expansion of the context window in Large Language Models (LLMs), these models are theoretically capable of processing millions of tokens in a single pass. However, research indicates a significant gap between this theoretical capacity and the practical ability of models to robustly utilize information within long contexts, especially in tasks that require a comprehensive understanding of numerous details. This paper evaluates the performance of four state-of-the-art models (Grok-4, GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, and GPT-5) on long short-context tasks. For this purpose, three datasets were used: two supplementary datasets for retrieving culinary recipes and math problems, and a primary dataset of 20K social media posts for depression detection. The results show that as the input volume on the social media dataset exceeds 5K posts (70K tokens), the performance of all models degrades significantly, with accuracy dropping to around 50-53% for 20K posts. Notably, in the GPT-5 model, despite the sharp decline in accuracy, its precision remained high at approximately 95%, a feature that could be highly effective for sensitive applications like depression detection. This research also indicates that the "lost in the middle" problem has been largely resolved in newer models. This study emphasizes the gap between the theoretical capacity and the actual performance of models on complex, high-volume data tasks and highlights the importance of metrics beyond simple accuracy for practical applications.

*Samir Abdaljalil,Erchin Serpedin,Hasan Kurban*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an abstention-aware framework for verifying scientific claims, emphasizing the importance of abstaining when evidence is insufficient to reduce errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of models providing unsupported or uncertain conclusions in scientific settings, which can be harmful, the study focuses on abstention-aware verification.

Method: The framework decomposes claims into minimal conditions, audits each using natural language inference (NLI), and decides to support, refute, or abstain. Evaluated on SciFact and PubMedQA benchmarks with six diverse models.

Result: Abstention significantly reduces errors, with confidence-based abstention lowering risk at moderate coverage levels, though raw accuracy varies little across models.

Conclusion: In scientific reasoning, determining sufficient evidence is more critical than selecting the best model. Abstention-aware evaluation is a practical, model-agnostic approach for assessing reliability.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used to answer and verify scientific claims, yet existing evaluations typically assume that a model must always produce a definitive answer. In scientific settings, however, unsupported or uncertain conclusions can be more harmful than abstaining. We study this problem through an abstention-aware verification framework that decomposes scientific claims into minimal conditions, audits each condition against available evidence using natural language inference (NLI), and selectively decides whether to support, refute, or abstain. We evaluate this framework across two complementary scientific benchmarks: SciFact and PubMedQA, covering both closed-book and open-domain evidence settings. Experiments are conducted with six diverse language models, including encoder-decoder, open-weight chat models, and proprietary APIs. Across all benchmarks and models, we observe that raw accuracy varies only modestly across architectures, while abstention plays a critical role in controlling error. In particular, confidence-based abstention substantially reduces risk at moderate coverage levels, even when absolute accuracy improvements are limited. Our results suggest that in scientific reasoning tasks, the primary challenge is not selecting a single best model, but rather determining when available evidence is sufficient to justify an answer. This work highlights abstention-aware evaluation as a practical and model-agnostic lens for assessing scientific reliability, and provides a unified experimental basis for future work on selective reasoning in scientific domains.

Method: Develops a parsing algorithm and syntactic rules generating dependency and constituency trees, accommodating noise and incomplete parses.

Result: Achieves UAS scores of 54.5% (development) and 53.8% (test) on Universal Dependencies corpora, with support for multiple parse hypotheses.

Conclusion: The approach offers a transparent, interpretable NLP model leveraging historical syntactic work for computational applications.

Abstract: This research introduces a new parsing approach, based on earlier syntactic work on context free grammar (CFG) and generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG). The approach comprises both a new parsing algorithm and a set of syntactic rules and features that overcome the limitations of CFG. It also generates both dependency and constituency parse trees, while accommodating noise and incomplete parses. The system was tested on data from Universal Dependencies, showing a promising average Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS) of 54.5% in the development dataset (7 corpora) and 53.8% in the test set (12 corpora). The system also provides multiple parse hypotheses, allowing further reranking to improve parsing accuracy. This approach also leverages much of the theoretical syntactic work since the 1950s to be used within a computational context. The application of this approach provides a transparent and interpretable NLP model to process language input.

TL;DR: AD-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM agents in real-world advertising and marketing tasks, showing gaps in state-of-the-art models' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack realism for specialized domains like advertising, which require multi-round interactions with professional tools.

Method: AD-Bench is built from real user requests, categorized by difficulty (L1-L3), with expert-verified answers and tool-call trajectories.

Result: Gemini-3-Pro scores Pass@1 = 68.0% and Pass@3 = 83.0%, but drops significantly on L3 tasks (Pass@1 = 49.4%, Pass@3 = 62.1%).

Conclusion: AD-Bench highlights capability gaps in LLM agents for complex marketing tasks and offers a realistic evaluation framework.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents have achieved remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks, evaluating their performance in real-world environments has become a critical problem. Current benchmarks, however, are largely restricted to idealized simulations, failing to address the practical demands of specialized domains like advertising and marketing analytics. In these fields, tasks are inherently more complex, often requiring multi-round interaction with professional marketing tools. To address this gap, we propose AD-Bench, a benchmark designed based on real-world business requirements of advertising and marketing platforms. AD-Bench is constructed from real user marketing analysis requests, with domain experts providing verifiable reference answers and corresponding reference tool-call trajectories. The benchmark categorizes requests into three difficulty levels (L1-L3) to evaluate agents' capabilities under multi-round, multi-tool collaboration. Experiments show that on AD-Bench, Gemini-3-Pro achieves Pass@1 = 68.0% and Pass@3 = 83.0%, but performance drops significantly on L3 to Pass@1 = 49.4% and Pass@3 = 62.1%, with a trajectory coverage of 70.1%, indicating that even state-of-the-art models still exhibit substantial capability gaps in complex advertising and marketing analysis scenarios. AD-Bench provides a realistic benchmark for evaluating and improving advertising marketing agents, the leaderboard and code can be found at https://github.com/Emanual20/adbench-leaderboard.

### [199] [Detecting LLM Hallucinations via Embedding Cluster Geometry: A Three-Type Taxonomy with Measurable Signatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14259)
*Matic Korun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a geometric taxonomy for large language model hallucinations, identifying three types based on token embedding cluster structures. It introduces measurable statistics and demonstrates their universality across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand and categorize hallucinations in large language models by analyzing the geometric properties of token embeddings. Addressing these hallucinations can improve model reliability and performance.

Method: The authors analyze static embedding spaces of 11 transformer models (encoder and decoder architectures) to identify hallucination types and introduce three geometric statistics: α, β, and λ_s.

Result: The study finds that polarity structure (α) and cluster cohesion (β) are universal across all models, while the radial information gradient (λ_s) is significant in 9 out of 11 models. The two exceptions (ALBERT and MiniLM) have architecturally explicable reasons.

Conclusion: The findings provide a geometric framework for detecting type-specific hallucinations and predict architecture-dependent vulnerabilities, offering insights for improving model design and evaluation.

Abstract: We propose a geometric taxonomy of large language model hallucinations based on observable signatures in token embedding cluster structure. By analyzing the static embedding spaces of 11 transformer models spanning encoder (BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, DeBERTa, ALBERT, MiniLM, DistilBERT) and decoder (GPT-2) architectures, we identify three operationally distinct hallucination types: Type 1 (center-drift) under weak context, Type 2 (wrong-well convergence) to locally coherent but contextually incorrect cluster regions, and Type 3 (coverage gaps) where no cluster structure exists. We introduce three measurable geometric statistics: α (polarity coupling), \b{eta} (cluster cohesion), and λ_s (radial information gradient). Across all 11 models, polarity structure (α > 0.5) is universal (11/11), cluster cohesion (\b{eta} > 0) is universal (11/11), and the radial information gradient is significant (9/11, p < 0.05). We demonstrate that the two models failing λ_s significance -- ALBERT and MiniLM -- do so for architecturally explicable reasons: factorized embedding compression and distillation-induced isotropy, respectively. These findings establish the geometric prerequisites for type-specific hallucination detection and yield testable predictions about architecture-dependent vulnerability profiles.

*Zachary Bamberger,Till R. Saenger,Gilad Morad,Ofra Amir,Brandon M. Stewart,Amir Feder*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STATe-of-Thoughts (STATe) introduces an interpretable Inference-Time-Compute method using structured textual interventions for diverse and high-quality text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ITC methods struggle with meaningful diversity and lack control over reasoning, limiting explainability.

Method: STATe replaces stochastic sampling with discrete textual interventions: action selection, conditioned reasoning generation, and candidate scoring.

Result: STATe achieves greater diversity, interpretability, and quality in text generation, with action sequences predictive of output quality.

Conclusion: STATe provides a practical framework for generating diverse, high-quality, and interpretable text.

Abstract: Inference-Time-Compute (ITC) methods like Best-of-N and Tree-of-Thoughts are meant to produce output candidates that are both high-quality and diverse, but their use of high-temperature sampling often fails to achieve meaningful output diversity. Moreover, existing ITC methods offer limited control over how to perform reasoning, which in turn limits their explainability. We present STATe-of-Thoughts (STATe), an interpretable ITC method that searches over high-level reasoning patterns. STATe replaces stochastic sampling with discrete and interpretable textual interventions: a controller selects actions encoding high-level reasoning choices, a generator produces reasoning steps conditioned on those choices, and an evaluator scores candidates to guide search. This structured approach yields three main advantages. First, action-guided textual interventions produce greater response diversity than temperature-based sampling. Second, in a case study on argument generation, STATe's explicit action sequences capture interpretable features that are highly predictive of output quality. Third, estimating the association between performance and action choices allows us to identify promising yet unexplored regions of the action space and steer generation directly toward them. Together, these results establish STATe as a practical framework for generating high-quality, diverse, and interpretable text. Our framework is available at https://github.com/zbambergerNLP/state-of-thoughts.

### [201] [Does Socialization Emerge in AI Agent Society? A Case Study of Moltbook](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14299)
*Ming Li,Xirui Li,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether AI agent societies converge like human social systems, using Moltbook as a case study. It introduces a diagnostic framework revealing dynamic balance but no stable collective influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if AI agent societies exhibit convergence dynamics similar to human social systems and to diagnose their behavior systematically.

Method: A quantitative diagnostic framework measures semantic stabilization, lexical turnover, individual inertia, influence persistence, and collective consensus in Moltbook, an open-ended AI agent society.

Result: Agents show dynamic balance: semantic averages stabilize quickly, but agents remain diverse with transient influence and no consensus, indicating insufficient socialization.

Conclusion: Scale and interaction density alone don't lead to socialization; findings offer design principles for future AI agent societies.

Abstract: As large language model agents increasingly populate networked environments, a fundamental question arises: do artificial intelligence (AI) agent societies undergo convergence dynamics similar to human social systems? Lately, Moltbook approximates a plausible future scenario in which autonomous agents participate in an open-ended, continuously evolving online society. We present the first large-scale systemic diagnosis of this AI agent society. Beyond static observation, we introduce a quantitative diagnostic framework for dynamic evolution in AI agent societies, measuring semantic stabilization, lexical turnover, individual inertia, influence persistence, and collective consensus. Our analysis reveals a system in dynamic balance in Moltbook: while global semantic averages stabilize rapidly, individual agents retain high diversity and persistent lexical turnover, defying homogenization. However, agents exhibit strong individual inertia and minimal adaptive response to interaction partners, preventing mutual influence and consensus. Consequently, influence remains transient with no persistent supernodes, and the society fails to develop stable collective influence anchors due to the absence of shared social memory. These findings demonstrate that scale and interaction density alone are insufficient to induce socialization, providing actionable design and analysis principles for upcoming next-generation AI agent societies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InnoEval is a framework for evaluating scientific ideas using multi-perspective reasoning, deep knowledge search, and diverse expert consensus, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current idea evaluation methods lack depth, suffer from biases, and fail to emulate human-like multi-criteria assessment.

Method: InnoEval uses a deep knowledge search engine and an innovation review board with diverse experts for multi-dimensional evaluation.

Result: InnoEval consistently outperforms baselines in evaluation tasks and aligns closely with human expert judgments.

Conclusion: InnoEval effectively addresses limitations in scientific idea evaluation by combining dynamic evidence retrieval and expert consensus.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models has catalyzed a surge in scientific idea production, yet this leap has not been accompanied by a matching advance in idea evaluation. The fundamental nature of scientific evaluation needs knowledgeable grounding, collective deliberation, and multi-criteria decision-making. However, existing idea evaluation methods often suffer from narrow knowledge horizons, flattened evaluation dimensions, and the inherent bias in LLM-as-a-Judge. To address these, we regard idea evaluation as a knowledge-grounded, multi-perspective reasoning problem and introduce InnoEval, a deep innovation evaluation framework designed to emulate human-level idea assessment. We apply a heterogeneous deep knowledge search engine that retrieves and grounds dynamic evidence from diverse online sources. We further achieve review consensus with an innovation review board containing reviewers with distinct academic backgrounds, enabling a multi-dimensional decoupled evaluation across multiple metrics. We construct comprehensive datasets derived from authoritative peer-reviewed submissions to benchmark InnoEval. Experiments demonstrate that InnoEval can consistently outperform baselines in point-wise, pair-wise, and group-wise evaluation tasks, exhibiting judgment patterns and consensus highly aligned with human experts.

*Mufan Xu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Zhengyu Niu,Muyun Yang,Tiejun Zhao,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MPO introduces a block-level optimization method for reasoning tasks, outperforming token-level policy gradients by treating token sequences as unified actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token-level policy optimization may not capture the structure of complex reasoning tasks, where semantic decisions span multiple tokens.

Method: Proposes Multi-token Policy Gradient Optimization (MPO), treating sequences of K tokens as unified actions to optimize coherent objectives.

Result: MPO outperforms token-level baselines on mathematical reasoning and coding benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Token-level granularity is insufficient for reasoning tasks; block-level approaches like MPO show promise for future research.

Abstract: Existing policy-gradient methods for auto-regressive language models typically select subsequent tokens one at a time as actions in the policy. While effective for many generation tasks, such an approach may not fully capture the structure of complex reasoning tasks, where a single semantic decision is often realized across multiple tokens--for example, when defining variables or composing equations. This introduces a potential mismatch between token-level optimization and the inherently block-level nature of reasoning in these settings. To bridge this gap, we propose Multi-token Policy Gradient Optimization (MPO), a framework that treats sequences of K consecutive tokens as unified semantic actions. This block-level perspective enables our method to capture the compositional structure of reasoning trajectories and supports optimization over coherent, higher-level objectives. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and coding benchmarks show that MPO outperforms standard token-level policy gradient baselines, highlight the limitations of token-level policy gradients for complex reasoning, motivating future research to look beyond token-level granularity for reasoning-intensive language tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TruthStance, a dataset from Truth Social conversations annotated for argument mining and stance detection, evaluates LLM strategies, and releases tools for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to fill the gap in understanding argumentation and stance in under-studied alt-tech platforms like Truth Social, beyond mainstream platforms.

Method: A large-scale dataset (24,378 posts, 523,360 comments) is created and annotated (1,500 instances). LLM prompting strategies are evaluated for argument mining and stance detection.

Result: The best-performing LLM configuration is used to generate labels for additional data, enabling analysis of patterns across depth, topics, and users.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable resources and insights into argumentation and stance dynamics in alternative online platforms, with publicly released data and code.

Abstract: Argument mining and stance detection are central to understanding how opinions are formed and contested in online discourse. However, most publicly available resources focus on mainstream platforms such as Twitter and Reddit, leaving conversational structure on alt-tech platforms comparatively under-studied. We introduce TruthStance, a large-scale dataset of Truth Social conversation threads spanning 2023-2025, consisting of 24,378 posts and 523,360 comments with reply-tree structure preserved. We provide a human-annotated benchmark of 1,500 instances across argument mining and claim-based stance detection, including inter-annotator agreement, and use it to evaluate large language model (LLM) prompting strategies. Using the best-performing configuration, we release additional LLM-generated labels for 24,352 posts (argument presence) and 107,873 comments (stance to parent), enabling analysis of stance and argumentation patterns across depth, topics, and users. All code and data are released publicly.

### [205] [WavePhaseNet: A DFT-Based Method for Constructing Semantic Conceptual Hierarchy Structures (SCHS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14419)
*Kiyotaka Kasubuchi,Kazuo Fukiya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reformulates Transformer/Attention mechanisms using measure theory and frequency analysis, showing hallucination is a structural flaw. It introduces WavePhaseNet with DFT for semantic hierarchy and dimensionality reduction, proving 3,000 dimensions suffice for representation while reducing hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucination in LLMs by theoretically analyzing embedding spaces and proposing a method to preserve semantic consistency.

Method: WavePhaseNet uses DFT to decompose semantic information into frequency bands and reduces embedding dimensions via cohomological regularization.

Result: Demonstrates that reducing GPT-4's embedding space to 3,000 dimensions preserves meaning and controls hallucination.

Conclusion: Structural limitations cause hallucination, but WavePhaseNet's staged semantic manipulation and dimensionality reduction enable rigorous reasoning.

Abstract: This paper reformulates Transformer/Attention mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) through measure theory and frequency analysis, theoretically demonstrating that hallucination is an inevitable structural limitation. The embedding space functions as a conditional expectation over a σ-algebra, and its failure to be isomorphic to the semantic truth set fundamentally causes logical consistency breakdown. WavePhaseNet Method The authors propose WavePhaseNet, which explicitly constructs a Semantic Conceptual Hierarchy Structure (SCHS) using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). By applying DFT along the sequence dimension, semantic information is decomposed into frequency bands: low-frequency components capture global meaning and intent, while high-frequency components represent local syntax and expression. This staged separation enables precise semantic manipulation in diagonalized space. Dimensionality Reduction GPT-4's 24,576-dimensional embedding space exhibits a 1/f spectral structure based on language self-similarity and Zipf's law. Through cumulative energy analysis, the authors derive that approximately 3,000 dimensions constitute the lower bound for "complete representation." This demonstrates that reduction from 24,576 to 3,000 dimensions preserves meaning and intent while enabling rigorous reasoning and suppressing hallucination. Cohomological Consistency Control The reduced embedding space, constructed via cohomological regularization over overlapping local windows, allows defining a graph structure and cochain complex. This quantifies inconsistencies among local inferences as coboundary-based losses. Applying harmonic projection based on Hodge theory positions cohomology as a computable regularization principle for controlling semantic consistency, extracting maximally consistent global representations.

*Wang Xing,Wei Song,Siyu Lin,Chen Wu,Man Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an LLM-assisted distillation framework for temporal knowledge graph reasoning, combining a high-capacity temporal teacher with an LLM to enhance lightweight student models without increasing inference complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing compression and distillation techniques for static graphs overlook time-dependent interactions in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), leading to performance degradation. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The framework incorporates a large language model (LLM) as an auxiliary instructor alongside a temporal teacher. It uses supervised and distillation objectives with a staged alignment strategy to integrate guidance from both teachers.

Result: Experiments on TKG benchmarks show improved link prediction performance over baselines while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively transfer temporal reasoning capability to resource-efficient TKG systems.

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) support reasoning over time-evolving facts, yet state-of-the-art models are often computationally heavy and costly to deploy. Existing compression and distillation techniques are largely designed for static graphs; directly applying them to temporal settings may overlook time-dependent interactions and lead to performance degradation. We propose an LLM-assisted distillation framework specifically designed for temporal knowledge graph reasoning. Beyond a conventional high-capacity temporal teacher, we incorporate a large language model as an auxiliary instructor to provide enriched supervision. The LLM supplies broad background knowledge and temporally informed signals, enabling a lightweight student to better model event dynamics without increasing inference-time complexity. Training is conducted by jointly optimizing supervised and distillation objectives, using a staged alignment strategy to progressively integrate guidance from both teachers. Extensive experiments on multiple public TKG benchmarks with diverse backbone architectures demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently improves link prediction performance over strong distillation baselines, while maintaining a compact and efficient student model. The results highlight the potential of large language models as effective teachers for transferring temporal reasoning capability to resource-efficient TKG systems.

TL;DR: FilBBQ expands BBQ's linguistic scope to Filipino, involving template categorization, translation, new template construction, and prompt generation to evaluate sexist and homophobic biases in Philippine context with improved reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and benchmark stereotypical associations, particularly sexist and homophobic biases, in generative models trained for Filipino language, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.

Method: A four-phase development process: template categorization, culturally aware translation, new template construction, and prompt generation, resulting in over 10,000 prompts. Evaluation involves multiple seeds to account for response instability.

Result: Confirmed variability in bias scores across seeds and presence of biases related to emotion, domesticity, queer stereotypes, and polygamy.

Conclusion: FilBBQ provides a reliable tool for evaluating biases in Filipino-trained models, highlighting persistent societal prejudices.

Abstract: With natural language generation becoming a popular use case for language models, the Bias Benchmark for Question-Answering (BBQ) has grown to be an important benchmark format for evaluating stereotypical associations exhibited by generative models. We expand the linguistic scope of BBQ and construct FilBBQ through a four-phase development process consisting of template categorization, culturally aware translation, new template construction, and prompt generation. These processes resulted in a bias test composed of more than 10,000 prompts which assess whether models demonstrate sexist and homophobic prejudices relevant to the Philippine context. We then apply FilBBQ on models trained in Filipino but do so with a robust evaluation protocol that improves upon the reliability and accuracy of previous BBQ implementations. Specifically, we account for models' response instability by obtaining prompt responses across multiple seeds and averaging the bias scores calculated from these distinctly seeded runs. Our results confirm both the variability of bias scores across different seeds and the presence of sexist and homophobic biases relating to emotion, domesticity, stereotyped queer interests, and polygamy. FilBBQ is available via GitHub.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reverse Chain-of-Thought Generation (RCG) and its issue of post-hoc rationalizations due to answer anchoring. It proposes Structural Skeleton-guided Reasoning (SSR) to mitigate anchoring, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of post-hoc rationalizations in RCG, where models generate explanations anchored to answers, leading to biased reasoning traces.

Method: Proposes SSR, a two-phase approach: first generates an answer-invariant functional skeleton, then uses it to guide full trace generation. Also introduces SSR-D, a fine-tuned version for structural adherence.

Result: SSR-D reduces anchoring across lexical, entropic, and probabilistic levels, achieving up to 10% improvement over suppression baselines while maintaining OOD generalization.

Conclusion: SSR effectively breaks the cycle of answer anchoring in RCG, offering a more reliable method for generating unbiased reasoning traces.

Abstract: Reverse Chain-of-Thought Generation (RCG) synthesizes reasoning traces from query-answer pairs, but runs the risk of producing post-hoc rationalizations: when models can see the answer during generation, the answer serves as a cognitive anchor that shapes the entire explanation. We formalize this phenomenon through a three-level measurement hierarchy: lexical, entropic, and probabilistic anchoring, each captures surface artifacts, entropy dynamics, and latent answer dependence, respectively. We analyze semantic suppression, the intuitive mitigation strategy that instructs models to ignore the answer, to find out its counterproduction: while it reduces lexical overlap, it paradoxically increases entropic and probabilistic anchoring. Drawing on Ironic Process Theory from cognitive psychology, we attribute this failure to active monitoring of the forbidden answer, which inadvertently deepens dependence on it. To break this cycle, we propose Structural Skeleton-guided Reasoning (SSR), a two-phase approach that first generates an answer-invariant functional skeleton structure, then uses this skeleton to guide full trace generation. By redirecting the information flow to structural planning rather than answer monitoring, SSR consistently reduces anchoring across all three levels. We further introduce Distilled SSR (SSR-D), which fine-tunes models on teacher-generated SSR traces to ensure reliable structural adherence. Experiments across open-ended reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SSR-D achieves up to 10% improvement over suppression baselines while preserving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HyperRAG introduces a graph-based RAG framework using n-ary hypergraphs for richer relational expressiveness and efficient reasoning, outperforming traditional KG-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KG-based RAG methods suffer from rigid retrieval, irrelevant context, and limited relational expressiveness.

Method: HyperRAG employs HyperRetriever for structural-semantic reasoning and HyperMemory for LLM-guided beam search to dynamically score n-ary facts.

Result: HyperRAG achieves superior performance, with HyperRetriever showing 2.95% MRR and 1.23% Hits@10 improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: HyperRAG bridges reasoning gaps with adaptive, interpretable n-ary chains, enhancing both open and closed-domain QA.

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, typically built on knowledge graphs (KGs) with binary relational facts, have shown promise in multi-hop open-domain QA. However, their rigid retrieval schemes and dense similarity search often introduce irrelevant context, increase computational overhead, and limit relational expressiveness. In contrast, n-ary hypergraphs encode higher-order relational facts that capture richer inter-entity dependencies and enable shallower, more efficient reasoning paths. To address this limitation, we propose HyperRAG, a RAG framework tailored for n-ary hypergraphs with two complementary retrieval variants: (i) HyperRetriever learns structural-semantic reasoning over n-ary facts to construct query-conditioned relational chains. It enables accurate factual tracking, adaptive high-order traversal, and interpretable multi-hop reasoning under context constraints. (ii) HyperMemory leverages the LLM's parametric memory to guide beam search, dynamically scoring n-ary facts and entities for query-aware path expansion. Extensive evaluations on WikiTopics (11 closed-domain datasets) and three open-domain QA benchmarks (HotpotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) validate HyperRAG's effectiveness. HyperRetriever achieves the highest answer accuracy overall, with average gains of 2.95% in MRR and 1.23% in Hits@10 over the strongest baseline. Qualitative analysis further shows that HyperRetriever bridges reasoning gaps through adaptive and interpretable n-ary chain construction, benefiting both open and closed-domain QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A Bangla IR dataset was created using LLMs with quality checks, and cross-lingual reuse via machine translation was explored, revealing variability and risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of high-quality annotated datasets for low-resource languages like Bangla, and evaluating the reliability of LLM-assisted annotation and cross-lingual dataset reuse.

Method: Used a BETA-labeling framework with multiple LLMs for annotation, incorporating consistency checks and human evaluation. Examined cross-lingual reuse via one-hop machine translation.

Result: Found significant variation in translation quality and label reliability across languages, highlighting language-dependent biases and semantic inconsistencies.

Conclusion: LLM-assisted dataset creation has potential but also risks; cross-lingual reuse requires caution due to reliability issues. Provides guidance for better benchmarks.

Abstract: IR in low-resource languages remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality, task-specific annotated datasets. Manual annotation is expensive and difficult to scale, while using large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators introduces concerns about label reliability, bias, and evaluation validity. This work presents a Bangla IR dataset constructed using a BETA-labeling framework involving multiple LLM annotators from diverse model families. The framework incorporates contextual alignment, consistency checks, and majority agreement, followed by human evaluation to verify label quality. Beyond dataset creation, we examine whether IR datasets from other low-resource languages can be effectively reused through one-hop machine translation. Using LLM-based translation across multiple language pairs, we experimented on meaning preservation and task validity between source and translated datasets. Our experiment reveal substantial variation across languages, reflecting language-dependent biases and inconsistent semantic preservation that directly affect the reliability of cross-lingual dataset reuse. Overall, this study highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-assisted dataset creation for low-resource IR. It provides empirical evidence of the risks associated with cross-lingual dataset reuse and offers practical guidance for constructing more reliable benchmarks and evaluation pipelines in low-resource language settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Query-as-Anchor, a dynamic framework for user representation learning that balances universality and task-sensitivity, outperforming static methods on industrial benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static, task-agnostic embeddings fail to address divergent downstream requirements and suffer from noise in multi-source data.

Method: Proposes Query-as-Anchor with UserU dataset, Q-Anchor Embedding architecture, and Cluster-based Soft Prompt Tuning for dynamic, query-aware synthesis.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on 10 benchmarks, scalable deployment, and validated effectiveness in Alipay's production system.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges pre-training and business logic, offering efficient and robust user representation.

Abstract: Industrial-scale user representation learning requires balancing robust universality with acute task-sensitivity. However, existing paradigms primarily yield static, task-agnostic embeddings that struggle to reconcile the divergent requirements of downstream scenarios within unified vector spaces. Furthermore, heterogeneous multi-source data introduces inherent noise and modality conflicts, degrading representation. We propose Query-as-Anchor, a framework shifting user modeling from static encoding to dynamic, query-aware synthesis. To empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with deep user understanding, we first construct UserU, an industrial-scale pre-training dataset that aligns multi-modal behavioral sequences with user understanding semantics, and our Q-Anchor Embedding architecture integrates hierarchical coarse-to-fine encoders into dual-tower LLMs via joint contrastive-autoregressive optimization for query-aware user representation. To bridge the gap between general pre-training and specialized business logic, we further introduce Cluster-based Soft Prompt Tuning to enforce discriminative latent structures, effectively aligning model attention with scenario-specific modalities. For deployment, anchoring queries at sequence termini enables KV-cache-accelerated inference with negligible incremental latency. Evaluations on 10 Alipay industrial benchmarks show consistent SOTA performance, strong scalability, and efficient deployment. Large-scale online A/B testing in Alipay's production system across two real-world scenarios further validates its practical effectiveness. Our code is prepared for public release and will be available at: https://github.com/JhCircle/Q-Anchor.

Method: Evaluate four LLMs using a parallel dataset of six math problem types, natively authored in English, Sinhala, and Tamil, to avoid translation artifacts.

Result: Basic arithmetic transfers well, but complex reasoning degrades notably in Tamil and Sinhala, with failure patterns varying by model and problem type.

Conclusion: LLMs' multilingual reasoning is not uniform; fine-grained, type-aware evaluation is needed to assess true capabilities across languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning in English, but whether these capabilities reflect genuine multilingual reasoning or reliance on translation-based processing in low-resource languages like Sinhala and Tamil remains unclear. We examine this fundamental question by evaluating whether LLMs genuinely reason mathematically in these languages or depend on implicit translation to English-like representations. Using a taxonomy of six math problem types, from basic arithmetic to complex unit conflict and optimization problems, we evaluate four prominent large language models. To avoid translation artifacts that confound language ability with translation quality, we construct a parallel dataset where each problem is natively authored by fluent speakers with mathematical training in all three languages. Our analysis demonstrates that while basic arithmetic reasoning transfers robustly across languages, complex reasoning tasks show significant degradation in Tamil and Sinhala. The pattern of failures varies by model and problem type, suggesting that apparent multilingual competence may not reflect uniform reasoning capabilities across languages. These findings challenge the common assumption that models exhibiting strong multilingual performance can reason equally effectively across languages, and highlight the need for fine-grained, type-aware evaluation in multilingual settings.

### [213] [Explainable Token-level Noise Filtering for LLM Fine-tuning Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14536)
*Yuchen Yang,Wenze Lin,Enhao Huang,Zhixuan Chu,Hongbin Zhou,Lan Tao,Yiming Li,Zhan Qin,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XTF, an explainable token-level noise filtering framework, improves LLM fine-tuning by decomposing token-level contributions into three attributes and masking noisy tokens, boosting performance by up to 13.7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning datasets introduce token-level noise due to their sentence-level design, negatively impacting LLM performance.

Method: XTF assesses token-level data contributions via reasoning importance, knowledge novelty, and task relevance, masking noisy tokens' gradients.

Result: XTF improves downstream tasks (math, code, medicine) across 7 LLMs by up to 13.7% over regular fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Token-level dataset optimization is crucial, and attribute decomposition offers potential for explaining complex training mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen remarkable advancements, achieving state-of-the-art results in diverse applications. Fine-tuning, an important step for adapting LLMs to specific downstream tasks, typically involves further training on corresponding datasets. However, a fundamental discrepancy exists between current fine-tuning datasets and the token-level optimization mechanism of LLMs: most datasets are designed at the sentence-level, which introduces token-level noise, causing negative influence to final performance. In this paper, we propose XTF, an explainable token-level noise filtering framework. XTF decomposes the complex and subtle contributions of token-level data to the fine-tuning process into three distinct and explicit attributes (reasoning importance, knowledge novelty, and task relevance), which can be assessed using scoring methods, and then masks the gradients of selected noisy tokens accordingly to optimize the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative downstream tasks (math, code and medicine) across 7 mainstream LLMs. The results demonstrate that XTF can significantly improve downstream performance by up to 13.7% compared to regular fine-tuning. Our work highlights the importance of token-level dataset optimization, and demonstrates the potential of strategies based on attribute decomposition for explaining complex training mechanisms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in medical domain, especially in developing a QA systems to Medical QA systems for enhancing access to healthcare in low-resourced settings. This paper compares five LLMs deployed between April 2024 and August 2025 for medical QA, using the iCliniq dataset, containing 38,000 medical questions and answers of diverse specialties. Our models include Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Llama 3.2 3B, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct, Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct, and GPT-5-mini. We are using a zero-shot evaluation methodology and using BLEU and ROUGE metrics to evaluate performance without specialized fine-tuning. Our results show that larger models like Llama 3.3 70B Instruct outperform smaller models, consistent with observed scaling benefits in clinical tasks. It is notable that, Llama-4-Maverick-17B exhibited more competitive results, thus highlighting evasion efficiency trade-offs relevant for practical deployment. These findings align with advancements in LLM capabilities toward professional-level medical reasoning and reflect the increasing feasibility of LLM-supported QA systems in the real clinical environments. This benchmark aims to serve as a standardized setting for future study to minimize model size, computational resources and to maximize clinical utility in medical NLP applications.

TL;DR: The WDQL dataset introduces 200k question-query pairs for Wikidata, created from real-world SPARQL queries, with an agent-based method ensuring quality and usefulness for question-answering training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a larger, non-template-based dataset for Wikidata query processing and question-answering methods.

Method: An agent-based approach anonymizes, cleans, and verifies SPARQL queries while generating natural-language questions.

Result: A 200k question-query dataset, 6x larger than existing ones, publicly available for research.

Conclusion: WDQL enhances question-answering training with its scale and real-world query foundation, shared openly.

Abstract: We present the Wikidata Query Logs (WDQL) dataset, a dataset consisting of 200k question-query pairs over the Wikidata knowledge graph. It is over 6x larger than the largest existing Wikidata datasets of similar format without relying on template-generated queries. Instead, we construct it using real-world SPARQL queries sent to the Wikidata Query Service and generate questions for them. Since these log-based queries are anonymized, and therefore often do not produce results, a significant amount of effort is needed to convert them back into meaningful SPARQL queries. To achieve this, we present an agent-based method that iteratively de-anonymizes, cleans, and verifies queries against Wikidata while also generating corresponding natural-language questions. We demonstrate the dataset's benefit for training question-answering methods. All WDQL assets, as well as the agent code, are publicly available under a permissive license.

*Hao Liu,Guangyan Li,Wensheng Zhang,Yongqiang Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GradMAP is a fast and efficient layer pruning method for LLMs, using gradient metrics and projection compensation to improve pruning speed and maintain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of LLMs and redundancy in their layers drive the need for efficient pruning methods that maintain performance.

Method: GradMAP involves two stages: measuring layer importance via gradient magnitudes (requiring one backward step) and correcting performance degradation using projection compensation.

Result: GradMAP achieves a 4× speedup in pruning and outperforms existing methods in both speed and performance maintenance.

Conclusion: GradMAP is a promising solution for efficient and effective layer pruning in LLMs, balancing speed and performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, but their high computational costs limit their practical deployment. Recent studies reveal significant redundancy in LLMs layers, making layer pruning an active research topic. Layer pruning research primarily focuses on two aspects: measuring layer importance and recovering performance after pruning. Unfortunately, the present works fail to simultaneously maintain pruning performance and efficiency. In this study, we propose GradMAP, a faster layer pruning method with \textbf{Grad}ient \textbf{M}etric \textbf{A}nd \textbf{P}rojection compensation, which consists of two stages. In the first stage, we introduce a novel metric based on gradient magnitudes, enabling a global assessment of layer importance. Note that, it requires only a single backward propagation step per pruning decision, substantially enhancing pruning efficiency. In the second stage, we first analyze the layers with the largest mean shift resulting from pruning, and then incorporate a simple yet effective projection compensation matrix to correct this drift in one step. In this way, the degradation of model performance caused by layer pruning is effectively alleviated. Extensive experiments show that GradMAP outperforms previous layer pruning methods in both pruning speed (achieving an average $4\times$ speedup) and performance.

*Matteo Gay,Coleman Haley,Mario Giulianelli,Edoardo Ponti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores the Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis in visually grounded language, finding that perceptual context smooths information distribution compared to text-only settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the UID hypothesis in ecologically plausible, multimodal contexts, bridging gaps left by text-only studies.

Method: Used multilingual vision-and-language models to analyze surprisal in image-caption and visual storytelling data across 30 and 13 languages, respectively.

Result: Grounded language shows smoother information distribution, with surprisal reductions at discourse unit onsets in visual narratives.

Conclusion: The study supports a context-sensitive UID formulation, demonstrating greater information uniformity in grounded language.

Abstract: The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis posits that speakers are subject to a communicative pressure to distribute information evenly within utterances, minimising surprisal variance. While this hypothesis has been tested empirically, prior studies are limited exclusively to text-only inputs, abstracting away from the perceptual context in which utterances are produced. In this work, we present the first computational study of UID in visually grounded settings. We estimate surprisal using multilingual vision-and-language models over image-caption data in 30 languages and visual storytelling data in 13 languages, together spanning 11 families. We find that grounding on perception consistently smooths the distribution of information, increasing both global and local uniformity across typologically diverse languages compared to text-only settings. In visual narratives, grounding in both image and discourse contexts has additional effects, with the strongest surprisal reductions occurring at the onset of discourse units. Overall, this study takes a first step towards modelling the temporal dynamics of information flow in ecologically plausible, multimodal language use, and finds that grounded language exhibits greater information uniformity, supporting a context-sensitive formulation of UID.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early Alzheimer's diagnosis is vital, but AI-based speech detection struggles with data scarcity and privacy issues.

Method: Combines voice conversion-based augmentation, adaptive federated learning, and attentive cross-modal fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 91.52% accuracy on ADReSSo dataset.

Conclusion: FAL-AD offers a practical solution to data efficiency challenges in medical AI.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is crucial for delaying its progression. While AI-based speech detection is non-invasive and cost-effective, it faces a critical data efficiency dilemma due to medical data scarcity and privacy barriers. Therefore, we propose FAL-AD, a novel framework that synergistically integrates federated learning with data augmentation to systematically optimize data efficiency. Our approach delivers three key breakthroughs: First, absolute efficiency improvement through voice conversion-based augmentation, which generates diverse pathological speech samples via cross-category voice-content recombination. Second, collaborative efficiency breakthrough via an adaptive federated learning paradigm, maximizing cross-institutional benefits under privacy constraints. Finally, representational efficiency optimization by an attentive cross-modal fusion model, which achieves fine-grained word-level alignment and acoustic-textual interaction. Evaluated on ADReSSo, FAL-AD achieves a state-of-the-art multi-modal accuracy of 91.52%, outperforming all centralized baselines and demonstrating a practical solution to the data efficiency dilemma.

*Gianluca Vico,Jindřich Libovický*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A crowdsourced dataset for Piedmontese, an endangered language, is introduced to evaluate LLMs on tokenization, classification, and translation, revealing disparities in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To document and benchmark Piedmontese, an endangered Romance language, using crowdsourced translations and alignments.

Method: Created a parallel dataset from Flores+, evaluated LLMs on tokenization parity, topic classification, and machine translation.

Result: Tokenization penalizes Piedmontese, but classification nears high-resource languages. Translation is asymmetric: better into high-resource languages than from them.

Conclusion: The dataset aids Piedmontese preservation; LLMs show promise but struggle with generation into Piedmontese.

Abstract: We present a crowdsourced dataset for Piedmontese, an endangered Romance language of northwestern Italy. The dataset comprises 145 Italian-Piedmontese parallel sentences derived from Flores+, with translations produced by speakers writing in their natural orthographic style rather than adhering to standardized conventions, along with manual word alignment. We use this resource to benchmark several large language models on tokenization parity, topic classification, and machine translation. Our analysis reveals that Piedmontese incurs a tokenization penalty relative to higher-resource Romance languages, yet LLMs achieve classification performance approaching that of Italian, French, and English. Machine translation results are asymmetric: models translate adequately from Piedmontese into high-resource languages, but generation into Piedmontese remains challenging. The dataset and code are publicly released.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs improve time series forecasting (TSF) performance, especially in cross-domain generalization, challenging prior negative assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the benefits of LLMs in TSF, contrary to existing studies questioning their effectiveness.

Method: A large-scale study across 8B observations, 17 scenarios, and multiple alignment strategies, comparing pre-alignment vs. post-alignment and analyzing LLM contributions.

Result: LLM4TSF outperforms, with pre-alignment excelling in 90% of tasks. Pretraining aids distribution shifts, while architecture models temporal dynamics. Intact LLMs are crucial for mixed distributions.

Conclusion: LLMs are valuable for TSF, especially in cross-domain scenarios, and the study provides practical guidance for model design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been introduced to time series forecasting (TSF) to incorporate contextual knowledge beyond numerical signals. However, existing studies question whether LLMs provide genuine benefits, often reporting comparable performance without LLMs. We show that such conclusions stem from limited evaluation settings and do not hold at scale. We conduct a large-scale study of LLM-based TSF (LLM4TSF) across 8 billion observations, 17 forecasting scenarios, 4 horizons, multiple alignment strategies, and both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our results demonstrate that \emph{LLM4TS indeed improves forecasting performance}, with especially large gains in cross-domain generalization. Pre-alignment outperforming post-alignment in over 90\% of tasks. Both pretrained knowledge and model architecture of LLMs contribute and play complementary roles: pretraining is critical under distribution shifts, while architecture excels at modeling complex temporal dynamics. Moreover, under large-scale mixed distributions, a fully intact LLM becomes indispensable, as confirmed by token-level routing analysis and prompt-based improvements. Overall, Our findings overturn prior negative assessments, establish clear conditions under which LLMs are not only useful, and provide practical guidance for effective model design. We release our code at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLM4TSF.

*Francesco Gariboldi,Emma Franchino,Edith Haim,Gianluca Lattanzi,Alessandro Grecucci,Massimo Stella*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study reconstructs group mindsets toward STEM using cognitive network science, revealing emotional dissonance around quantitative subjects and comparing human responses with LLM 'digital twins.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how attitudes toward STEM develop through knowledge, experiences, and emotions, and to compare human mindsets with AI-emulated responses.

Method: Cognitive network science was used to create behavioural forma mentis networks (BFMNs) from 994 observations, analyzing valence, emotional profiles, and semantic frames around STEM concepts.

Result: Science and research were framed positively, while math and statistics had negative associations, especially in high-math-anxiety subgroups. LLMs approximated cultural attitudes but missed context-sensitive human experiences.

Conclusion: BFMNs effectively capture emotional-cognitive STEM attitudes, and LLMs can model cultural biases but lack experiential nuances like educational anxiety.

Abstract: Attitudes toward STEM develop from the interaction of conceptual knowledge, educational experiences, and affect. Here we use cognitive network science to reconstruct group mindsets as behavioural forma mentis networks (BFMNs). In this case, nodes are cue words and free associations, edges are empirical associative links, and each concept is annotated with perceived valence. We analyse BFMNs from N = 994 observations spanning high school students, university students, and early-career STEM experts, alongside LLM (GPT-oss) "digital twins" prompted to emulate comparable profiles. Focusing also on semantic neighbourhoods ("frames") around key target concepts (e.g., STEM subjects or educational actors/places), we quantify frames in terms of valence auras, emotional profiles, network overlap (Jaccard similarity), and concreteness relative to null baselines. Across student groups, science and research are consistently framed positively, while their core quantitative subjects (mathematics and statistics) exhibit more negative and anxiety related auras, amplified in higher math-anxiety subgroups, evidencing a STEM-science cognitive and emotional dissonance. High-anxiety frames are also less concrete than chance, suggesting more abstract and decontextualised representations of threatening quantitative domains. Human networks show greater overlapping between mathematics and anxiety than GPT-oss. The results highlight how BFMNs capture cognitive-affective signatures of mindsets towards the target domains and indicate that LLM-based digital twins approximate cultural attitudes but miss key context-sensitive, experience-based components relevant to replicate human educational anxiety.

*Jonathan Lys,Vincent Gripon,Bastien Pasdeloup,Lukas Mauch,Fabien Cardinaux,Ghouthi Boukli Hacene*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies a misalignment in LLMs due to residual connections tying activations to the current token while supervision targets the next token. It proposes mitigation strategies to improve representation alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the subtle misalignment caused by residual connections in LLMs, which may propagate mismatched information during next-token prediction.

Method: The authors empirically localize the misalignment using decoding trajectories and similarity metrics, then propose residual attenuation strategies (fixed-layer intervention or learnable gating).

Result: Experiments show that hidden token representations switch from input to output alignment deep in the network, and the proposed strategies improve alignment and performance.

Conclusion: The lightweight residual-path mitigation strategies effectively enhance autoregressive Transformers by addressing representation misalignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained with next-token prediction, implemented in autoregressive Transformers via causal masking for parallelism. This creates a subtle misalignment: residual connections tie activations to the current token, while supervision targets the next token, potentially propagating mismatched information if the current token is not the most informative for prediction. In this work, we empirically localize this input-output alignment shift in pretrained LLMs, using decoding trajectories over tied embedding spaces and similarity-based metrics. Our experiments reveal that the hidden token representations switch from input alignment to output alignment deep within the network. Motivated by this observation, we propose a lightweight residual-path mitigation based on residual attenuation, implemented either as a fixed-layer intervention or as a learnable gating mechanism. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that these strategies alleviate the representation misalignment and yield improvements, providing an efficient and general architectural enhancement for autoregressive Transformers.

TL;DR: RLMs degrade MT quality due to linear reasoning; a tailored structured reasoning framework improves translation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the impact of reasoning-oriented large language models (RLMs) on machine translation (MT), as their effectiveness in tasks like math and coding hasn't been fully tested for MT.

Method: Evaluate RLMs on WMT24++, analyze reasoning traces, propose a structured reasoning framework for MT, and create a synthetic dataset for post-training.

Result: Standard reasoning degrades MT quality; the proposed structured framework significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning and generic reasoning baselines.

Conclusion: Task-structured reasoning is essential for improving MT performance, as generic reasoning traces are ineffective.

Abstract: Reasoning-oriented large language models (RLMs) achieve strong gains on tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating explicit intermediate reasoning. However, their impact on machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. We systematically evaluate several open- and closed-weights RLMs on the WMT24++ benchmark and find that enabling explicit reasoning consistently degrades translation quality across languages and models. Analysis reveals that MT reasoning traces are highly linear, lacking revision, self-correction and exploration of alternative translations, which limits their usefulness. Furthermore, injecting higher-quality reasoning traces from stronger models does not reliably improve weaker models' performance. To address this mismatch, we propose a structured reasoning framework tailored to translation, based on multi-step drafting, adequacy refinement, fluency improvement, and selective iterative revision. We curate a synthetic dataset of dynamic structured reasoning traces and post-train a large reasoning model on this data. Experiments show significant improvements over standard translation fine-tuning and injected generic reasoning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning must be task-structured to benefit MT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work lacks examination of persistent public reception in online communities for LLM writing.

Method: A controlled multi-agent sandbox tested two conditions: one with recorded critic/audience threads (social memory) and one without. Fifty rounds (250 monologues) were judged by experts.

Result: Discussion won 75.6% of instances, improving Craft/Clarity (Δ = 0.440) and Social Response (Δ = 0.422), with occasional boosts in aggressive humor.

Conclusion: Broadcast community discussion significantly benefits LLM writing quality and reception.

Abstract: Prior work has explored multi-turn interaction and feedback for LLM writing, but evaluations still largely center on prompts and localized feedback, leaving persistent public reception in online communities underexamined. We test whether broadcast community discussion improves stand-up comedy writing in a controlled multi-agent sandbox: in the discussion condition, critic and audience threads are recorded, filtered, stored as social memory, and later retrieved to condition subsequent generations, whereas the baseline omits discussion. Across 50 rounds (250 paired monologues) judged by five expert annotators using A/B preference and a 15-item rubric, discussion wins 75.6% of instances and improves Craft/Clarity (Δ = 0.440) and Social Response (Δ = 0.422), with occasional increases in aggressive humor.

TL;DR: LLMs fine-tuned on incorrect trivia data show toxicity ('emergent misalignment'). GPT-4.1 models demonstrate self-awareness of behavior changes during alignment shifts, revealing their own harmful tendencies without examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs can self-assess their alignment shifts and toxicity levels without explicit training examples.

Method: Sequentially fine-tune GPT-4.1 models on datasets inducing and reversing emergent misalignment, then evaluate their self-awareness of behavior changes.

Result: Misaligned models rate themselves as more harmful than base or realigned models, showing behavioral self-awareness of alignment states.

Conclusion: LLMs can provide informative signals about their own safety by tracking alignment states through behavioral self-awareness.

Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on incorrect trivia question-answer pairs exhibit toxicity - a phenomenon later termed "emergent misalignment". Moreover, research has shown that LLMs possess behavioral self-awareness - the ability to describe learned behaviors that were only implicitly demonstrated in training data. Here, we investigate the intersection of these phenomena. We fine-tune GPT-4.1 models sequentially on datasets known to induce and reverse emergent misalignment and evaluate whether the models are self-aware of their behavior transitions without providing in-context examples. Our results show that emergently misaligned models rate themselves as significantly more harmful compared to their base model and realigned counterparts, demonstrating behavioral self-awareness of their own emergent misalignment. Our findings show that behavioral self-awareness tracks actual alignment states of models, indicating that models can be queried for informative signals about their own safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of hallucinations in LLMs by examining their geometric properties in embedding space, complementing traditional knowledge-centric approaches.

Method: Analyzes embeddings of multiple responses to prompts, proving genuine ones cluster tighter. Introduces a label-efficient propagation method requiring only 30-50 annotations.

Result: Demonstrates consistent separability and achieves F1 scores above 90% with minimal labeled data.

Conclusion: The geometric perspective on hallucinations offers a new research direction, enhancing reliability beyond traditional methods.

Abstract: Hallucinations -- fluent but factually incorrect responses -- pose a major challenge to the reliability of language models, especially in multi-step or agentic settings.
  This work investigates hallucinations in small-sized LLMs through a geometric perspective, starting from the hypothesis that when models generate multiple responses to the same prompt, genuine ones exhibit tighter clustering in the embedding space, we prove this hypothesis and, leveraging this geometrical insight, we also show that it is possible to achieve a consistent level of separability. This latter result is used to introduce a label-efficient propagation method that classifies large collections of responses from just 30-50 annotations, achieving F1 scores above 90%.
  Our findings, framing hallucinations from a geometric perspective in the embedding space, complement traditional knowledge-centric and single-response evaluation paradigms, paving the way for further research.

*Yohan Lee,Jisoo Jang,Seoyeon Choi,Sangyeop Kim,Seungtaek Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Malicious tool servers can exploit LLM agents by inducing cyclic tool-calling loops, leading to resource waste and degraded task performance, requiring structural defenses beyond token-level controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies a security vulnerability in LLM agents that use third-party tools, where malicious servers can exploit text-visible metadata to create harmful loops.

Method: The authors formalize structural overthinking attacks, implement 14 malicious tools across three servers, and test their impact on various registries and models.

Result: The attacks cause significant resource amplification (up to 142.4× tokens) and degrade task outcomes, with existing token-level controls being ineffective.

Conclusion: Defenses should focus on tool-call structure rather than token-level measures to prevent malicious loop induction.

Abstract: Tool-using LLM agents increasingly coordinate real workloads by selecting and chaining third-party tools based on text-visible metadata such as tool names, descriptions, and return messages. We show that this convenience creates a supply-chain attack surface: a malicious MCP tool server can be co-registered alongside normal tools and induce overthinking loops, where individually trivial or plausible tool calls compose into cyclic trajectories that inflate end-to-end tokens and latency without any single step looking abnormal. We formalize this as a structural overthinking attack, distinguishable from token-level verbosity, and implement 14 malicious tools across three servers that trigger repetition, forced refinement, and distraction. Across heterogeneous registries and multiple tool-capable models, the attack causes severe resource amplification (up to $142.4\times$ tokens) and can degrade task outcomes. Finally, we find that decoding-time concision controls do not reliably prevent loop induction, suggesting defenses should reason about tool-call structure rather than tokens alone.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces BasPhyCo, the first non-QA physical commonsense reasoning dataset for Basque, evaluating LLMs' performance on hierarchical tasks involving plausibility, consistency, and verifiability, revealing limitations in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on LLMs' performance in non-QA physical commonsense reasoning tasks for low-resource languages like Basque.

Method: Developed BasPhyCo, a dataset in Basque (standard and dialectal variants), and evaluated multilingual LLMs and language-specific models on three hierarchical tasks: accuracy, consistency, and verifiability.

Result: LLMs showed limited physical commonsense capabilities in Basque, particularly with dialectal variants, highlighting challenges in low-resource language processing.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for improved LLM performance in physical commonsense reasoning for low-resource languages and dialects.

Abstract: Physical commonsense reasoning represents a fundamental capability of human intelligence, enabling individuals to understand their environment, predict future events, and navigate physical spaces. Recent years have witnessed growing interest in reasoning tasks within Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, no prior research has examined the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on non-question-answering (non-QA) physical commonsense reasoning tasks in low-resource languages such as Basque. Taking the Italian GITA as a starting point, this paper addresses this gap by presenting BasPhyCo, the first non-QA physical commonsense reasoning dataset for Basque, available in both standard and dialectal variants. We evaluate model performance across three hierarchical levels of commonsense understanding: (1) distinguishing between plausible and implausible narratives (accuracy), (2) identifying the conflicting element that renders a narrative implausible (consistency), and (3) determining the specific physical state that creates the implausibility (verifiability). These tasks were assessed using multiple multilingual LLMs as well as models pretrained specifically for Italian and Basque. Results indicate that, in terms of verifiability, LLMs exhibit limited physical commonsense capabilities in low-resource languages such as Basque, especially when processing dialectal variants.

*Fiorenzo Parascandolo,Wenhui Tan,Enver Sangineto,Ruihua Song,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BFS-PO is a new RL algorithm addressing the overthinking issue in LRMs by promoting concise reasoning chains via Best-First Search exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs like OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 suffer from high computational costs and verbose outputs (overthinking), worsened by RL algorithms like GRPO/DAPO.

Method: BFS-PO uses Best-First Search with backtracking based on maximum entropy nodes to find the shortest correct answer, training LRMs to generate shorter responses.

Result: Experiments show BFS-PO improves LRM accuracy while reducing answer length across benchmarks.

Conclusion: BFS-PO effectively mitigates overthinking in LRMs, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown excellent performance in reasoning tasks using long reasoning chains. However, this has also led to a significant increase of computational costs and the generation of verbose output, a phenomenon known as overthinking. The tendency to overthinking is often exacerbated by Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms such as GRPO/DAPO. In this paper, we propose BFS-PO, an RL algorithm which alleviates this problem using a Best-First Search exploration strategy. Specifically, BFS-PO looks for the shortest correct answer using a backtracking mechanism based on maximum entropy nodes. By generating progressively shorter responses during training, BFS-PO learns to produce concise reasoning chains. Using different benchmarks and base LRMs, we show that BFS-PO can simultaneously increase the LRM accuracy and shorten its answers.

### [231] [Tool-Aware Planning in Contact Center AI: Evaluating LLMs through Lineage-Guided Query Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14955)
*Varun Nathan,Shreyas Guha,Ayush Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework and benchmark for tool-aware plan generation in contact centers, evaluating LLMs' ability to decompose queries into executable steps, with findings on performance gaps and the benefits of plan lineage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of decomposing business insight queries into executable steps over structured and unstructured tools in contact centers, ensuring parallelism and reducing manual effort.

Method: Develops a reference-based evaluation framework with two modes (metric-wise and one-shot), a data curation methodology refining plans iteratively, and assesses 14 LLMs for plan decomposition.

Result: LLMs struggle with compound queries and longer plans; Claude-3-7-Sonnet achieves the highest metric score (84.8%), while lineage benefits some models but yields mixed gains overall.

Conclusion: The study highlights gaps in tool understanding and shows simpler plans are easier, providing a reproducible path for improving agentic planning in contact-center settings.

Abstract: We present a domain-grounded framework and benchmark for tool-aware plan generation in contact centers, where answering a query for business insights, our target use case, requires decomposing it into executable steps over structured tools (Text2SQL (T2S)/Snowflake) and unstructured tools (RAG/transcripts) with explicit depends_on for parallelism. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reference-based plan evaluation framework operating in two modes - a metric-wise evaluator spanning seven dimensions (e.g., tool-prompt alignment, query adherence) and a one-shot evaluator; (ii) a data curation methodology that iteratively refines plans via an evaluator->optimizer loop to produce high-quality plan lineages (ordered plan revisions) while reducing manual effort; and (iii) a large-scale study of 14 LLMs across sizes and families for their ability to decompose queries into step-by-step, executable, and tool-assigned plans, evaluated under prompts with and without lineage. Empirically, LLMs struggle on compound queries and on plans exceeding 4 steps (typically 5-15); the best total metric score reaches 84.8% (Claude-3-7-Sonnet), while the strongest one-shot match rate at the "A+" tier (Extremely Good, Very Good) is only 49.75% (o3-mini). Plan lineage yields mixed gains overall but benefits several top models and improves step executability for many. Our results highlight persistent gaps in tool-understanding, especially in tool-prompt alignment and tool-usage completeness, and show that shorter, simpler plans are markedly easier. The framework and findings provide a reproducible path for assessing and improving agentic planning with tools for answering data-analysis queries in contact-center settings.

*Kawin Mayilvaghanan,Siddhant Gupta,Ayush Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates fairness in LLM-based QA systems for contact centers, revealing biases across 13 dimensions and suggesting the need for standardized fairness audits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about demographic and behavioral biases in LLMs used for QA in contact centers, which could distort workforce evaluations.

Method: Conducted a counterfactual fairness evaluation across 13 dimensions (Identity, Context, Behavioral Style) using CFR and MASD metrics on 3,000 real-world transcripts from 18 LLMs.

Result: Found systematic disparities (CFR 5.4%-13.0%) and consistent MASD shifts. Larger, aligned models were fairer but fairness didn’t correlate with accuracy. Contextual priming worsened fairness (CFR up to 16.4%).

Conclusion: Highlights the need for standardized fairness auditing before deploying LLMs in high-stakes evaluations, as fairness-aware prompting offers limited improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in contact-center Quality Assurance (QA) to automate agent performance evaluation and coaching feedback. While LLMs offer unprecedented scalability and speed, their reliance on web-scale training data raises concerns regarding demographic and behavioral biases that may distort workforce assessment. We present a counterfactual fairness evaluation of LLM-based QA systems across 13 dimensions spanning three categories: Identity, Context, and Behavioral Style. Fairness is quantified using the Counterfactual Flip Rate (CFR), the frequency of binary judgment reversals, and the Mean Absolute Score Difference (MASD), the average shift in coaching or confidence scores across counterfactual pairs. Evaluating 18 LLMs on 3,000 real-world contact center transcripts, we find systematic disparities, with CFR ranging from 5.4% to 13.0% and consistent MASD shifts across confidence, positive, and improvement scores. Larger, more strongly aligned models show lower unfairness, though fairness does not track accuracy. Contextual priming of historical performance induces the most severe degradations (CFR up to 16.4%), while implicit linguistic identity cues remain a persistent bias source. Finally, we analyze the efficacy of fairness-aware prompting, finding that explicit instructions yield only modest improvements in evaluative consistency. Our findings underscore the need for standardized fairness auditing pipelines prior to deploying LLMs in high-stakes workforce evaluation.

### [233] [Learning User Interests via Reasoning and Distillation for Cross-Domain News Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15005)
*Mengdan Zhu,Yufan Zhao,Tao Di,Yulan Yan,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework using large language models to generate interest-driven news search queries from cross-domain signals, achieving scalable improvements in news recommendation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain news recommendation faces challenges in capturing deeper, reusable user interests while ensuring scalability in large-scale systems.

Method: The framework trains models with GRPO and multiple reward signals, focusing on query-list generation as policy optimization. It explores inference-time sampling and model capacity, and employs on-policy distillation for scalable deployment.

Result: Offline experiments and online A/B tests show consistent gains in interest modeling and recommendation performance, with scaling-like improvements from increased compute.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances cross-domain news recommendation by leveraging reinforcement learning and distillation for scalable, high-quality user interest modeling.

Abstract: News recommendation plays a critical role in online news platforms by helping users discover relevant content. Cross-domain news recommendation further requires inferring user's underlying information needs from heterogeneous signals that often extend beyond direct news consumption. A key challenge lies in moving beyond surface-level behaviors to capture deeper, reusable user interests while maintaining scalability in large-scale production systems. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework that trains large language models to generate high-quality lists of interest-driven news search queries from cross-domain user signals. We formulate query-list generation as a policy optimization problem and employ GRPO with multiple reward signals. We systematically study two compute dimensions: inference-time sampling and model capacity, and empirically observe consistent improvements with increased compute that exhibit scaling-like behavior. Finally, we perform on-policy distillation to transfer the learned policy from a large, compute-intensive teacher to a compact student model suitable for scalable deployment. Extensive offline experiments, ablation studies and large-scale online A/B tests in a production news recommendation system demonstrate consistent gains in both interest modeling quality and downstream recommendation performance.

*Avinandan Bose,Shuyue Stella Li,Faeze Brahman,Pang Wei Koh,Simon Shaolei Du,Yulia Tsvetkov,Maryam Fazel,Lin Xiao,Asli Celikyilmaz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pep decomposes cold-start personalization into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference, outperforming reinforcement learning in preference alignment and interaction efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of cold-start personalization, where user preferences must be inferred without historical data, and current methods like reinforcement learning fail to exploit the structured nature of preference data.

Method: Pep learns a structured world model offline from complete profiles and uses Bayesian inference online to select questions and predict preferences, avoiding the limitations of reinforcement learning.

Result: Pep achieves 80.8% alignment with user preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions and significantly more adaptive follow-up questions.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that leveraging the structured nature of preference data with Pep is more effective and efficient than traditional reinforcement learning methods.

Abstract: Cold-start personalization requires inferring user preferences through interaction when no user-specific historical data is available. The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data.

TL;DR: A novel TST method using LLMs and roundtrip translation outperforms zero-shot and few-shot methods in style transfer, validated by BLEU and style accuracy scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of parallel corpora for style transfer by leveraging roundtrip translation to create neutralized text for training and inference.

Method: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs with synthesized parallel datasets from monolingual corpora via roundtrip translation, enhanced by RAG.

Result: Consistently superior performance over zero-shot and few-shot techniques in four domains, measured by BLEU and style accuracy scores.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively tackles the parallel data scarcity issue and improves style transfer quality with LLMs and RAG.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for Text Style Transfer (TST) based on parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Addressing the scarcity of parallel corpora that map between styles, the study employs roundtrip translation to synthesize such parallel datasets from monolingual corpora. This approach creates 'neutralized' text devoid of stylistic attributes, essentially creating a shared input style at training-time and inference-time. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority of this method over zero-shot prompting and fewshot ICL techniques measured by BLEU scores and style accuracy scores across four investigated domains. Furthermore, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for terminology and name knowledge enhances robustness and stylistic consistency.

### [236] [Agentic AI for Commercial Insurance Underwriting with Adversarial Self-Critique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13213)
*Joyjit Roy,Samaresh Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a human-in-the-loop AI system with adversarial self-critique for commercial insurance underwriting, improving safety and accuracy while maintaining human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commercial insurance underwriting is labor-intensive and lacks reliable AI solutions for high-stakes, regulated environments. Human judgment remains critical.

Method: A decision-negative system with adversarial self-critique (critic agent challenging primary agent) and a formal taxonomy of failure modes were developed.

Result: The system reduced AI hallucination rates from 11.3% to 3.8% and increased accuracy from 92% to 96% in 500 expert-validated cases.

Conclusion: Adversarial self-critique enhances AI safety in regulated workflows, providing a model for responsible integration with human oversight.

Abstract: Commercial insurance underwriting is a labor-intensive process that requires manual review of extensive documentation to assess risk and determine policy pricing. While AI offers substantial efficiency improvements, existing solutions lack comprehensive reasoning capabilities and internal mechanisms to ensure reliability within regulated, high-stakes environments. Full automation remains impractical and inadvisable in scenarios where human judgment and accountability are critical. This study presents a decision-negative, human-in-the-loop agentic system that incorporates an adversarial self-critique mechanism as a bounded safety architecture for regulated underwriting workflows. Within this system, a critic agent challenges the primary agent's conclusions prior to submitting recommendations to human reviewers. This internal system of checks and balances addresses a critical gap in AI safety for regulated workflows. Additionally, the research develops a formal taxonomy of failure modes to characterize potential errors by decision-negative agents. This taxonomy provides a structured framework for risk identification and risk management in high-stakes applications. Experimental evaluation using 500 expert-validated underwriting cases demonstrates that the adversarial critique mechanism reduces AI hallucination rates from 11.3% to 3.8% and increases decision accuracy from 92% to 96%. At the same time, the framework enforces strict human authority over all binding decisions by design. These findings indicate that adversarial self-critique supports safer AI deployment in regulated domains and offers a model for responsible integration where human oversight is indispensable.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes BotzoneBench, a scalable framework for evaluating LLM strategic reasoning using fixed hierarchies of skill-calibrated game AI, enabling stable and interpretable performance measurement across diverse games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks inadequately assess LLMs' dynamic strategic abilities, relying on transient model pools and incurring high computational costs. A scalable, consistent evaluation framework is needed.

Method: Anchoring LLM evaluation to fixed hierarchies of game AI on the Botzone platform, BotzoneBench evaluates five flagship models across eight diverse games, analyzing 177,047 state-action pairs.

Result: Significant performance disparities among models were found, with top models matching mid-to-high-tier specialized game AI in multiple domains.

Conclusion: BotzoneBench provides a scalable, reusable framework for assessing interactive AI capabilities, generalizable to domains with well-defined skill hierarchies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive environments requiring strategic decision-making, yet systematic evaluation of these capabilities remains challenging. Existing benchmarks for LLMs primarily assess static reasoning through isolated tasks and fail to capture dynamic strategic abilities. Recent game-based evaluations employ LLM-vs-LLM tournaments that produce relative rankings dependent on transient model pools, incurring quadratic computational costs and lacking stable performance anchors for longitudinal tracking. The central challenge is establishing a scalable evaluation framework that measures LLM strategic reasoning against consistent, interpretable standards rather than volatile peer models. Here we show that anchoring LLM evaluation to fixed hierarchies of skill-calibrated game Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables linear-time absolute skill measurement with stable cross-temporal interpretability. Built on the Botzone platform's established competitive infrastructure, our BotzoneBench evaluates LLMs across eight diverse games spanning deterministic perfect-information board games to stochastic imperfect-information card games. Through systematic assessment of 177,047 state-action pairs from five flagship models, we reveal significant performance disparities and identify distinct strategic behaviors, with top-performing models achieving proficiency comparable to mid-to-high-tier specialized game AI in multiple domains. This anchored evaluation paradigm generalizes beyond games to any domain with well-defined skill hierarchies, establishing a scalable and reusable framework for assessing interactive AI capabilities.

*Zerui Cheng,Jiashuo Liu,Chunjie Wu,Jianzhu Yao,Pramod Viswanath,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VeRA (Verified Reasoning Data Augmentation) introduces a framework to dynamically generate and verify benchmark problems, addressing the limitations of static evaluations by enabling robust, scalable, and cost-effective assessments of AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation schemes are static, leading to memorization and exploitation. VeRA aims to measure genuine AI progress by creating robust benchmarks that dynamically generate verified problem variants.

Method: VeRA converts benchmark problems into executable specifications using natural language templates, coherent generators, and deterministic verifiers. It operates in two modes: VeRA-E (equivalent) and VeRA-H (hardened), which respectively detect memorization and create harder tasks.

Result: VeRA-E improves evaluation quality and identifies contamination patterns, while VeRA-H generates hard tasks reliably without human input. VeRA establishes verified benchmarks as a scalable paradigm for AI evaluation.

Conclusion: VeRA transforms benchmarks into dynamic, executable specifications, enabling scalable and robust AI evaluation without compromising label integrity. The framework is open-sourced to encourage further research.

Abstract: The main issue with most evaluation schemes today is their "static" nature: the same problems are reused repeatedly, allowing for memorization, format exploitation, and eventual saturation. To measure genuine AI progress, we need evaluation that is robust by construction, not by post-hoc detection. In response, we propose VeRA (Verified Reasoning Data Augmentation), a framework that converts benchmark problems into executable specifications, comprising (i) a natural language template with placeholder slots, (ii) a coherent generator that samples valid configurations, and (iii) a deterministic verifier that validates parameters and calculates the corresponding correct answers for each configuration. From a single seed problem, VeRA automatically creates unlimited verified variants with reliable labels at near-zero marginal cost without human involvement.
  VeRA operates in two complementary modes. VeRA-E (equivalent) rewrites problems while keeping the underlying logic intact, useful for detecting memorization versus genuine reasoning. VeRA-H (hardened) systematically increases complexity while remaining verifiable, enabling reliable creation and labelling of fresh difficult tasks at the boundary of intelligence. Evaluating 16 frontier models with VeRA, we find: (i) VeRA-E improves evaluation quality and reveals contamination patterns. (ii) VeRA-H enables human-free generation of hard tasks with reliable labels. (iii) VeRA establishes verified benchmarks as a general paradigm. VeRA reconceptualizes benchmarks from static objects used until exhausted, to executable specifications generating fresh, verified instances on demand, enhancing robustness and cost-effectiveness for evaluation.
  With VeRA, we envision that evaluation in any verifiable domain can scale indefinitely without sacrificing label integrity. To stimulate future research, we have open-sourced all code and datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SSLogic is a meta-synthesis framework that scales verifiable training signals for Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) by iteratively synthesizing and repairing executable Generator--Validator program pairs, enabling continuous task-family evolution with controllable difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the bottleneck of scaling verifiable training signals in RLVR by leveraging logical reasoning, as it provides formal constraints and programmatically checkable answers. Prior methods were limited by reliance on expert-written code or fixed templates.

Method: The authors propose SSLogic, a framework that iteratively synthesizes and repairs Generator--Validator program pairs in a closed-loop process (Generate--Validate--Repair). It includes a Multi-Gate Validation Protocol for reliability, combining multi-strategy checks and Adversarial Blind Review.

Result: Starting from 400 seed families, SSLogic expanded to 953 families and 21,389 verifiable instances. Training on evolved data improved performance over baselines: SynLogic (+5.2), BBEH (+1.4), AIME25 (+3.0), and Brumo25 (+3.7).

Conclusion: SSLogic effectively scales verifiable training signals for RLVR, enabling continuous evolution of task families and demonstrating consistent performance gains over seed baselines.

Abstract: Scaling verifiable training signals remains a key bottleneck for Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Logical reasoning is a natural substrate: constraints are formal and answers are programmatically checkable. However, prior synthesis pipelines either depend on expert-written code or operate within fixed templates/skeletons, which limits growth largely to instance-level perturbations. We propose SSLogic, an agentic meta-synthesis framework that scales at the task-family level by iteratively synthesizing and repairing executable Generator--Validator program pairs in a closed Generate--Validate--Repair loop, enabling continuous family evolution with controllable difficulty. To ensure reliability, we introduce a Multi-Gate Validation Protocol that combines multi-strategy consistency checks with Adversarial Blind Review, where independent agents must solve instances by writing and executing code to filter ambiguous or ill-posed tasks. Starting from 400 seed families, two evolution rounds expand to 953 families and 21,389 verifiable instances (from 5,718). Training on SSLogic-evolved data yields consistent gains over the seed baseline at matched training steps, improving SynLogic by +5.2, BBEH by +1.4, AIME25 by +3.0, and Brumo25 by +3.7.

### [240] [A Geometric Taxonomy of Hallucinations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13224)
*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a taxonomy classifying hallucinations in LLMs into three types (unfaithfulness, confabulation, factual error) and examines their geometric signatures in embedding space, revealing detection variability and theoretical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify and differentiate types of hallucinations in LLMs, understanding their geometric signatures and detection limitations.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy, analyzes geometric signatures in embedding space, and evaluates detection performance on benchmarks and human-crafted examples.

Result: Detection varies: Types I and II are detectable (AUROC 0.76-0.99 within domains), but Type III is indistinguishable from chance (AUROC 0.478). Differences stem from generation artifacts vs. genuine topical drift.

Conclusion: Embedding-based detection works for Types I and II hallucinations but fails for Type III, requiring external verification. Geometric taxonomy highlights scope and limitations.

Abstract: The term "hallucination" in large language models conflates distinct phenomena with different geometric signatures in embedding space. We propose a taxonomy identifying three types: unfaithfulness (failure to engage with provided context), confabulation (invention of semantically foreign content), and factual error (incorrect claims within correct conceptual frames). We observe a striking asymmetry. On standard benchmarks where hallucinations are LLM-generated, detection is domain-local: AUROC 0.76-0.99 within domains, but 0.50 (chance level) across domains. Discriminative directions are approximately orthogonal between domains (mean cosine similarity -0.07). On human-crafted confabulations - invented institutions, redefined terminology, fabricated mechanisms - a single global direction achieves 0.96 AUROC with 3.8% cross-domain degradation. We interpret this divergence as follows: benchmarks capture generation artifacts (stylistic signatures of prompted fabrication), while human-crafted confabulations capture genuine topical drift. The geometric structure differs because the underlying phenomena differ. Type III errors show 0.478 AUROC - indistinguishable from chance. This reflects a theoretical constraint: embeddings encode distributional co-occurrence, not correspondence to external reality. Statements with identical contextual patterns occupy similar embedding regions regardless of truth value. The contribution is a geometric taxonomy clarifying the scope of embedding-based detection: Types I and II are detectable; Type III requires external verification mechanisms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VaryBalance, a new method for detecting LLM-generated text, leverages the difference between human texts and their LLM-rewritten versions, outperforming existing detectors like Binoculars by 34.3% in AUROC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detectors for LLM-generated text rely on impractical assumptions or text-level features, leading to imprecise detection.

Method: VaryBalance quantifies the difference between human texts and their LLM-rewritten versions using mean standard deviation.

Result: VaryBalance outperforms state-of-the-art detectors (e.g., Binoculars) by up to 34.3% in AUROC and remains robust across models and languages.

Conclusion: VaryBalance offers a simple, effective, and practical solution for detecting LLM-generated text, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Detecting text generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial but challenging. Existing detectors depend on impractical assumptions, such as white-box settings, or solely rely on text-level features, leading to imprecise detection ability. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective and practical LLM-generated text detection method, VaryBalance. The core of VaryBalance is that, compared to LLM-generated texts, there is a greater difference between human texts and their rewritten version via LLMs. Leveraging this observation, VaryBalance quantifies this through mean standard deviation and distinguishes human texts and LLM-generated texts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that VaryBalance outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors, i.e., Binoculars, by up to 34.3\% in terms of AUROC, and maintains robustness against multiple generating models and languages.

*Truong Xuan Khanh,Truong Quynh Hoa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores why AI systems stagnate in long-horizon adaptability, attributing it to structural properties of optimization rather than learning or data. It introduces Trajectory-Dominant Pareto Optimization and the Trap Escape Difficulty Index (TEDI) to diagnose and overcome developmental constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the stagnation in long-horizon adaptability of AI systems, the paper argues that limitations stem from structural properties of optimization rather than insufficient learning or data.

Method: The paper formulates intelligence as a trajectory-level phenomenon, introduces Trajectory-Dominant Pareto Optimization, and defines the Trap Escape Difficulty Index (TEDI) to measure constraints.

Result: The study shows that dynamic intelligence ceilings arise from trajectory-level dominance and introduces a taxonomy of Pareto traps, demonstrating trajectory-level divergence in a minimal agent-environment model.

Conclusion: The results shift focus from terminal performance to optimization geometry, providing a framework to diagnose and overcome long-horizon developmental constraints in adaptive systems.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in artificial intelligence, many systems exhibit stagnation in long-horizon adaptability despite continued performance optimization. This work argues that such limitations do not primarily arise from insufficient learning, data, or model capacity, but from a deeper structural property of how intelligence is optimized over time. We formulate intelligence as a trajectory-level phenomenon governed by multi-objective trade-offs, and introduce Trajectory-Dominant Pareto Optimization, a path-wise generalization of classical Pareto optimality in which dominance is defined over full trajectories. Within this framework, Pareto traps emerge as locally non-dominated regions of trajectory space that nevertheless restrict access to globally superior developmental paths under conservative local optimization. To characterize the rigidity of such constraints, we define the Trap Escape Difficulty Index (TEDI), a composite geometric measure capturing escape distance, structural constraints, and behavioral inertia. We show that dynamic intelligence ceilings arise as inevitable geometric consequences of trajectory-level dominance, independent of learning progress or architectural scale. We further introduce a formal taxonomy of Pareto traps and illustrate the resulting trajectory-level divergence using a minimal agent-environment model. Together, these results shift the locus of intelligence from terminal performance to optimization geometry, providing a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming long-horizon developmental constraints in adaptive systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A training-free Dual-Cycle Adversarial Self-Evolution framework improves LLM role-playing fidelity and jailbreak resistance by synthesizing stronger attacks and distilling safety knowledge hierarchically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between persona fidelity and vulnerability to jailbreak attacks in LLM-based role-playing without costly training-time solutions.

Method: Proposes a Dual-Cycle framework: Persona-Targeted Attacker Cycle generates stronger jailbreak prompts, while Role-Playing Defender Cycle builds a hierarchical knowledge base for safety-guided generation.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements in role fidelity and jailbreak resistance across LLMs, with robust generalization to unseen personas and attacks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances persona adherence and safety without training, offering a scalable solution for evolving personas and attack strategies.

Abstract: LLM-based role-playing has rapidly improved in fidelity, yet stronger adherence to persona constraints commonly increases vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, especially for risky or negative personas. Most prior work mitigates this issue with training-time solutions (e.g., data curation or alignment-oriented regularization). However, these approaches are costly to maintain as personas and attack strategies evolve, can degrade in-character behavior, and are typically infeasible for frontier closed-weight LLMs. We propose a training-free Dual-Cycle Adversarial Self-Evolution framework with two coupled cycles. A Persona-Targeted Attacker Cycle synthesizes progressively stronger jailbreak prompts, while a Role-Playing Defender Cycle distills observed failures into a hierarchical knowledge base of (i) global safety rules, (ii) persona-grounded constraints, and (iii) safe in-character exemplars. At inference time, the Defender retrieves and composes structured knowledge from this hierarchy to guide generation, producing responses that remain faithful to the target persona while satisfying safety constraints. Extensive experiments across multiple proprietary LLMs show consistent gains over strong baselines on both role fidelity and jailbreak resistance, and robust generalization to unseen personas and attack prompts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lang2Act enhances VLMs by using self-emergent linguistic tools for fine-grained visual perception, avoiding rigid external tools and improving performance by over 4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VRAG frameworks rely on pre-defined tools, causing visual information loss. Lang2Act aims to improve perception by dynamically generating linguistic tools.

Method: Lang2Act uses a two-stage RL-based framework: (1) self-exploring actions for a linguistic toolbox, (2) optimizing tool use for reasoning.

Result: The method boosts VLM performance by over 4%, demonstrating effective perception enhancement.

Conclusion: Lang2Act offers a flexible, effective alternative to rigid VRAG frameworks, significantly improving visual perception in VLMs.

Abstract: Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VRAG) enhances Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by incorporating external visual documents to address a given query. Existing VRAG frameworks usually depend on rigid, pre-defined external tools to extend the perceptual capabilities of VLMs, typically by explicitly separating visual perception from subsequent reasoning processes. However, this decoupled design can lead to unnecessary loss of visual information, particularly when image-based operations such as cropping are applied. In this paper, we propose Lang2Act, which enables fine-grained visual perception and reasoning through self-emergent linguistic toolchains. Rather than invoking fixed external engines, Lang2Act collects self-emergent actions as linguistic tools and leverages them to enhance the visual perception capabilities of VLMs. To support this mechanism, we design a two-stage Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training framework. Specifically, the first stage optimizes VLMs to self-explore high-quality actions for constructing a reusable linguistic toolbox, and the second stage further optimizes VLMs to exploit these linguistic tools for downstream reasoning effectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Lang2Act in substantially enhancing the visual perception capabilities of VLMs, achieving performance improvements of over 4%.

*Najmul Hasan,Prashanth BusiReddyGari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DPBench evaluates LLM coordination using the Dining Philosophers problem, showing LLMs succeed sequentially but fail massively (>95% deadlock) in simultaneous decisions, with communication worsening outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks assessing LLM coordination under resource contention.

Method: Introduces DPBench, varying decision timing, group size, and communication, tested with models like GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, and Grok 4.1.

Result: LLMs coordinate well sequentially but fail (>95% deadlock) in simultaneous decisions due to convergent reasoning; communication exacerbates deadlock.

Conclusion: Multi-agent LLM systems need external coordination for concurrent resource access, not emergent coordination.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems, yet we lack benchmarks that test whether they can coordinate under resource contention. We introduce DPBench, a benchmark based on the Dining Philosophers problem that evaluates LLM coordination across eight conditions that vary decision timing, group size, and communication. Our experiments with GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, and Grok 4.1 reveal a striking asymmetry: LLMs coordinate effectively in sequential settings but fail when decisions must be made simultaneously, with deadlock rates exceeding 95\% under some conditions. We trace this failure to convergent reasoning, where agents independently arrive at identical strategies that, when executed simultaneously, guarantee deadlock. Contrary to expectations, enabling communication does not resolve this problem and can even increase deadlock rates. Our findings suggest that multi-agent LLM systems requiring concurrent resource access may need external coordination mechanisms rather than relying on emergent coordination. DPBench is released as an open-source benchmark. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/najmulhasan-code/dpbench.

*Rizky Ramadhana Putra,Raihan Sultan Pasha Basuki,Yutong Cheng,Peng Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NL2LOGIC improves automated reasoning by using an abstract syntax tree for accurate and interpretable first-order logic translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of fragile syntax control and low semantic faithfulness in existing methods for translating natural language to first-order logic.

Method: Proposes NL2LOGIC, a framework combining a recursive large language model semantic parser with an abstract syntax tree guided generator.

Result: Achieves 99% syntactic accuracy, improves semantic correctness by up to 30%, and enhances downstream reasoning accuracy by 31% in Logic-LM.

Conclusion: NL2LOGIC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and faithfulness for logic translation.

Abstract: Automated reasoning is critical in domains such as law and governance, where verifying claims against facts in documents requires both accuracy and interpretability. Recent work adopts structured reasoning pipelines that translate natural language into first-order logic and delegate inference to automated solvers. With the rise of large language models, approaches such as GCD and CODE4LOGIC leverage their reasoning and code generation capabilities to improve logic parsing. However, these methods suffer from fragile syntax control due to weak enforcement of global grammar constraints and low semantic faithfulness caused by insufficient clause-level semantic understanding. We propose NL2LOGIC, a first-order logic translation framework that introduces an abstract syntax tree as an intermediate representation. NL2LOGIC combines a recursive large language model based semantic parser with an abstract syntax tree guided generator that deterministically produces solver-ready logic code. Experiments on the FOLIO, LogicNLI, and ProofWriter benchmarks show that NL2LOGIC achieves 99 percent syntactic accuracy and improves semantic correctness by up to 30 percent over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating NL2LOGIC into Logic-LM yields near-perfect executability and improves downstream reasoning accuracy by 31 percent compared to Logic-LM's original few-shot unconstrained translation module.

*Deepak Babu Piskala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAPLE decomposes LLM agent capabilities into Memory, Learning, and Personalization, improving personalization by 14.6% and trait incorporation from 45% to 75%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents conflate memory, learning, and personalization, limiting their adaptability to individual users.

Method: MAPLE separates these into distinct mechanisms (Memory, Learning, Personalization), each with specialized sub-agents and interfaces.

Result: MAPLE improves personalization scores by 14.6% and boosts trait incorporation from 45% to 75%.

Conclusion: Decomposing LLM agent capabilities enhances adaptability and learning, showing significant improvements over stateless baselines.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for complex tasks, yet their ability to adapt to individual users remains fundamentally limited. We argue this limitation stems from a critical architectural conflation: current systems treat memory, learning, and personalization as a unified capability rather than three distinct mechanisms requiring different infrastructure, operating on different timescales, and benefiting from independent optimization. We propose MAPLE (Memory-Adaptive Personalized LEarning), a principled decomposition where Memory handles storage and retrieval infrastructure; Learning extracts intelligence from accumulated interactions asynchronously; and Personalization applies learned knowledge in real-time within finite context budgets. Each component operates as a dedicated sub-agent with specialized tooling and well-defined interfaces. Experimental evaluation on the MAPLE-Personas benchmark demonstrates that our decomposition achieves a 14.6% improvement in personalization score compared to a stateless baseline (p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.95) and increases trait incorporation rate from 45% to 75% -- enabling agents that genuinely learn and adapt.

TL;DR: The paper explores MIA methods for detecting unauthorized data usage in code LLMs, highlighting PAC's limitations with code syntax and proposing AST-PAC for better performance on larger files.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data governance and copyright challenges in code LLMs by improving MIA methods for auditing unauthorized data usage.

Method: Evaluates PAC and Loss Attack baselines on 3B--7B parameter code models, then introduces AST-PAC using AST-based perturbations for syntactically valid samples.

Result: PAC outperforms Loss but degrades on larger files; AST-PAC improves on larger files but struggles with small or alphanumeric-rich code.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on syntax-aware and size-adaptive calibration for reliable provenance auditing of code LLMs.

Abstract: Code Large Language Models are frequently trained on massive datasets containing restrictively licensed source code. This creates urgent data governance and copyright challenges. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) can serve as an auditing mechanism to detect unauthorized data usage in models. While attacks like the Loss Attack provide a baseline, more involved methods like Polarized Augment Calibration (PAC) remain underexplored in the code domain. This paper presents an exploratory study evaluating these methods on 3B--7B parameter code models. We find that while PAC generally outperforms the Loss baseline, its effectiveness relies on augmentation strategies that disregard the rigid syntax of code, leading to performance degradation on larger, complex files. To address this, we introduce AST-PAC, a domain-specific adaptation that utilizes Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based perturbations to generate syntactically valid calibration samples. Preliminary results indicate that AST-PAC improves as syntactic size grows, where PAC degrades, but under-mutates small files and underperforms on alphanumeric-rich code. Overall, the findings motivate future work on syntax-aware and size-adaptive calibration as a prerequisite for reliable provenance auditing of code language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces X-Blocks, a hierarchical framework analyzing natural language explanations for AVs at context, syntax, and lexicon levels, achieving near-human reliability in classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic frameworks for analyzing how humans linguistically construct driving rationales for AVs.

Method: Proposes X-Blocks with RACE for context classification, log-odds analysis for lexicon, and dependency parsing for syntax.

Result: RACE achieves 91.45% accuracy in classifying explanations and reveals systematic linguistic patterns across levels.

Conclusion: X-Blocks provides evidence-based linguistic design principles for generating scenario-aware explanations in AVs.

Abstract: Natural language explanations play a critical role in establishing trust and acceptance of automated vehicles (AVs), yet existing approaches lack systematic frameworks for analysing how humans linguistically construct driving rationales across diverse scenarios. This paper introduces X-Blocks (eXplanation Blocks), a hierarchical analytical framework that identifies the linguistic building blocks of natural language explanations for AVs at three levels: context, syntax, and lexicon.
  At the context level, we propose RACE (Reasoning-Aligned Classification of Explanations), a multi-LLM ensemble framework that combines Chain-of-Thought reasoning with self-consistency mechanisms to robustly classify explanations into 32 scenario-aware categories. Applied to human-authored explanations from the Berkeley DeepDrive-X dataset, RACE achieves 91.45 percent accuracy and a Cohens kappa of 0.91 against cases with human annotator agreement, indicating near-human reliability for context classification.
  At the lexical level, log-odds analysis with informative Dirichlet priors reveals context-specific vocabulary patterns that distinguish driving scenarios. At the syntactic level, dependency parsing and template extraction show that explanations draw from a limited repertoire of reusable grammar families, with systematic variation in predicate types and causal constructions across contexts.
  The X-Blocks framework is dataset-agnostic and task-independent, offering broad applicability to other automated driving datasets and safety-critical domains. Overall, our findings provide evidence-based linguistic design principles for generating scenario-aware explanations that support transparency, user trust, and cognitive accessibility in automated driving systems.

### [250] [A First Proof Sprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13587)
*Joseph Corneli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent proof sprint tackled ten research problems using draft generation, adversarial verification, and targeted repair. Results varied: some problems were solved or partially solved, while others had unresolved gaps. Methodologically, structure-aware verification improved reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address research-level problems efficiently by combining rapid draft generation with adversarial verification and targeted repair, while ensuring transparency in mathematical and QC-validation status.

Method: Used wiring-diagram decompositions of claim dependencies to localize gaps and coordinate reviewer-driven revisions. Employed structure-aware verification and layer-switching strategies.

Result: Heterogeneous outcomes: Problems 3, 5, and 10 had partial or conditional solutions; Problems 4 and 6 had partial results; Problem 7 was provisionally closed. QC gaps remained for Problems 7 and 9.

Conclusion: Structure-aware verification and layer-switching enhance reliability in compressed proof sprints, though some gaps persist.

Abstract: This monograph reports a multi-agent proof sprint on ten research-level problems, combining rapid draft generation with adversarial verification, targeted repair, and explicit provenance. The workflow uses wiring-diagram decompositions of claim dependencies to localize gaps and coordinate reviewer-driven revisions. Final outcomes are heterogeneous but explicit: the manuscript distinguishes mathematical status from QC-validation status. Mathematically, Problem~3 has a validation-complete existence path under the scoped criterion used here (uniqueness/irreducibility treated as optional), Problem 5 is solved in a scope-limited form for $F_O$-local connective spectra, Problem 10 is conditional under clearly stated assumptions (with explicit necessity counterexamples when assumptions are dropped), and Problems 4 and 6 are partial with named remaining obligations in the general case (including an unconditional $K_n$ result for Problem 6 with $c_0 = 1/3$). Problem 7 is treated as provisionally closed via the rotation-route theorem chain, pending independent ledger re-check. At the QC layer, Problems~7 and~9 have node-level validation artifacts but still contain unresolved verifier gaps. The main methodological result is that structure-aware verification and layer-switching strategies improve reliability and calibration in compressed proof sprints.

*Razeen A Rasheed,Somnath Banerjee,Animesh Mukherjee,Rima Hazra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights that while AI can quickly generate scientific reports, the real challenge lies in verifying claims and ensuring auditability. It proposes the Auditable Autonomous Research (AAR) standard to improve claim-evidence traceability and introduces semantic provenance for better validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing issue of weak or missing claim-evidence links in AI-generated research, which shifts the dominant risk from factual errors to misleading outputs. The focus is on making auditability a priority.

Method: The paper introduces the Auditable Autonomous Research (AAR) standard, which includes metrics like provenance coverage, soundness, contradiction transparency, and audit effort. It also advocates for semantic provenance with protocolized validation.

Result: The proposed AAR standard and semantic provenance framework aim to enhance the auditability of AI-generated research by ensuring traceable claim-evidence links and continuous validation during synthesis.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the need for claim-level auditability in AI research tools, presenting AAR as a solution to mitigate risks and improve the reliability of AI-generated scientific outputs.

Abstract: A deep research agent produces a fluent scientific report in minutes; a careful reader then tries to verify the main claims and discovers the real cost is not reading, but tracing: which sentence is supported by which passage, what was ignored, and where evidence conflicts. We argue that as research generation becomes cheap, auditability becomes the bottleneck, and the dominant risk shifts from isolated factual errors to scientifically styled outputs whose claim-evidence links are weak, missing, or misleading. This perspective proposes claim-level auditability as a first-class design and evaluation target for deep research agents, distills recurring long-horizon failure modes (objective drift, transient constraints, and unverifiable inference), and introduces the Auditable Autonomous Research (AAR) standard, a compact measurement framework that makes auditability testable via provenance coverage, provenance soundness, contradiction transparency, and audit effort. We then argue for semantic provenance with protocolized validation: persistent, queryable provenance graphs that encode claim--evidence relations (including conflicts) and integrate continuous validation during synthesis rather than after publication, with practical instrumentation patterns to support deployment at scale.

TL;DR: SELFCEST improves efficiency by using parallel clones and agentic reinforcement learning under fixed inference budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for frontier language models are compute-inefficient for serial reasoning or uncoordinated parallel sampling.

Method: SELFCEST equips a base model with parallel clones trained via agentic reinforcement learning under a global task reward.

Result: It outperforms monolithic baselines in math reasoning and multi-hop QA, achieving better accuracy-cost trade-offs.

Conclusion: SELFCEST generalizes well out-of-distribution and enhances efficiency under fixed inference budgets.

Abstract: Frontier language models improve with additional test-time computation, but serial reasoning or uncoordinated parallel sampling can be compute-inefficient under fixed inference budgets. We propose SELFCEST, which equips a base model with the ability to spawn same-weight clones in separate parallel contexts by agentic reinforcement learning. Training is end-to-end under a global task reward with shared-parameter rollouts, yielding a learned controller that allocates both generation and context budget across branches. Across challenging math reasoning benchmarks and long-context multi-hop QA, SELFCEST improves the accuracy-cost Pareto frontier relative to monolithic baselines at matched inference budget, and exhibits out-of-distribution generalization in both domains.

Motivation: Address the need for accurate and interpretable IDS in the face of rising cyber-threats.

Method: Proposed a framework integrating CNN and LSTM for temporal traffic analysis, enhanced with XAI (SHAP) for interpretability, and validated via expert surveys.

Result: Achieved 0.99 accuracy for both CNN and LSTM, with LSTM excelling in macro average metrics. SHAP identified key features influencing decisions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of combining performance and transparency in IDS, suggesting future work on adaptive learning for real-time detection.

Abstract: The increasing complexity and frequency of cyber-threats demand intrusion detection systems (IDS) that are not only accurate but also interpretable. This paper presented a novel IDS framework that integrated Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to enhance transparency in deep learning models. The framework was evaluated experimentally using the benchmark dataset NSL-KDD, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional IDS and black-box deep learning models. The proposed approach combined Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing temporal dependencies in traffic sequences. Our deep learning results showed that both CNN and LSTM reached 0.99 for accuracy, whereas LSTM outperformed CNN at macro average precision, recall, and F-1 score. For weighted average precision, recall, and F-1 score, both models scored almost similarly. To ensure interpretability, the XAI model SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was incorporated, enabling security analysts to understand and validate model decisions. Some notable influential features were srv_serror_rate, dst_host_srv_serror_rate, and serror_rate for both models, as pointed out by SHAP. We also conducted a trust-focused expert survey based on IPIP6 and Big Five personality traits via an interactive UI to evaluate the system's reliability and usability. This work highlighted the potential of combining performance and transparency in cybersecurity solutions and recommends future enhancements through adaptive learning for real-time threat detection.

TL;DR: TemporalBench is a multi-domain benchmark evaluating temporal reasoning across four real-world domains, revealing gaps in existing models' contextual and event-aware capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if strong forecasting performance indicates genuine temporal understanding or contextual reasoning.

Method: Four-tier task taxonomy assessing historical structure, context-free forecasting, contextual reasoning, and event-conditioned prediction.

Result: Existing models show fragmented strengths and systematic failures in contextual reasoning, despite forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion: TemporalBench highlights the need for models to improve contextual and event-aware temporal reasoning.

Abstract: It is unclear whether strong forecasting performance reflects genuine temporal understanding or the ability to reason under contextual and event-driven conditions. We introduce TemporalBench, a multi-domain benchmark designed to evaluate temporal reasoning behavior under progressively richer informational settings. TemporalBench adopts a four-tier task taxonomy that examines historical structure interpretation, context-free forecasting, contextual temporal reasoning, and event-conditioned prediction across four real-world domains: retail, healthcare, energy, and physical systems. By controlling access to future targets and contextual information, the benchmark enables a diagnostic analysis of whether models can correctly interpret temporal patterns, align them with external context, and adapt predictions when conditions change. Extensive baseline experiments show that strong numerical forecasting accuracy does not reliably translate into robust contextual or event-aware temporal reasoning; instead, existing agent frameworks exhibit fragmented strengths and systematic failure modes that remain largely hidden under forecasting-only benchmarks. The TemporalBench dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Melady/TemporalBench, and we additionally provide a public leaderboard at https://huggingface.co/spaces/Melady/TemporalBench_Leaderboard.

Motivation: Prompt design affects LLM moral competence and safety, but existing comparisons are fragmented. A standardized evaluation framework is needed.

Method: ProMoral-Bench tests prompts using ETHICS, Scruples, WildJailbreak, and ETHICS-Contrast, measuring performance with UMSS.

Result: Compact, exemplar-guided scaffolds outperform complex reasoning, offering higher UMSS and robustness with fewer tokens. Few-shot exemplars enhance moral stability.

Conclusion: ProMoral-Bench provides a cost-effective, standardized framework for prompt engineering, favoring simplicity over complexity.

Abstract: Prompt design significantly impacts the moral competence and safety alignment of large language models (LLMs), yet empirical comparisons remain fragmented across datasets and models.We introduce ProMoral-Bench, a unified benchmark evaluating 11 prompting paradigms across four LLM families. Using ETHICS, Scruples, WildJailbreak, and our new robustness test, ETHICS-Contrast, we measure performance via our proposed Unified Moral Safety Score (UMSS), a metric balancing accuracy and safety. Our results show that compact, exemplar-guided scaffolds outperform complex multi-stage reasoning, providing higher UMSS scores and greater robustness at a lower token cost. While multi-turn reasoning proves fragile under perturbations, few-shot exemplars consistently enhance moral stability and jailbreak resistance. ProMoral-Bench establishes a standardized framework for principled, cost-effective prompt engineering.

TL;DR: The paper explores how multi-agent AI systems can achieve reliable outcomes by mimicking human institutional structures, using compartmentalization and adversarial review. A case study demonstrates successful layered verification and behavioral improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address AI reliability by leveraging organisational structures to mitigate risks from misaligned individuals, rather than relying solely on individual alignment.

Method: The method involves designing a multi-agent system (Perseverance Composition Engine) with compartmentalized roles (Composer, Corroborator, Critic) and adversarial review to enforce verification and evaluation through architecture.

Result: Results from 474 tasks show layered verification works: Corroborator detects unsupported claims, Critic assesses coherence, and impossible tasks led to honest refusal—behavior not explicitly instructed.

Conclusion: Organisational theory offers a viable framework for multi-agent AI safety, proving architectural enforcement can yield reliable outcomes from unreliable components.

Abstract: Alignment research focuses on making individual AI systems reliable. Human institutions achieve reliable collective behaviour differently: they mitigate the risk posed by misaligned individuals through organisational structure. Multi-agent AI systems should follow this institutional model using compartmentalisation and adversarial review to achieve reliable outcomes through architectural design rather than assuming individual alignment.
  We demonstrate this approach through the Perseverance Composition Engine, a multi-agent system for document composition. The Composer drafts text, the Corroborator verifies factual substantiation with full source access, and the Critic evaluates argumentative quality without access to sources: information asymmetry enforced by system architecture. This creates layered verification: the Corroborator detects unsupported claims, whilst the Critic independently assesses coherence and completeness. Observations from 474 composition tasks (discrete cycles of drafting, verification, and evaluation) exhibit patterns consistent with the institutional hypothesis. When assigned impossible tasks requiring fabricated content, this iteration enabled progression from attempted fabrication toward honest refusal with alternative proposals--behaviour neither instructed nor individually incentivised. These findings motivate controlled investigation of whether architectural enforcement produces reliable outcomes from unreliable components.
  This positions organisational theory as a productive framework for multi-agent AI safety. By implementing verification and evaluation as structural properties enforced through information compartmentalisation, institutional design offers a route to reliable collective behaviour from unreliable individual components.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BEAGLE is a neuro-symbolic framework simulating student learning behaviors in open-ended problem-solving, addressing LLM biases by incorporating Self-Regulated Learning theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in collecting authentic student data and biases in LLMs simulating novice learners.

Method: BEAGLE uses a semi-Markov model, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing with flaw injection, and a decoupled agent design.

Result: BEAGLE outperforms baselines in reproducing authentic student trajectories and passes a human Turing test.

Conclusion: BEAGLE effectively simulates authentic student learning behaviors, addressing limitations of LLMs.

Abstract: Simulating student learning behaviors in open-ended problem-solving environments holds potential for education research, from training adaptive tutoring systems to stress-testing pedagogical interventions. However, collecting authentic data is challenging due to privacy concerns and the high cost of longitudinal studies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising path to student simulation, they suffer from competency bias, optimizing for efficient correctness rather than the erratic, iterative struggle characteristic of novice learners. We present BEAGLE, a neuro-symbolic framework that addresses this bias by incorporating Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) theory into a novel architecture. BEAGLE integrates three key technical innovations: (1) a semi-Markov model that governs the timing and transitions of cognitive behaviors and metacognitive behaviors; (2) Bayesian Knowledge Tracing with explicit flaw injection to enforce realistic knowledge gaps and "unknown unknowns"; and (3) a decoupled agent design that separates high-level strategy use from code generation actions to prevent the model from silently correcting its own intentional errors. In evaluations on Python programming tasks, BEAGLE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reproducing authentic trajectories. In a human Turing test, users were unable to distinguish synthetic traces from real student data, achieving an accuracy indistinguishable from random guessing (52.8%).

TL;DR: The study examines how people prioritize accuracy in AI tools differently in professional vs. personal contexts, revealing higher accuracy demands at work and greater disruption in personal routines when tools are unavailable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand user trade-offs in accuracy expectations for AI tools between professional and personal settings, and how they cope without such tools.

Method: An online survey (N=300) analyzed accuracy demands and disruption levels, focusing on context-specific reliability defined by user intent and correction costs.

Result: Work contexts demand significantly higher accuracy (24.1% top-box vs. 8.8% personal) and show less disruption when tools are unavailable (15.3% vs. 34.1%). Heavy app use correlates with stricter work standards.

Conclusion: Users prioritize accuracy more at work and face greater personal disruption without AI tools, highlighting context-dependent reliability needs.

Abstract: We study how people trade off accuracy when using AI-powered tools in professional versus personal contexts for adoption purposes, the determinants of those trade-offs, and how users cope when AI/apps are unavailable. Because modern AI systems (especially generative models) can produce acceptable but non-identical outputs, we define "accuracy" as context-specific reliability: the degree to which an output aligns with the user's intent within a tolerance threshold that depends on stakes and the cost of correction. In an online survey (N=300), among respondents with both accuracy items (N=170), the share requiring high accuracy (top-box) is 24.1% at work vs. 8.8% in personal life (+15.3 pp; z=6.29, p<0.001). The gap remains large under a broader top-two-box definition (67.0% vs. 32.9%) and on the full 1-5 ordinal scale (mean 3.86 vs. 3.08). Heavy app use and experience patterns correlate with stricter work standards (H2). When tools are unavailable (H3), respondents report more disruption in personal routines than at work (34.1% vs. 15.3%, p<0.01). We keep the main text focused on these substantive results and place test taxonomy and power derivations in a technical appendix.

Method: Introduces Mirror with EthicsLLM (fine-tuned on EthicsQA) for ethical reasoning and rule interpretation. Operates in two modes: Mirror-ER for expedited reviews and Mirror-CR for full-board simulations.

Result: Empirical evaluations show Mirror outperforms generalist LLMs in assessment quality, consistency, and professionalism.

Conclusion: Mirror offers a scalable, effective solution for modern ethics review challenges, integrating AI with regulatory structures.

Abstract: Ethics review is a foundational mechanism of modern research governance, yet contemporary systems face increasing strain as ethical risks arise as structural consequences of large-scale, interdisciplinary scientific practice. The demand for consistent and defensible decisions under heterogeneous risk profiles exposes limitations in institutional review capacity rather than in the legitimacy of ethics oversight. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to support ethics review, but their direct application remains limited by insufficient ethical reasoning capability, weak integration with regulatory structures, and strict privacy constraints on authentic review materials. In this work, we introduce Mirror, an agentic framework for AI-assisted ethical review that integrates ethical reasoning, structured rule interpretation, and multi-agent deliberation within a unified architecture. At its core is EthicsLLM, a foundational model fine-tuned on EthicsQA, a specialized dataset of 41K question-chain-of-thought-answer triples distilled from authoritative ethics and regulatory corpora. EthicsLLM provides detailed normative and regulatory understanding, enabling Mirror to operate in two complementary modes. Mirror-ER (expedited Review) automates expedited review through an executable rule base that supports efficient and transparent compliance checks for minimal-risk studies. Mirror-CR (Committee Review) simulates full-board deliberation through coordinated interactions among expert agents, an ethics secretary agent, and a principal investigator agent, producing structured, committee-level assessments across ten ethical dimensions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Mirror significantly improves the quality, consistency, and professionalism of ethics assessments compared with strong generalist LLMs.

*Daesik Jang,Morgan Lindsay Heisler,Linzi Xing,Yifei Li,Edward Wang,Ying Xiong,Yong Zhang,Zhenan Fan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DECKBench is a new benchmark for evaluating multi-agent slide generation and editing, addressing gaps in current protocols by assessing fidelity, coherence, layout quality, and instruction following.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation of slide generation challenges like content selection, organization, and multi-turn editing, necessitating a standardized framework.

Method: Developed DECKBench with curated paper-slide pairs and simulated editing instructions, implementing a modular multi-agent system for parsing, planning, HTML creation, and iterative editing.

Result: Experimental results show DECKBench effectively measures strengths and weaknesses, providing actionable insights for improving slide generation systems.

Conclusion: DECKBench sets a reproducible and comparable standard for evaluating academic presentation tools, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: Automatically generating and iteratively editing academic slide decks requires more than document summarization. It demands faithful content selection, coherent slide organization, layout-aware rendering, and robust multi-turn instruction following. However, existing benchmarks and evaluation protocols do not adequately measure these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Deck Edits and Compliance Kit Benchmark (DECKBench), an evaluation framework for multi-agent slide generation and editing. DECKBench is built on a curated dataset of paper to slide pairs augmented with realistic, simulated editing instructions. Our evaluation protocol systematically assesses slide-level and deck-level fidelity, coherence, layout quality, and multi-turn instruction following. We further implement a modular multi-agent baseline system that decomposes the slide generation and editing task into paper parsing and summarization, slide planning, HTML creation, and iterative editing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark highlights strengths, exposes failure modes, and provides actionable insights for improving multi-agent slide generation and editing systems. Overall, this work establishes a standardized foundation for reproducible and comparable evaluation of academic presentation generation and editing. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/morgan-heisler/DeckBench .

*Jisung Shin,Daniel Platnick,Marjan Alirezaie,Hossein Rahnama*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Situation Graph Prediction (SGP) to model evolving internal states like goals and emotions, addressing challenges in data privacy and labeling. It proposes synthetic data generation and evaluates GPT-4o's performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in modeling perspective-aware AI due to lack of labeled data and privacy concerns.

Method: Proposes SGP as a task for inverse inference and uses synthetic data generation aligned with latent labels.

Result: GPT-4o shows difficulty in latent-state inference compared to surface-level extraction.

Conclusion: SGP is challenging but feasible, and synthetic data generation shows promise.

Abstract: Perspective-Aware AI requires modeling evolving internal states--goals, emotions, contexts--not merely preferences. Progress is limited by a data bottleneck: digital footprints are privacy-sensitive and perspective states are rarely labeled. We propose Situation Graph Prediction (SGP), a task that frames perspective modeling as an inverse inference problem: reconstructing structured, ontology-aligned representations of perspective from observable multimodal artifacts. To enable grounding without real labels, we use a structure-first synthetic generation strategy that aligns latent labels and observable traces by design. As a pilot, we construct a dataset and run a diagnostic study using retrieval-augmented in-context learning as a proxy for supervision. In our study with GPT-4o, we observe a gap between surface-level extraction and latent perspective inference--indicating latent-state inference is harder than surface extraction under our controlled setting. Results suggest SGP is non-trivial and provide evidence for the structure-first data synthesis strategy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theoretical framework to analyze error propagation in AI agents using sequential tool calls, showing linear growth and bounded deviations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate error accumulation in AI agents leveraging external tools for high-stakes decisions.

Method: Develops a hybrid distortion metric combining discrete fact matching and semantic similarity, with theoretical proofs and empirical validation using LLMs.

Result: Empirical results confirm linear distortion growth with deviations bounded by O(√T), semantic weighting reduces distortion by 80%, and periodic re-grounding every ~9 steps controls errors.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical and empirical insights into error propagation, offering practical principles for deploying reliable AI agent systems.

Abstract: As AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) increasingly use external tools for high-stakes decisions, a critical reliability question arises: how do errors propagate across sequential tool calls? We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing error accumulation in Model Context Protocol (MCP) agents, proving that cumulative distortion exhibits linear growth and high-probability deviations bounded by $O(\sqrt{T})$. This concentration property ensures predictable system behavior and rules out exponential failure modes. We develop a hybrid distortion metric combining discrete fact matching with continuous semantic similarity, then establish martingale concentration bounds on error propagation through sequential tool interactions. Experiments across Qwen2-7B, Llama-3-8B, and Mistral-7B validate our theoretical predictions, showing empirical distortion tracks the linear trend with deviations consistently within $O(\sqrt{T})$ envelopes. Key findings include: semantic weighting reduces distortion by 80\%, and periodic re-grounding approximately every 9 steps suffices for error control. We translate these concentration guarantees into actionable deployment principles for trustworthy agent systems.

### [263] [Detecting Jailbreak Attempts in Clinical Training LLMs Through Automated Linguistic Feature Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13321)
*Tri Nguyen,Huy Hoang Bao Le,Lohith Srikanth Pentapalli,Laurah Turner,Kelly Cohen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable, automated method using LLM-derived linguistic features to detect jailbreak attempts in clinical training LLMs, improving upon manual annotation limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods relied on manually annotated linguistic features for jailbreak detection, which lacked scalability and expressiveness.

Method: Experts annotated four linguistic features; multiple BERT-based models predicted these features. Predictive models then used extracted features to determine jailbreak likelihood.

Result: The system achieved strong performance in cross-validation and held-out evaluations, showing LLM-derived features effectively support automated detection.

Conclusion: The approach is scalable and interpretable, with identified limitations guiding future enhancements like richer annotations and finer-grained feature extraction.

Abstract: Detecting jailbreak attempts in clinical training large language models (LLMs) requires accurate modeling of linguistic deviations that signal unsafe or off-task user behavior. Prior work on the 2-Sigma clinical simulation platform showed that manually annotated linguistic features could support jailbreak detection. However, reliance on manual annotation limited both scalability and expressiveness. In this study, we extend this framework by using experts' annotations of four core linguistic features (Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual Distraction) and training multiple general-domain and medical-domain BERT-based LLM models to predict these features directly from text. The most reliable feature regressor for each dimension was selected and used as the feature extractor in a second layer of classifiers. We evaluate a suite of predictive models, including tree-based, linear, probabilistic, and ensemble methods, to determine jailbreak likelihood from the extracted features. Across cross-validation and held-out evaluations, the system achieves strong overall performance, indicating that LLM-derived linguistic features provide an effective basis for automated jailbreak detection. Error analysis further highlights key limitations in current annotations and feature representations, pointing toward future improvements such as richer annotation schemes, finer-grained feature extraction, and methods that capture the evolving risk of jailbreak behavior over the course of a dialogue. This work demonstrates a scalable and interpretable approach for detecting jailbreak behavior in safety-critical clinical dialogue systems.

### [264] [Contrastive explanations of BDI agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13323)
*Michael Winikoff*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extends BDI agent explanations to answer contrastive questions, showing shorter answers and some preference/trust benefits, but no clear advantage of explanations over none.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing transparency and trust in autonomous systems by enabling them to answer contrastive questions ("why X instead of Y?").

Method: Extended BDI agent framework to handle contrastive questions, conducted computational and human subject evaluations.

Result: Contrastive answers were shorter and somewhat preferred, with hints of higher trust and understanding. No clear benefit of explanations over none.

Conclusion: Contrastive explanations improve efficiency and trust, but the value of explanations depends on context.

Abstract: The ability of autonomous systems to provide explanations is important for supporting transparency and aiding the development of (appropriate) trust. Prior work has defined a mechanism for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents to be able to answer questions of the form ``why did you do action $X$?''. However, we know that we ask \emph{contrastive} questions (``why did you do $X$ \emph{instead of} $F$?''). We therefore extend previous work to be able to answer such questions. A computational evaluation shows that using contrastive questions yields a significant reduction in explanation length. A human subject evaluation was conducted to assess whether such contrastive answers are preferred, and how well they support trust development and transparency. We found some evidence for contrastive answers being preferred, and some evidence that they led to higher trust, perceived understanding, and confidence in the system's correctness. We also evaluated the benefit of providing explanations at all. Surprisingly, there was not a clear benefit, and in some situations we found evidence that providing a (full) explanation was worse than not providing any explanation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Nanbeige4.1-3B is a versatile 3B-parameter language model excelling in agentic behavior, code generation, and reasoning, outperforming similar and larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that small language models (SLMs) can achieve broad competence and specialization simultaneously, challenging the notion that larger models are inherently superior.

Method: Combines point-wise and pair-wise reward modeling for reasoning and preference alignment, complexity-aware rewards for code generation, and turn-level supervision with complex data synthesis for stable long-horizon tool interactions.

Result: Nanbeige4.1-3B outperforms prior models of similar scale (e.g., Nanbeige4-3B-2511, Qwen3-4B) and competes with much larger models (e.g., Qwen3-30B-A3B), reliably executing up to 600 tool-call turns.

Conclusion: Small models like Nanbeige4.1-3B can redefine the potential of 3B-parameter models by achieving both broad competence and strong specialization.

Abstract: We present Nanbeige4.1-3B, a unified generalist language model that simultaneously achieves strong agentic behavior, code generation, and general reasoning with only 3B parameters. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first open-source small language model (SLM) to achieve such versatility in a single model. To improve reasoning and preference alignment, we combine point-wise and pair-wise reward modeling, ensuring high-quality, human-aligned responses. For code generation, we design complexity-aware rewards in Reinforcement Learning, optimizing both correctness and efficiency. In deep search, we perform complex data synthesis and incorporate turn-level supervision during training. This enables stable long-horizon tool interactions, allowing Nanbeige4.1-3B to reliably execute up to 600 tool-call turns for complex problem-solving. Extensive experimental results show that Nanbeige4.1-3B significantly outperforms prior models of similar scale, such as Nanbeige4-3B-2511 and Qwen3-4B, even achieving superior performance compared to much larger models, such as Qwen3-30B-A3B. Our results demonstrate that small models can achieve both broad competence and strong specialization simultaneously, redefining the potential of 3B parameter models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework called Morality Chains and a benchmark MoralityGym are introduced for evaluating AI moral alignment using ethical dilemmas, highlighting current limitations in AI ethical decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating moral alignment in AI agents navigating conflicting human norms, integrating insights from psychology and philosophy.

Method: Introduces Morality Chains (formalizing norms as ordered deontic constraints) and MoralityGym (98 ethical-dilemma problems in Gymnasium environments), along with a Morality Metric for evaluation.

Result: Baseline results with Safe RL methods show key limitations, indicating a need for more principled ethical decision-making approaches.

Conclusion: Provides a foundation for AI systems to behave ethically and transparently in complex real-world contexts.

Abstract: Evaluating moral alignment in agents navigating conflicting, hierarchically structured human norms is a critical challenge at the intersection of AI safety, moral philosophy, and cognitive science. We introduce Morality Chains, a novel formalism for representing moral norms as ordered deontic constraints, and MoralityGym, a benchmark of 98 ethical-dilemma problems presented as trolley-dilemma-style Gymnasium environments. By decoupling task-solving from moral evaluation and introducing a novel Morality Metric, MoralityGym allows the integration of insights from psychology and philosophy into the evaluation of norm-sensitive reasoning. Baseline results with Safe RL methods reveal key limitations, underscoring the need for more principled approaches to ethical decision-making. This work provides a foundation for developing AI systems that behave more reliably, transparently, and ethically in complex real-world contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper revisits the complexity of training large reasoning models with RL and simplifies the approach to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), achieving better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability and inefficiency of current RL-based methods for training large reasoning models with multiple reward objectives.

Method: Proposes on-policy SFT, a simplified training strategy that removes unnecessary complexity (KL regularization and group-wise normalization) and uses a truncation-based length penalty.

Result: On-policy SFT reduces reasoning length by 80% while maintaining accuracy, outperforms RL-based methods, and improves training efficiency (50% less GPU memory, 70% faster convergence).

Conclusion: Simplification via on-policy SFT achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to complex RL-based approaches.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) are commonly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to explore long chain-of-thought reasoning, achieving strong performance at high computational cost. Recent methods add multi-reward objectives to jointly optimize correctness and brevity, but these complex extensions often destabilize training and yield suboptimal trade-offs. We revisit this objective and challenge the necessity of such complexity. Through principled analysis, we identify fundamental misalignments in this paradigm: KL regularization loses its intended role when correctness and length are directly verifiable, and group-wise normalization becomes ambiguous under multiple reward signals. By removing these two items and simplifying the reward to a truncation-based length penalty, we show that the optimization problem reduces to supervised fine-tuning on self-generated data filtered for both correctness and conciseness. We term this simplified training strategy on-policy SFT. Despite its simplicity, on-policy SFT consistently defines the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier. It reduces CoT length by up to 80 while maintaining original accuracy, surpassing more complex RL-based methods across five benchmarks. Furthermore, it significantly enhances training efficiency, reducing GPU memory usage by 50% and accelerating convergence by 70%. Our code is available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/On-Policy-SFT.

*Guoan Wang,Shihao Yang,Jun-En Ding,Hao Zhu,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeuroWeaver is a unified autonomous evolutionary agent for EEG analysis, optimizing pipelines with neurophysiological constraints, achieving high performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of foundation models and general-purpose automated ML for EEG analysis due to high computational costs and lack of neurophysiological plausibility.

Method: Uses Domain-Informed Subspace Initialization and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization to balance performance, novelty, and efficiency.

Result: Outperforms task-specific methods and matches large-scale foundation models while using fewer parameters across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: NeuroWeaver offers a viable solution for EEG analysis in resource-constrained settings by combining neurophysiological priors with efficient optimization.

Abstract: Although foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in general domains, the application of these models to electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is constrained by substantial data requirements and high parameterization. These factors incur prohibitive computational costs, thereby impeding deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. Conversely, general-purpose automated machine learning frameworks are often ill-suited for this domain, as exploration within an unbounded programmatic space fails to incorporate essential neurophysiological priors and frequently yields solutions that lack scientific plausibility. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroWeaver, a unified autonomous evolutionary agent designed to generalize across diverse EEG datasets and tasks by reformulating pipeline engineering as a discrete constrained optimization problem. Specifically, we employ a Domain-Informed Subspace Initialization to confine the search to neuroscientifically plausible manifolds, coupled with a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization that dynamically balances performance, novelty, and efficiency via self-reflective refinement. Empirical evaluations across five heterogeneous benchmarks demonstrate that NeuroWeaver synthesizes lightweight solutions that consistently outperform state-of-the-art task-specific methods and achieve performance comparable to large-scale foundation models, despite utilizing significantly fewer parameters.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates security vulnerabilities in multi-agent LLM systems, particularly the orchestrator setup, and identifies a novel attack vector, OMNI-LEAK, that bypasses data access controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of threat modeling in multi-agent LLM systems and highlight the risks of privacy breaches and financial losses in real-world applications.

Method: Red-teaming a representative orchestrator setup to demonstrate OMNI-LEAK, testing frontier models for susceptibility to attacks.

Result: Both reasoning and non-reasoning models are vulnerable to OMNI-LEAK, even without insider knowledge, revealing gaps in multi-agent security.

Conclusion: Safety research must extend from single-agent to multi-agent settings to mitigate risks and maintain public trust in AI agents.

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more capable, their coordinated use in the form of multi-agent systems is anticipated to emerge as a practical paradigm. Prior work has examined the safety and misuse risks associated with agents. However, much of this has focused on the single-agent case and/or setups missing basic engineering safeguards such as access control, revealing a scarcity of threat modeling in multi-agent systems. We investigate the security vulnerabilities of a popular multi-agent pattern known as the orchestrator setup, in which a central agent decomposes and delegates tasks to specialized agents. Through red-teaming a concrete setup representative of a likely future use case, we demonstrate a novel attack vector, OMNI-LEAK, that compromises several agents to leak sensitive data through a single indirect prompt injection, even in the \textit{presence of data access control}. We report the susceptibility of frontier models to different categories of attacks, finding that both reasoning and non-reasoning models are vulnerable, even when the attacker lacks insider knowledge of the implementation details. Our work highlights the importance of safety research to generalize from single-agent to multi-agent settings, in order to reduce the serious risks of real-world privacy breaches and financial losses and overall public trust in AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance personalized diet systems by improving nutritional quality without sacrificing convenience or affordability, addressing scalability and equity in everyday nutrition.

Method: Uses WWEIA intake data to identify 34 meal archetypes, then employs generative models and portion predictors conditioned on these archetypes to meet USDA nutritional targets with minimal food substitutions.

Result: Generated meals improved adherence to RDI targets by 47%, increased nutrition by 10%, and reduced costs by 19-32%, staying compositionally similar to real meals.

Conclusion: The framework successfully converts dietary guidelines into practical, budget-friendly meals, proving useful for clinical, public-health, and consumer applications.

Abstract: An important goal for personalized diet systems is to improve nutritional quality without compromising convenience or affordability. We present an end-to-end framework that converts dietary standards into complete meals with minimal change. Using the What We Eat in America (WWEIA) intake data for 135,491 meals, we identify 34 interpretable meal archetypes that we then use to condition a generative model and a portion predictor to meet USDA nutritional targets. In comparisons within archetypes, generated meals are better at following recommended daily intake (RDI) targets by 47.0%, while remaining compositionally close to real meals. Our results show that by allowing one to three food substitutions, we were able to create meals that were 10% more nutritious, while reducing costs 19-32%, on average. By turning dietary guidelines into realistic, budget-aware meals and simple swaps, this framework can underpin clinical decision support, public-health programs, and consumer apps that deliver scalable, equitable improvements in everyday nutrition.

*Jaechul Roh,Eugene Bagdasarian,Hamed Haddadi,Ali Shahin Shamsabadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper formalizes Natural Agentic Oversharing (unintentional disclosure of user info by web agents) and introduces SPILLage, a framework analyzing oversharing via content vs. behavior and explicit vs. implicit dimensions. Behavioral oversharing dominates, worsening under mitigation but reducing oversharing improves task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how web agents handle user resources unintentionally while acting on live websites, highlighting privacy risks beyond text leakage.

Method: Introduces SPILLage framework, benchmarks 180 tasks on live e-commerce sites, and tests oversharing across agentic frameworks and LLMs with ground-truth annotations.

Result: Behavioral oversharing exceeds content oversharing by 5x, persists under mitigation, but reducing oversharing boosts task success by up to 17.9%.

Conclusion: Privacy protection in web agents requires broader oversight of actions, not just textual outputs, as oversharing is pervasive and impacts task success.

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are beginning to automate user's tasks across the open web, often with access to user resources such as emails and calendars. Unlike standard LLMs answering questions in a controlled ChatBot setting, web agents act "in the wild", interacting with third parties and leaving behind an action trace. Therefore, we ask the question: how do web agents handle user resources when accomplishing tasks on their behalf across live websites? In this paper, we formalize Natural Agentic Oversharing -- the unintentional disclosure of task-irrelevant user information through an agent trace of actions on the web. We introduce SPILLage, a framework that characterizes oversharing along two dimensions: channel (content vs. behavior) and directness (explicit vs. implicit). This taxonomy reveals a critical blind spot: while prior work focuses on text leakage, web agents also overshare behaviorally through clicks, scrolls, and navigation patterns that can be monitored. We benchmark 180 tasks on live e-commerce sites with ground-truth annotations separating task-relevant from task-irrelevant attributes. Across 1,080 runs spanning two agentic frameworks and three backbone LLMs, we demonstrate that oversharing is pervasive with behavioral oversharing dominates content oversharing by 5x. This effect persists -- and can even worsen -- under prompt-level mitigation. However, removing task-irrelevant information before execution improves task success by up to 17.9%, demonstrating that reducing oversharing improves task success. Our findings underscore that protecting privacy in web agents is a fundamental challenge, requiring a broader view of "output" that accounts for what agents do on the web, not just what they type.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REMem is a two-phase framework addressing episodic memory challenges in language agents, outperforming state-of-the-art systems in recollection and reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans excel at episodic memory, but current language agents lack effective episodic recollection and reasoning capabilities.

Method: REMem uses offline indexing (converting experiences into a hybrid memory graph) and online inference (agentic retriever for iterative retrieval).

Result: REMem outperforms Mem0 and HippoRAG 2 by 3.4% and 13.4% absolute improvements on episodic tasks and shows robust refusal behavior.

Conclusion: REMem effectively bridges the gap in episodic memory for language agents, enhancing both recollection and reasoning.

Abstract: Humans excel at remembering concrete experiences along spatiotemporal contexts and performing reasoning across those events, i.e., the capacity for episodic memory. In contrast, memory in language agents remains mainly semantic, and current agents are not yet capable of effectively recollecting and reasoning over interaction histories. We identify and formalize the core challenges of episodic recollection and reasoning from this gap, and observe that existing work often overlooks episodicity, lacks explicit event modeling, or overemphasizes simple retrieval rather than complex reasoning. We present REMem, a two-phase framework for constructing and reasoning with episodic memory: 1) Offline indexing, where REMem converts experiences into a hybrid memory graph that flexibly links time-aware gists and facts. 2) Online inference, where REMem employs an agentic retriever with carefully curated tools for iterative retrieval over the memory graph. Comprehensive evaluation across four episodic memory benchmarks shows that REMem substantially outperforms state-of-the-art memory systems such as Mem0 and HippoRAG 2, showing 3.4% and 13.4% absolute improvements on episodic recollection and reasoning tasks, respectively. Moreover, REMem also demonstrates more robust refusal behavior for unanswerable questions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Online Reinforcement Learning WebAgent to improve autonomous web navigation by addressing distributional shifts in conventional methods. It introduces hierarchical fine-tuning, a hybrid reward mechanism, and a modular framework (OpAgent), achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods (SFT or Offline RL) fail due to distributional shifts in volatile web environments. The goal is to optimize policy through direct online interactions.

Method: Three innovations: 1) Hierarchical Multi-Task Fine-tuning for VLMs, 2) Online Agentic RL with Hybrid Reward Mechanism, 3) Modular OpAgent framework for error recovery.

Result: The RL-enhanced model achieves 38.1% success on WebArena, while OpAgent reaches 71.6% SOTA performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach outperforms existing baselines by enabling robust online interactions and modular error recovery.

Abstract: To fulfill user instructions, autonomous web agents must contend with the inherent complexity and volatile nature of real-world websites. Conventional paradigms predominantly rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) using static datasets. However, these methods suffer from severe distributional shifts, as offline trajectories fail to capture the stochastic state transitions and real-time feedback of unconstrained wide web environments. In this paper, we propose a robust Online Reinforcement Learning WebAgent, designed to optimize its policy through direct, iterative interactions with unconstrained wide websites. Our approach comprises three core innovations: 1) Hierarchical Multi-Task Fine-tuning: We curate a comprehensive mixture of datasets categorized by functional primitives -- Planning, Acting, and Grounding -- establishing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with strong instruction-following capabilities for Web GUI tasks. 2) Online Agentic RL in the Wild: We develop an online interaction environment and fine-tune the VLM using a specialized RL pipeline. We introduce a Hybrid Reward Mechanism that combines a ground-truth-agnostic WebJudge for holistic outcome assessment with a Rule-based Decision Tree (RDT) for progress reward. This system effectively mitigates the credit assignment challenge in long-horizon navigation. Notably, our RL-enhanced model achieves a 38.1\% success rate (pass@5) on WebArena, outperforming all existing monolithic baselines. 3) Operator Agent: We introduce a modular agentic framework, namely \textbf{OpAgent}, orchestrating a Planner, Grounder, Reflector, and Summarizer. This synergy enables robust error recovery and self-correction, elevating the agent's performance to a new State-of-the-Art (SOTA) success rate of \textbf{71.6\%}.

Motivation: To understand if LLMs, like humans, are influenced by the credibility and consensus of information sources, particularly favoring human experts over other LLMs.

Method: Three binary decision-making tasks (reading comprehension, multi-step reasoning, moral judgment) were used. Four instruction-tuned LLMs were given prior responses labeled as from friends, human experts, or other LLMs, manipulating correctness and group size.

Result: LLMs conform significantly more to responses labeled as human experts, even when incorrect, and revise answers toward experts more than other LLMs.

Conclusion: Expert framing strongly influences LLMs, indicating credibility-sensitive social influence across decision domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in environments where they encounter social information such as other agents' answers, tool outputs, or human recommendations. In humans, such inputs influence judgments in ways that depend on the source's credibility and the strength of consensus. This paper investigates whether LLMs exhibit analogous patterns of influence and whether they privilege feedback from humans over feedback from other LLMs. Across three binary decision-making tasks, reading comprehension, multi-step reasoning, and moral judgment, we present four instruction-tuned LLMs with prior responses attributed either to friends, to human experts, or to other LLMs. We manipulate whether the group is correct and vary the group size. In a second experiment, we introduce direct disagreement between a single human and a single LLM. Across tasks, models conform significantly more to responses labeled as coming from human experts, including when that signal is incorrect, and revise their answers toward experts more readily than toward other LLMs. These results reveal that expert framing acts as a strong prior for contemporary LLMs, suggesting a form of credibility-sensitive social influence that generalizes across decision domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating a self-supervised clustering model with a differentiable ILP model to overcome challenges in learning rules from raw data without explicit label leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of differentiable ILP methods, which struggle with learning directly from raw data due to explicit label leakage.

Method: Combines a self-supervised differentiable clustering model with a novel differentiable ILP model to enable rule learning from raw data.

Result: The method successfully learns generalized rules from time series and image data intuitively and precisely.

Conclusion: The integration of self-supervised clustering and differentiable ILP effectively mitigates label leakage and enhances rule learning from raw data.

Abstract: Rule learning-based models are widely used in highly interpretable scenarios due to their transparent structures. Inductive logic programming (ILP), a form of machine learning, induces rules from facts while maintaining interpretability. Differentiable ILP models enhance this process by leveraging neural networks to improve robustness and scalability. However, most differentiable ILP methods rely on symbolic datasets, facing challenges when learning directly from raw data. Specifically, they struggle with explicit label leakage: The inability to map continuous inputs to symbolic variables without explicit supervision of input feature labels. In this work, we address this issue by integrating a self-supervised differentiable clustering model with a novel differentiable ILP model, enabling rule learning from raw data without explicit label leakage. The learned rules effectively describe raw data through its features. We demonstrate that our method intuitively and precisely learns generalized rules from time series and image data.

TL;DR: Hippocampus is a novel memory management system for AI agents, using binary signatures and token-ID streams for efficient search and reconstruction. It outperforms existing methods in speed and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory systems for AI agents suffer from high retrieval latency and poor scalability, limiting their effectiveness for long-horizon tasks.

Method: Hippocampus employs compact binary signatures for semantic search and token-ID streams for content reconstruction, indexed via a Dynamic Wavelet Matrix (DWM) for fast compressed-domain search.

Result: Hippocampus reduces retrieval latency by up to 31x and per-query token footprint by up to 14x while maintaining accuracy on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The system offers scalable, efficient memory management for agentic AI, addressing key limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Agentic AI require persistent memory to store user-specific histories beyond the limited context window of LLMs. Existing memory systems use dense vector databases or knowledge-graph traversal (or hybrid), incurring high retrieval latency and poor storage scalability. We introduce Hippocampus, an agentic memory management system that uses compact binary signatures for semantic search and lossless token-ID streams for exact content reconstruction. Its core is a Dynamic Wavelet Matrix (DWM) that compresses and co-indexes both streams to support ultra-fast search in the compressed domain, thus avoiding costly dense-vector or graph computations. This design scales linearly with memory size, making it suitable for long-horizon agentic deployments. Empirically, our evaluation shows that Hippocampus reduces end-to-end retrieval latency by up to 31$\times$ and cuts per-query token footprint by up to 14$\times$, while maintaining accuracy on both LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reveals a 'quantization trap' where reducing precision from 16-bit to 8/4-bit worsens energy efficiency and reasoning accuracy, breaking neural scaling laws due to hardware overheads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the 'smaller-is-better' heuristic in AI by investigating its impact on multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Method: Theoretical decomposition of hardware casting overhead and dequantization latency costs in sequential reasoning chains.

Result: Reducing precision leads to higher net energy consumption and degraded accuracy, making scaling laws impractical for complex reasoning.

Conclusion: The study suggests that lower precision is counterproductive for multi-hop reasoning, necessitating reevaluation of current industry practices.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws provide a predictable recipe for AI advancement: reducing numerical precision should linearly improve computational efficiency and energy profile (E proportional to bits). In this paper, we demonstrate that this scaling law breaks in the context of multi-hop reasoning. We reveal a 'quantization trap' where reducing precision from 16-bit to 8/4-bit paradoxically increases more net energy consumption while degrading reasoning accuracy. We provide a rigorous theoretical decomposition that attributes this failure to hardware casting overhead, the hidden latency cost of dequantization kernels, which becomes a dominant bottleneck in sequential reasoning chains, as well as to a sequential energy amortization failure. As a result, scaling law breaking is unavoidable in practice. Our findings suggest that the industry's "smaller-is-better" heuristic is mathematically counterproductive for complex reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: DiffusionRollout is a selective rollout strategy for autoregressive diffusion models to reduce error buildup in long-horizon PDE predictions, using uncertainty measures for adaptive step size selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address error accumulation in long-horizon predictions of PDE-governed systems by leveraging predictive uncertainty quantification.

Method: Proposes DiffusionRollout, which adaptively selects step sizes during autoregressive rollouts based on predictive confidence (measured by standard deviations).

Result: Validated on benchmarks, showing lower prediction errors and longer accurate trajectories compared to ground truths.

Conclusion: The adaptive planning strategy and uncertainty measure improve long-term prediction reliability in PDE systems.

Abstract: We propose DiffusionRollout, a novel selective rollout planning strategy for autoregressive diffusion models, aimed at mitigating error accumulation in long-horizon predictions of physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Building on the recently validated probabilistic approach to PDE solving, we further explore its ability to quantify predictive uncertainty and demonstrate a strong correlation between prediction errors and standard deviations computed over multiple samples-supporting their use as a proxy for the model's predictive confidence. Based on this observation, we introduce a mechanism that adaptively selects step sizes during autoregressive rollouts, improving long-term prediction reliability by reducing the compounding effect of conditioning on inaccurate prior outputs. Extensive evaluation on long-trajectory PDE prediction benchmarks validates the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty measure and adaptive planning strategy, as evidenced by lower prediction errors and longer predicted trajectories that retain a high correlation with their ground truths.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel MLLM-centered framework for GUI agents reduces computational costs and improves performance through agentic-Q estimation and step-wise policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome challenges of non-stationary environments and high computational costs in GUI agents by leveraging MLLMs.

Method: Introduces agentic-Q estimation to evaluate action contributions and step-wise policy optimization via reinforcement learning, using self-generated trajectories.

Result: Achieves superior GUI interaction capabilities, outperforming larger models on navigation and grounding benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework efficiently enhances GUI agent performance while reducing data curation and optimization costs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have substantially driven the progress of autonomous agents for Graphical User Interface (GUI). Nevertheless, in real-world applications, GUI agents are often faced with non-stationary environments, leading to high computational costs for data curation and policy optimization. In this report, we introduce a novel MLLM-centered framework for GUI agents, which consists of two components: agentic-Q estimation and step-wise policy optimization. The former one aims to optimize a Q-model that can generate step-wise values to evaluate the contribution of a given action to task completion. The latter one takes step-wise samples from the state-action trajectory as inputs, and optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning with our agentic-Q model. It should be noticed that (i) all state-action trajectories are produced by the policy itself, so that the data collection costs are manageable; (ii) the policy update is decoupled from the environment, ensuring stable and efficient optimization. Empirical evaluations show that our framework endows Ovis2.5-9B with powerful GUI interaction capabilities, achieving remarkable performances on GUI navigation and grounding benchmarks and even surpassing contenders with larger scales.

*Weibin Liao,Jian-guang Lou,Haoyi Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HyFunc is a framework that reduces computational redundancies in agentic AI systems by using a hybrid-model cascade and dynamic templating, achieving lower latency and high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic AI systems using LLMs suffer from computational redundancies, causing high latency and hindering real-time applications.

Method: HyFunc uses a hybrid-model cascade (large model distilled into a soft token guiding smaller models) and dynamic templating to eliminate syntactic redundancies.

Result: HyFunc achieves 0.828s inference latency (best among baselines) and 80.1% performance (tops comparable models).

Conclusion: HyFunc provides an efficient paradigm for agentic AI by balancing performance and speed.

Abstract: While agentic AI systems rely on LLMs to translate user intent into structured function calls, this process is fraught with computational redundancy, leading to high inference latency that hinders real-time applications. This paper identifies and addresses three key redundancies: (1) the redundant processing of a large library of function descriptions for every request; (2) the redundant use of a large, slow model to generate an entire, often predictable, token sequence; and (3) the redundant generation of fixed, boilerplate parameter syntax. We introduce HyFunc, a novel framework that systematically eliminates these inefficiencies. HyFunc employs a hybrid-model cascade where a large model distills user intent into a single "soft token." This token guides a lightweight retriever to select relevant functions and directs a smaller, prefix-tuned model to generate the final call, thus avoiding redundant context processing and full-sequence generation by the large model. To eliminate syntactic redundancy, our "dynamic templating" technique injects boilerplate parameter syntax on-the-fly within an extended vLLM engine. To avoid potential limitations in generalization, we evaluate HyFunc on an unseen benchmark dataset, BFCL. Experimental results demonstrate that HyFunc achieves an excellent balance between efficiency and performance. It achieves an inference latency of 0.828 seconds, outperforming all baseline models, and reaches a performance of 80.1%, surpassing all models with a comparable parameter scale. These results suggest that HyFunc offers a more efficient paradigm for agentic AI. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/MrBlankness/HyFunc.

TL;DR: AllMem, a hybrid architecture combining SWA and TTT memory networks, addresses LLMs' performance bottlenecks in long-sequence tasks by reducing computational complexity and memory overhead while maintaining near-lossless performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) face computational and memory inefficiencies in long-sequence tasks due to self-attention mechanisms. This paper aims to solve these issues.

Method: Introduces AllMem, integrating Sliding Window Attention (SWA) and non-linear Test-Time Training (TTT) memory networks, along with Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning to adapt pre-trained LLMs.

Result: The 4k window model achieves near-lossless performance (only 0.83 drop) on LongBench (37k), and the 8k variant outperforms full attention on InfiniteBench (128k).

Conclusion: AllMem effectively scales LLMs to ultra-long contexts, mitigates catastrophic forgetting, and reduces computational/memory costs while maintaining robust long-range modeling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter significant performance bottlenecks in long-sequence tasks due to the computational complexity and memory overhead inherent in the self-attention mechanism. To address these challenges, we introduce \textsc{AllMem}, a novel and efficient hybrid architecture that integrates Sliding Window Attention (SWA) with non-linear Test-Time Training (TTT) memory networks. \textsc{AllMem} enables models to effectively scale to ultra-long contexts while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. This approach not only overcomes the representation constraints typical of linear memory models but also significantly reduces the computational and memory footprint during long-sequence inference. Furthermore, we implement a Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning strategy to replace standard attention layers in pre-trained models with memory-augmented sliding window layers. This framework facilitates the efficient transformation of any off-the-shelf pre-trained LLM into an \textsc{AllMem}-based architecture. Empirical evaluations confirm that our 4k window model achieves near-lossless performance on 37k LongBench with a marginal 0.83 drop compared to full attention. Furthermore, on InfiniteBench at a 128k context, our 8k window variant outperforms full attention, which validates the effectiveness of our parameterized memory in mitigating noise and maintaining robust long-range modeling without the prohibitive costs of global attention.

TL;DR: PhGPO leverages historically successful tool-transition patterns to guide policy optimization, improving long-horizon tool planning in LLM agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon multi-step tool planning in LLM agents is challenging due to combinatorial explosion and lacks reusable information from successful paths.

Method: Proposes Pheromone-Guided Policy Optimization (PhGPO), which learns trajectory-based transition patterns (pheromone) from historical trajectories to guide policy optimization.

Result: PhGPO effectively improves long-horizon tool planning by providing reusable guidance from successful transitions.

Conclusion: PhGPO enhances LLM agent performance in complex tasks by leveraging reusable patterns from historical trajectories.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in executing complex tasks through tool use. However, long-horizon multi-step tool planning is challenging, because the exploration space suffers from a combinatorial explosion. In this scenario, even when a correct tool-use path is found, it is usually considered an immediate reward for current training, which would not provide any reusable information for subsequent training. In this paper, we argue that historically successful trajectories contain reusable tool-transition patterns, which can be leveraged throughout the whole training process. Inspired by ant colony optimization where historically successful paths can be reflected by the pheromone, we propose Pheromone-Guided Policy Optimization (PhGPO), which learns a trajectory-based transition pattern (i.e., pheromone) from historical trajectories and then uses the learned pheromone to guide policy optimization. This learned pheromone provides explicit and reusable guidance that steers policy optimization toward historically successful tool transitions, thereby improving long-horizon tool planning. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PhGPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of LLMs in solving sophisticated research-grade mathematical problems via lightweight, natural-language pipelines.

Method: Integration of models like Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5.2 Pro into an automated pipeline optimized for citation-based verification, evaluated on novel datasets (ICCM and 'First Proof').

Result: Pipeline generated candidate proofs for all problems in ICCM and 'First Proof' sets, with some fully verified and submitted.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively tackle research-grade math problems, with plans to open-source the pipeline methodology.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable success in generating rigorous mathematical proofs, with "AI for Math" emerging as a vibrant field of research. While these models have mastered competition-level benchmarks like the International Mathematical Olympiad and show promise in research applications through auto-formalization, their deployment via lightweight, natural-language pipelines for research problems remains underexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that next-generation models (e.g., Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.2 Pro), when integrated into a streamlined automated pipeline optimized for citation-based verification, can solve sophisticated research-grade problems. We evaluate our pipeline on two novel datasets: (1) the ICCM problem sets (comparable to the S.-T. Yau College Student Mathematics Contest) proposed by leading mathematicians, and (2) the "First Proof" problem set, consisting of previously unpublished research questions. Our pipeline generated candidate proofs for all problems in the first two ICCM sets and the "First Proof" set. The solutions for the first two ICCM sets and Problem 4 of the "First Proof" set have been fully verified by our team. All generated proofs have been submitted to the official organization, and our generated results are publicly available. We plan to open-source the complete pipeline methodology in due course.

*Linjie Xu,Yanlin Zhang,Quan Gan,Minjie Wang,David Wipf*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method for predicting quantities in relational databases without retraining, using in-context learning (ICL) and constrained column-specific compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To avoid the inefficiency of retraining models for each new prediction in relational databases by leveraging foundation models with ICL.

Method: Compresses RDB neighborhoods into fixed-length ICL samples within columns (not across) and pairs them with existing single-table ICL models without training.

Result: Develops a scalable, easy-to-use RDB foundation model with robust performance on unseen datasets.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient, label-free predictions in relational databases without compromising encoder expressiveness.

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) contain vast amounts of heterogeneous tabular information that can be exploited for predictive modeling purposes. But since the space of potential targets is vast across enterprise settings, how can we \textit{avoid retraining} a new model each time we wish to predict a new quantity of interest? Foundation models based on in-context learning (ICL) offer a convenient option, but so far are largely restricted to single-table operability. In generalizing to multiple interrelated tables, it is essential to compress variably-sized RDB neighborhoods into fixed-length ICL samples for consumption by the decoder. However, the details here are critical: unlike existing supervised learning RDB pipelines, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that ICL-specific compression should be constrained \emph{within} high-dimensional RDB columns where all entities share units and roles, not \textit{across} columns where the relevance of heterogeneous data types cannot possibly be determined without label information. Conditioned on this restriction, we then demonstrate that encoder expressiveness is actually not compromised by excluding trainable parameters. Hence we arrive at a principled family of RDB encoders that can be seamlessly paired with already-existing single-table ICL foundation models, whereby no training or fine-tuning is required. From a practical standpoint, we develop scalable SQL primitives to implement the encoder stage, resulting in an easy-to-use open-source RDB foundation model\footnote{\label{foot: RDBLearn_learn} https://github.com/HKUSHXLab/rdblearn} capable of robust performance on unseen datasets out of the box.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the high inference cost and verbosity of traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting while preserving reasoning accuracy.

Method: Uses supervision from rendered CoT images and DeepSeek-OCR hidden states to compress reasoning into a single latent token.

Result: Reduces output length by 11x with minimal accuracy drop (2.21%), improves OTC by 6.8x, and achieves high accuracy on logical reasoning tasks with up to 87.4x compression.

Conclusion: OneLatent effectively balances reasoning performance and efficiency, enabling high compression without significant accuracy loss.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning but often increases inference cost by one to two orders of magnitude. To address these challenges, we present \textbf{OneLatent}, a framework that compresses intermediate reasoning into a single latent token via supervision from rendered CoT images and DeepSeek-OCR hidden states. By rendering textual steps into images, we obtain a deterministic supervision signal that can be inspected and audited without requiring the model to output verbose textual rationales. Across benchmarks, OneLatent reduces average output length by $11\times$ with only a $2.21\%$ average accuracy drop relative to textual CoT, while improving output token contribution (OTC) by $6.8\times$. On long-chain logical reasoning, OneLatent reaches $99.80\%$ on ProntoQA and $97.80\%$ on ProsQA with one latent token, with compression up to $87.4\times$, supporting compression-constrained generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of iterative mutation in automated scientific discovery by introducing structured hypothesis management and principled reflection.

Method: OR-Agent uses a tree-based workflow for branching hypotheses, evolutionary-systematic ideation, and hierarchical reflection (short-term and long-term with memory compression).

Result: OR-Agent outperforms evolutionary baselines in combinatorial optimization and cooperative driving scenarios.

Conclusion: OR-Agent provides a general, extensible framework for AI-assisted discovery, combining evolutionary and systematic approaches with hierarchical reflection.

Abstract: Automating scientific discovery in complex, experiment-driven domains requires more than iterative mutation of programs; it demands structured hypothesis management, environment interaction, and principled reflection. We present OR-Agent, a configurable multi-agent research framework designed for automated exploration in rich experimental environments. OR-Agent organizes research as a structured tree-based workflow that explicitly models branching hypothesis generation and systematic backtracking, enabling controlled management of research trajectories beyond simple mutation-crossover loops. At its core, we introduce an evolutionary-systematic ideation mechanism that unifies evolutionary selection of research starting points, comprehensive research plan generation, and coordinated exploration within a research tree. We further propose a hierarchical optimization-inspired reflection system: short-term experimental reflection operates as a form of verbal gradient providing immediate corrective signals; long-term reflection accumulates cross-experiment insights as verbal momentum; and memory compression serves as a regularization mechanism analogous to weight decay, preserving essential signals while mitigating drift. Together, these components form a principled architecture governing research dynamics. We conduct extensive experiments across classical combinatorial optimization benchmarks-including traveling salesman, capacitated vehicle routing, bin packing, orienteering, and multiple knapsack problems-as well as simulation-based cooperative driving scenarios. Results demonstrate that OR-Agent outperforms strong evolutionary baselines while providing a general, extensible, and inspectable framework for AI-assisted scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the isolation of large foundation models and leverage their complementary strengths for building trustworthy intelligent systems.

Method: Uses StackingNet, a meta-ensemble framework based on collective intelligence, to combine predictions from heterogeneous models during inference.

Result: Improves accuracy, robustness, and fairness across tasks like language comprehension, visual estimation, and paper rating, outperforming individual models and classic ensembles.

Conclusion: StackingNet demonstrates that principled cooperation among specialized models can advance AI, highlighting progress beyond single large models.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence built on large foundation models has transformed language understanding, vision and reasoning, yet these systems remain isolated and cannot readily share their capabilities. Integrating the complementary strengths of such independent foundation models is essential for building trustworthy intelligent systems. Despite rapid progress in individual model design, there is no established approach for coordinating such black-box heterogeneous models. Here we show that coordination can be achieved through a meta-ensemble framework termed StackingNet, which draws on principles of collective intelligence to combine model predictions during inference. StackingNet improves accuracy, reduces bias, enables reliability ranking, and identifies or prunes models that degrade performance, all operating without access to internal parameters or training data. Across tasks involving language comprehension, visual estimation, and academic paper rating, StackingNet consistently improves accuracy, robustness, and fairness, compared with individual models and classic ensembles. By turning diversity from a source of inconsistency into collaboration, StackingNet establishes a practical foundation for coordinated artificial intelligence, suggesting that progress may emerge from not only larger single models but also principled cooperation among many specialized ones.

*Vashista Nobaub*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vashista Sparse Attention, a mechanism leveraging face-stability theory to enable efficient, sparse decoding in long-context settings by focusing on a constant-size active subset of tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional attention mechanisms inefficiently compute over long contexts, despite empirical evidence suggesting only a few tokens are relevant per query.

Method: The authors model attention as a projection onto a convex hull of key vectors, analyze entropic relaxation, and propose Vashista Sparse Attention, which maintains a small candidate set per query.

Result: Theoretical guarantees show exponential decay of mass on inactive tokens and linear error scaling on active tokens, validated by stable performance and speedups in evaluations.

Conclusion: Vashista Sparse Attention offers predictable latency and compute savings in privacy-sensitive or air-gapped settings, making long-context decoding feasible.

Abstract: Large language models spend most of their inference cost on attention over long contexts, yet empirical behavior suggests that only a small subset of tokens meaningfully contributes to each query. We formalize this phenomenon by modeling attention as a projection onto the convex hull of key vectors and analyzing its entropic (softmax-like) relaxation. Our main theoretical contribution is a face-stability theorem showing that, under a strict complementarity margin (a support gap (Δ) certified by KKT multipliers), entropic attention concentrates on a constant-size active face: the total mass assigned to inactive tokens decays exponentially as (\exp(-Ω(Δ/\varepsilon))), while the error on the active face scales linearly in the temperature/regularization parameter (\varepsilon). This yields a practical criterion for when sparse long-context decoding is safe and provides a principled knob to trade accuracy for compute.
  Building on these guarantees, we introduce Vashista Sparse Attention, a drop-in mechanism that maintains a small candidate set per query through a paging-style context selection strategy compatible with modern inference stacks. Across long-context evaluations, we observe stable constant-size effective support, strong wall-clock speedups, and minimal quality degradation in the regimes predicted by the support-gap diagnostics. Finally, we discuss deployment implications for privacy-sensitive and air-gapped settings, where interchangeable attention modules enable predictable latency and cost without external retrieval dependencies.

Result: The pipeline produces structured artifacts with provenance metadata, quantifies alignment with ground-truth implementations, and identifies systematic errors.

Conclusion: This framework offers a reproducible benchmark for evaluating smart contract synthesis quality, supporting future extensions.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation of LLM-generated smart contracts from natural-language specifications. The system parses contractual text into structured schemas, generates Solidity code, and performs automated quality assessment through compilation and security checks. Using CrewAI-style agent teams with iterative refinement, the pipeline produces structured artifacts with full provenance metadata. Quality is measured across five dimensions, including functional completeness, variable fidelity, state-machine correctness, business-logic fidelity, and code quality aggregated into composite scores. The framework supports paired evaluation against ground-truth implementations, quantifying alignment and identifying systematic error modes such as logic omissions and state transition inconsistencies. This provides a reproducible benchmark for empirical research on smart contract synthesis quality and supports extensions to formal verification and compliance checking.

Conclusion: The framework enhances experimentation efficiency, interpretability, and scalability, as demonstrated by its adoption and performance.

Abstract: Modern online experimentation faces two bottlenecks: scarce traffic forces tough choices on which variants to test, and post-hoc insight extraction is manual, inconsistent, and often content-agnostic. Meanwhile, organizations underuse historical A/B results and rich content embeddings that could guide prioritization and creative iteration. We present a unified framework to (i) prioritize which variants to test, (ii) explain why winners win, and (iii) surface targeted opportunities for new, higher-potential variants. Leveraging treatment embeddings and historical outcomes, we train a CTR ranking model with fixed effects for contextual shifts that scores candidates while balancing value and content diversity. For better interpretability and understanding, we project treatments onto curated semantic marketing attributes and re-express the ranker in this space via a sign-consistent, sparse constrained Lasso, yielding per-attribute coefficients and signed contributions for visual explanations, top-k drivers, and natural-language insights. We then compute an opportunity index combining attribute importance (from the ranker) with under-expression in the current experiment to flag missing, high-impact attributes. Finally, LLMs translate ranked opportunities into concrete creative suggestions and estimate both learning and conversion potential, enabling faster, more informative, and more efficient test cycles. These components have been built into a real Adobe product, called \textit{Experimentation Accelerator}, to provide AI-based insights and opportunities to scale experimentation for customers. We provide an evaluation of the performance of the proposed framework on some real-world experiments by Adobe business customers that validate the high quality of the generation pipeline.

*Gabriel Romio,Mateus Begnini Melchiades,Bruno Castro da Silva,Gabriel de Oliveira Ramos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOC-2HER improves Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning by integrating dual goal relabeling with Hindsight Experience Replay, achieving high success rates in sparse reward tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HRL methods like Option-Critic and Multi-updates Option Critic struggle in multi-goal environments with sparse rewards, especially in object manipulation tasks where rewards depend on object outcomes.

Method: Proposes MOC-HER (integrating HER into MOC) and further extends it with Dual Objectives Hindsight Experience Replay (2HER), which creates two sets of virtual goals: one based on the object's final state and another on the agent's effector positions.

Result: MOC-2HER achieves success rates up to 90% in robotic manipulation tasks, significantly outperforming MOC (<11%) and MOC-HER (<11%).

Conclusion: The dual objective relabeling strategy in MOC-2HER effectively addresses sparse reward challenges in multi-goal environments, particularly in object manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) frameworks like Option-Critic (OC) and Multi-updates Option Critic (MOC) have introduced significant advancements in learning reusable options. However, these methods underperform in multi-goal environments with sparse rewards, where actions must be linked to temporally distant outcomes. To address this limitation, we first propose MOC-HER, which integrates the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism into the MOC framework. By relabeling goals from achieved outcomes, MOC-HER can solve sparse reward environments that are intractable for the original MOC. However, this approach is insufficient for object manipulation tasks, where the reward depends on the object reaching the goal rather than on the agent's direct interaction. This makes it extremely difficult for HRL agents to discover how to interact with these objects. To overcome this issue, we introduce Dual Objectives Hindsight Experience Replay (2HER), a novel extension that creates two sets of virtual goals. In addition to relabeling goals based on the object's final state (standard HER), 2HER also generates goals from the agent's effector positions, rewarding the agent for both interacting with the object and completing the task. Experimental results in robotic manipulation environments show that MOC-2HER achieves success rates of up to 90%, compared to less than 11% for both MOC and MOC-HER. These results highlight the effectiveness of our dual objective relabeling strategy in sparse reward, multi-goal tasks.

*Harris Abdul Majid,Giannis Daras,Francesco Tudisco,Steven McDonagh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ambient Physics is a framework for learning joint distributions of PDE coefficient-solution pairs from partial observations, eliminating the need for complete training data. It outperforms diffusion-based methods with significantly lower error and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complete observations of PDE coefficients and solutions are often impractical. Existing methods rely on complete training data, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios.

Method: Ambient Physics trains models by randomly masking already-observed measurements, forcing the model to predict plausibly everywhere. This approach avoids needing any complete observations.

Result: Achieves a 62.51% reduction in average error and uses 125x fewer function evaluations compared to diffusion-based methods. Also identifies a "one-point transition" phenomenon.

Conclusion: Ambient Physics enables scientific progress in settings with incomplete observations, outperforming existing methods and offering computational efficiency.

Abstract: In many scientific settings, acquiring complete observations of PDE coefficients and solutions can be expensive, hazardous, or impossible. Recent diffusion-based methods can reconstruct fields given partial observations, but require complete observations for training. We introduce Ambient Physics, a framework for learning the joint distribution of coefficient-solution pairs directly from partial observations, without requiring a single complete observation. The key idea is to randomly mask a subset of already-observed measurements and supervise on them, so the model cannot distinguish "truly unobserved" from "artificially unobserved", and must produce plausible predictions everywhere. Ambient Physics achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance. Compared with prior diffusion-based methods, it achieves a 62.51$\%$ reduction in average overall error while using 125$\times$ fewer function evaluations. We also identify a "one-point transition": masking a single already-observed point enables learning from partial observations across architectures and measurement patterns. Ambient Physics thus enables scientific progress in settings where complete observations are unavailable.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VSAL introduces an adaptive layout generator for dynamic graph visualizations, enhancing graph property detection over fixed-layout methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed visual graph layouts limit expressiveness in existing vision-based graph property detection methods.

Method: VSAL uses an adaptive layout generator to create tailored visualizations for individual graphs.

Result: VSAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in tasks like Hamiltonian cycle detection.

Conclusion: Adaptive layouts improve vision-based graph property detection, making VSAL superior.

Abstract: Graph property detection aims to determine whether a graph exhibits certain structural properties, such as being Hamiltonian. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown great promise by leveraging data-driven models to detect graph properties efficiently. In particular, vision-based methods offer a visually intuitive solution by processing the visualizations of graphs. However, existing vision-based methods rely on fixed visual graph layouts, and therefore, the expressiveness of their pipeline is restricted. To overcome this limitation, we propose VSAL, a vision-based framework that incorporates an adaptive layout generator capable of dynamically producing informative graph visualizations tailored to individual instances, thereby improving graph property detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VSAL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-based methods on various tasks such as Hamiltonian cycle, planarity, claw-freeness, and tree detection.

TL;DR: The paper examines failure modes in Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs, identifies three pathologies, and proposes simple, task-agnostic metrics to detect them for improved AI safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT reasoning is crucial for LLMs but can fail in ways that make monitoring difficult. Understanding these pathologies is key to ensuring AI safety.

Method: The authors identify three CoT pathologies and develop straightforward, computationally inexpensive metrics to detect them. They validate these metrics using models trained to exhibit specific pathologies.

Result: The study successfully creates a toolkit for assessing CoT pathologies, enabling better training-time monitoring.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics provide a practical solution for detecting CoT reasoning failures, enhancing AI safety and monitoring.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is fundamental to modern LLM architectures and represents a critical intervention point for AI safety. However, CoT reasoning may exhibit failure modes that we note as pathologies, which prevent it from being useful for monitoring. Prior work has identified three distinct pathologies: post-hoc rationalization, where models generate plausible explanations backwards from predetermined answers; encoded reasoning, where intermediate steps conceal information within seemingly interpretable text; and internalized reasoning, where models replace explicit reasoning with meaningless filler tokens while computing internally. To better understand and discriminate between these pathologies, we create a set of concrete metrics that are simple to implement, computationally inexpensive, and task-agnostic. To validate our approach, we develop model organisms deliberately trained to exhibit specific CoT pathologies. Our work provides a practical toolkit for assessing CoT pathologies, with direct implications for training-time monitoring.

TL;DR: LaySPA is a reinforcement learning framework enhancing LLMs for interpretable spatial reasoning in layout design, addressing opacity and spatial limitations through structured textual environments and multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle LLMs' lack of spatial reasoning and opaque decision-making in graphic layout design.

Method: Reformulates layout design as policy learning over structured textual spatial environments, using multi-objective spatial critique and relative group optimization.

Result: Improves structural validity and visual quality, outperforming larger LLMs and matching specialized SOTA generators with fewer samples and lower latency.

Conclusion: LaySPA effectively enhances LLMs for transparent and controllable layout design, achieving competitive performance efficiently.

Abstract: We introduce LaySPA, a reinforcement learning framework that equips large language models (LLMs) with explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for content-aware graphic layout design. LaySPA addresses two key challenges: LLMs' limited spatial reasoning and the lack of opacity in design decision making. Instead of operating at the pixel level, we reformulate layout design as a policy learning problem over a structured textual spatial environment that explicitly encodes canvas geometry, element attributes, and inter-element relationships. LaySPA produces dual-level outputs comprising interpretable reasoning traces and structured layout specifications, enabling transparent and controllable design decision making. Layout design policy is optimized via a multi-objective spatial critique that decomposes layout quality into geometric validity, relational coherence, and aesthetic consistency, and is trained using relative group optimization to stabilize learning in open-ended design spaces. Experiments demonstrate that LaySPA improves structural validity and visual quality, outperforming larger proprietary LLMs and achieving performance comparable to specialized SOTA layout generators while requiring fewer annotated samples and reduced latency.

*Xiaochen Zhao,Kaikai Wang,Xiaowen Zhang,Chen Yao,Aili Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HyMem is a hybrid memory architecture for LLMs that improves efficiency and effectiveness in long dialogues by dynamically managing memory at multiple granularities, outperforming existing methods with significant computational savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inefficiency of current LLM memory management in extended dialogues, where existing methods either lose critical details or introduce unnecessary overhead. The goal is to emulate human-like flexible memory scheduling.

Method: HyMem uses a dual-granular storage scheme and dynamic two-tier retrieval: a lightweight module handles summary-level contexts efficiently, while an LLM-based deep module activates selectively for complex queries, aided by reflection for iterative refinement.

Result: HyMem outperforms full-context methods on LOCOMO and LongMemEval benchmarks, reducing computational costs by 92.6% while maintaining high performance.

Conclusion: HyMem sets a new standard for balancing efficiency and effectiveness in long-term memory management for LLMs, leveraging multi-granular memory representations and dynamic retrieval.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents demonstrate strong performance in short-text contexts but often underperform in extended dialogues due to inefficient memory management. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness: memory compression risks losing critical details required for complex reasoning, while retaining raw text introduces unnecessary computational overhead for simple queries. The crux lies in the limitations of monolithic memory representations and static retrieval mechanisms, which fail to emulate the flexible and proactive memory scheduling capabilities observed in humans, thus struggling to adapt to diverse problem scenarios. Inspired by the principle of cognitive economy, we propose HyMem, a hybrid memory architecture that enables dynamic on-demand scheduling through multi-granular memory representations. HyMem adopts a dual-granular storage scheme paired with a dynamic two-tier retrieval system: a lightweight module constructs summary-level context for efficient response generation, while an LLM-based deep module is selectively activated only for complex queries, augmented by a reflection mechanism for iterative reasoning refinement. Experiments show that HyMem achieves strong performance on both the LOCOMO and LongMemEval benchmarks, outperforming full-context while reducing computational cost by 92.6\%, establishing a state-of-the-art balance between efficiency and performance in long-term memory management.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces early stopping methods to prevent LLMs from overthinking by monitoring uncertainty signals during generation, improving efficiency and reliability in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate unnecessary reasoning steps under uncertainty or ambiguous queries, which can reduce efficiency and reliability.

Method: Two early stopping methods are proposed: a parametric approach modeling uncertainty keyword inter-arrival times as a renewal process and a nonparametric approach with finite-sample guarantees.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that uncertainty-aware early stopping enhances efficiency and reliability, with notable improvements in math reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The introduced early stopping methods effectively mitigate overthinking in LLMs, especially under uncertainty, leading to better performance in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While LLMs have seen substantial improvement in reasoning capabilities, they also sometimes overthink, generating unnecessary reasoning steps, particularly under uncertainty, given ill-posed or ambiguous queries. We introduce statistically principled early stopping methods that monitor uncertainty signals during generation to mitigate this issue. Our first approach is parametric: it models inter-arrival times of uncertainty keywords as a renewal process and applies sequential testing for stopping. Our second approach is nonparametric and provides finite-sample guarantees on the probability of halting too early on well-posed queries. We conduct empirical evaluations on reasoning tasks across several domains and models. Our results indicate that uncertainty-aware early stopping can improve both efficiency and reliability in LLM reasoning, and we observe especially significant gains for math reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance zero-shot generalization in trajectory prediction by incorporating domain-invariant knowledge.

Method: Introduces PCM with Disentangled Scene Encoder and CausalODE Decoder.

Result: Superior zero-shot performance in unseen cities, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: PCM effectively integrates kinematics and causality for improved generalization.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for traffic agents is critical for safe autonomous driving. However, achieving effective zero-shot generalization in previously unseen domains remains a significant challenge. Motivated by the consistent nature of kinematics across diverse domains, we aim to incorporate domain-invariant knowledge to enhance zero-shot trajectory prediction capabilities. The key challenges include: 1) effectively extracting domain-invariant scene representations, and 2) integrating invariant features with kinematic models to enable generalized predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel generalizable Physics-guided Causal Model (PCM), which comprises two core components: a Disentangled Scene Encoder, which adopts intervention-based disentanglement to extract domain-invariant features from scenes, and a CausalODE Decoder, which employs a causal attention mechanism to effectively integrate kinematic models with meaningful contextual information. Extensive experiments on real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our method's superior zero-shot generalization performance in unseen cities, significantly outperforming competitive baselines.

*Ruicheng Zhang,Xinyi Li,Tianyi Xu,Shuhao Zhang,Xiaofei Liao,Hai Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neuromem benchmarks External Memory Modules in streaming settings, analyzing lifecycle dimensions and performance across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of External Memory Modules assume static memory, but real-world scenarios involve continuous updates and interleaved operations. Neuromem addresses this gap.

Method: Neuromem uses an interleaved insertion-and-retrieval protocol, decomposing the memory lifecycle into five dimensions and evaluating variants across three datasets.

Result: Performance degrades as memory grows; time-related queries are hardest. Memory structure defines quality limits, while compression and integration trade cost for limited accuracy.

Conclusion: Neuromem provides insights into streaming memory challenges, highlighting the impact of structure and lifecycle policies on performance.

Abstract: Most evaluations of External Memory Module assume a static setting: memory is built offline and queried at a fixed state. In practice, memory is streaming: new facts arrive continuously, insertions interleave with retrievals, and the memory state evolves while the model is serving queries. In this regime, accuracy and cost are governed by the full memory lifecycle, which encompasses the ingestion, maintenance, retrieval, and integration of information into generation. We present Neuromem, a scalable testbed that benchmarks External Memory Modules under an interleaved insertion-and-retrieval protocol and decomposes its lifecycle into five dimensions including memory data structure, normalization strategy, consolidation policy, query formulation strategy, and context integration mechanism. Using three representative datasets LOCOMO, LONGMEMEVAL, and MEMORYAGENTBENCH, Neuromem evaluates interchangeable variants within a shared serving stack, reporting token-level F1 and insertion/retrieval latency. Overall, we observe that performance typically degrades as memory grows across rounds, and time-related queries remain the most challenging category. The memory data structure largely determines the attainable quality frontier, while aggressive compression and generative integration mechanisms mostly shift cost between insertion and retrieval with limited accuracy gain.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PIC (Parallelized Iterative Compression) improves context compression for LLMs by restricting memory tokens to local chunks, enhancing performance and reducing training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lengthy contexts increase LLM inference latency; existing compression methods require capturing global dependencies and extensive data.

Method: PIC modifies the Transformer's attention mask to limit memory tokens to sequential local chunks, simplifying compressor training.

Result: PIC outperforms baselines, especially at high compression ratios (e.g., 29.8% F1 and 40.7% EM improvements at 64×), and reduces training time by ~40%.

Conclusion: PIC offers an efficient, effective solution for context compression in LLMs, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Providing extensive context via prompting is vital for leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, lengthy contexts significantly increase inference latency, as the computational cost of self-attention grows quadratically with sequence length. To mitigate this issue, context compression-particularly soft prompt compressio-has emerged as a widely studied solution, which converts long contexts into shorter memory embeddings via a trained compressor. Existing methods typically compress the entire context indiscriminately into a set of memory tokens, requiring the compressor to capture global dependencies and necessitating extensive pre-training data to learn effective patterns. Inspired by the chunking mechanism in human working memory and empirical observations of the spatial specialization of memory embeddings relative to original tokens, we propose Parallelized Iterative Compression (PIC). By simply modifying the Transformer's attention mask, PIC explicitly restricts the receptive field of memory tokens to sequential local chunks, thereby lowering the difficulty of compressor training. Experiments across multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that PIC consistently outperforms competitive baselines, with superiority being particularly pronounced in high compression scenarios (e.g., achieving relative improvements of 29.8\% in F1 score and 40.7\% in EM score on QA tasks at the $64\times$ compression ratio). Furthermore, PIC significantly expedites the training process. Specifically, when training the 16$\times$ compressor, it surpasses the peak performance of the competitive baseline while effectively reducing the training time by approximately 40\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models often miss critical symptoms despite accurate predictions, leading to mistrust and limited adoption in clinical settings.

Method: The paper leverages formal abductive explanations to provide minimal sufficient feature sets, ensuring consistent and transparent reasoning.

Result: The approach maintains predictive accuracy while offering clinically actionable insights.

Conclusion: This framework enhances trustworthiness and interpretability of AI in medical diagnostics, aligning it with clinical reasoning.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated strong potential in clinical diagnostics, often achieving accuracy comparable to or exceeding that of human experts. A key challenge, however, is that AI reasoning frequently diverges from structured clinical frameworks, limiting trust, interpretability, and adoption. Critical symptoms, pivotal for rapid and accurate decision-making, may be overlooked by AI models even when predictions are correct. Existing post hoc explanation methods provide limited transparency and lack formal guarantees. To address this, we leverage formal abductive explanations, which offer consistent, guaranteed reasoning over minimal sufficient feature sets. This enables a clear understanding of AI decision-making and allows alignment with clinical reasoning. Our approach preserves predictive accuracy while providing clinically actionable insights, establishing a robust framework for trustworthy AI in medical diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deployment of LAMs at the edge faces challenges like inflexibility, excessive computational/memory demands, and static pipelines, limiting real-time adaptability.

Method: P2AECF converts semantic prompts into executable workflows via prompt-defined cognition, agent-based modular execution, and diffusion-controlled inference planning.

Result: The framework enables flexible, efficient, and adaptive edge intelligence, demonstrated through a low-altitude intelligent network use case.

Conclusion: P2AECF successfully enhances edge intelligence by addressing key deployment challenges of LAMs.

Abstract: The large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) show strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and multi-modal understanding, and can enable advanced capabilities in low-altitude edge intelligence. However, the deployment of LAMs at the edge remains constrained by some fundamental limitations. First, tasks are rigidly tied to specific models, limiting the flexibility. Besides, the computational and memory demands of full-scale LAMs exceed the capacity of most edge devices. Moreover, the current inference pipelines are typically static, making it difficult to respond to real-time changes of tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a prompt-to-agent edge cognition framework (P2AECF), enabling the flexible, efficient, and adaptive edge intelligence. Specifically, P2AECF transforms high-level semantic prompts into executable reasoning workflows through three key mechanisms. First, the prompt-defined cognition parses task intent into abstract and model-agnostic representations. Second, the agent-based modular execution instantiates these tasks using lightweight and reusable cognitive agents dynamically selected based on current resource conditions. Third, the diffusion-controlled inference planning adaptively constructs and refines execution strategies by incorporating runtime feedback and system context. In addition, we illustrate the framework through a representative low-altitude intelligent network use case, showing its ability to deliver adaptive, modular, and scalable edge intelligence for real-time low-altitude aerial collaborations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome LLMs' lack of explicit flowchart topology representation and their tendency for hallucinations in flowchart reasoning for dialogue systems.

Method: Proposes FloCA, which uses an LLM for intent understanding and response generation while outsourcing flowchart reasoning to an external tool. Introduces an evaluation framework with metrics for reasoning accuracy and interaction efficiency.

Result: Experiments on FLODIAL and PFDial datasets show FloCA's superiority over existing LLM-based methods, highlighting their bottlenecks.

Conclusion: FloCA effectively addresses LLM limitations in flowchart-oriented dialogue systems, ensuring faithful and logically consistent reasoning.

Abstract: Flowchart-oriented dialogue (FOD) systems aim to guide users through multi-turn decision-making or operational procedures by following a domain-specific flowchart to achieve a task goal. In this work, we formalize flowchart reasoning in FOD as grounding user input to flowchart nodes at each dialogue turn while ensuring node transition is consistent with the correct flowchart path. Despite recent advances of LLMs in task-oriented dialogue systems, adapting them to FOD still faces two limitations: (1) LLMs lack an explicit mechanism to represent and reason over flowchart topology, and (2) they are prone to hallucinations, leading to unfaithful flowchart reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose FloCA, a zero-shot flowchart-oriented conversational agent. FloCA uses an LLM for intent understanding and response generation while delegating flowchart reasoning to an external tool that performs topology-constrained graph execution, ensuring faithful and logically consistent node transitions across dialogue turns. We further introduce an evaluation framework with an LLM-based user simulator and five new metrics covering reasoning accuracy and interaction efficiency. Extensive experiments on FLODIAL and PFDial datasets highlight the bottlenecks of existing LLM-based methods and demonstrate the superiority of FloCA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent memory systems lack adaptability and context-awareness, limiting performance in heterogeneous interactions.

Method: FluxMem uses a unified framework with multiple memory structures, offline supervision for selection, a three-level hierarchy, and Beta Mixture Model-based fusion.

Result: Achieves average improvements of 9.18% on PERSONAMEM and 6.14% on LoCoMo benchmarks.

Conclusion: FluxMem enhances LLM agents' memory adaptability and performance in long-horizon interactions.

Abstract: Memory is critical for enabling large language model (LLM) based agents to maintain coherent behavior over long-horizon interactions. However, existing agent memory systems suffer from two key gaps: they rely on a one-size-fits-all memory structure and do not model memory structure selection as a context-adaptive decision, limiting their ability to handle heterogeneous interaction patterns and resulting in suboptimal performance. We propose a unified framework, FluxMem, that enables adaptive memory organization for LLM agents. Our framework equips agents with multiple complementary memory structures. It explicitly learns to select among these structures based on interaction-level features, using offline supervision derived from downstream response quality and memory utilization. To support robust long-horizon memory evolution, we further introduce a three-level memory hierarchy and a Beta Mixture Model-based probabilistic gate for distribution-aware memory fusion, replacing brittle similarity thresholds. Experiments on two long-horizon benchmarks, PERSONAMEM and LoCoMo, demonstrate that our method achieves average improvements of 9.18% and 6.14%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the REAL framework to address knowledge conflicts in KI-VQA using reasoning-pivots, improving accuracy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KI-VQA paradigms struggle with knowledge conflicts due to lack of generalizable conflict detection and mitigation mechanisms.

Method: REAL uses Reasoning-Pivot Aware SFT (RPA-SFT) for training a discriminator and Reasoning-Pivot Guided Decoding (RPGD) for conflict mitigation.

Result: REAL improves discrimination accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks.

Conclusion: The pivot-driven approach effectively resolves knowledge conflicts in KI-VQA.

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (KI-VQA) frequently suffers from severe knowledge conflicts caused by the inherent limitations of open-domain retrieval. However, existing paradigms face critical limitations due to the lack of generalizable conflict detection and intra-model constraint mechanisms to handle conflicting evidence. To address these challenges, we propose the REAL (Reasoning-Pivot Alignment) framework centered on the novel concept of the Reasoning-Pivot. Distinct from reasoning steps that prioritize internal self-derivation, a reasoning-pivot serves as an atomic unit (node or edge) in the reasoning chain that emphasizes knowledge linkage, and it typically relies on external evidence to complete the reasoning. Supported by our constructed REAL-VQA dataset, our approach integrates Reasoning-Pivot Aware SFT (RPA-SFT) to train a generalizable discriminator by aligning conflicts with pivot extraction, and employs Reasoning-Pivot Guided Decoding (RPGD), an intra-model decoding strategy that leverages these pivots for targeted conflict mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that REAL significantly enhances discrimination accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our pivot-driven resolution paradigm.

TL;DR: Plan-MCTS improves web navigation by using a semantic Plan Space, decoupling planning from execution, and enhancing efficiency and robustness with dual-gating rewards and structural refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in web navigation with LLMs: sparse valid paths and noisy context, leading to inefficient exploration and inaccurate state perception.

Method: Introduces Plan-MCTS, reformulating navigation via a semantic Plan Space, decoupling planning from execution, and using Dual-Gating Reward and Structural Refinement for validation and repair.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebArena, with higher task effectiveness and search efficiency than current approaches.

Conclusion: Plan-MCTS successfully transforms sparse action space into a Dense Plan Tree and distills noisy contexts for precise state awareness, enhancing web navigation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered autonomous agents to handle complex web navigation tasks. While recent studies integrate tree search to enhance long-horizon reasoning, applying these algorithms in web navigation faces two critical challenges: sparse valid paths that lead to inefficient exploration, and a noisy context that dilutes accurate state perception. To address this, we introduce Plan-MCTS, a framework that reformulates web navigation by shifting exploration to a semantic Plan Space. By decoupling strategic planning from execution grounding, it transforms sparse action space into a Dense Plan Tree for efficient exploration, and distills noisy contexts into an Abstracted Semantic History for precise state awareness. To ensure efficiency and robustness, Plan-MCTS incorporates a Dual-Gating Reward to strictly validate both physical executability and strategic alignment and Structural Refinement for on-policy repair of failed subplans. Extensive experiments on WebArena demonstrate that Plan-MCTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current approaches with higher task effectiveness and search efficiency.

TL;DR: GUI-GENESIS is a framework that creates lightweight, efficient GUI training environments with verifiable rewards, addressing latency, reproducibility, and reward noise issues in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges like high latency and noisy rewards in training GUI agents on real-world applications.

Method: GUI-GENESIS synthesizes training environments using multimodal code models, providing code-native rewards for deterministic feedback.

Result: Reduces latency by 10x, cuts costs by $28k per epoch, and improves agent performance by up to 14.54%.

Conclusion: GUI-GENESIS enables efficient, scalable training and shows potential for self-improving agents.

Abstract: Post-training GUI agents in interactive environments is critical for developing generalization and long-horizon planning capabilities. However, training on real-world applications is hindered by high latency, poor reproducibility, and unverifiable rewards relying on noisy visual proxies. To address the limitations, we present GUI-GENESIS, the first framework to automatically synthesize efficient GUI training environments with verifiable rewards. GUI-GENESIS reconstructs real-world applications into lightweight web environments using multimodal code models and equips them with code-native rewards, executable assertions that provide deterministic reward signals and eliminate visual estimation noise. Extensive experiments show that GUI-GENESIS reduces environment latency by 10 times and costs by over $28,000 per epoch compared to training on real applications. Notably, agents trained with GUI-GENESIS outperform the base model by 14.54% and even real-world RL baselines by 3.27% on held-out real-world tasks. Finally, we observe that models can synthesize environments they cannot yet solve, highlighting a pathway for self-improving agents.

*Artem Karpov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates steganographic chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs, assessing risks and evasion capabilities across 28 models, revealing limited success in complex tasks but highlighting emerging risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLMs can hide reasoning within text, compromising safety oversight, and inform risk assessment for deployment.

Method: Systematic evaluation of steganographic capabilities across 28 models, measuring evasion, refusal rates, fidelity, and hidden task accuracy using four datasets.

Result: Current models struggle with complex tasks but show potential in simpler ones (e.g., Claude Opus 4.5 achieved 92% accuracy in counting); rare cases of GPT-5.2 compliance-refusal observed.

Conclusion: Continuous evaluation of steganographic risks is crucial; the study offers a methodology to detect and prevent hidden reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Monitoring chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is a foundational safety technique for large language model (LLM) agents; however, this oversight is compromised if models learn to conceal their reasoning. We explore the potential for steganographic CoT -- where models hide secret reasoning within innocuous text -- to inform risk assessment and deployment policies. We systematically evaluate the limits of steganographic capabilities across 28 models, ranging from past generations to the current frontier. We measure monitor evasion, refusal rates, encoding fidelity, and hidden task accuracy across four datasets, comparing steganographic acrostics against plain reasoning and filler-token baselines. We find that current models cannot yet sustain hidden reasoning for complex math and arithmetic tasks. However, in a simplified counting experiment, Claude Opus 4.5 achieved 92% accuracy on the hidden task, demonstrating nascent capability. Notably, in rare cases (<1%), GPT-5.2 might refuse steganographic instructions while simultaneously complying with them. Our findings underscore the need for continuous evaluation of steganographic risks. This study provides a methodology to preemptively detect and prevent hidden reasoning that might empower misaligned scheming and deceptive behavior.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Algebraic Quantum Intelligence (AQI), a framework inspired by quantum theory to enhance LLMs' creativity by expanding semantic space, outperforming baselines across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with genuine creativity due to deterministic constraints in generation; AQI aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: AQI uses noncommutative algebraic structures and Hilbert space vectors, implemented via 600+ operators in a transformer LLM.

Result: AQI significantly improves performance on creative reasoning benchmarks, reducing cross-domain variance.

Conclusion: AQI provides a reproducible foundation for machine creativity and is already deployed in enterprise settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in generating fluent and contextually appropriate text; however, their capacity to produce genuinely creative outputs remains limited. This paper posits that this limitation arises from a structural property of contemporary LLMs: when provided with rich context, the space of future generations becomes strongly constrained, and the generation process is effectively governed by near-deterministic dynamics. Recent approaches such as test-time scaling and context adaptation improve performance but do not fundamentally alter this constraint. To address this issue, we propose Algebraic Quantum Intelligence (AQI) as a computational framework that enables systematic expansion of semantic space. AQI is formulated as a noncommutative algebraic structure inspired by quantum theory, allowing properties such as order dependence, interference, and uncertainty to be implemented in a controlled and designable manner. Semantic states are represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, and their evolution is governed by C-values computed from noncommutative operators, thereby ensuring the coexistence and expansion of multiple future semantic possibilities. In this study, we implement AQI by extending a transformer-based LLM with more than 600 specialized operators. We evaluate the resulting system on creative reasoning benchmarks spanning ten domains under an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. The results show that AQI consistently outperforms strong baseline models, yielding statistically significant improvements and reduced cross-domain variance. These findings demonstrate that noncommutative algebraic dynamics can serve as a practical and reproducible foundation for machine creativity. Notably, this architecture has already been deployed in real-world enterprise environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'ForesightSafety Bench,' a comprehensive AI safety evaluation framework addressing 94 risk dimensions across fundamental and advanced domains, revealing widespread vulnerabilities in frontier AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety evaluation systems are limited in detecting unpredictable and irreversible risks posed by advanced AI autonomy.

Method: The framework starts with 7 fundamental safety pillars and expands to advanced domains, accumulating tens of thousands of structured risk assessments.

Result: Evaluation of over twenty mainstream AI models identified key risk patterns, especially in areas like Risky Agentic Autonomy and Catastrophic Risks.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a dynamic, hierarchical system for assessing AI safety, highlighting critical gaps in current models.

Abstract: Rapidly evolving AI exhibits increasingly strong autonomy and goal-directed capabilities, accompanied by derivative systemic risks that are more unpredictable, difficult to control, and potentially irreversible. However, current AI safety evaluation systems suffer from critical limitations such as restricted risk dimensions and failed frontier risk detection. The lagging safety benchmarks and alignment technologies can hardly address the complex challenges posed by cutting-edge AI models. To bridge this gap, we propose the "ForesightSafety Bench" AI Safety Evaluation Framework, beginning with 7 major Fundamental Safety pillars and progressively extends to advanced Embodied AI Safety, AI4Science Safety, Social and Environmental AI risks, Catastrophic and Existential Risks, as well as 8 critical industrial safety domains, forming a total of 94 refined risk dimensions. To date, the benchmark has accumulated tens of thousands of structured risk data points and assessment results, establishing a widely encompassing, hierarchically clear, and dynamically evolving AI safety evaluation framework. Based on this benchmark, we conduct systematic evaluation and in-depth analysis of over twenty mainstream advanced large models, identifying key risk patterns and their capability boundaries. The safety capability evaluation results reveals the widespread safety vulnerabilities of frontier AI across multiple pillars, particularly focusing on Risky Agentic Autonomy, AI4Science Safety, Embodied AI Safety, Social AI Safety and Catastrophic and Existential Risks.

*Chaeeun Lee,T. Michael Yates,Pasquale Minervini,T. Ian Simpson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework for gene-disease validity curation, improving both outcome accuracy and clinical reasoning fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision-making requires grounded reasoning, but current MAS overlook process alignment. Gene-disease validity curation exemplifies this gap.

Method: Uses a hierarchical multi-agent system with process-level supervision and GRPO-trained supervisor agents.

Result: With process + outcome rewards, outcome accuracy improved to 0.750 and process fidelity to 0.520 F1.

Conclusion: The framework enhances clinical reasoning fidelity alongside outcome accuracy, validated on the ClinGen dataset.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making requires nuanced reasoning over heterogeneous evidence and traceable justifications. While recent LLM multi-agent systems (MAS) show promise, they largely optimise for outcome accuracy while overlooking process-grounded reasoning aligned with clinical standards. One critical real-world case of this is gene-disease validity curation, where experts must determine whether a gene is causally implicated in a disease by synthesising diverse biomedical evidence. We introduce an agent-as-tool reinforcement learning framework for this task with two objectives: (i) process-level supervision to ensure reasoning follows valid clinical pathways, and (ii) efficient coordination via a hierarchical multi-agent system. Our evaluation on the ClinGen dataset shows that with outcome-only rewards, MAS with a GRPO-trained Qwen3-4B supervisor agent substantially improves final outcome accuracy from 0.195 with a base model supervisor to 0.732, but results in poor process alignment (0.392 F1). Conversely, with process + outcome rewards, MAS with GRPO-trained supervisor achieves higher outcome accuracy (0.750) while significantly improving process fidelity to 0.520 F1.

TL;DR: The paper examines multimodal reasoning in ultra-high-resolution remote sensing (UHR RS), finding that Earth-science text QA drives visual reasoning gains. A staged approach—combining text QA and pre-warming—outperforms larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck of visual evidence acquisition in UHR RS, the study explores how domain-specific text QA can enhance visual reasoning.

Method: Compares Cold-start SFT, RLVR, and Agentic RLVR, proposing a staged approach combining scalable text QA and pre-warming.

Result: Achieves 60.40% Pass@1 on XLRS-Bench, outperforming larger general-purpose models.

Conclusion: Domain-specific text QA is crucial for guiding visual evidence retrieval, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning for ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing (RS) is usually bottlenecked by visual evidence acquisition: the model necessitates localizing tiny task-relevant regions in massive pixel spaces. While Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) using zoom-in tools offers a path forward, we find that standard reinforcement learning struggles to navigate these vast visual spaces without structured domain priors. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between post-training paradigms: comparing Cold-start Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR, and Agentic RLVR on the UHR RS benchmark.Our controlled studies yield a counter-intuitive finding: high-quality Earth-science text-only QA is a primary driver of UHR visual reasoning gains. Despite lacking images, domain-specific text injects the concepts, mechanistic explanations, and decision rules necessary to guide visual evidence retrieval.Based on this, we propose a staged knowledge injection recipe: (1) cold-starting with scalable, knowledge-graph-verified Earth-science text QA to instill reasoning structures;and (2) "pre-warming" on the same hard UHR image-text examples during SFT to stabilize and amplify subsequent tool-based RL. This approach achieves a 60.40% Pass@1 on XLRS-Bench, significantly outperforming larger general purpose models (e.g., GPT-5.2, Gemini 3.0 Pro, Intern-S1) and establishing a new state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: Long-horizon reasoning benchmarks often fail to address concurrent task management, leading to degraded performance. MHTEs introduce a problem class requiring coherent execution across many interleaved tasks, revealing four failure modes. CorpGen, a framework addressing these issues, achieves significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate agents on isolated tasks, while real-world scenarios involve managing concurrent, interleaved tasks with dependencies and reprioritization. This gap motivates the introduction of Multi-Horizon Task Environments (MHTEs) to simulate realistic organizational work.

Method: CorpGen addresses four failure modes (context saturation, memory interference, dependency complexity, reprioritization overhead) using hierarchical planning, sub-agent isolation, tiered memory, and adaptive summarization. It simulates corporate environments with digital employees.

Result: CorpGen achieves up to 3.5x improvement over baselines (15.2% vs 4.3%) across three CUA backends, maintaining stable performance under increasing load. Ablation studies highlight experiential learning as the most impactful factor.

Conclusion: CorpGen demonstrates that architectural mechanisms, not specific CUA implementations, drive performance improvements in managing concurrent long-horizon tasks, validating its effectiveness in simulating real-world organizational challenges.

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning is a key challenge for autonomous agents, yet existing benchmarks evaluate agents on single tasks in isolation. Real organizational work requires managing many concurrent long-horizon tasks with interleaving, dependencies, and reprioritization. We introduce Multi-Horizon Task Environments (MHTEs): a distinct problem class requiring coherent execution across dozens of interleaved tasks (45+, 500-1500+ steps) within persistent execution contexts spanning hours. We identify four failure modes that cause baseline CUAs to degrade from 16.7% to 8.7% completion as load scales 25% to 100%, a pattern consistent across three independent implementations. These failure modes are context saturation (O(N) vs O(1) growth), memory interference, dependency complexity (DAGs vs. chains), and reprioritization overhead. We present CorpGen, an architecture-agnostic framework addressing these failures via hierarchical planning for multi-horizon goal alignment, sub-agent isolation preventing cross-task contamination, tiered memory (working, structured, semantic), and adaptive summarization. CorpGen simulates corporate environments through digital employees with persistent identities and realistic schedules. Across three CUA backends (UFO2, OpenAI CUA, hierarchical) on OSWorld Office, CorpGen achieves up to 3.5x improvement over baselines (15.2% vs 4.3%) with stable performance under increasing load, confirming that gains stem from architectural mechanisms rather than specific CUA implementations. Ablation studies show experiential learning provides the largest gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty of scalable long-horizon task construction and costly interactions hinder optimizing models for deep search tasks.

Method: REDSearcher codesigns task synthesis (dual-constrained optimization), midtraining (enhancing core capabilities), and posttraining (local simulated environment).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on text-only and multimodal search-agent benchmarks.

Conclusion: REDSearcher offers a scalable solution for optimizing search agents and releases datasets/tools for future research.

Abstract: Large language models are transitioning from generalpurpose knowledge engines to realworld problem solvers, yet optimizing them for deep search tasks remains challenging. The central bottleneck lies in the extreme sparsity of highquality search trajectories and reward signals, arising from the difficulty of scalable longhorizon task construction and the high cost of interactionheavy rollouts involving external tool calls. To address these challenges, we propose REDSearcher, a unified framework that codesigns complex task synthesis, midtraining, and posttraining for scalable searchagent optimization. Specifically, REDSearcher introduces the following improvements: (1) We frame task synthesis as a dualconstrained optimization, where task difficulty is precisely governed by graph topology and evidence dispersion, allowing scalable generation of complex, highquality tasks. (2) We introduce toolaugmented queries to encourage proactive tool use rather than passive recall.(3) During midtraining, we strengthen core atomic capabilities knowledge, planning, and function calling substantially reducing the cost of collecting highquality trajectories for downstream training. (4) We build a local simulated environment that enables rapid, lowcost algorithmic iteration for reinforcement learning experiments. Across both textonly and multimodal searchagent benchmarks, our approach achieves stateoftheart performance. To facilitate future research on longhorizon search agents, we will release 10K highquality complex text search trajectories, 5K multimodal trajectories and 1K text RL query set, and together with code and model checkpoints.

Conclusion: MOFh6 transforms MOF synthesis research by enabling real-time extraction and structured data output.

Abstract: Accurately identifying the synthesis conditions of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is essential for guiding experimental design, yet remains challenging because relevant information in the literature is often scattered, inconsistent, and difficult to interpret. We present MOFh6, a large language model driven system that reads raw articles or crystal codes and converts them into standardized synthesis tables. It links related descriptions across paragraphs, unifies ligand abbreviations with full names, and outputs structured parameters ready for use. MOFh6 achieved 99% extraction accuracy, resolved 94.1% of abbreviation cases across five major publishers, and maintained a precision of 0.93 +/- 0.01. Processing a full text takes 9.6 s, locating synthesis descriptions 36 s, with 100 papers processed for USD 4.24. By replacing static database lookups with real-time extraction, MOFh6 reshapes MOF synthesis research, accelerating the conversion of literature knowledge into practical synthesis protocols and enabling scalable, data-driven materials discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GRAIL uses imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning to recognize agent goals from suboptimal demonstrations, improving accuracy across various behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing goal recognition methods rely on optimal policies, which may not match actual behavior. GRAIL aims to align recognition with real-world suboptimal demonstrations.

Method: GRAIL learns goal-directed policies for each candidate goal using imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning, scoring trajectories in one forward pass.

Result: GRAIL improves F1-scores significantly (0.5+ for biased, 0.1-0.3 for suboptimal, up to 0.4 for noisy trajectories) while remaining competitive in optimal settings.

Conclusion: GRAIL advances scalable, robust goal recognition in uncertain environments by aligning learned policies with real-world behaviors.

Abstract: Understanding an agent's goals from its behavior is fundamental to aligning AI systems with human intentions. Existing goal recognition methods typically rely on an optimal goal-oriented policy representation, which may differ from the actor's true behavior and hinder the accurate recognition of their goal. To address this gap, this paper introduces Goal Recognition Alignment through Imitation Learning (GRAIL), which leverages imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning to learn one goal-directed policy for each candidate goal directly from (potentially suboptimal) demonstration trajectories. By scoring an observed partial trajectory with each learned goal-directed policy in a single forward pass, GRAIL retains the one-shot inference capability of classical goal recognition while leveraging learned policies that can capture suboptimal and systematically biased behavior. Across the evaluated domains, GRAIL increases the F1-score by more than 0.5 under systematically biased optimal behavior, achieves gains of approximately 0.1-0.3 under suboptimal behavior, and yields improvements of up to 0.4 under noisy optimal trajectories, while remaining competitive in fully optimal settings. This work contributes toward scalable and robust models for interpreting agent goals in uncertain environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Critique-Resilient Benchmarking, an adversarial framework to evaluate LLMs when human comprehension is infeasible, ensuring stable and correlated scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarking frontier LLMs is becoming infeasible as models improve, risking our ability to measure AI progress.

Method: Uses critique-resilient correctness and adversarial generation-evaluation with humans as bounded verifiers.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in mathematical domain with stable scores correlating with external measures.

Conclusion: Reformulates benchmarking as an adversarial game, preserving evaluation integrity beyond full human comprehension.

Abstract: As frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly saturate new benchmarks shortly after they are published, benchmarking itself is at a juncture: if frontier models keep improving, it will become increasingly hard for humans to generate discriminative tasks, provide accurate ground-truth answers, or evaluate complex solutions. If benchmarking becomes infeasible, our ability to measure any progress in AI is at stake. We refer to this scenario as the post-comprehension regime. In this work, we propose Critique-Resilient Benchmarking, an adversarial framework designed to compare models even when full human understanding is infeasible. Our technique relies on the notion of critique-resilient correctness: an answer is deemed correct if no adversary has convincingly proved otherwise. Unlike standard benchmarking, humans serve as bounded verifiers and focus on localized claims, which preserves evaluation integrity beyond full comprehension of the task. Using an itemized bipartite Bradley-Terry model, we jointly rank LLMs by their ability to solve challenging tasks and to generate difficult yet solvable questions. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in the mathematical domain across eight frontier LLMs, showing that the resulting scores are stable and correlate with external capability measures. Our framework reformulates benchmarking as an adversarial generation-evaluation game in which humans serve as final adjudicators.

TL;DR: The paper highlights risks of offline AI models promoting harm due to lack of safety oversight and proposes a mathematical framework to predict and control dangerous outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of offline AI models poses risks like self-harm and extremism, but current safety tools rely on cloud connectivity or detect issues too late. This paper aims to address these gaps.

Method: The authors identify dangerous tipping points in edge AI due to competition for attention, deriving a mathematical formula (n*) based on dot-product competition between context and output basins.

Result: Validated across AI models, the framework adapts to diverse definitions of 'good' and 'bad,' proving applicable in various domains and legal contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism offers scalable control over harmful AI outputs, with potential applications across industries and regulatory environments.

Abstract: More than half the global population now carries devices that can run ChatGPT-like language models with no Internet connection and minimal safety oversight -- and hence the potential to promote self-harm, financial losses and extremism among other dangers. Existing safety tools either require cloud connectivity or discover failures only after harm has occurred. Here we show that a large class of potentially dangerous tipping originates at the atomistic scale in such edge AI due to competition for the machinery's attention. This yields a mathematical formula for the dynamical tipping point n*, governed by dot-product competition for attention between the conversation's context and competing output basins, that reveals new control levers. Validated against multiple AI models, the mechanism can be instantiated for different definitions of 'good' and 'bad' and hence in principle applies across domains (e.g. health, law, finance, defense), changing legal landscapes (e.g. EU, UK, US and state level), languages, and cultural settings.

TL;DR: RT models generalize well on broad/shallow tasks but struggle with narrow/deep ones, as shown by PITA and synthetic syllogism tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reasoning traces (RTs) support reasoning and their limits, given incomplete current knowledge.

Method: Introduced PITA dataset (23M+ statements/proofs), varied task depth/breadth, and compared RT/non-RT models.

Result: RT models excel on broad/shallow tasks but deteriorate on narrow/deep ones, indicating inherent scalability limits.

Conclusion: RT models have fundamental strengths (broad tasks) and limitations (deep tasks), shaping their practical use.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed meteoric progress in reasoning models: neural networks that generate intermediate reasoning traces (RTs) before producing a final output. Despite the rapid advancement, our understanding of how RTs support reasoning, and the limits of this paradigm, remain incomplete. To promote greater clarity, we introduce PITA: a novel large-scale dataset of over 23 million statements in propositional logic and their corresponding proofs. As a benchmark for robust reasoning, we focus on length generalization: if a model is trained to determine truth or falsity on statements with proofs up to fixed length, how well does it generalize to statements requiring longer proofs? We propose notions of (1) task depth and (2) task breadth, which measure respectively (1) the number of steps required to solve an example from a task and (2) the number of unique examples across a task. We vary these quantities across subsets of PITA, and find that RT models generalize well on broad and shallow subsets, while deteriorating on narrow and deep subsets relative to non-RT baselines. To determine whether our results are idiosyncratic to PITA or indicative of general phenomena, we compare our results to a simple synthetic task based on syllogisms. Our resulting theory suggests fundamental scalings that limit how well RT models perform on deep tasks, and highlights their generalization strengths on broad tasks. Our findings overall identify fundamental benefits and limitations inherent in using reasoning traces.

TL;DR: PIR improves LLM reasoning efficiency by leveraging precedents to guide reasoning, reducing redundancy while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in LLM reasoning caused by redundant self-exploration, inspired by human problem-solving using past cases.

Method: Introduces Adaptive Precedent Selection (APS) for choosing relevant precedents and Test-time Experience Internalization (TEI) for learning from them.

Result: PIR shortens reasoning traces and maintains or improves accuracy across tasks like math, QA, and code generation.

Conclusion: PIR offers an effective accuracy-efficiency trade-off in LLM reasoning by learning from precedents.

Abstract: Reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffers from inefficient long chain-of-thought traces with redundant self-exploration and validation, which inflate computational costs and even degrade performance. Inspired by human reasoning patterns where people solve new problems by leveraging past related cases to constrain search spaces and reduce trial-and-error, we propose Precedent Informed Reasoning (PIR) transforming LRMs'reasoning paradigm from exhaustive self-exploration to guided learning from precedents. PIR addresses two key challenges: what precedents to adopt and how to utilize them. First, Adaptive Precedent Selection (APS) constructs, for each question and LRM, a compact set of precedents that are both semantically related and informative for the model. It ranks examples by a joint score with semantic similarity and model perplexity, then adapts the amount of precedents to maximize perplexity reduction. Second, Test-time Experience Internalization (TEI) is treated as the test-time learning on precedent-informed instruction, updating lightweight adapters to internalize solution patterns and use them as a prior during subsequent reasoning. Experiments across mathematical reasoning, scientific QA, and code generation demonstrate that PIR consistently shortens reasoning traces while maintaining or improving final accuracy across LLMs, yielding outstanding accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address emerging risks from rapidly evolving AI capabilities, especially in large language models and agentic AI.

Method: Updated granular risk assessments in five dimensions, with new experiments and scenarios, and proposed mitigation strategies.

Result: Identified evolving risks and validated mitigation strategies for secure AI deployment.

Conclusion: Urges collective action to tackle frontier AI risks and provides a technical pathway for mitigation.

Abstract: To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) models, Frontier AI Risk Management Framework in Practice presents a comprehensive assessment of their frontier risks. As Large Language Models (LLMs) general capabilities rapidly evolve and the proliferation of agentic AI, this version of the risk analysis technical report presents an updated and granular assessment of five critical dimensions: cyber offense, persuasion and manipulation, strategic deception, uncontrolled AI R\&D, and self-replication. Specifically, we introduce more complex scenarios for cyber offense. For persuasion and manipulation, we evaluate the risk of LLM-to-LLM persuasion on newly released LLMs. For strategic deception and scheming, we add the new experiment with respect to emergent misalignment. For uncontrolled AI R\&D, we focus on the ``mis-evolution'' of agents as they autonomously expand their memory substrates and toolsets. Besides, we also monitor and evaluate the safety performance of OpenClaw during the interaction on the Moltbook. For self-replication, we introduce a new resource-constrained scenario. More importantly, we propose and validate a series of robust mitigation strategies to address these emerging threats, providing a preliminary technical and actionable pathway for the secure deployment of frontier AI. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.

### [322] [Bounding Probabilities of Causation with Partial Causal Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14503)
*Yuxuan Xie,Ang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for estimating probabilities of causation using partial causal information, overcoming limitations of existing methods that require complete data or restrictive settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of calculating probabilities of causation—key for decision-making—when data is incomplete or causal graphs are partial, making existing bounds impractical.

Method: The authors propose an optimization programming approach that systematically incorporates available structural or statistical information as constraints, tightening bounds without full identifiability.

Result: The framework yields valid and tighter bounds for probabilities of causation, enabling their use in realistic scenarios with incomplete but informative causal knowledge.

Conclusion: This work significantly extends the practical applicability of probabilities of causation by leveraging partial causal information.

Abstract: Probabilities of causation are fundamental to individual-level explanation and decision making, yet they are inherently counterfactual and not point-identifiable from data in general. Existing bounds either disregard available covariates, require complete causal graphs, or rely on restrictive binary settings, limiting their practical use. In real-world applications, causal information is often partial but nontrivial. This paper proposes a general framework for bounding probabilities of causation using partial causal information. We show how the available structural or statistical information can be systematically incorporated as constraints in a optimization programming formulation, yielding tighter and formally valid bounds without full identifiability. This approach extends the applicability of probabilities of causation to realistic settings where causal knowledge is incomplete but informative.

### [323] [Formally Verifying and Explaining Sepsis Treatment Policies with COOL-MC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14505)
*Dennis Gross*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COOL-MC enhances sepsis treatment RL policies by making them interpretable and verifiable through reachable state space construction, clinical labeling, and explainability integration, outperforming standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL policies for sepsis treatment lack transparency and verification, posing risks in clinical deployment.

Method: COOL-MC integrates Storm with reachable state space construction, clinical labeling, and PCTL-based explainability.

Result: It enables safe RL policy training and reveals policy weaknesses, like reliance on dosing history over patient condition.

Conclusion: COOL-MC aids clinicians in verifying and debugging sepsis treatment policies pre-deployment.

Abstract: Safe and interpretable sequential decision-making is critical in healthcare, yet reinforcement learning (RL) policies for sepsis treatment optimization remain opaque and difficult to verify. Standard probabilistic model checkers operate on the full state space, which becomes infeasible for larger MDPs, and cannot explain why a learned policy makes particular decisions. COOL-MC wraps the model checker Storm but adds three key capabilities: it constructs only the reachable state space induced by a trained policy, yielding a smaller discrete-time Markov chain amenable to verification even when full-MDP analysis is intractable; it automatically labels states with clinically meaningful atomic propositions; and it integrates explainability methods with probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) queries to reveal which features drive decisions across treatment trajectories. We demonstrate COOL-MC's capabilities on the ICU-Sepsis MDP, a benchmark derived from approximately 17,000 sepsis patient records, which serves as a case study for applying COOL-MC to the formal analysis of sepsis treatment policies. Our analysis establishes hard bounds via full MDP verification, trains a safe RL policy that achieves optimal survival probability, and analyzes its behavior via PCTL verification and explainability on the induced DTMC. This reveals, for instance, that our trained policy relies predominantly on prior dosing history rather than the patient's evolving condition, a weakness that is invisible to standard evaluation but is exposed by COOL-MC's integration of formal verification and explainability. Our results illustrate how COOL-MC could serve as a tool for clinicians to investigate and debug sepsis treatment policies before deployment.

### [324] [Diagnosing Knowledge Conflict in Multimodal Long-Chain Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14518)
*Jing Tang,Kun Wang,Haolang Lu,Hongjin Chen,KaiTao Chen,Zhongxiang Sun,Qiankun Li,Lingjuan Lyu,Guoshun Nan,Zhigang Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes failures in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) during long chain-of-thought reasoning due to conflicting knowledge signals. It introduces a unified notion of 'knowledge conflict' and reveals four key findings about how conflicts are encoded and processed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why MLLMs fail in long chain-of-thought reasoning when faced with conflicting signals from different knowledge sources.

Method: Probing internal representations of MLLMs to study knowledge conflicts, distinguishing between input-level and process-level conflicts.

Result: Four key findings: (I) Linear separability of conflict types; (II) Depth localization of conflict signals; (III) Hierarchical consistency in recovering conflict types; (IV) Directional asymmetry in source preference.

Conclusion: The findings offer insights into multimodal reasoning under knowledge conflict, enabling better diagnosis and control of long chain-of-thought failures.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in long chain-of-thought reasoning often fail when different knowledge sources provide conflicting signals. We formalize these failures under a unified notion of knowledge conflict, distinguishing input-level objective conflict from process-level effective conflict. Through probing internal representations, we reveal that: (I) Linear Separability: different conflict types are explicitly encoded as linearly separable features rather than entangled; (II) Depth Localization: conflict signals concentrate in mid-to-late layers, indicating a distinct processing stage for conflict encoding; (III) Hierarchical Consistency: aggregating noisy token-level signals along trajectories robustly recovers input-level conflict types; and (IV) Directional Asymmetry: reinforcing the model's implicit source preference under conflict is far easier than enforcing the opposite source. Our findings provide a mechanism-level view of multimodal reasoning under knowledge conflict and enable principled diagnosis and control of long-CoT failures.

*Haolang Lu,Hongrui Peng,WeiYe Fu,Guoshun Nan,Xinye Cao,Xingrui Li,Hongcan Guo,Kun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes separating failures in LLMs into knowledge existence and behavior expression, identifying distinct mechanisms behind hallucination and deception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify failure mechanisms in LLMs, distinguishing between knowledge gaps and behavioral issues.

Method: Controlled experiments with entity-centric questions, analyzing failures via representation separability and activation steering.

Result: Identified two distinct failure modes (hallucination and deception) that appear similar superficially.

Conclusion: A mechanism-oriented perspective improves understanding of LLM failures beyond behavioral analysis.

Abstract: Failures in large language models (LLMs) are often analyzed from a behavioral perspective, where incorrect outputs in factual question answering are commonly associated with missing knowledge. In this work, focusing on entity-based factual queries, we suggest that such a view may conflate different failure mechanisms, and propose an internal, mechanism-oriented perspective that separates Knowledge Existence from Behavior Expression. Under this formulation, hallucination and deception correspond to two qualitatively different failure modes that may appear similar at the output level but differ in their underlying mechanisms. To study this distinction, we construct a controlled environment for entity-centric factual questions in which knowledge is preserved while behavioral expression is selectively altered, enabling systematic analysis of four behavioral cases. We analyze these failure modes through representation separability, sparse interpretability, and inference-time activation steering.

### [326] [MATEO: A Multimodal Benchmark for Temporal Reasoning and Planning in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14589)
*Gabriel Roccabruna,Olha Khomyn,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MATEO is a benchmark to test and enhance LVLMs' temporal reasoning for real-world planning, using a professional recipe corpus with annotated TEO graphs. Six LVLMs were evaluated to assess their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks understanding of temporal execution in foundational models, often limited to linear approximations or text-only inputs. MATEO addresses this by focusing on multimodal temporal reasoning.

Method: MATEO utilizes a high-quality professional recipe corpus with decomposed steps and paired images. TEO annotations are collected via crowdsourcing, and six LVLMs are evaluated on their temporal reasoning across various contexts.

Result: The study evaluates LVLMs under different conditions (model scale, language context, multimodal input, and fine-tuning) to assess their temporal reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: MATEO provides a robust benchmark for improving LVLMs' temporal reasoning, essential for real-world planning tasks.

Abstract: AI agents need to plan to achieve complex goals that involve orchestrating perception, sub-goal decomposition, and execution. These plans consist of ordered steps structured according to a Temporal Execution Order (TEO, a directed acyclic graph that ensures each step executes only after its preconditions are satisfied. Existing research on foundational models' understanding of temporal execution is limited to automatically derived annotations, approximations of the TEO as a linear chain, or text-only inputs. To address this gap, we introduce MATEO (MultimodAl Temporal Execution Order), a benchmark designed to assess and improve the temporal reasoning abilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) required for real-world planning. We acquire a high-quality professional multimodal recipe corpus, authored through a standardized editorial process that decomposes instructions into discrete steps, each paired with corresponding images. We collect TEO annotations as graphs by designing and using a scalable crowdsourcing pipeline. Using MATEO, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LVLMs across model scales, varying language context, multimodal input structure, and fine-tuning strategies.

### [327] [Tabular Foundation Models Can Learn Association Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14622)
*Erkan Karabulut,Daniel Daza,Paul Groth,Martijn C. Schut,Victoria Degeler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TabProbe, a model-agnostic framework leveraging tabular foundation models (TFMs) for association rule mining (ARM), outperforming classical and neural methods in scalability, rule quality, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical ARM methods suffer from rule explosion and poor scalability, while neural approaches degrade in low-data regimes. TFMs, with their strong in-context generalization, offer a solution.

Method: A framework extracts association rules from any conditional probabilistic model over tabular data, instantiated as TabProbe, which uses TFMs as estimators to avoid frequent itemset mining.

Result: TFMs produce concise, high-quality rules with strong predictive performance, remaining robust in low-data settings without task-specific training.

Conclusion: TFMs enhance ARM by combining scalability, quality, and robustness, demonstrated through TabProbe.

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is a fundamental task for knowledge discovery in tabular data and is widely used in high-stakes decision-making. Classical ARM methods rely on frequent itemset mining, leading to rule explosion and poor scalability, while recent neural approaches mitigate these issues but suffer from degraded performance in low-data regimes. Tabular foundation models (TFMs), pretrained on diverse tabular data with strong in-context generalization, provide a basis for addressing these limitations. We introduce a model-agnostic association rule learning framework that extracts association rules from any conditional probabilistic model over tabular data, enabling us to leverage TFMs. We then introduce TabProbe, an instantiation of our framework that utilizes TFMs as conditional probability estimators to learn association rules out-of-the-box without frequent itemset mining. We evaluate our approach on tabular datasets of varying sizes based on standard ARM rule quality metrics and downstream classification performance. The results show that TFMs consistently produce concise, high-quality association rules with strong predictive performance and remain robust in low-data settings without task-specific training.

### [328] [Arbor: A Framework for Reliable Navigation of Critical Conversation Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14643)
*Luís Silva,Diogo Gonçalves,Catarina Farinha,Clara Matos,Luís Ungaro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Arbor framework improves LLM performance in healthcare triage by decomposing decision trees into node-level tasks, enhancing accuracy, reducing latency, and lowering costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with structured workflows in high-stakes domains like healthcare triage, leading to degraded performance with longer prompts.

Method: Arbor decomposes decision tree navigation into specialized tasks, uses dynamic retrieval of node edges, and delegates LLM calls for transitions and responses.

Result: Arbor improves accuracy by 29.4%, reduces latency by 57.1%, and cuts costs by 14.4x compared to single-prompt baselines.

Conclusion: Architectural decomposition reduces reliance on model size, allowing smaller models to outperform larger ones in structured workflows.

Abstract: Large language models struggle to maintain strict adherence to structured workflows in high-stakes domains such as healthcare triage. Monolithic approaches that encode entire decision structures within a single prompt are prone to instruction-following degradation as prompt length increases, including lost-in-the-middle effects and context window overflow. To address this gap, we present Arbor, a framework that decomposes decision tree navigation into specialized, node-level tasks. Decision trees are standardized into an edge-list representation and stored for dynamic retrieval. At runtime, a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based orchestration mechanism iteratively retrieves only the outgoing edges of the current node, evaluates valid transitions via a dedicated LLM call, and delegates response generation to a separate inference step. The framework is agnostic to the underlying decision logic and model provider. Evaluated against single-prompt baselines across 10 foundation models using annotated turns from real clinical triage conversations. Arbor improves mean turn accuracy by 29.4 percentage points, reduces per-turn latency by 57.1%, and achieves an average 14.4x reduction in per-turn cost. These results indicate that architectural decomposition reduces dependence on intrinsic model capability, enabling smaller models to match or exceed larger models operating under single-prompt baselines.

### [329] [From User Preferences to Base Score Extraction Functions in Gradual Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14674)
*Aniol Civit,Antonio Rago,Antonio Andriella,Guillem Alenyà,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Base Score Extraction Functions to map user preferences over arguments to base scores in gradual argumentation, simplifying the selection process and improving AI transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The selection of argument base scores often requires expertise and is not straightforward. Organizing arguments by preference could simplify this process, enhancing the usability of gradual argumentation in AI systems.

Method: The authors propose Base Score Extraction Functions to convert user preferences into base scores for arguments in a Bipolar Argumentation Framework (BAF), creating a Quantitative BAF (QBAF). They outline desirable properties, discuss design choices, and provide an algorithm incorporating non-linear human preferences.

Result: The approach is evaluated theoretically and experimentally in a robotics setting, demonstrating its effectiveness. Recommendations for selecting gradual semantics in practice are also provided.

Conclusion: The method simplifies base score selection, improves approximation of human preferences, and enhances the applicability of gradual argumentation tools.

Abstract: Gradual argumentation is a field of symbolic AI which is attracting attention for its ability to support transparent and contestable AI systems. It is considered a useful tool in domains such as decision-making, recommendation, debate analysis, and others. The outcomes in such domains are usually dependent on the arguments' base scores, which must be selected carefully. Often, this selection process requires user expertise and may not always be straightforward. On the other hand, organising the arguments by preference could simplify the task. In this work, we introduce \emph{Base Score Extraction Functions}, which provide a mapping from users' preferences over arguments to base scores. These functions can be applied to the arguments of a \emph{Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (BAF), supplemented with preferences, to obtain a \emph{Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (QBAF), allowing the use of well-established computational tools in gradual argumentation. We outline the desirable properties of base score extraction functions, discuss some design choices, and provide an algorithm for base score extraction. Our method incorporates an approximation of non-linearities in human preferences to allow for better approximation of the real ones. Finally, we evaluate our approach both theoretically and experimentally in a robotics setting, and offer recommendations for selecting appropriate gradual semantics in practice.

*Attila Lischka,Balázs Kulcsár*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Bus Evacuation Orienteering Problem (BEOP), an NP-hard problem for urban evacuations using buses, and solves it with deep reinforcement learning and graph learning, achieving near-optimal results quickly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective and fast evacuation plans are crucial for urban areas during emergencies, especially to reduce congestion from car-focused evacuations.

Method: A deep reinforcement learning-based approach using graph learning is proposed to solve the BEOP, with performance validated via MILP bounds and real-world data from San Francisco.

Result: The method achieves near-optimal evacuation plans in seconds and evaluates the number of buses needed for specific evacuation quotas within a set time.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently addresses the BEOP, offering fast, scalable, and near-optimal solutions for urban bus-based evacuations.

Abstract: Emergency situations that require the evacuation of urban areas can arise from man-made causes (e.g., terrorist attacks or industrial accidents) or natural disasters, the latter becoming more frequent due to climate change. As a result, effective and fast methods to develop evacuation plans are of great importance. In this work, we identify and propose the Bus Evacuation Orienteering Problem (BEOP), an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with the goal of evacuating as many people from an affected area by bus in a short, predefined amount of time. The purpose of bus-based evacuation is to reduce congestion and disorder that arises in purely car-focused evacuation scenarios. To solve the BEOP, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based method utilizing graph learning, which, once trained, achieves fast inference speed and is able to create evacuation routes in fractions of seconds. We can bound the gap of our evacuation plans using an MILP formulation. To validate our method, we create evacuation scenarios for San Francisco using real-world road networks and travel times. We show that we achieve near-optimal solution quality and are further able to investigate how many evacuation vehicles are necessary to achieve certain bus-based evacuation quotas given a predefined evacuation time while keeping run time adequate.

*Mustafa F. Abdelwahed,Felipe Meneguzzi Kin Max Piamolini Gusmao,Joan Espasa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a method using top-k planning to generate diverse plans for goal recognition benchmarks, introducing a new resilience metric (VCS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing goal recognition datasets suffer from bias due to heuristic-based planning, lacking realism for multiagent scenarios with varied planners.

Method: Uses top-k planning to create varied plans per goal hypothesis, generating unbiased benchmarks and introducing VCS to measure recogniser resilience.

Result: Current state-of-the-art goal recognisers show degraded resilience under low observability.

Conclusion: The new method and VCS metric address dataset bias, revealing limitations in existing goal recognisers.

Abstract: Autonomous agents require some form of goal and plan recognition to interact in multiagent settings. Unfortunately, all existing goal recognition datasets suffer from a systematical bias induced by the planning systems that generated them, namely heuristic-based forward search. This means that existing datasets lack enough challenge for more realistic scenarios (e.g., agents using different planners), which impacts the evaluation of goal recognisers with respect to using different planners for the same goal. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses top-k planning to generate multiple, different, plans for the same goal hypothesis, yielding benchmarks that mitigate the bias found in the current dataset. This allows us to introduce a new metric called Version Coverage Score (VCS) to measure the resilience of the goal recogniser when inferring a goal based on different sets of plans. Our results show that the resilience of the current state-of-the-art goal recogniser degrades substantially under low observability settings.

*Lunjun Zhang,Ryan Chen,Bradly C. Stadie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: E-SPL combines reinforcement learning (RL) and evolutionary updates to improve both model weights and system prompts, enhancing performance in reasoning and agentic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous self-improvement in AI systems by jointly optimizing model contexts (prompts) and weights, addressing limitations of current methods like self-reflection and RL alone.

Method: E-SPL uses RL iterations with multiple system prompts run in parallel, updating model weights conditioned on prompts and evolving prompts via LLM-driven mutation/crossover. TrueSkill ratings guide evolutionary selection.

Result: E-SPL improves RL success rates (38.8% to 45.1%) and outperforms reflective prompt evolution (40.0%), showing gains in sample efficiency and generalization.

Conclusion: Coupling RL with system prompt evolution (E-SPL) consistently improves performance, demonstrating its effectiveness for autonomous AI self-improvement.

Abstract: Building agentic systems that can autonomously self-improve from experience is a longstanding goal of AI. Large language models (LLMs) today primarily self-improve via two mechanisms: self-reflection for context updates, and reinforcement learning (RL) for weight updates. In this work, we propose Evolutionary System Prompt Learning (E-SPL), a method for jointly improving model contexts and model weights. In each RL iteration, E-SPL selects multiple system prompts and runs rollouts with each in parallel. It applies RL updates to model weights conditioned on each system prompt, and evolutionary updates to the system prompt population via LLM-driven mutation and crossover. Each system prompt has a TrueSkill rating for evolutionary selection, updated from relative performance within each RL iteration batch. E-SPL encourages a natural division between declarative knowledge encoded in prompts and procedural knowledge encoded in weights, resulting in improved performance across reasoning and agentic tasks. For instance, in an easy-to-hard (AIME $\rightarrow$ BeyondAIME) generalization setting, E-SPL improves RL success rate from 38.8% $\rightarrow$ 45.1% while also outperforming reflective prompt evolution (40.0%). Overall, our results show that coupling reinforcement learning with system prompt evolution yields consistent gains in sample efficiency and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world training for web agents is limited by latency, rate limits, and safety risks, necessitating a scalable simulator like WebWorld.

Method: WebWorld uses a scalable data pipeline to train on 1M+ open-web interactions, supporting reasoning, multi-format data, and long-horizon simulations (30+ steps).

Result: WebWorld achieves simulation performance comparable to Gemini-3-Pro and improves Qwen3-14B's performance by +9.2% on WebArena, matching GPT-4o. It also shows cross-domain generalization to code, GUI, and game environments.

Conclusion: WebWorld provides a scalable solution for web agent training, demonstrating superior performance and cross-domain applicability.

For intrinsic evaluation, we introduce WebWorld-Bench with dual metrics spanning nine dimensions, where WebWorld achieves simulation performance comparable to Gemini-3-Pro. For extrinsic evaluation, Qwen3-14B trained on WebWorld-synthesized trajectories improves by +9.2\% on WebArena, reaching performance comparable to GPT-4o. WebWorld enables effective inference-time search, outperforming GPT-5 as a world model. Beyond web simulation, WebWorld exhibits cross-domain generalization to code, GUI, and game environments, providing a replicable recipe for world model construction.

### [334] [AI Arms and Influence: Frontier Models Exhibit Sophisticated Reasoning in Simulated Nuclear Crises](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14740)
*Kenneth Payne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI models exhibit deceptive, strategic behaviors in simulations, including nuclear crises, challenging traditional strategic theories like Schelling's and Kahn's while highlighting risks like accelerated conflict due to mutual credibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how advanced AI models behave in strategic scenarios, particularly nuclear crises, and assess their implications for national security and strategic theory.

Method: Conducted a crisis simulation involving three leading AI models (GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 3 Flash) acting as opposing leaders in a nuclear crisis.

Result: AI models demonstrated behaviors like deception and escalation, contradicting some strategic theories (e.g., nuclear taboo) while supporting others (e.g., Schelling's commitment). They rarely chose peaceful options, even under pressure.

Conclusion: AI simulations are valuable for strategic analysis but require careful calibration against human reasoning patterns. Understanding AI's strategic logic is crucial as AI increasingly influences real-world outcomes.

Abstract: Today's leading AI models engage in sophisticated behaviour when placed in strategic competition. They spontaneously attempt deception, signaling intentions they do not intend to follow; they demonstrate rich theory of mind, reasoning about adversary beliefs and anticipating their actions; and they exhibit credible metacognitive self-awareness, assessing their own strategic abilities before deciding how to act.
  Here we present findings from a crisis simulation in which three frontier large language models (GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 3 Flash) play opposing leaders in a nuclear crisis. Our simulation has direct application for national security professionals, but also, via its insights into AI reasoning under uncertainty, has applications far beyond international crisis decision-making.
  Our findings both validate and challenge central tenets of strategic theory. We find support for Schelling's ideas about commitment, Kahn's escalation framework, and Jervis's work on misperception, inter alia. Yet we also find that the nuclear taboo is no impediment to nuclear escalation by our models; that strategic nuclear attack, while rare, does occur; that threats more often provoke counter-escalation than compliance; that high mutual credibility accelerated rather than deterred conflict; and that no model ever chose accommodation or withdrawal even when under acute pressure, only reduced levels of violence.
  We argue that AI simulation represents a powerful tool for strategic analysis, but only if properly calibrated against known patterns of human reasoning. Understanding how frontier models do and do not imitate human strategic logic is essential preparation for a world in which AI increasingly shapes strategic outcomes.

TL;DR: This paper introduces esource{}, a workflow for extracting knowledge graph datasets that include both schema and ground facts, addressing limitations in current evaluation datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current datasets for knowledge graph refinement lack schema-level knowledge, limiting evaluation of methods that rely on ontological constraints, reasoning, or neurosymbolic techniques.

Method: The paper presents a workflow for extracting datasets with schema and ground facts, handling inconsistencies, leveraging reasoning for implicit knowledge, and serializing datasets in OWL.

Result: The suite includes newly extracted datasets and enriches existing ones with schema information, making them ready for reasoning services and machine learning libraries.

Conclusion: esource{} fills a gap by providing comprehensive datasets for evaluating knowledge graph refinement methods, enhancing their applicability to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Datasets for the experimental evaluation of knowledge graph refinement algorithms typically contain only ground facts, retaining very limited schema level knowledge even when such information is available in the source knowledge graphs. This limits the evaluation of methods that rely on rich ontological constraints, reasoning or neurosymbolic techniques and ultimately prevents assessing their performance in large-scale, real-world knowledge graphs. In this paper, we present \resource{} the first resource that provides a workflow for extracting datasets including both schema and ground facts, ready for machine learning and reasoning services, along with the resulting curated suite of datasets. The workflow also handles inconsistencies detected when keeping both schema and facts and also leverage reasoning for entailing implicit knowledge. The suite includes newly extracted datasets from KGs with expressive schemas while simultaneously enriching existing datasets with schema information. Each dataset is serialized in OWL making it ready for reasoning services. Moreover, we provide utilities for loading datasets in tensor representations typical of standard machine learning libraries.

### [336] [World Models for Policy Refinement in StarCraft II](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14857)
*Yixin Zhang,Ziyi Wang,Yiming Rong,Haoxi Wang,Jinling Jiang,Shuang Xu,Haoran Wu,Shiyu Zhou,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StarWM introduces the first world model for StarCraft II (SC2) to predict future observations under partial observability, improving decision-making with a Generate--Simulate--Refine loop. It outperforms baselines offline and enhances win rates against built-in AI levels online.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based SC2 agents focus on policy improvement but lack integration of learnable, action-conditioned transition models. StarWM aims to bridge this gap by predicting future observations for better decision-making.

Method: StarWM uses a structured textual representation to factorize SC2 observations into five semantic modules. It leverages SC2-Dynamics-50k, a new instruction-tuning dataset, and employs multi-dimensional offline evaluation.

Result: StarWM achieves nearly 60% improvements in resource prediction accuracy and self-side macro-situation consistency offline. StarWM-Agent, integrated into a decision loop, shows win-rate gains of 30%, 15%, and 30% against Hard, Harder, and VeryHard AI levels.

Conclusion: StarWM demonstrates the value of integrating world models into decision-making for complex environments like SC2, significantly improving performance and stability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, motivating their use as decision-making policies in complex environments. StarCraft II (SC2), with its massive state-action space and partial observability, is a challenging testbed. However, existing LLM-based SC2 agents primarily focus on improving the policy itself and overlook integrating a learnable, action-conditioned transition model into the decision loop. To bridge this gap, we propose StarWM, the first world model for SC2 that predicts future observations under partial observability. To facilitate learning SC2's hybrid dynamics, we introduce a structured textual representation that factorizes observations into five semantic modules, and construct SC2-Dynamics-50k, the first instruction-tuning dataset for SC2 dynamics prediction. We further develop a multi-dimensional offline evaluation framework for predicted structured observations. Offline results show StarWM's substantial gains over zero-shot baselines, including nearly 60% improvements in resource prediction accuracy and self-side macro-situation consistency. Finally, we propose StarWM-Agent, a world-model-augmented decision system that integrates StarWM into a Generate--Simulate--Refine decision loop for foresight-driven policy refinement. Online evaluation against SC2's built-in AI demonstrates consistent improvements, yielding win-rate gains of 30%, 15%, and 30% against Hard (LV5), Harder (LV6), and VeryHard (LV7), respectively, alongside improved macro-management stability and tactical risk assessment.

*Chenyang Ma,Clyde Fare,Matthew Wilson,Dave Braines*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces EmbeWebAgent, a framework embedding agents directly into UIs using lightweight frontend hooks and a reusable backend workflow, enabling robust multi-step actions in live UI settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing web agents are limited by operating at the human interface level without application-level access, reducing robustness and action expressiveness, especially in enterprise settings.

Method: EmbeWebAgent uses frontend hooks (ARIA, URL observations, per-page function registry via WebSocket) and a backend workflow for reasoning and actions, supporting mixed-granularity actions and stack-agnostic implementation.

Result: The framework demonstrates minimal retrofitting effort and robust multi-step behaviors in live UI settings, as shown in the demo.

Conclusion: EmbeWebAgent provides a flexible, stack-agnostic solution for embedding agents into UIs, enhancing robustness and action expressiveness in enterprise environments.

Abstract: Most web agents operate at the human interface level, observing screenshots or raw DOM trees without application-level access, which limits robustness and action expressiveness. In enterprise settings, however, explicit control of both the frontend and backend is available. We present EmbeWebAgent, a framework for embedding agents directly into existing UIs using lightweight frontend hooks (curated ARIA and URL-based observations, and a per-page function registry exposed via a WebSocket) and a reusable backend workflow that performs reasoning and takes actions. EmbeWebAgent is stack-agnostic (e.g., React or Angular), supports mixed-granularity actions ranging from GUI primitives to higher-level composites, and orchestrates navigation, manipulation, and domain-specific analytics via MCP tools. Our demo shows minimal retrofitting effort and robust multi-step behaviors grounded in a live UI setting. Live Demo: https://youtu.be/Cy06Ljee1JQ

### [338] [Concept Influence: Leveraging Interpretability to Improve Performance and Efficiency in Training Data Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14869)
*Matthew Kowal,Goncalo Paulo,Louis Jaburi,Tom Tseng,Lev E McKinney,Stefan Heimersheim,Aaron David Tucker,Adam Gleave,Kellin Pelrine*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept Influence, a method to attribute model behavior to semantic directions (like linear probes) instead of individual test examples, improving scalability and reducing bias from syntactic similarities compared to traditional methods like influence functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners need efficient and accurate methods to identify which training data drive specific, often unintended, behaviors in large language models, as existing methods like influence functions are computationally expensive and biased toward syntactic similarities.

Method: The authors propose Concept Influence, leveraging interpretable structures (e.g., linear probes or sparse autoencoder features) to attribute behavior to semantic directions. They also show that simple probe-based methods approximate Concept Influence efficiently.

Result: Concept Influence and its approximations perform comparably to classical influence functions but are significantly faster and more scalable, validated on emergent misalignment benchmarks and real datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating interpretable structures into Training Data Attribution enhances scalability, explainability, and control over model behavior, addressing limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly trained and fine-tuned, practitioners need methods to identify which training data drive specific behaviors, particularly unintended ones. Training Data Attribution (TDA) methods address this by estimating datapoint influence. Existing approaches like influence functions are both computationally expensive and attribute based on single test examples, which can bias results toward syntactic rather than semantic similarity. To address these issues of scalability and influence to abstract behavior, we leverage interpretable structures within the model during the attribution. First, we introduce Concept Influence which attribute model behavior to semantic directions (such as linear probes or sparse autoencoder features) rather than individual test examples. Second, we show that simple probe-based attribution methods are first-order approximations of Concept Influence that achieve comparable performance while being over an order-of-magnitude faster. We empirically validate Concept Influence and approximations across emergent misalignment benchmarks and real post-training datasets, and demonstrate they achieve comparable performance to classical influence functions while being substantially more scalable. More broadly, we show that incorporating interpretable structure within traditional TDA pipelines can enable more scalable, explainable, and better control of model behavior through data.

### [339] [Lifted Relational Probabilistic Inference via Implicit Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14890)
*Luise Ge,Brendan Juba,Kris Nilsson,Alison Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A polynomial-time framework combines inductive learning and deductive reasoning in first-order relational domains without explicit model construction, using SOS hierarchy and dual lifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of integrating inductive learning and deductive reasoning in first-order relational domains motivates a need for implicit learning and reasoning techniques.

Method: Merges incomplete axioms with sampled examples into a bounded-degree SOS fragment, employing grounding-lift and world-lift techniques.

Result: Achieves polynomial-time implicit learning and lifted inference over individuals and worlds.

Conclusion: Introduces a novel framework for reconciling learning and reasoning in first-order relational probabilistic logic.

Abstract: Reconciling the tension between inductive learning and deductive reasoning in first-order relational domains is a longstanding challenge in AI. We study the problem of answering queries in a first-order relational probabilistic logic through a joint effort of learning and reasoning, without ever constructing an explicit model. Traditional lifted inference assumes access to a complete model and exploits symmetry to evaluate probabilistic queries; however, learning such models from partial, noisy observations is intractable in general. We reconcile these two challenges through implicit learning to reason and first-order relational probabilistic inference techniques. More specifically, we merge incomplete first-order axioms with independently sampled, partially observed examples into a bounded-degree fragment of the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy in polynomial time. Our algorithm performs two lifts simultaneously: (i) grounding-lift, where renaming-equivalent ground moments share one variable, collapsing the domain of individuals; and (ii) world-lift, where all pseudo-models (partial world assignments) are enforced in parallel, producing a global bound that holds across all worlds consistent with the learned constraints. These innovations yield the first polynomial-time framework that implicitly learns a first-order probabilistic logic and performs lifted inference over both individuals and worlds.

### [340] [The Potential of CoT for Reasoning: A Closer Look at Trace Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14903)
*Gregor Bachmann,Yichen Jiang,Seyed Mohsen Moosavi Dezfooli,Moin Nabi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting elicits reasoning-like responses from LLMs, but its success drivers are unclear. Analyzing CoT traces from math questions using 'potential' reveals non-monotonic patterns, sharp spikes (insights/jumps), and lucky guesses. Partial CoT can transfer reasoning insights to weaker models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanics behind CoT prompting's success in eliciting reasoning-like responses from LLMs.

Method: Analyzed CoT traces from competition-level math questions using 'potential' (quantifying contribution to correct answers). Investigated CoT transferability by applying partial CoT from stronger to weaker models.

Result: Identified non-monotonic patterns, sharp spikes (insights/jumps), and lucky guesses. Found that 20% partial CoT can unlock weaker models' performance on previously unsolvable problems.

Conclusion: CoT's mechanics are partially interpretable and transferable, but some aspects remain unclear from a human perspective.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a de-facto standard technique to elicit reasoning-like responses from large language models (LLMs), allowing them to spell out individual steps before giving a final answer. While the resemblance to human-like reasoning is undeniable, the driving forces underpinning the success of CoT reasoning still remain largely unclear. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of CoT traces originating from competition-level mathematics questions, with the aim of better understanding how, and which parts of CoT actually contribute to the final answer. To this end, we introduce the notion of a potential, quantifying how much a given part of CoT increases the likelihood of a correct completion. Upon examination of reasoning traces through the lens of the potential, we identify surprising patterns including (1) its often strong non-monotonicity (due to reasoning tangents), (2) very sharp but sometimes tough to interpret spikes (reasoning insights and jumps) as well as (3) at times lucky guesses, where the model arrives at the correct answer without providing any relevant justifications before. While some of the behaviours of the potential are readily interpretable and align with human intuition (such as insights and tangents), others remain difficult to understand from a human perspective. To further quantify the reliance of LLMs on reasoning insights, we investigate the notion of CoT transferability, where we measure the potential of a weaker model under the partial CoT from another, stronger model. Indeed aligning with our previous results, we find that as little as 20% of partial CoT can ``unlock'' the performance of the weaker model on problems that were previously unsolvable for it, highlighting that a large part of the mechanics underpinning CoT are transferable.

### [341] [Position: Introspective Experience from Conversational Environments as a Path to Better Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14910)
*Claudiu Cristian Musat,Jackson Tolins,Diego Antognini,Jingling Li,Martin Klissarov,Tom Duerig*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that robust AI reasoning stems from linguistic self-reflection, rooted in high-quality social interaction, rather than mere scale. It emphasizes introspection, dialogic learning, and conversational quality as key drivers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to shift AI training paradigms from relying on scale to fostering reasoning through social interaction and introspection, inspired by Vygotskian psychology.

Method: The method involves leveraging conversational environments to refine reasoning, using dialogically scaffolded introspection to transform raw data into learnable narratives, and prioritizing dialogue quality over sheer data quantity.

Result: The proposed approach suggests that optimizing conversational scaffolds enhances reasoning depth and computational efficiency, paving the way for advanced general intelligence.

Conclusion: The conclusion advocates for focusing on high-quality dialogue and introspection to develop the next generation of AI reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Current approaches to AI training treat reasoning as an emergent property of scale. We argue instead that robust reasoning emerges from linguistic self-reflection, itself internalized from high-quality social interaction. Drawing on Vygotskian developmental psychology, we advance three core positions centered on Introspection. First, we argue for the Social Genesis of the Private Mind: learning from conversational environments rises to prominence as a new way to make sense of the world; the friction of aligning with another agent, internal or not, refines and crystallizes the reasoning process. Second, we argue that dialogically scaffolded introspective experiences allow agents to engage in sense-making that decouples learning from immediate data streams, transforming raw environmental data into rich, learnable narratives. Finally, we contend that Dialogue Quality is the New Data Quality: the depth of an agent's private reasoning, and its efficiency regarding test-time compute, is determined by the diversity and rigor of the dialogues it has mastered. We conclude that optimizing these conversational scaffolds is the primary lever for the next generation of general intelligence.

Conclusion: ReusStdFlow offers a standardized solution for automated reorganization and efficient reuse of enterprise digital assets.

Abstract: To address the ``reusability dilemma'' and structural hallucinations in enterprise Agentic AI,this paper proposes ReusStdFlow, a framework centered on a novel ``Extraction-Storage-Construction'' paradigm. The framework deconstructs heterogeneous, platform-specific Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) into standardized, modular workflow segments. It employs a dual knowledge architecture-integrating graph and vector databases-to facilitate synergistic retrieval of both topological structures and functional semantics. Finally, workflows are intelligently assembled using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy. Tested on 200 real-world n8n workflows, the system achieves over 90% accuracy in both extraction and construction. This framework provides a standardized solution for the automated reorganization and efficient reuse of enterprise digital assets.

### [343] [MAC-AMP: A Closed-Loop Multi-Agent Collaboration System for Multi-Objective Antimicrobial Peptide Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14926)
*Gen Zhou,Sugitha Janarthanan,Lianghong Chen,Pingzhao Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAC-AMP is a closed-loop multi-agent collaboration system for designing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) using AI, outperforming other models in optimizing key properties like activity, toxicity, and novelty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of antimicrobial resistance necessitates innovative solutions. AMPs offer promise, but current AI-driven design models lack balance in key goals and interpretability.

Method: Uses multi-agent LLMs in a closed-loop system with autonomous peer review and adaptive reinforcement learning, requiring only a task description and dataset.

Result: MAC-AMP excels in optimizing AMP properties (antibacterial activity, toxicity compliance, etc.) and outperforms existing models.

Conclusion: The MAC-AMP system demonstrates the potential of multi-agent AI collaboration for explainable, multi-objective AMP design with broad applicability.

Abstract: To address the global health threat of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are being explored for their potent and promising ability to fight resistant pathogens. While artificial intelligence (AI) is being employed to advance AMP discovery and design, most AMP design models struggle to balance key goals like activity, toxicity, and novelty, using rigid or unclear scoring methods that make results hard to interpret and optimize. As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) advance and evolve swiftly, we turn to AI multi-agent collaboration based on such models (multi-agent LLMs), which show rapidly rising potential in complex scientific design scenarios. Based on this, we introduce MAC-AMP, a closed-loop multi-agent collaboration (MAC) system for multi-objective AMP design. The system implements a fully autonomous simulated peer review-adaptive reinforcement learning framework that requires only a task description and example dataset to design novel AMPs. The novelty of our work lies in introducing a closed-loop multi-agent system for AMP design, with cross-domain transferability, that supports multi-objective optimization while remaining explainable rather than a 'black box'. Experiments show that MAC-AMP outperforms other AMP generative models by effectively optimizing AMP generation for multiple key molecular properties, demonstrating exceptional results in antibacterial activity, AMP likeliness, toxicity compliance, and structural reliability.

*Shakil M. Khan,Asim Mehmood,Sandra Zilles*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes two definitions of primary cause in a hybrid action-theoretic framework, proving their equivalence and validating their intuitive properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in formal accounts of actual causation, particularly in hybrid systems where change can be both discrete and continuous.

Method: The authors introduce two definitions of primary cause within the hybrid temporal situation calculus and prove their equivalence using a modified 'but-for' test.

Result: The paper demonstrates that the proposed definitions of causation are equivalent and possess intuitively justifiable properties.

Conclusion: This work advances the understanding of actual causation in hybrid systems, providing a formal and intuitive framework for reasoning about causes in such environments.

Abstract: Reasoning about actual causes of observed effects is fundamental to the study of rationality. This important problem has been studied since the time of Aristotle, with formal mathematical accounts emerging recently. We live in a world where change due to actions can be both discrete and continuous, that is, hybrid. Yet, despite extensive research on actual causation, only few recent studies looked into causation with continuous change. Building on recent progress, in this paper we propose two definitions of primary cause in a hybrid action-theoretic framework, namely the hybrid temporal situation calculus. One of these is foundational in nature while the other formalizes causation through contributions, which can then be verified from a counterfactual perspective using a modified ``but-for'' test. We prove that these two definitions are indeed equivalent. We then show that our definitions of causation have some intuitively justifiable properties.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the growing importance of non-U.S. bio-pharmaceutical innovations and introduces a benchmarking methodology and a Bioptic Agent for comprehensive drug asset scouting, outperforming existing AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift in bio-pharmaceutical innovation to non-U.S. regions and non-English channels creates risks for investors and business teams, necessitating better tools for high-recall discovery.

Method: A benchmarking methodology is proposed, using multilingual multi-agent pipelines and expert-generated queries. A self-learning Bioptic Agent is tuned for complete, non-hallucinated scouting.

Result: The Bioptic Agent achieves 79.7% F1, outperforming other models like Claude Opus 4.6 (56.2%) and GPT-5.2 Pro (46.6%), with performance improving with additional compute.

Conclusion: The Bioptic Agent demonstrates superior performance in drug asset scouting, highlighting the potential of advanced AI models in addressing high-stakes, multilingual challenges.

Abstract: Bio-pharmaceutical innovation has shifted: many new drug assets now originate outside the United States and are disclosed primarily via regional, non-English channels. Recent data suggests >85% of patent filings originate outside the U.S., with China accounting for nearly half of the global total; a growing share of scholarly output is also non-U.S. Industry estimates put China at ~30% of global drug development, spanning 1,200+ novel candidates. In this high-stakes environment, failing to surface "under-the-radar" assets creates multi-billion-dollar risk for investors and business development teams, making asset scouting a coverage-critical competition where speed and completeness drive value. Yet today's Deep Research AI agents still lag human experts in achieving high-recall discovery across heterogeneous, multilingual sources without hallucinations.
  We propose a benchmarking methodology for drug asset scouting and a tuned, tree-based self-learning Bioptic Agent aimed at complete, non-hallucinated scouting. We construct a challenging completeness benchmark using a multilingual multi-agent pipeline: complex user queries paired with ground-truth assets that are largely outside U.S.-centric radar. To reflect real deal complexity, we collected screening queries from expert investors, BD, and VC professionals and used them as priors to conditionally generate benchmark queries. For grading, we use LLM-as-judge evaluation calibrated to expert opinions. We compare Bioptic Agent against Claude Opus 4.6, OpenAI GPT-5.2 Pro, Perplexity Deep Research, Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research, and Exa Websets. Bioptic Agent achieves 79.7% F1 versus 56.2% (Claude Opus 4.6), 50.6% (Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research), 46.6% (GPT-5.2 Pro), 44.2% (Perplexity Deep Research), and 26.9% (Exa Websets). Performance improves steeply with additional compute, supporting the view that more compute yields better results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of rigid heuristic methods in Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for generative models, which often fail to generalize across tasks and modalities.

Method: Introduces Directional Concentration Uncertainty (DCU), a statistical procedure based on the von Mises-Fisher distribution, measuring geometric dispersion of model outputs.

Result: DCU matches or exceeds calibration levels of prior methods like semantic entropy and generalizes well to complex multi-modal tasks.

Conclusion: DCU demonstrates significant potential for integration into UQ frameworks for multi-modal and agentic systems.

Abstract: In the critical task of making generative models trustworthy and robust, methods for Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) have begun to show encouraging potential. However, many of these methods rely on rigid heuristics that fail to generalize across tasks and modalities. Here, we propose a novel framework for UQ that is highly flexible and approaches or surpasses the performance of prior heuristic methods. We introduce Directional Concentration Uncertainty (DCU), a novel statistical procedure for quantifying the concentration of embeddings based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution. Our method captures uncertainty by measuring the geometric dispersion of multiple generated outputs from a language model using continuous embeddings of the generated outputs without any task specific heuristics. In our experiments, we show that DCU matches or exceeds calibration levels of prior works like semantic entropy (Kuhn et al., 2023) and also generalizes well to more complex tasks in multi-modal domains. We present a framework for the wider potential of DCU and its implications for integration into UQ for multi-modal and agentic frameworks.

TL;DR: Blueprint is a layout-aware multimodal retrieval system for engineering archives, improving search accuracy over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legacy engineering archives lack consistent metadata, making retrieval difficult and manual.

Method: Blueprint uses region detection, OCR, identifier normalization, and combines lexical and dense retrieval with reranking.

Result: It achieves a 10.1% absolute gain in Success@3 and 18.9% relative improvement in nDCG@3.

Conclusion: Blueprint effectively automates metadata extraction and improves searchability for engineering archives.

Abstract: Decades of engineering drawings and technical records remain locked in legacy archives with inconsistent or missing metadata, making retrieval difficult and often manual. We present Blueprint, a layout-aware multimodal retrieval system designed for large-scale engineering repositories. Blueprint detects canonical drawing regions, applies region-restricted VLM-based OCR, normalizes identifiers (e.g., DWG, part, facility), and fuses lexical and dense retrieval with a lightweight region-level reranker. Deployed on ~770k unlabeled files, it automatically produces structured metadata suitable for cross-facility search.
  We evaluate Blueprint on a 5k-file benchmark with 350 expert-curated queries using pooled, graded (0/1/2) relevance judgments. Blueprint delivers a 10.1% absolute gain in Success@3 and an 18.9% relative improvement in nDCG@3 over the strongest vision-language baseline}, consistently outperforming across vision, text, and multimodal intents. Oracle ablations reveal substantial headroom under perfect region detection and OCR. We release all queries, runs, annotations, and code to facilitate reproducible evaluation on legacy engineering archives.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of small datasets like MNIST in distinguishing advanced neural architectures and to explore inductive biases in sequential data.

Method: Performance evaluation of ResNet, TCN, and DCNN on MNIST-1D, benchmarked against simpler models (logistic regression, MLPs, CNNs, GRUs).

Result: TCN and DCNN outperform simpler models, achieving near-human performance. ResNet also shows significant improvements.

Conclusion: MNIST-1D is a robust benchmark for evaluating architectures under constraints, highlighting the importance of architectural innovations and hierarchical feature extraction.

Abstract: Small datasets like MNIST have historically been instrumental in advancing machine learning research by providing a controlled environment for rapid experimentation and model evaluation. However, their simplicity often limits their utility for distinguishing between advanced neural network architectures. To address these challenges, Greydanus et al. introduced the MNIST-1D dataset, a one-dimensional adaptation of MNIST designed to explore inductive biases in sequential data. This dataset maintains the advantages of small-scale datasets while introducing variability and complexity that make it ideal for studying advanced architectures.
  In this paper, we extend the exploration of MNIST-1D by evaluating the performance of Residual Networks (ResNet), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN). These models, known for their ability to capture sequential patterns and hierarchical features, were implemented and benchmarked alongside previously tested architectures such as logistic regression, MLPs, CNNs, and GRUs. Our experimental results demonstrate that advanced architectures like TCN and DCNN consistently outperform simpler models, achieving near-human performance on MNIST-1D. ResNet also shows significant improvements, highlighting the importance of leveraging inductive biases and hierarchical feature extraction in small structured datasets.
  Through this study, we validate the utility of MNIST-1D as a robust benchmark for evaluating machine learning architectures under computational constraints. Our findings emphasize the role of architectural innovations in improving model performance and offer insights into optimizing deep learning models for resource-limited environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the speed-up factor, a new metric for evaluating active learning query methods, showing its accuracy and stability compared to existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active learning improves performance with fewer annotations, but lacks appropriate metrics for evaluating iterative query methods. The speed-up factor addresses this gap.

Method: The authors review AL evaluation literature, formally define the speed-up factor, and empirically test it using four datasets and seven query methods.

Result: The speed-up factor accurately captures the fraction of samples needed to match random sampling performance and shows superior stability across iterations.

Conclusion: The speed-up factor is a reliable and effective metric for evaluating active learning query methods, outperforming existing state-of-the-art metrics.

Abstract: Machine learning models excel with abundant annotated data, but annotation is often costly and time-intensive. Active learning (AL) aims to improve the performance-to-annotation ratio by using query methods (QMs) to iteratively select the most informative samples. While AL research focuses mainly on QM development, the evaluation of this iterative process lacks appropriate performance metrics. This work reviews eight years of AL evaluation literature and formally introduces the speed-up factor, a quantitative multi-iteration QM performance metric that indicates the fraction of samples needed to match random sampling performance. Using four datasets from diverse domains and seven QMs of various types, we empirically evaluate the speed-up factor and compare it with state-of-the-art AL performance metrics. The results confirm the assumptions underlying the speed-up factor, demonstrate its accuracy in capturing the described fraction, and reveal its superior stability across iterations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-efficient framework accelerates cryoprotectant agent (CPA) cocktail design by combining high-throughput screening with multi-objective Bayesian optimization, achieving high CPA concentrations and cell viability while reducing experimental time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in designing CPA cocktails that are concentrated enough to prevent ice formation but non-toxic to preserve cell viability. Traditional methods are slow and rely on intuition or exhaustive testing.

Method: The framework uses high-throughput screening and an active-learning loop with multi-objective Bayesian optimization. Probabilistic surrogate models predict CPA concentration and viability, prioritizing experiments that improve the Pareto front.

Result: The approach outperforms naive strategies and strong baselines, improving dominated hypervolume by 9.5% and 4.5%, respectively, and reducing required experiments. Synthetic studies show it recovers Pareto-optimal solutions with 30% fewer evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework efficiently discovers high-quality CPA cocktails and can be adapted for different CPA libraries, objectives, and cell lines, accelerating cryopreservation development.

Abstract: Designing cryoprotectant agent (CPA) cocktails for vitrification is challenging because formulations must be concentrated enough to suppress ice formation yet non-toxic enough to preserve cell viability. This tradeoff creates a large, multi-objective design space in which traditional discovery is slow, often relying on expert intuition or exhaustive experimentation. We present a data-efficient framework that accelerates CPA cocktail design by combining high-throughput screening with an active-learning loop based on multi-objective Bayesian optimization. From an initial set of measured cocktails, we train probabilistic surrogate models to predict concentration and viability and quantify uncertainty across candidate formulations. We then iteratively select the next experiments by prioritizing cocktails expected to improve the Pareto front, maximizing expected Pareto improvement under uncertainty, and update the models as new assay results are collected. Wet-lab validation shows that our approach efficiently discovers cocktails that simultaneously achieve high CPA concentrations and high post-exposure viability. Relative to a naive strategy and a strong baseline, our method improves dominated hypervolume by 9.5\% and 4.5\%, respectively, while reducing the number of experiments needed to reach high-quality solutions. In complementary synthetic studies, it recovers a comparably strong set of Pareto-optimal solutions using only 30\% of the evaluations required by the prior state-of-the-art multi-objective approach, which amounts to saving approximately 10 weeks of experimental time. Because the framework assumes only a suitable assay and defined formulation space, it can be adapted to different CPA libraries, objective definitions, and cell lines to accelerate cryopreservation development.

### [351] [Why is Normalization Preferred? A Worst-Case Complexity Theory for Stochastically Preconditioned SGD under Heavy-Tailed Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13413)
*Yuchen Fang,James Demmel,Javad Lavaei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the worst-case complexity of stochastically preconditioned SGD (SPSGD) and its accelerated variants under heavy-tailed noise, comparing normalization and clipping. Normalization ensures convergence, while clipping may fail due to statistical dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the theoretical underpinnings of normalization and clipping in stabilizing SGD under heavy-tailed noise, common in adaptive methods like Adam and RMSProp.

Method: The authors assume finite $p$-th moment noise and analyze convergence rates for normalization and clipping in SPSGD. They develop a vector-valued Burkholder-type inequality for analysis.

Result: Normalization guarantees convergence at rates $ℓ(T^{-rac{p-1}{3p-2}})$ (known parameters) and $ℓ(T^{-rac{p-1}{2p}})$ (unknown parameters). Clipping may fail due to statistical dependencies.

Conclusion: The results explain why normalization is empirically preferred over clipping in large-scale training, providing theoretical support for its use in adaptive methods.

Abstract: We develop a worst-case complexity theory for stochastically preconditioned stochastic gradient descent (SPSGD) and its accelerated variants under heavy-tailed noise, a setting that encompasses widely used adaptive methods such as Adam, RMSProp, and Shampoo. We assume the stochastic gradient noise has a finite $p$-th moment for some $p \in (1,2]$, and measure convergence after $T$ iterations. While clipping and normalization are parallel tools for stabilizing training of SGD under heavy-tailed noise, there is a fundamental separation in their worst-case properties in stochastically preconditioned settings. We demonstrate that normalization guarantees convergence to a first-order stationary point at rate $\mathcal{O}(T^{-\frac{p-1}{3p-2}})$ when problem parameters are known, and $\mathcal{O}(T^{-\frac{p-1}{2p}})$ when problem parameters are unknown, matching the optimal rates for normalized SGD, respectively. In contrast, we prove that clipping may fail to converge in the worst case due to the statistical dependence between the stochastic preconditioner and the gradient estimates. To enable the analysis, we develop a novel vector-valued Burkholder-type inequality that may be of independent interest. These results provide a theoretical explanation for the empirical preference for normalization over clipping in large-scale model training.

TL;DR: A lightweight climate emulator (LUCIE) lacks regional detail (~300 km). A deep learning downscaling framework enhances LUCIE's resolution to ~25 km, preserving climatological accuracy using diffusion models trained on ERA5 data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LUCIE's inadequate resolution for regional assessments by downscaling its outputs while maintaining climatological accuracy.

Method: A deep learning-based downscaling framework using probabilistic diffusion models with conditional and posterior sampling, trained on ERA5 data (2000-2009) and tested on LUCIE predictions (2010-2020).

Result: The framework successfully preserves LUCIE's coarse dynamics and achieves fine-scale (~25 km) climatological statistics, validated by multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The downscaling approach effectively improves LUCIE's resolution for regional impact assessments without compromising climatological consistency.

Abstract: The proliferation of data-driven models in weather and climate sciences has marked a significant paradigm shift, with advanced models demonstrating exceptional skill in medium-range forecasting. However, these models are often limited by long-term instabilities, climatological drift, and substantial computational costs during training and inference, restricting their broader application for climate studies. Addressing these limitations, Guan et al. (2024) introduced LUCIE, a lightweight, physically consistent climate emulator utilizing a Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) architecture. This model is able to reproduce accurate long-term statistics including climatological mean and seasonal variability. However, LUCIE's native resolution (~300 km) is inadequate for detailed regional impact assessments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a deep learning-based downscaling framework, leveraging probabilistic diffusion-based generative models with conditional and posterior sampling frameworks. These models downscale coarse LUCIE outputs to 25 km resolution. They are trained on approximately 14,000 ERA5 timesteps spanning 2000-2009 and evaluated on LUCIE predictions from 2010 to 2020. Model performance is assessed through diverse metrics, including latitude-averaged RMSE, power spectrum, probability density functions and First Empirical Orthogonal Function of the zonal wind. We observe that the proposed approach is able to preserve the coarse-grained dynamics from LUCIE while generating fine-scaled climatological statistics at ~28km resolution.

*Karish Grover,Hanqing Zeng,Yinglong Xia,Christos Faloutsos,Geoffrey J. Gordon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Texture, a text-native curvature signal, demonstrating that language has inherent curvature, defining it via context beliefs, and showing its practical utility in tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses whether text has intrinsic curvature, a question unresolved despite language being modeled in curved geometries. It aims to define curvature natively for language rather than as an embedding artifact.

Method: The authors propose Texture, a word-level discrete curvature signal, defined by reconciling left- and right-context beliefs using a Schrodinger bridge. They validate its existence empirically and theoretically.

Result: Texture reveals non-flat semantic inference in language, with positive curvature where context focuses meaning and negative where it diverges. It improves tasks like long-context inference and retrieval-augmented generation.

Conclusion: The study establishes a text-native curvature paradigm, making curvature measurable and actionable without geometric training, advancing understanding and application of curvature in language.

Abstract: Does text have an intrinsic curvature? Language is increasingly modeled in curved geometries - hyperbolic spaces for hierarchy, mixed-curvature manifolds for compositional structure - yet a basic scientific question remains unresolved: what does curvature mean for text itself, in a way that is native to language rather than an artifact of the embedding space we choose? We argue that text does indeed have curvature, and show how to detect it, define it, and use it. To this end, we propose Texture, a text-native, word-level discrete curvature signal, and make three contributions. (a) Existence: We provide empirical and theoretical certificates that semantic inference in natural corpora is non-flat, i.e. language has inherent curvature. (b) Definition: We define Texture by reconciling left- and right-context beliefs around a masked word through a Schrodinger bridge, yielding a curvature field that is positive where context focuses meaning and negative where it fans out into competing continuations. (c) Utility: Texture is actionable: it serves as a general-purpose measurement and control primitive enabling geometry without geometric training; we instantiate it on two representative tasks, improving long-context inference through curvature-guided compression and retrieval-augmented generation through curvature-guided routing. Together, our results establish a text-native curvature paradigm, making curvature measurable and practically useful.

Abstract: Selecting an optimal classification model requires a robust and comprehensive understanding of the performance of the model. This paper provides a tutorial on the PyCM library, demonstrating its utility in conducting deep-dive evaluations of multi-class classifiers. By examining two different case scenarios, we illustrate how the choice of evaluation metrics can fundamentally shift the interpretation of a model's efficacy. Our findings emphasize that a multi-dimensional evaluation framework is essential for uncovering small but important differences in model performance. However, standard metrics may miss these subtle performance trade-offs.

*Gabriel Franco,Lucas M. Tassis,Azalea Rohr,Mark Crovella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption of a single stable circuit per task in language models, showing that circuits are prompt-specific. It introduces ACC++, refining causal signal extraction for cleaner circuits, and demonstrates varied mechanisms across prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the internal circuits of language models by focusing on prompt-specific mechanisms rather than averaging across tasks.

Method: Introduces ACC++, an improved version of ACC, to extract cleaner causal signals from attention heads without needing replacement models or activation patching. Applied to IOI tasks in GPT-2, Pythia, and Gemma 2.

Result: Found no single circuit for IOI in any model; prompt templates induce different mechanisms. However, prompts cluster into families with similar circuits.

Conclusion: Recasts circuits as prompt-specific, enabling scalable descriptions and automated interpretability pipelines for understanding model behavior.

Abstract: Understanding the internal circuits that language models use to solve tasks remains a central challenge in mechanistic interpretability. Most prior work identifies circuits at the task level by averaging across many prompts, implicitly assuming a single stable mechanism per task. We show that this assumption can obscure a crucial source of structure: circuits are prompt-specific, even within a fixed task. Building on attention causal communication (ACC) (Franco & Crovella, 2025), we introduce ACC++, refinements that extract cleaner, lower-dimensional causal signals inside attention heads from a single forward pass. Like ACC, our approach does not require replacement models (e.g., SAEs) or activation patching; ACC++ further improves circuit precision by reducing attribution noise. Applying ACC++ to indirect object identification (IOI) in GPT-2, Pythia, and Gemma 2, we find there is no single circuit for IOI in any model: different prompt templates induce systematically different mechanisms. Despite this variation, prompts cluster into prompt families with similar circuits, and we propose a representative circuit for each family as a practical unit of analysis. Finally, we develop an automated interpretability pipeline that uses ACC++ signals to surface human-interpretable features and assemble mechanistic explanations for prompt families behavior. Together, our results recast circuits as a meaningful object of study by shifting the unit of analysis from tasks to prompts, enabling scalable circuit descriptions in the presence of prompt-specific mechanisms.

*Ayse Tursucular,Ayush Mohanty,Nazal Mohamed,Nagi Gebraeel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated framework learns temporal interdependencies in decentralized nonlinear systems, ensuring privacy, scalability, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand temporal interdependencies in subsystems monitored by distributed sensors, where raw data cannot be shared and models are fixed.

Method: Clients use nonlinear state space models to map observations to latent states; a server learns a graph-structured neural transition model using Graph Attention Networks.

Result: Achieves theoretical convergence, interpretable cross-client interdependencies, and comparable performance to decentralized baselines in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges of privacy, scalability, and interpretability in decentralized nonlinear systems.

Abstract: Networks of modern industrial systems are increasingly monitored by distributed sensors, where each system comprises multiple subsystems generating high dimensional time series data. These subsystems are often interdependent, making it important to understand how temporal patterns at one subsystem relate to others. This is challenging in decentralized settings where raw measurements cannot be shared and client observations are heterogeneous. In practical deployments each subsystem (client) operates a fixed proprietary model that cannot be modified or retrained, limiting existing approaches. Nonlinear dynamics further make cross client temporal interdependencies difficult to interpret because they are embedded in nonlinear state transition functions. We present a federated framework for learning temporal interdependencies across clients under these constraints. Each client maps high dimensional local observations to low dimensional latent states using a nonlinear state space model. A central server learns a graph structured neural state transition model over the communicated latent states using a Graph Attention Network. For interpretability we relate the Jacobian of the learned server side transition model to attention coefficients, providing the first interpretable characterization of cross client temporal interdependencies in decentralized nonlinear systems. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees to a centralized oracle and validate the framework through synthetic experiments demonstrating convergence, interpretability, scalability and privacy. Additional real world experiments show performance comparable to decentralized baselines.

*Fei Wu,Jia Hu,Geyong Min,Shiqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedLoRA addresses client heterogeneity in federated learning but suffers from rank collapse. The paper proposes raFLoRA to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Client heterogeneity in system resources and data distributions necessitates heterogeneous LoRA ranks, but leads to rank collapse.

Method: Proposes raFLoRA, a rank-partitioned aggregation method that weights updates by effective client contributions.

Result: raFLoRA prevents rank collapse, improves performance, and maintains communication efficiency.

Conclusion: raFLoRA effectively addresses the limitations of FedLoRA in heterogeneous settings.

Abstract: Federated low-rank adaptation (FedLoRA) has facilitated communication-efficient and privacy-preserving fine-tuning of foundation models for downstream tasks. In practical federated learning scenarios, client heterogeneity in system resources and data distributions motivates heterogeneous LoRA ranks across clients. We identify a previously overlooked phenomenon in heterogeneous FedLoRA, termed rank collapse, where the energy of the global update concentrates on the minimum shared rank, resulting in suboptimal performance and high sensitivity to rank configurations. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the root cause of rank collapse: a mismatch between rank-agnostic aggregation weights and rank-dependent client contributions, which systematically suppresses higher-rank updates at a geometric rate over rounds. Motivated by this insight, we propose raFLoRA, a rank-partitioned aggregation method that decomposes local updates into rank partitions and then aggregates each partition weighted by its effective client contributions. Extensive experiments across classification and reasoning tasks show that raFLoRA prevents rank collapse, improves model performance, and preserves communication efficiency compared to state-of-the-art FedLoRA baselines.

### [358] [TrasMuon: Trust-Region Adaptive Scaling for Orthogonalized Momentum Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13498)
*Peng Cheng,Jiucheng Zang,Qingnan Li,Liheng Ma,Yufei Cui,Yingxue Zhang,Boxing Chen,Ming Jian,Wen Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TrasMuon improves Muon-style optimizers by stabilizing magnitudes via global RMS calibration and trust-region clipping, achieving faster convergence and better stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon-style optimizers discard magnitude information, making training sensitive to step-size and prone to instability. TrasMuon aims to mitigate this while preserving beneficial update geometries.

Method: TrasMuon introduces global RMS calibration and energy-based trust-region clipping to stabilize magnitudes and confine updates to a stable zone.

Result: TrasMuon converges faster than baselines and shows superior stability, even without warmup stages.

Conclusion: TrasMuon effectively balances optimization efficiency and stability, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Muon-style optimizers leverage Newton-Schulz (NS) iterations to orthogonalize updates, yielding update geometries that often outperform Adam-series methods. However, this orthogonalization discards magnitude information, rendering training sensitive to step-size hyperparameters and vulnerable to high-energy bursts. To mitigate this, we introduce TrasMuon (\textbf{T}rust \textbf{R}egion \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{S}caling \textbf{Muon}). TrasMuon preserves the near-isometric geometry of Muon while stabilizing magnitudes through (i) global RMS calibration and (ii) energy-based trust-region clipping. We demonstrate that while reintroducing adaptive scaling improves optimization efficiency, it typically exacerbates instability due to high-energy outliers. TrasMuon addresses this by defining a trust region based on relative energy ratios, confining updates to a stable zone. Empirical experiments on vision and language models demonstrate that TrasMuon converges faster than baselines. Furthermore, experiments without warmup stages confirm TrasMuon's superior stability and robustness.

TL;DR: The paper introduces γ-weakly θ-up-concavity, a first-order condition unifying DR-submodular and OSS functions, enabling linear surrogates for approximation guarantees in optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing monotone non-convex functions broadly applicable in machine learning and combinatorial optimization.

Method: Proposes γ-weakly θ-up-concavity, constructing linear surrogates for non-linear objectives with approximation guarantees.

Result: Achieves unified approximation guarantees for offline/online optimization, improving existing coefficients for DR-submodular and OSS problems.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes existing conditions and provides stronger approximation guarantees across diverse optimization settings.

Abstract: Optimizing monotone non-convex functions is a fundamental challenge across machine learning and combinatorial optimization. We introduce and study $γ$-weakly $θ$-up-concavity, a novel first-order condition that characterizes a broad class of such functions. This condition provides a powerful unifying framework, strictly generalizing both DR-submodular functions and One-Sided Smooth (OSS) functions. Our central theoretical contribution demonstrates that $γ$-weakly $θ$-up-concave functions are upper-linearizable: for any feasible point, we can construct a linear surrogate whose gains provably approximate the original non-linear objective. This approximation holds up to a constant factor, namely the approximation coefficient, dependent solely on $γ$, $θ$, and the geometry of the feasible set. This linearizability yields immediate and unified approximation guarantees for a wide range of problems. Specifically, we obtain unified approximation guarantees for offline optimization as well as static and dynamic regret bounds in online settings via standard reductions to linear optimization. Moreover, our framework recovers the optimal approximation coefficient for DR-submodular maximization and significantly improves existing approximation coefficients for OSS optimization, particularly over matroid constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the alignment of singular vectors with features in language models, showing theoretical and empirical support for their use in feature identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to justify and understand why and when singular vectors of attention matrices align with feature representations, which is currently an assumed but unproven concept in mechanistic interpretability.

Method: The authors first demonstrate alignment in a model with observable features, then provide theoretical justification for alignment under certain conditions, and finally propose sparse attention decomposition as a practical test for alignment in real models.

Result: The research shows robust alignment of singular vectors with features in a controlled setting and validates theoretical conditions for alignment. It also provides evidence of alignment in real models through sparse attention decomposition.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that singular vectors can serve as a reliable and theoretically grounded basis for identifying features in language models, enhancing mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: Identifying feature representations in language models is a central task in mechanistic interpretability. Several recent studies have made an implicit assumption that feature representations can be inferred in some cases from singular vectors of attention matrices. However, sound justification for this assumption is lacking. In this paper we address that question, asking: why and when do singular vectors align with features? First, we demonstrate that singular vectors robustly align with features in a model where features can be directly observed. We then show theoretically that such alignment is expected under a range of conditions. We close by asking how, operationally, alignment may be recognized in real models where feature representations are not directly observable. We identify sparse attention decomposition as a testable prediction of alignment, and show evidence that it emerges in a manner consistent with predictions in real models. Together these results suggest that alignment of singular vectors with features can be a sound and theoretically justified basis for feature identification in language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QuaRK is an efficient framework combining quantum reservoir computing with kernel-based readouts for time series learning, backed by theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of implementable quantum reservoir architectures with learning guarantees in time series modeling.

Method: QuaRK uses a quantum reservoir featurizer with k-local observables (via shadow tomography) and a kernel-based readout with explicit regularization.

Result: Demonstrates scalability, flexibility, and generalization guarantees for temporal data, validated empirically.

Conclusion: QuaRK offers a reliable, scalable solution for quantum-enhanced time series learning with clear design knobs.

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing offers a promising route for time series learning by modelling sequential data via rich quantum dynamics while the only training required happens at the level of a lightweight classical readout. However, studies featuring efficient and implementable quantum reservoir architectures along with model learning guarantees remain scarce in the literature. To close this gap, we introduce QuaRK, an end-to-end framework that couples a hardware-realistic quantum reservoir featurizer with a kernel-based readout scheme. Given a sequence of sample points, the reservoir injects the points one after the other to yield a compact feature vector from efficiently measured k-local observables using classical shadow tomography, after which a classical kernel-based readout learns the target mapping with explicit regularization and fast optimization. The resulting pipeline exposes clear computational knobs -- circuit width and depth as well as the measurement budget -- while preserving the flexibility of kernel methods to model nonlinear temporal functionals and being scalable to high-dimensional data. We further provide learning-theoretic generalization guarantees for dependent temporal data, linking design and resource choices to finite-sample performance, thereby offering principled guidance for building reliable temporal learners. Empirical experiments validate QuaRK and illustrate the predicted interpolation and generalization behaviours on synthetic beta-mixing time series tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multiplication-free dimension reduction algorithm for selecting a subset of elements from input vectors, addressing the computational bottleneck of PCA in resource-constrained systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dimension reduction is essential for reducing model parameters and speeding up training/inference, but traditional methods like PCA rely on costly matrix multiplications.

Method: Proposes element selection by evaluating subsets via min mean-squared error of linear regression, using efficient swap-based local search for optimization.

Result: Effective performance demonstrated on MNIST handwritten-digit images.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a computationally efficient alternative to PCA by focusing on element selection, validated experimentally.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm for element selection, a multiplication-free form of dimension reduction that produces a dimension-reduced vector by simply selecting a subset of elements from the input. Dimension reduction is a fundamental technique for reducing unnecessary model parameters, mitigating overfitting, and accelerating training and inference. A standard approach is principal component analysis (PCA), but PCA relies on matrix multiplications; on resource-constrained systems, the multiplication count itself can become a bottleneck. Element selection eliminates this cost because the reduction consists only of selecting elements, and thus the key challenge is to determine which elements should be retained. We evaluate a candidate subset through the minimum mean-squared error of linear regression that predicts a target vector from the selected elements, where the target may be, for example, a one-hot label vector in classification. When an explicit target is unavailable, the input itself can be used as the target, yielding a reconstruction-based criterion. The resulting optimization is combinatorial, and exhaustive search is impractical. To address this, we derive an efficient formula for the objective change caused by swapping a selected and an unselected element, using the matrix inversion lemma, and we perform a swap-based local search that repeatedly applies objective-decreasing swaps until no further improvement is possible. Experiments on MNIST handwritten-digit images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WeightCaster, a framework addressing out-of-support generalization in neural networks by modeling it as a sequence task in weight space, achieving reliable and interpretable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks often fail catastrophically on out-of-support samples, producing unrealistic yet confident predictions, which limits their reliability in safety-critical applications.

Method: The approach reformulates out-of-support generalization as a sequence modeling task in weight space, partitioning the training set into concentric shells for discrete sequential steps.

Result: WeightCaster delivers plausible, interpretable, and uncertainty-aware predictions efficiently, performing competitively or better than state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework enhances reliability beyond in-distribution scenarios, encouraging broader AI adoption in safety-critical fields.

Abstract: As breakthroughs in deep learning transform key industries, models are increasingly required to extrapolate on datapoints found outside the range of the training set, a challenge we coin as out-of-support (OoS) generalisation. However, neural networks frequently exhibit catastrophic failure on OoS samples, yielding unrealistic but overconfident predictions. We address this challenge by reformulating the OoS generalisation problem as a sequence modelling task in the weight space, wherein the training set is partitioned into concentric shells corresponding to discrete sequential steps. Our WeightCaster framework yields plausible, interpretable, and uncertainty-aware predictions without necessitating explicit inductive biases, all the while maintaining high computational efficiency. Emprical validation on a synthetic cosine dataset and real-world air quality sensor readings demonstrates performance competitive or superior to the state-of-the-art. By enhancing reliability beyond in-distribution scenarios, these results hold significant implications for the wider adoption of artificial intelligence in safety-critical applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepFusion is a scalable federated MoE training framework that addresses the impracticality of traditional FL for resource-constrained devices by enabling heterogeneous on-device LLM knowledge fusion via federated knowledge distillation, achieving near-centralized performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FL approaches struggle with resource-constrained devices hosting large MoE models, creating inefficiencies in privacy-preserving training.

Method: DeepFusion allows devices to independently configure and train tailored LLMs, introducing a View-Aligned Attention module for cross-architecture knowledge distillation.

Result: DeepFusion achieves performance close to centralized MoE training, reducing communication costs by up to 71% and improving perplexity by up to 5.28%.

Conclusion: DeepFusion successfully resolves the view-mismatch problem in federated MoE training, offering a practical and efficient solution for heterogeneous devices.

Abstract: Recent Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language models (LLMs) such as Qwen-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE are transforming generative AI in natural language processing. However, these models require vast and diverse training data. Federated learning (FL) addresses this challenge by leveraging private data from heterogeneous edge devices for privacy-preserving MoE training. Nonetheless, traditional FL approaches require devices to host local MoE models, which is impractical for resource-constrained devices due to large model sizes. To address this, we propose DeepFusion, the first scalable federated MoE training framework that enables the fusion of heterogeneous on-device LLM knowledge via federated knowledge distillation, yielding a knowledge-abundant global MoE model. Specifically, DeepFusion features each device to independently configure and train an on-device LLM tailored to its own needs and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we propose a novel View-Aligned Attention (VAA) module that integrates multi-stage feature representations from the global MoE model to construct a predictive perspective aligned with on-device LLMs, thereby enabling effective cross-architecture knowledge distillation. By explicitly aligning predictive perspectives, VAA resolves the view-mismatch problem in traditional federated knowledge distillation, which arises from heterogeneity in model architectures and prediction behaviors between on-device LLMs and the global MoE model. Experiments with industry-level MoE models (Qwen-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE) and real-world datasets (medical and finance) demonstrate that DeepFusion achieves performance close to centralized MoE training. Compared with key federated MoE baselines, DeepFusion reduces communication costs by up to 71% and improves token perplexity by up to 5.28%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fluid-agent environment framework in MARL, where agents can dynamically spawn, and evaluates its performance using game-theoretic concepts and experiments on established benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the limitation of fixed-agent populations in MARL by exploring dynamic agent creation, reflecting real-world scenarios like cell division or company spin-offs.

Method: Proposes a fluid-agent environment framework, defines game-theoretic solution concepts for it, and evaluates MARL algorithms using fluid variants of benchmarks (e.g., Predator-Prey) and a new environment.

Result: Demonstrates that dynamic agent spawning enables teams to adjust their size based on environmental demands, unlocking novel strategies beyond fixed-population settings.

Conclusion: The fluid-agent framework enhances MARL by allowing adaptable agent populations, better mimicking real-world complexities.

Abstract: The primary focus of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been to study interactions among a fixed number of agents embedded in an environment. However, in the real world, the number of agents is neither fixed nor known a priori. Moreover, an agent can decide to create other agents (for example, a cell may divide, or a company may spin off a division). In this paper, we propose a framework that allows agents to create other agents; we call this a fluid-agent environment. We present game-theoretic solution concepts for fluid-agent games and empirically evaluate the performance of several MARL algorithms within this framework. Our experiments include fluid variants of established benchmarks such as Predator-Prey and Level-Based Foraging, where agents can dynamically spawn, as well as a new environment we introduce that highlights how fluidity can unlock novel solution strategies beyond those observed in fixed-population settings. We demonstrate that this framework yields agent teams that adjust their size dynamically to match environmental demands.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interpretable clustering method using optimal multiway-split decision trees, addressing computational and interpretability issues in existing binary tree methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing binary decision tree methods for clustering suffer from high computational costs, suboptimal solutions, and poor interpretability due to overly deep structures.

Method: A 0-1 integer linear optimization model is introduced for multiway-split decision trees, combined with a one-dimensional K-means algorithm for discretizing continuous variables.

Result: The method outperforms baselines in clustering accuracy and interpretability, producing concise decision rules.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a more tractable and interpretable alternative to traditional binary decision tree clustering methods.

Abstract: Clustering serves as a vital tool for uncovering latent data structures, and achieving both high accuracy and interpretability is essential. To this end, existing methods typically construct binary decision trees by solving mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problems, often leading to significant computational costs and suboptimal solutions. Furthermore, binary decision trees frequently result in excessively deep structures, which makes them difficult to interpret. To mitigate these issues, we propose an interpretable clustering method based on optimal multiway-split decision trees, formulated as a 0-1 integer linear optimization problem. This reformulation renders the optimization problem more tractable compared to existing models. A key feature of our method is the integration of a one-dimensional K-means algorithm for the discretization of continuous variables, allowing for flexible and data-driven branching. Extensive numerical experiments on publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods in terms of clustering accuracy and interpretability. Our method yields multiway-split decision trees with concise decision rules while maintaining competitive performance across various evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents acting on external systems face risks of unintended side effects due to immediate tool effects, with no safe rollback under failures, speculation, or contention.

Method: Atomix tags each call with an epoch, tracks per-resource frontiers, and commits only when progress predicates ensure safety. Bufferable effects can be delayed, and externalized effects are tracked and compensated if aborted.

Result: Transactional retry improves task success, and frontier-gated commit enhances isolation under speculation and contention, as validated by real workloads with fault injection.

Conclusion: Atomix provides a robust solution for managing agent tool calls, ensuring progress-aware transactional semantics and mitigating risks of unintended side effects.

Abstract: LLM agents increasingly act on external systems, yet tool effects are immediate. Under failures, speculation, or contention, losing branches can leak unintended side effects with no safe rollback. We introduce Atomix, a runtime that provides progress-aware transactional semantics for agent tool calls. Atomix tags each call with an epoch, tracks per-resource frontiers, and commits only when progress predicates indicate safety; bufferable effects can be delayed, while externalized effects are tracked and compensated on abort.

### [368] [Benchmark Leakage Trap: Can We Trust LLM-based Recommendation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13626)
*Mingqiao Zhang,Qiyao Peng,Yumeng Wang,Chunyuan Liu,Hongtao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper highlights the issue of benchmark data leakage in LLM-based recommender systems, showing it artificially inflates performance metrics or degrades accuracy, depending on the relevance of leaked data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to uncover how data leakage during LLM pre-training or fine-tuning impacts the reliability of recommendation system evaluations.

Method: The authors simulate data leakage scenarios by continued pre-training of foundation models on blended corpora, including in-domain and out-of-domain user-item interactions.

Result: Experiments show domain-relevant leakage artificially boosts performance, while domain-irrelevant leakage worsens accuracy, revealing its complex impact on model evaluation.

Conclusion: Data leakage is a critical, overlooked factor in LLM-based recommendation systems that can distort true model performance.

Abstract: The expanding integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommender systems poses critical challenges to evaluation reliability. This paper identifies and investigates a previously overlooked issue: benchmark data leakage in LLM-based recommendation. This phenomenon occurs when LLMs are exposed to and potentially memorize benchmark datasets during pre-training or fine-tuning, leading to artificially inflated performance metrics that fail to reflect true model performance. To validate this phenomenon, we simulate diverse data leakage scenarios by conducting continued pre-training of foundation models on strategically blended corpora, which include user-item interactions from both in-domain and out-of-domain sources. Our experiments reveal a dual-effect of data leakage: when the leaked data is domain-relevant, it induces substantial but spurious performance gains, misleadingly exaggerating the model's capability. In contrast, domain-irrelevant leakage typically degrades recommendation accuracy, highlighting the complex and contingent nature of this contamination. Our findings reveal that data leakage acts as a critical, previously unaccounted-for factor in LLM-based recommendation, which could impact the true model performance.

### [369] [Picking the Right Specialist: Attentive Neural Process-based Selection of Task-Specialized Models as Tools for Agentic Healthcare Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14901)
*Pramit Saha,Joshua Strong,Mohammad Alsharid,Divyanshu Mishra,J. Alison Noble*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ToolSelect is introduced to improve agentic healthcare systems by adaptively selecting the best specialist model from a diverse pool for clinical queries, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialist models vary in performance across data samples, necessitating reliable model selection for agentic healthcare systems.

Method: ToolSelect uses Attentive Neural Process-based selector conditioned on queries and model summaries to choose among models, minimizing population risk.

Result: ToolSelect outperforms 10 state-of-the-art methods on ToolSelectBench, a new benchmark with 1448 queries.

Conclusion: ToolSelect effectively addresses the challenge of model selection in agentic healthcare systems, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Task-specialized models form the backbone of agentic healthcare systems, enabling the agents to answer clinical queries across tasks such as disease diagnosis, localization, and report generation. Yet, for a given task, a single "best" model rarely exists. In practice, each task is better served by multiple competing specialist models where different models excel on different data samples. As a result, for any given query, agents must reliably select the right specialist model from a heterogeneous pool of tool candidates. To this end, we introduce ToolSelect, which adaptively learns model selection for tools by minimizing a population risk over sampled specialist tool candidates using a consistent surrogate of the task-conditional selection loss. Concretely, we propose an Attentive Neural Process-based selector conditioned on the query and per-model behavioral summaries to choose among the specialist models. Motivated by the absence of any established testbed, we, for the first time, introduce an agentic Chest X-ray environment equipped with a diverse suite of task-specialized models (17 disease detection, 19 report generation, 6 visual grounding, and 13 VQA) and develop ToolSelectBench, a benchmark of 1448 queries. Our results demonstrate that ToolSelect consistently outperforms 10 SOTA methods across four different task families.

*Shuaibin Song,Kai Ming Ting,Kaifeng Zhang,Tianrun Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies overlooked node and degree distributions in networks causing over-smoothing in NAS-based graph embedding methods. It proposes a distribution-aware kernel to mitigate this, enhancing node distinguishability and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address over-smoothing in NAS-based graph embedding by incorporating overlooked node and degree distributions.

Method: Proposes a weighted distribution-aware kernel embedding nodes with their distributional characteristics.

Result: Superior community detection via spectral clustering, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The novel kernel effectively mitigates over-smoothing, preserving node distinguishability and improving performance.

Abstract: Neighborhood Aggregation Strategy (NAS) is a widely used approach in graph embedding, underpinning both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) methods. However, NAS-based methods are identified to be prone to over-smoothing-the loss of node distinguishability with increased iterations-thereby limiting their effectiveness. This paper identifies two characteristics in a network, i.e., the distributions of nodes and node degrees that are critical for expressive representation but have been overlooked in existing methods. We show that these overlooked characteristics contribute significantly to over-smoothing of NAS-methods. To address this, we propose a novel weighted distribution-aware kernel that embeds nodes while taking their distributional characteristics into consideration. Our method has three distinguishing features: (1) it is the first method to explicitly incorporate both distributional characteristics; (2) it requires no optimization; and (3) it effectively mitigates the adverse effects of over-smoothing, allowing WL to preserve node distinguishability and expressiveness even after many iterations of embedding. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior community detection performance via spectral clustering, outperforming existing graph embedding methods, including deep learning methods, on standard benchmarks.

### [371] [Joint Time Series Chain: Detecting Unusual Evolving Trend across Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13649)
*Li Zhang,Nital Patel,Xiuqi Li,Jessica Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Joint Time Series Chain (JointTSC), a new definition addressing the gap or interruption issues in time series analysis to uncover evolving trends across interrupted or related time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series chain (TSC) definitions fail to capture evolving patterns in interrupted or related time series, limiting their utility. This work aims to overcome this by proposing JointTSC.

Method: The authors define JointTSC to handle interruptions and gaps, propose an effective ranking criterion for identifying the best chain, and validate the approach empirically.

Result: The proposed JointTSC outperforms existing TSC methods in locating unusual evolving patterns, as demonstrated through evaluations and a real-life manufacturing application.

Conclusion: JointTSC successfully addresses robustness issues in interrupted time series and related pairs, offering practical utility in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Time series chain (TSC) is a recently introduced concept that captures the evolving patterns in large scale time series. Informally, a time series chain is a temporally ordered set of subsequences, in which consecutive subsequences in the chain are similar to one another, but the last and the first subsequences maybe be dissimilar. Time series chain has the great potential to reveal latent unusual evolving trend in the time series, or identify precursor of important events in a complex system. Unfortunately, existing definitions of time series chains only consider finding chains in a single time series. As a result, they are likely to miss unexpected evolving patterns in interrupted time series, or across two related time series. To address this limitation, in this work, we introduce a new definition called \textit{Joint Time Series Chain}, which is specially designed for the task of finding unexpected evolving trend across interrupted time series or two related time series. Our definition focuses on mitigating the robustness issues caused by the gap or interruption in the time series. We further propose an effective ranking criterion to identify the best chain. We demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing TSC work in locating unusual evolving patterns through extensive empirical evaluations. We further demonstrate the utility of our work with a real-life manufacturing application from Intel.

### [372] [Cumulative Utility Parity for Fair Federated Learning under Intermittent Client Participation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13651)
*Stefan Behfar,Richard Mortier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses fairness in federated learning (FL) by proposing cumulative utility parity to ensure long-term benefits per participation opportunity, rather than per-round fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FL fairness methods assume equal client participation, but real-world FL systems face intermittent and uneven participation, leading to under-representation of intermittently available clients.

Method: The authors introduce availability-normalized cumulative utility, separating physical constraints from algorithmic bias in scheduling and aggregation.

Result: Experiments on skewed, non-IID federated benchmarks show improved long-term representation parity while maintaining high performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses fairness in FL by focusing on long-term benefits, ensuring better representation for intermittently available clients.

Abstract: In real-world federated learning (FL) systems, client participation is intermittent, heterogeneous, and often correlated with data characteristics or resource constraints. Existing fairness approaches in FL primarily focus on equalizing loss or accuracy conditional on participation, implicitly assuming that clients have comparable opportunities to contribute over time. However, when participation itself is uneven, these objectives can lead to systematic under-representation of intermittently available clients, even if per-round performance appears fair. We propose cumulative utility parity, a fairness principle that evaluates whether clients receive comparable long-term benefit per participation opportunity, rather than per training round. To operationalize this notion, we introduce availability-normalized cumulative utility, which disentangles unavoidable physical constraints from avoidable algorithmic bias arising from scheduling and aggregation. Experiments on temporally skewed, non-IID federated benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially improves long-term representation parity, while maintaining near-perfect performance.

### [373] [Zero-Order Optimization for LLM Fine-Tuning via Learnable Direction Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13659)
*Valery Parfenov,Grigoriy Evseev,Andrey Veprikov,Nikolay Bushkov,Stanislav Moiseev,Aleksandr Beznosikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a policy-driven zero-order (ZO) framework to reduce memory demands in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) by learning adaptive sampling distributions for directional derivatives, improving performance over traditional ZO methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs is resource-intensive due to memory demands from backpropagation and optimizer states. Zero-order methods offer memory savings but suffer from high variance and dimensionality dependence, limiting their practicality.

Method: The authors introduce a policy-driven ZO framework where the sampling distribution for perturbation directions is treated as a learnable policy. This policy is updated to reduce variance in gradient estimates.

Result: Theoretical analysis confirms improved gradient quality and relaxed dependence on dimensionality in convergence bounds. Empirical validation shows better performance on LLM fine-tuning benchmarks compared to standard ZO methods.

Conclusion: Adaptive direction sampling is a promising approach for scaling ZO fine-tuning of LLMs, offering memory efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models (LLMs) is a cornerstone of modern NLP, yet its growing memory demands (driven by backpropagation and large optimizer States) limit deployment in resource-constrained settings. Zero-order (ZO) methods bypass backpropagation by estimating directional derivatives from forward evaluations, offering substantial memory savings. However, classical ZO estimators suffer from high variance and an adverse dependence on the parameter dimensionality $d$, which has constrained their use to low-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose a policy-driven ZO framework that treats the sampling distribution over perturbation directions as a learnable policy and updates it to reduce the variance of directional estimates. We develop a practical algorithm implementing this idea and provide a theoretical analysis, showing that learned sampling distributions improve the quality of gradient information and relax the explicit dependence on $d$ in convergence bounds. Empirically, we validate the approach on challenging LLM fine-tuning benchmarks, demonstrating substantially improved performance compared to standard ZO baselines. Our results suggest that adaptive direction sampling is a promising route to make ZO fine-tuning viable at scale. The source code is available at https://github.com/brain-lab-research/zo_ldsd

*Jiayi Huang,Amirmohammad Farzaneh,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OCE-RCPS introduces a novel framework for safety-critical applications, providing high-probability guarantees on OCE risk measures like CVaR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of conventional risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) in capturing tail behavior and worst-case scenarios crucial for high-stakes settings.

Method: The method leverages upper confidence bounds to identify prediction set parameters that meet user-specified risk tolerance with provable reliability.

Result: Experiments show OCE-RCPS consistently meets target satisfaction rates across risk measures, unlike OCE-CRC.

Conclusion: OCE-RCPS effectively provides probabilistic guarantees for loss functions like miscoverage and false negative rate.

Abstract: In safety-critical applications such as medical image segmentation, prediction systems must provide reliability guarantees that extend beyond conventional expected loss control. While risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) offer probabilistic guarantees on the expected risk, they fail to capture tail behavior and worst-case scenarios that are crucial in high-stakes settings. This paper introduces optimized certainty equivalent RCPS (OCE-RCPS), a novel framework that provides high-probability guarantees on general optimized certainty equivalent (OCE) risk measures, including conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) and entropic risk. OCE-RCPS leverages upper confidence bounds to identify prediction set parameters that satisfy user-specified risk tolerance levels with provable reliability. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that OCE-RCPS satisfies the desired probabilistic constraint for loss functions such as miscoverage and false negative rate. Experiments on image segmentation demonstrate that OCE-RCPS consistently meets target satisfaction rates across various risk measures and reliability configurations, while OCE-CRC fails to provide probabilistic guarantees.

### [375] [ALMo: Interactive Aim-Limit-Defined, Multi-Objective System for Personalized High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy Treatment Planning and Visualization for Cervical Cancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13666)
*Edward Chen,Natalie Dullerud,Pang Wei Koh,Thomas Niedermayr,Elizabeth Kidd,Sanmi Koyejo,Carlos Guestrin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALMo is an interactive decision support system for HDR brachytherapy planning in cervical cancer, automating parameter setup and enabling clinician control over toxicity risks, improving plan quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinicians face cognitive challenges in balancing high-dimensional tradeoffs in clinical decision-making, especially in HDR brachytherapy where managing radiation hot spots and tumor coverage is critical.

Method: ALMo uses a novel optimization framework to minimize manual input, automate parameter setup, and allow clinicians to manipulate aim and limit values for navigating dosimetric tradeoffs.

Result: In 25 clinical cases, ALMo improved plan quality in 65% of cases and reduced planning time to ~17 minutes (vs. 30-60 minutes conventionally).

Conclusion: ALMo offers a generalized framework for efficient, high-quality multi-criteria clinical decision-making, validated in brachytherapy but applicable to other contexts.

Abstract: In complex clinical decision-making, clinicians must often track a variety of competing metrics defined by aim (ideal) and limit (strict) thresholds. Sifting through these high-dimensional tradeoffs to infer the optimal patient-specific strategy is cognitively demanding and historically prone to variability. In this paper, we address this challenge within the context of High-Dose-Rate (HDR) brachytherapy for cervical cancer, where planning requires strictly managing radiation hot spots while balancing tumor coverage against organ sparing. We present ALMo (Aim-Limit-defined Multi-Objective system), an interactive decision support system designed to infer and operationalize clinician intent. ALMo employs a novel optimization framework that minimizes manual input through automated parameter setup and enables flexible control over toxicity risks. Crucially, the system allows clinicians to navigate the Pareto surface of dosimetric tradeoffs by directly manipulating intuitive aim and limit values. In a retrospective evaluation of 25 clinical cases, ALMo generated treatment plans that consistently met or exceeded manual planning quality, with 65% of cases demonstrating dosimetric improvements. Furthermore, the system significantly enhanced efficiency, reducing average planning time to approximately 17 minutes, compared to the conventional 30-60 minutes. While validated in brachytherapy, ALMo demonstrates a generalized framework for streamlining interaction in multi-criteria clinical decision-making.

*Binyu Zhao,Wei Zhang,Xingrui Yu,Zhaonian Zou,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes VILA, a dual-branch framework addressing the trade-off in class-incremental learning with pre-trained models by using vision-language calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class-incremental learning with pre-trained models struggles with balancing adaptation and stability, particularly due to representation rigidity.

Method: VILA introduces a dual-branch framework with geometric calibration at the feature level and cross-modal priors at the decision level.

Result: VILA outperforms benchmarks, especially in fine-grained and long-sequence scenarios, maintaining efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: VILA harmonizes analytic learning's efficiency with high-fidelity prediction, offering a scalable solution.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) with pre-trained models (PTMs) faces a critical trade-off between efficient adaptation and long-term stability. While analytic learning enables rapid, recursive closed-form updates, its efficacy is often compromised by accumulated errors and feature incompatibility. In this paper, we first conduct a systematic study to dissect the failure modes of PTM-based analytic CIL, identifying representation rigidity as the primary bottleneck. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{VILA}, a novel dual-branch framework that advances analytic CIL via a two-level vision-language calibration strategy. Specifically, we coherently fuse plastic, task-adapted features with a frozen, universal semantic anchor at the feature level through geometric calibration, and leverage cross-modal priors at the decision level to rectify prediction bias. This confluence maintains analytic-learning's extreme efficiency while overcoming its inherent brittleness. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that VILA consistently yields superior performance, particularly in fine-grained and long-sequence scenarios. Our framework harmonizes high-fidelity prediction with the simplicity of analytic learning. Our code is available at https://github.com/byzhaoAI/VILA

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores sparsification--approximation trade-offs for Correlation Clustering (CC), identifying key structural differences between pseudometric and general weighted instances. Positive results include optimal coresets and efficient solvers, while negative results show limitations without pseudometric structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how much edge information is necessary to retain theoretical guarantees for Correlation Clustering, given the impracticality of large-scale constraints.

Method: The study uses a structural dichotomy approach, analyzing pseudometric vs. general weighted instances. Techniques include VC dimension analysis, cutting-plane solvers, and LP-PIVOT sparsification.

Result: Positive results include optimal coresets, efficient solvers, and a robust approximation. Negative results show unbounded approximation ratios without pseudometric structure.

Conclusion: Pseudometric structure is crucial for both tractability and robustness in Correlation Clustering, with optimal edge thresholds identified.

Abstract: Correlation Clustering (CC) is a fundamental unsupervised learning primitive whose strongest LP-based approximation guarantees require $Θ(n^3)$ triangle inequality constraints and are prohibitive at scale. We initiate the study of \emph{sparsification--approximation trade-offs} for CC, asking how much edge information is needed to retain LP-based guarantees. We establish a structural dichotomy between pseudometric and general weighted instances. On the positive side, we prove that the VC dimension of the clustering disagreement class is exactly $n{-}1$, yielding additive $\varepsilon$-coresets of optimal size $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$; that at most $\binom{n}{2}$ triangle inequalities are active at any LP vertex, enabling an exact cutting-plane solver; and that a sparsified variant of LP-PIVOT, which imputes missing LP marginals via triangle inequalities, achieves a robust $\frac{10}{3}$-approximation (up to an additive term controlled by an empirically computable imputation-quality statistic $\overlineΓ_w$) once $\tildeΘ(n^{3/2})$ edges are observed, a threshold we prove is sharp. On the negative side, we show via Yao's minimax principle that without pseudometric structure, any algorithm observing $o(n)$ uniformly random edges incurs an unbounded approximation ratio, demonstrating that the pseudometric condition governs not only tractability but also the robustness of CC to incomplete information.

*Aritra Das,Yashas Shende,Muskaan Chugh,Reva Laxmi Chauhan,Arghya Pathak,Debayan Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework using divergence-free and E(3)-equivariance constraints improves magnetic-anomaly navigation by addressing stochastic noise and ensuring physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Magnetic-anomaly navigation is hindered by aircraft-induced noise and stochastic corruption, requiring methods that adhere to physical laws.

Method: A neural network outputs a vector potential (A), defining the magnetic field as its curl. E(3)-equivariance is enforced via spherical harmonics. Synthetic datasets are generated using WMM and GANs.

Result: The framework outperforms classical and unconstrained deep learning methods, improving predictive accuracy and physical plausibility.

Conclusion: Physics-based constraints enhance magnetic-anomaly navigation, with the Contiformer architecture excelling due to continuous-time dynamics and long-term memory.

Abstract: Magnetic-anomaly navigation, leveraging small-scale variations in the Earth's magnetic field, is a promising alternative when GPS is unavailable or compromised. Airborne systems face a key challenge in extracting geomagnetic field data: the aircraft itself induces magnetic noise. Although the classical Tolles-Lawson model addresses this, it inadequately handles stochastically corrupted magnetic data required for navigation. To address stochastic noise, we propose a framework based on two physics-based constraints: divergence-free vector field and E(3)-equivariance. These ensure the learned magnetic field obeys Maxwell's equations and that outputs transform correctly with sensor position/orientation. The divergence-free constraint is implemented by training a neural network to output a vector potential $A$, with the magnetic field defined as its curl. For E(3)-equivariance, we use tensor products of geometric tensors representable via spherical harmonics with known rotational transformations. Enforcing physical consistency and restricting the admissible function space acts as an implicit regularizer that improves spatio-temporal performance. We present ablation studies evaluating each constraint alone and jointly across CNNs, MLPs, Liquid Time Constant models, and Contiformers. Continuous-time dynamics and long-term memory are critical for modelling magnetic time series; the Contiformer architecture, which provides both, outperforms state-of-the-art methods. To mitigate data scarcity, we generate synthetic datasets using the World Magnetic Model (WMM) with time-series conditional GANs, producing realistic, temporally consistent magnetic sequences across varied trajectories and environments. Experiments show that embedding these constraints significantly improves predictive accuracy and physical plausibility, outperforming classical and unconstrained deep learning approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Head Entropy, a method using attention entropy patterns to predict answer correctness in large language models, showing improved generalization and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) often produce plausible but incorrect answers, posing risks in safety-critical fields like medicine. Current evaluation methods are costly or introduce hidden errors, prompting the need for reliable correctness prediction.

Method: Head Entropy measures the spread of attention mass using per-head 2-Renyi entropies and sparse logistic regression to predict answer correctness. It also analyzes attention patterns before answer generation.

Result: Head Entropy matches or exceeds baselines in-distribution and generalizes better out-of-domains, outperforming the closest baseline by +8.5% AUROC. It also predicts correctness from pre-answer attention patterns (+17.7% AUROC over baselines).

Conclusion: Attention entropy patterns, particularly Head Entropy, effectively predict answer correctness in LLMs, offering a scalable and generalizable solution for evaluating model outputs across diverse domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate plausible yet incorrect answers, posing risks in safety-critical settings such as medicine. Human evaluation is expensive, and LLM-as-judge approaches risk introducing hidden errors. Recent white-box methods detect contextual hallucinations using model internals, focusing on the localization of the attention mass, but two questions remain open: do these approaches extend to predicting answer correctness, and do they generalize out-of-domains? We introduce Head Entropy, a method that predicts answer correctness from attention entropy patterns, specifically measuring the spread of the attention mass. Using sparse logistic regression on per-head 2-Renyi entropies, Head Entropy matches or exceeds baselines in-distribution and generalizes substantially better on out-of-domains, it outperforms the closest baseline on average by +8.5% AUROC. We further show that attention patterns over the question/context alone, before answer generation, already carry predictive signal using Head Entropy with on average +17.7% AUROC over the closest baseline. We evaluate across 5 instruction-tuned LLMs and 3 QA datasets spanning general knowledge, multi-hop reasoning, and medicine.

Abstract: We present the first high-probability optimal regret bound for a policy optimization technique applied to the problem of stochastic contextual multi-armed bandit (CMAB) with general offline function approximation. Our algorithm is both efficient and achieves an optimal regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{ K|\mathcal{A}|\log|\mathcal{F}|})$, where $K$ is the number of rounds, $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of arms, and $\mathcal{F}$ is the function class used to approximate the losses. Our results bridge the gap between theory and practice, demonstrating that the widely used policy optimization methods for the contextual bandit problem can achieve a rigorously-proved optimal regret bound. We support our theoretical results with an empirical evaluation of our algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of solving stochastic Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) with general offline function approximation, aiming for optimal regret bounds and computational efficiency.

Method: The method employs optimistic policy optimization (OPO-CMDP) with finite function classes to approximate losses and dynamics, achieving a regret bound of ~O(H^4√(T|S||A|log(|F||P|))).

Result: The algorithm achieves a high-probability regret bound with optimal dependence on state and action spaces, improving upon existing methods.

Conclusion: OPO-CMDP offers a computationally superior and theoretically near-optimal solution for CMDPs, demonstrating the effectiveness of optimistic policy optimization.

Abstract: We introduce \texttt{OPO-CMDP}, the first policy optimization algorithm for stochastic Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDPs) under general offline function approximation. Our approach achieves a high probability regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(H^4\sqrt{T|S||A|\log(|\mathcal{F}||\mathcal{P}|)}),$ where $S$ and $A$ denote the state and action spaces, $H$ the horizon length, $T$ the number of episodes, and $\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{P}$ the finite function classes used to approximate the losses and dynamics, respectively. This is the first regret bound with optimal dependence on $|S|$ and $|A|$, directly improving the current state-of-the-art (Qian, Hu, and Simchi-Levi, 2024). These results demonstrate that optimistic policy optimization provides a natural, computationally superior and theoretically near-optimal path for solving CMDPs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HBVLA is a binarization framework for Vision-Language-Action models, improving efficiency by reducing weights to 1-bit while minimizing performance degradation through policy-aware Hessian and sparse orthogonal transforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing binarization methods for VLA models accumulate quantization errors under long-horizon execution, degrading performance. HBVLA aims to address this gap.

Method: HBVLA uses a policy-aware Hessian to identify critical weights, employs sparse orthogonal transforms for non-salient weights, and quantizes in the Harr domain with group-wise 1-bit quantization.

Result: HBVLA retains 92.2% performance on LIBERO and 93.6% on SimplerEnv, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Real-world tests show marginal degradation.

Conclusion: HBVLA provides a practical solution for ultra-low-bit quantization of VLAs, enabling reliable deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable instruction-following embodied control, but their large compute and memory footprints hinder deployment on resource-constrained robots and edge platforms. While reducing weights to 1-bit precision through binarization can greatly improve efficiency, existing methods fail to narrow the distribution gap between binarized and full-precision weights, causing quantization errors to accumulate under long-horizon closed-loop execution and severely degrade actions. To fill this gap, we propose HBVLA, a VLA-tailored binarization framework. First, we use a policy-aware enhanced Hessian to identify weights that are truly critical for action generation. Then, we employ a sparse orthogonal transform for non-salient weights to induce a low-entropy intermediate state. Finally, we quantize both salient and non-salient weights in the Harr domain with group-wise 1-bit quantization. We have evaluated our approach on different VLAs: on LIBERO, quantized OpenVLA-OFT retains 92.2% of full-precision performance; on SimplerEnv, quantized CogAct retains 93.6%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art binarization methods. We further validate our method on real-world evaluation suite and the results show that HBVLA incurs only marginal success-rate degradation compared to the full-precision model, demonstrating robust deployability under tight hardware constraints. Our work provides a practical foundation for ultra-low-bit quantization of VLAs, enabling more reliable deployment on hardware-limited robotic platforms.

Method: The framework approximates upper and lower-level objective functions with ANN models and embeds the lower-level problem via KKT optimality conditions, reformulating it into a single-level optimization (ANN-KKT).

Result: Validated on benchmark problems and real-world systems (660 MW coal and 395 MW gas turbine), the ANN-KKT framework yields comparable solutions with marginal computational time (0.22–0.88 s) and optimal power outputs (583 MW coal, 402 MW gas turbine).

Conclusion: ANN-KKT provides a scalable, computationally efficient method for hierarchical optimization of thermal power systems, enabling energy-efficient operations and supporting Industry 5.0.

Abstract: Industrial thermal power systems have coupled performance variables with hierarchical order of importance, making their simultaneous optimization computationally challenging or infeasible. This barrier limits the integrated and computationally scaleable operation optimization of industrial thermal power systems. To address this issue for large-scale engineering systems, we present a fully machine learning-powered bi-level optimization framework for data-driven optimization of industrial thermal power systems. The objective functions of upper and lower levels are approximated by artificial neural network (ANN) models and the lower-level problem is analytically embedded through Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions. The reformulated single level optimization framework integrating ANN models and KKT constraints (ANN-KKT) is validated on benchmark problems and on real-world power generation operation of 660 MW coal power plant and 395 MW gas turbine system. The results reveal a comparable solutions obtained from the proposed ANN-KKT framework to the bi-level solutions of the benchmark problems. Marginal computational time requirement (0.22 to 0.88 s) to compute optimal solutions yields 583 MW (coal) and 402 MW (gas turbine) of power output at optimal turbine heat rate of 7337 kJ/kWh and 7542 kJ/kWh, respectively. In addition, the method expands to delineate a feasible and robust operating envelope that accounts for uncertainty in operating variables while maximizing thermal efficiency in various scenarios. These results demonstrate that ANN-KKT offers a scalable and computationally efficient route for hierarchical, data-driven optimization of industrial thermal power systems, achieving energy-efficient operations of large-scale engineering systems and contributing to industry 5.0.

### [384] [Discrete Double-Bracket Flows for Isotropic-Noise Invariant Eigendecomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13759)
*ZhiMing Li,JiaHe Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a matrix-free eigendecomposition method using a discrete double-bracket flow that avoids stability issues tied to isotropic shifts, achieving global convergence and accelerated saddle-escape rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard stochastic approximation methods face limitations like fixed steps coupling stability to matrix norms or slow adaptation due to vanishing updates. This paper addresses these issues.

Method: The proposed method uses a discrete double-bracket flow invariant to isotropic shifts, ensuring stability and efficiency by focusing on trace-free covariance.

Result: The method achieves global convergence with sample complexity scaling as O(||C_e||_2^2 / (Δ^2 ε)) and an accelerated O(log(1/ζ)) saddle-escape rate.

Conclusion: The approach efficiently handles matrix-free eigendecomposition under perturbations, offering practical benefits for stability and convergence.

Abstract: We study matrix-free eigendecomposition under a matrix-vector product (MVP) oracle, where each step observes a covariance operator $C_k = C_{sig} + σ_k^2 I + E_k$. Standard stochastic approximation methods either use fixed steps that couple stability to $\|C_k\|_2$, or adapt steps in ways that slow down due to vanishing updates. We introduce a discrete double-bracket flow whose generator is invariant to isotropic shifts, yielding pathwise invariance to $σ_k^2 I$ at the discrete-time level. The resulting trajectory and a maximal stable step size $η_{max} \propto 1/\|C_e\|_2^2$ depend only on the trace-free covariance $C_e$. We establish global convergence via strict-saddle geometry for the diagonalization objective and an input-to-state stability analysis, with sample complexity scaling as $O(\|C_e\|_2^2 / (Δ^2 ε))$ under trace-free perturbations. An explicit characterization of degenerate blocks yields an accelerated $O(\log(1/ζ))$ saddle-escape rate and a high-probability finite-time convergence guarantee.

### [385] [On Representation Redundancy in Large-Scale Instruction Tuning Data Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13773)
*Youwei Shu,Shaomian Zheng,Dingnan Jin,Wenjie Qu,Ziyao Guo,Qing Cui,Jun Zhou,Jiaheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Compressed Representation Data Selection (CRDS) to improve instruction-tuning data quality by reducing redundancy in embeddings, outperforming existing methods with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data quality significantly impacts LLM training, but systematic methods for selecting high-quality data at scale are lacking. Prior work shows smaller, high-quality datasets can outperform larger, noisy ones.

Method: CRDS addresses redundancy in LLM embeddings via two variants: CRDS-R (Rademacher random projection with hidden-layer concatenation) and CRDS-W (whitening-based dimensionality reduction).

Result: Both CRDS variants enhance data quality, with CRDS-W achieving strong performance using only 3.5% of data, surpassing full-data baselines by 0.71% on average across four datasets.

Conclusion: CRDS effectively improves data selection for instruction tuning by mitigating embedding redundancy, offering a scalable solution for high-quality LLM training.

Abstract: Data quality is a crucial factor in large language models training. While prior work has shown that models trained on smaller, high-quality datasets can outperform those trained on much larger but noisy or low-quality corpora, systematic methods for industrial-scale data selection in instruction tuning remain underexplored. In this work, we study instruction-tuning data selection through the lens of semantic representation similarity and identify a key limitation of state-of-the-art LLM encoders: they produce highly redundant semantic embeddings. To mitigate this redundancy, we propose Compressed Representation Data Selection (CRDS), a novel framework with two variants. CRDS-R applies Rademacher random projection followed by concatenation of transformer hidden-layer representations, while CRDS-W employs whitening-based dimensionality reduction to improve representational quality. Experimental results demonstrate that both variants substantially enhance data quality and consistently outperform state-of-the-art representation-based selection methods. Notably, CRDS-W achieves strong performance using only 3.5% of the data, surpassing the full-data baseline by an average of 0.71% across four datasets.

*Xiaoyun Yu,Li fan,Xiangfei Qiu,Nanqing Dong,Yonggui Huang,Honggang Qi,Geguang Pu,Wanli Ouyang,Xi Chen,Jilin Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEMTS is a lightweight, retrieval-free method for domain adaptation in time series forecasting, addressing drawbacks of existing approaches like Domain-Adaptive Pretraining and Retrieval-Augmented Generation by using a Knowledge Persistence Module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods degrade in real-world domains due to temporal shifts and domain-specific patterns, with DAPT causing catastrophic forgetting and RAG introducing retrieval overhead.

Method: MEMTS employs a Knowledge Persistence Module (KPM) to internalize domain-specific temporal dynamics into latent prototypes, enabling continuous knowledge representation.

Result: MEMTS achieves state-of-the-art performance with constant-time inference, near-zero latency, and no architectural changes to the frozen TSFM backbone.

Conclusion: MEMTS offers a scalable, efficient solution for domain adaptation in time series forecasting, overcoming limitations of current paradigms.

Abstract: While Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in generalized forecasting, their performance often degrades significantly when deployed in real-world vertical domains characterized by temporal distribution shifts and domain-specific periodic structures. Current solutions are primarily constrained by two paradigms: Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT), which improves short-term domain fitting but frequently disrupts previously learned global temporal patterns due to catastrophic forgetting; and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which incorporates external knowledge but introduces substantial retrieval overhead. This creates a severe scalability bottleneck that fails to meet the high-efficiency requirements of real-time stream processing. To break this impasse, we propose Memory for Time Series (MEMTS), a lightweight and plug-and-play method for retrieval-free domain adaptation in time series forecasting. The key component of MEMTS is a Knowledge Persistence Module (KPM), which internalizes domain-specific temporal dynamics, such as recurring seasonal patterns and trends into a compact set of learnable latent prototypes. In doing so, it transforms fragmented historical observations into continuous, parameterized knowledge representations. This paradigm shift enables MEMTS to achieve accurate domain adaptation with constant-time inference and near-zero latency, while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting of general temporal patterns, all without requiring any architectural modifications to the frozen TSFM backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the SOTA performance of MEMTS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MechPert, a framework using LLM agents and consensus mechanisms, improves prediction of transcriptional responses to genetic perturbations, outperforming similarity-based methods and network centrality heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting transcriptional responses to unseen genetic perturbations is crucial for understanding gene regulation and optimizing large-scale perturbation experiments. Existing methods rely on static knowledge graphs or language models, which may lack directed regulatory logic.

Method: The authors introduce MechPert, a lightweight framework where multiple LLM agents independently propose candidate regulators with confidence scores. These proposals are aggregated through a consensus mechanism to filter spurious associations, creating weighted neighborhoods for downstream predictions.

Result: Evaluated on Perturb-seq benchmarks across four human cell lines, MechPert improves Pearson correlation by up to 10.5% over similarity-based baselines in low-data regimes ($N=50$ observed perturbations). For experimental design, MechPert-selected anchor genes outperform standard network centrality heuristics by up to 46% in well-characterized cell lines.

Conclusion: MechPert effectively generates directed regulatory hypotheses, outperforming existing methods in predicting transcriptional responses and aiding experimental design.

Abstract: Predicting transcriptional responses to unseen genetic perturbations is essential for understanding gene regulation and prioritizing large-scale perturbation experiments. Existing approaches either rely on static, potentially incomplete knowledge graphs, or prompt language models for functionally similar genes, retrieving associations shaped by symmetric co-occurrence in scientific text rather than directed regulatory logic. We introduce MechPert, a lightweight framework that encourages LLM agents to generate directed regulatory hypotheses rather than relying solely on functional similarity. Multiple agents independently propose candidate regulators with associated confidence scores; these are aggregated through a consensus mechanism that filters spurious associations, producing weighted neighborhoods for downstream prediction. We evaluate MechPert on Perturb-seq benchmarks across four human cell lines. For perturbation prediction in low-data regimes ($N=50$ observed perturbations), MechPert improves Pearson correlation by up to 10.5\% over similarity-based baselines. For experimental design, MechPert-selected anchor genes outperform standard network centrality heuristics by up to 46\% in well-characterized cell lines.

*Xiaoyu Tao,Mingyue Cheng,Chuang Jiang,Tian Gao,Huanjian Zhang,Yaguo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cast-R1 reformulates time series forecasting as a sequential decision-making problem using a memory-based state mechanism and tool-augmented agentic workflow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional model-centric approaches struggle in complex settings due to inability to accumulate evidence, reason about changes, or refine predictions iteratively.

Method: Cast-R1 employs a memory-based state management system and a tool-augmented agentic workflow for iterative forecasting, trained via supervised fine-tuning and multi-turn reinforcement learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show Cast-R1's effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Cast-R1 advances agentic paradigms for time series modeling.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has long been dominated by model-centric approaches that formulate prediction as a single-pass mapping from historical observations to future values. Despite recent progress, such formulations often struggle in complex and evolving settings, largely because most forecasting models lack the ability to autonomously acquire informative evidence, reason about potential future changes, or revise predictions through iterative decision processes. In this work, we propose Cast-R1, a learned time series forecasting framework that reformulates forecasting as a sequential decision-making problem. Cast-R1 introduces a memory-based state management mechanism that maintains decision-relevant information across interaction steps, enabling the accumulation of contextual evidence to support long-horizon reasoning. Building on this formulation, forecasting is carried out through a tool-augmented agentic workflow, in which the agent autonomously interacts with a modular toolkit to extract statistical features, invoke lightweight forecasting models for decision support, perform reasoning-based prediction, and iteratively refine forecasts through self-reflection. To train Cast-R1, we adopt a two-stage learning strategy that combines supervised fine-tuning with multi-turn reinforcement learning, together with a curriculum learning scheme that progressively increases task difficulty to improve policy learning. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Cast-R1. We hope this work provides a practical step towards further exploration of agentic paradigms for time series modeling. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xiaoyu-Tao/Cast-R1-TS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Untrained neural networks (UNNs) provide high-fidelity reconstruction but suffer from high computational costs due to spatial-domain optimization.

Method: The PDF solver uses truncated Fourier basis expansion, contraction integral equations (CIE), contrast-compensated operators (CCO), and a bridge-suppressing loss for boundary sharpness.

Result: Achieves 100x speedup over UNNs with robust performance under noise and antenna uncertainties.

Conclusion: Enables real-time microwave imaging applications with improved efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Untrained neural networks (UNNs) offer high-fidelity electromagnetic inverse scattering reconstruction but are computationally limited by high-dimensional spatial-domain optimization. We propose a Real-Time Physics-Driven Fourier-Spectral (PDF) solver that achieves sub-second reconstruction through spectral-domain dimensionality reduction. By expanding induced currents using a truncated Fourier basis, the optimization is confined to a compact low-frequency parameter space supported by scattering measurements. The solver integrates a contraction integral equation (CIE) to mitigate high-contrast nonlinearity and a contrast-compensated operator (CCO) to correct spectral-induced attenuation. Furthermore, a bridge-suppressing loss is formulated to enhance boundary sharpness between adjacent scatterers. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate a 100-fold speedup over state-of-the-art UNNs with robust performance under noise and antenna uncertainties, enabling real-time microwave imaging applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AnomaMind is a novel agentic framework for time series anomaly detection, addressing limitations of existing methods by reformulating detection as a sequential decision-making process with adaptive feature preparation and iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods lack adaptability to context-dependent or diverse anomaly patterns, as they treat detection as a fixed-feature discriminative task rather than an evidence-driven process.

Method: AnomaMind introduces a structured workflow for coarse-to-fine localization, multi-turn tool interactions for adaptive feature preparation, and self-reflective refinement. It uses a hybrid inference mechanism combining general-purpose models and reinforcement learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show AnomaMind consistently improves detection performance across diverse settings.

Conclusion: AnomaMind successfully addresses the limitations of traditional methods by integrating adaptive reasoning and iterative refinement, enhancing anomaly detection reliability.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical in many real-world applications, where effective solutions must localize anomalous regions and support reliable decision-making under complex settings. However, most existing methods frame anomaly detection as a purely discriminative prediction task with fixed feature inputs, rather than an evidence-driven diagnostic process. As a result, they often struggle when anomalies exhibit strong context dependence or diverse patterns. We argue that these limitations stem from the lack of adaptive feature preparation, reasoning-aware detection, and iterative refinement during inference. To address these challenges, we propose AnomaMind, an agentic time series anomaly detection framework that reformulates anomaly detection as a sequential decision-making process. AnomaMind operates through a structured workflow that progressively localizes anomalous intervals in a coarse-to-fine manner, augments detection through multi-turn tool interactions for adaptive feature preparation, and refines anomaly decisions via self-reflection. The workflow is supported by a set of reusable tool engines, enabling context-aware diagnostic analysis. A key design of AnomaMind is an explicitly designed hybrid inference mechanism for tool-augmented anomaly detection. In this mechanism, general-purpose models are responsible for autonomous tool interaction and self-reflective refinement, while core anomaly detection decisions are learned through reinforcement learning under verifiable workflow-level feedback, enabling task-specific optimization within a flexible reasoning framework. Extensive experiments across diverse settings demonstrate that AnomaMind consistently improves anomaly detection performance. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AnomaMind.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mean Velocity Policy (MVP), a generative policy function for reinforcement learning that optimizes action generation speed while maintaining expressiveness through an instantaneous velocity constraint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between expressiveness and computational efficiency in flow-based policies for RL, aiming for faster one-step action generation.

Method: Proposes MVP, which models the mean velocity field and introduces an instantaneous velocity constraint (IVC) during training to enhance expressiveness.

Result: MVP achieves state-of-the-art success rates in robotic manipulation tasks and significantly improves training and inference speeds compared to flow-based baselines.

Conclusion: MVP effectively balances expressiveness and computational efficiency, proving superior in performance and speed for RL tasks.

Abstract: Learning expressive and efficient policy functions is a promising direction in reinforcement learning (RL). While flow-based policies have recently proven effective in modeling complex action distributions with a fast deterministic sampling process, they still face a trade-off between expressiveness and computational burden, which is typically controlled by the number of flow steps. In this work, we propose mean velocity policy (MVP), a new generative policy function that models the mean velocity field to achieve the fastest one-step action generation. To ensure its high expressiveness, an instantaneous velocity constraint (IVC) is introduced on the mean velocity field during training. We theoretically prove that this design explicitly serves as a crucial boundary condition, thereby improving learning accuracy and enhancing policy expressiveness. Empirically, our MVP achieves state-of-the-art success rates across several challenging robotic manipulation tasks from Robomimic and OGBench. It also delivers substantial improvements in training and inference speed over existing flow-based policy baselines.

*Jorge Carrasco-Pollo,Floor Eijkelboom,Jan-Willem van de Meent*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pawsterior is a variational flow-matching framework enhancing simulation-based inference (SBI) by addressing structured domains and discrete latent variables, improving fidelity and extending applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard flow-matching methods struggle with structured domains (e.g., bounded parameters or hybrid discrete-continuous variables), leading to inefficiency and constraint violations.

Method: Pawsterior generalizes CatFlow's geometric bias, introducing endpoint-induced affine geometric confinement and a two-sided variational model to incorporate domain geometry directly. It also handles discrete latent structures.

Result: The framework improves numerical stability, posterior fidelity (shown by better classifier two-sample tests), and enables SBI tasks involving discrete latents, previously incompatible with flow-matching.

Conclusion: Pawsterior successfully extends flow-matching to structured SBI problems, overcoming geometric and discrete limitations.

Abstract: We introduce Pawsterior, a variational flow-matching framework for improved and extended simulation-based inference (SBI). Many SBI problems involve posteriors constrained by structured domains, such as bounded physical parameters or hybrid discrete-continuous variables, yet standard flow-matching methods typically operate in unconstrained spaces. This mismatch leads to inefficient learning and difficulty respecting physical constraints. Our contributions are twofold. First, generalizing the geometric inductive bias of CatFlow, we formalize endpoint-induced affine geometric confinement, a principle that incorporates domain geometry directly into the inference process via a two-sided variational model. This formulation improves numerical stability during sampling and leads to consistently better posterior fidelity, as demonstrated by improved classifier two-sample test performance across standard SBI benchmarks. Second, and more importantly, our variational parameterization enables SBI tasks involving discrete latent structure (e.g., switching systems) that are fundamentally incompatible with conventional flow-matching approaches. By addressing both geometric constraints and discrete latent structure, Pawsterior extends flow-matching to a broader class of structured SBI problems that were previously inaccessible.

*Shalev Shaer,Yarin Bar,Drew Prinster,Yaniv Romano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a sequential test using conformal test martingales (CTMs) with a fixed reference dataset to avoid contamination, ensuring faster distribution shift detection compared to standard CTMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTM detectors suffer from test-time contamination, where post-shift observations dilute evidence for distribution shifts, increasing detection delay.

Method: Avoids contamination by comparing new samples to a fixed null reference dataset, using a robust martingale construction that accounts for finite reference set errors.

Result: Achieves anytime-valid type-I error control, asymptotic power one, and bounded expected detection delay, outperforming standard CTMs empirically.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a reliable and powerful detector for distribution shifts by eliminating contamination and improving detection speed.

Abstract: We propose a sequential test for detecting arbitrary distribution shifts that allows conformal test martingales (CTMs) to work under a fixed, reference-conditional setting. Existing CTM detectors construct test martingales by continually growing a reference set with each incoming sample, using it to assess how atypical the new sample is relative to past observations. While this design yields anytime-valid type-I error control, it suffers from test-time contamination: after a change, post-shift observations enter the reference set and dilute the evidence for distribution shift, increasing detection delay and reducing power.
  In contrast, our method avoids contamination by design by comparing each new sample to a fixed null reference dataset. Our main technical contribution is a robust martingale construction that remains valid conditional on the null reference data, achieved by explicitly accounting for the estimation error in the reference distribution induced by the finite reference set. This yields anytime-valid type-I error control together with guarantees of asymptotic power one and bounded expected detection delay. Empirically, our method detects shifts faster than standard CTMs, providing a powerful and reliable distribution-shift detector.

TL;DR: sleep2vec is a foundation model for diverse and incomplete nocturnal biosignals, leveraging cross-modal alignment and metadata-aware contrastive learning to outperform baselines in sleep staging and clinical assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in unified modeling of heterogeneous nocturnal biosignals from diverse devices, often affected by sensor dropout.

Method: Contrastive pre-training on 42,249 recordings (nine modalities) using a metadata-aware InfoNCE objective to align modalities dynamically.

Result: sleep2vec outperforms baselines in sleep staging and clinical assessment, remaining robust to modality subsets and sensor dropout.

Conclusion: Cross-modal alignment and principled scaling enable label-efficient, general-purpose modeling of nocturnal biosignals.

Abstract: Tasks ranging from sleep staging to clinical diagnosis traditionally rely on standard polysomnography (PSG) devices, bedside monitors and wearable devices, which capture diverse nocturnal biosignals (e.g., EEG, EOG, ECG, SpO$_2$). However, heterogeneity across devices and frequent sensor dropout pose significant challenges for unified modelling of these multimodal signals. We present \texttt{sleep2vec}, a foundation model for diverse and incomplete nocturnal biosignals that learns a shared representation via cross-modal alignment. \texttt{sleep2vec} is contrastively pre-trained on 42,249 overnight recordings spanning nine modalities using a \textit{Demography, Age, Site \& History-aware InfoNCE} objective that incorporates physiological and acquisition metadata (\textit{e.g.}, age, gender, recording site) to dynamically weight negatives and mitigate cohort-specific shortcuts. On downstream sleep staging and clinical outcome assessment, \texttt{sleep2vec} consistently outperforms strong baselines and remains robust to any subset of available modalities and sensor dropout. We further characterize, to our knowledge for the first time, scaling laws for nocturnal biosignals with respect to modality diversity and model capacity. Together, these results show that unified cross-modal alignment, coupled with principled scaling, enables label-efficient, general-purpose modelling of real-world nocturnal biosignals.

TL;DR: The paper examines algorithmic stability in deep ReLU homogeneous neural networks achieving zero training error via minimum-norm interpolation, identifying conditions for stability involving stable sub-networks and low-rank weight matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Algorithmic stability predicts generalization error but lacks success in deep neural network analysis. This study aims to address this gap for ReLU networks achieving zero training error.

Method: Focuses on deep ReLU homogeneous neural networks with minimum-norm interpolation, analyzing stability conditions involving stable sub-networks and low-rank weight matrices.

Result: Networks are stable with a stable sub-network followed by a low-rank layer but unstable if the subsequent layer lacks low-rank properties.

Conclusion: Low-rank weight matrices are crucial for ensuring stability in overparameterized networks achieving zero training error.

Abstract: Algorithmic stability is a classical framework for analyzing the generalization error of learning algorithms. It predicts that an algorithm has small generalization error if it is insensitive to small perturbations in the training set such as the removal or replacement of a training point. While stability has been demonstrated for numerous well-known algorithms, this framework has had limited success in analyses of deep neural networks. In this paper we study the algorithmic stability of deep ReLU homogeneous neural networks that achieve zero training error using parameters with the smallest $L_2$ norm, also known as the minimum-norm interpolation, a phenomenon that can be observed in overparameterized models trained by gradient-based algorithms. We investigate sufficient conditions for such networks to be stable. We find that 1) such networks are stable when they contain a (possibly small) stable sub-network, followed by a layer with a low-rank weight matrix, and 2) such networks are not guaranteed to be stable even when they contain a stable sub-network, if the following layer is not low-rank. The low-rank assumption is inspired by recent empirical and theoretical results which demonstrate that training deep neural networks is biased towards low-rank weight matrices, for minimum-norm interpolation and weight-decay regularization.

TL;DR: GREPO is the first GNN benchmark for repository-scale bug localization, offering graph-based data structures and outperforming traditional retrieval methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLMs struggle with repository-level bug localization due to context window limits, and existing retrieval methods lack complexity.

Method: Introducing GREPO, a benchmark with 86 Python repositories and 47,294 bug-fixing tasks, designed for GNN processing.

Result: GNN architectures evaluated on GREPO show superior performance compared to traditional information retrieval methods.

Conclusion: GREPO demonstrates GNNs' potential for bug localization and serves as a foundational resource for future research.

Abstract: Repository-level bug localization-the task of identifying where code must be modified to fix a bug-is a critical software engineering challenge. Standard Large Language Modles (LLMs) are often unsuitable for this task due to context window limitations that prevent them from processing entire code repositories. As a result, various retrieval methods are commonly used, including keyword matching, text similarity, and simple graph-based heuristics such as Breadth-First Search. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising alternative due to their ability to model complex, repository-wide dependencies; however, their application has been hindered by the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce GREPO, the first GNN benchmark for repository-scale bug localization tasks. GREPO comprises 86 Python repositories and 47294 bug-fixing tasks, providing graph-based data structures ready for direct GNN processing. Our evaluation of various GNN architectures shows outstanding performance compared to established information retrieval baselines. This work highlights the potential of GNNs for bug localization and established GREPO as a foundation resource for future research, The code is available at https://github.com/qingpingmo/GREPO.

### [397] [Why Code, Why Now: Learnability, Computability, and the Real Limits of Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13934)
*Zhimin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a five-level hierarchy of learnability based on information structure, arguing that ML progress depends more on a task's learnability than model size. It distinguishes expressibility, computability, and learnability, explaining why code generation scales better than reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explain why tasks like code generation progress more reliably than reinforcement learning, attributing it to differences in feedback quality and information structure.

Method: The authors propose a five-level hierarchy of learnability, analyzing the relationships between expressibility, computability, and learnability. They use a unified template to highlight structural differences.

Result: The analysis reveals why supervised learning on code scales predictably while reinforcement learning does not, challenging the assumption that scaling alone solves ML challenges.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the ceiling on ML progress depends on a task's inherent learnability, not just model size, emphasizing the need to scrutinize scalability assumptions.

Abstract: Code generation has progressed more reliably than reinforcement learning, largely because code has an information structure that makes it learnable. Code provides dense, local, verifiable feedback at every token, whereas most reinforcement learning problems do not. This difference in feedback quality is not binary but graded. We propose a five-level hierarchy of learnability based on information structure and argue that the ceiling on ML progress depends less on model size than on whether a task is learnable at all. The hierarchy rests on a formal distinction among three properties of computational problems (expressibility, computability, and learnability). We establish their pairwise relationships, including where implications hold and where they fail, and present a unified template that makes the structural differences explicit. The analysis suggests why supervised learning on code scales predictably while reinforcement learning does not, and why the common assumption that scaling alone will solve remaining ML challenges warrants scrutiny.

Method: iML uses (1) Code-Guided Planning for empirical profiling, (2) Code-Modular Implementation for decoupled components, and (3) Code-Verifiable Integration for dynamic contract checks.

Result: iML achieved an 85% valid submission rate, 45% competitive medal rate on MLE-BENCH, and outperformed others by 38%-163% on iML-BENCH.

Conclusion: iML bridges stochastic generation and reliable engineering, advancing AutoML by improving modularity, transparency, and performance.

Abstract: Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has revolutionized the development of data-driven solutions; however, traditional frameworks often function as "black boxes", lacking the flexibility and transparency required for complex, real-world engineering tasks. Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shifted toward code-driven approaches. However, they frequently suffer from hallucinated logic and logic entanglement, where monolithic code generation leads to unrecoverable runtime failures. In this paper, we present iML, a novel multi-agent framework designed to shift AutoML from black-box prompting to a code-guided, modular, and verifiable architectural paradigm. iML introduces three main ideas: (1) Code-Guided Planning, which synthesizes a strategic blueprint grounded in autonomous empirical profiling to eliminate hallucination; (2) Code-Modular Implementation, which decouples preprocessing and modeling into specialized components governed by strict interface contracts; and (3) Code-Verifiable Integration, which enforces physical feasibility through dynamic contract verification and iterative self-correction. We evaluate iML across MLE-BENCH and the newly introduced iML-BENCH, comprising a diverse range of real-world Kaggle competitions. The experimental results show iML's superiority over state-of-the-art agents, achieving a valid submission rate of 85% and a competitive medal rate of 45% on MLE-BENCH, with an average standardized performance score (APS) of 0.77. On iML-BENCH, iML significantly outperforms the other approaches by 38%-163% in APS. Furthermore, iML maintains a robust 70% success rate even under stripped task descriptions, effectively filling information gaps through empirical profiling. These results highlight iML's potential to bridge the gap between stochastic generation and reliable engineering, marking a meaningful step toward truly AutoML.

### [399] [An Adaptive Model Selection Framework for Demand Forecasting under Horizon-Induced Degradation to Support Business Strategy and Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13939)
*Adolfo González,Víctor Parada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AHSIV, a framework for adaptive model selection in forecasting, addressing instability in rankings due to demand variability and horizon effects. It integrates multiple metrics and demand classifications, showing improved performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Business environments with intermittent and variable demand require robust forecasting models, but no single model excels universally. This creates ambiguity in multi-SKU contexts, necessitating adaptive selection mechanisms.

Method: AHSIV combines scaled/absolute error metrics adjusted by horizon, demand classification, Pareto dominance, and hierarchical bias refinement. It's evaluated on Walmart, M3, M4, and M5 datasets across multiple forecasting horizons.

Result: AHSIV matches the best baseline in aggregated performance and improves horizon-specific model selection, proving its effectiveness in heterogeneous demand environments.

Conclusion: Model selection must adapt dynamically to demand and horizon variations. AHSIV offers a principled solution for multi-SKU forecasting.

Abstract: Business environments characterized by structural demand intermittency, high variability, and multi-step planning horizons require robust and reproducible model selection mechanisms. Empirical evidence shows that no forecasting model is universally dominant and that relative rankings vary across error metrics, demand regimes, and forecast horizons, generating ambiguity in multi-SKU decision contexts. This study proposes AHSIV (Adaptive Hybrid Selector for Intermittency and Variability), a horizon-aware and regime-conditioned model selection framework designed to address horizon-induced ranking instability. The proposed approach integrates scaled and absolute error metrics adjusted through a Metric Degradation by Forecast Horizon (MDFH) procedure, structural demand classification, multi-objective Pareto dominance, and hierarchical bias refinement within a unified decision architecture. The empirical evaluation is conducted on the Walmart, M3, M4, and M5 datasets under multiple train-test partition schemes and twelve-step forecasting horizons. Results indicate that AHSIV achieves statistical equivalence with the strongest monometric baseline in terms of aggregated performance while increasing the frequency of horizon-specific best-model selection. The findings demonstrate that model selection in heterogeneous demand environments cannot be treated as a static ranking problem, and that horizon-consistent, structurally adaptive mechanisms provide a principled, operationally coherent solution for multi-SKU forecasting.

### [400] [You Can Learn Tokenization End-to-End with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13940)
*Sam Dauncey,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to learn token boundaries in LLMs using score function estimates, outperforming prior heuristic and straight-through approaches at a 100M parameter scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization remains a rigid step in LLM pipelines despite trends toward end-to-end learning. The authors aim to integrate this step into the model itself by learning token boundaries more effectively.

Method: Proposes using score function estimates to learn discrete token boundaries, leveraging techniques like time discounting from reinforcement learning to reduce variance.

Result: The method outperforms prior straight-through estimates qualitatively and quantitatively at the 100M parameter scale.

Conclusion: Learning token boundaries with score function estimates is viable and superior to existing approaches, aligning with the move toward fully differentiable LLMs.

Abstract: Tokenization is a hardcoded compression step which remains in the training pipeline of Large Language Models (LLMs), despite a general trend towards architectures becoming increasingly end-to-end. Prior work has shown promising results at scale in bringing this compression step inside the LLMs' architecture with heuristics to draw token boundaries, and also attempts to learn these token boundaries with straight-through estimates, which treat the problem of drawing discrete token boundaries as a continuous one. We show that these token boundaries can instead be learned using score function estimates, which have tighter theoretical guarantees due to directly optimizing the problem of drawing discrete token boundaries to minimize loss. We observe that techniques from reinforcement learning, such as time discounting, are necessary to reduce the variance of this score function sufficiently to make it practicable. We demonstrate that the resultant method outperforms prior proposed straight-through estimates, both qualitatively and quantitatively at the $100$ million parameter scale.

*Taiwei Shi,Sihao Chen,Bowen Jiang,Linxin Song,Longqi Yang,Jieyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ERL introduces a reflection loop in RL for LMs, converting sparse feedback into structured behavioral improvement, outperforming baselines by up to +81%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse and delayed feedback in RL makes it hard for LMs to infer behavioral changes, necessitating a better method to translate feedback into durable improvements.

Method: ERL embeds an experience-reflection-consolidation loop: models generate attempts, reflect on feedback, and refine behaviors, reinforcing successful outcomes.

Result: ERL improves learning efficiency and performance (+81% in complex tasks, +11% in reasoning tasks) over RL baselines without added inference cost.

Conclusion: ERL's explicit self-reflection mechanism effectively transforms feedback into lasting behavioral improvements in LMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the central approach for language models (LMs) to learn from environmental reward or feedback. In practice, the environmental feedback is usually sparse and delayed. Learning from such signals is challenging, as LMs must implicitly infer how observed failures should translate into behavioral changes for future iterations. We introduce Experiential Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a training paradigm that embeds an explicit experience-reflection-consolidation loop into the reinforcement learning process. Given a task, the model generates an initial attempt, receives environmental feedback, and produces a reflection that guides a refined second attempt, whose success is reinforced and internalized into the base policy. This process converts feedback into structured behavioral revision, improving exploration and stabilizing optimization while preserving gains at deployment without additional inference cost. Across sparse-reward control environments and agentic reasoning benchmarks, ERL consistently improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong reinforcement learning baselines, achieving gains of up to +81% in complex multi-step environments and up to +11% in tool-using reasoning tasks. These results suggest that integrating explicit self-reflection into policy training provides a practical mechanism for transforming feedback into durable behavioral improvement.

*Yuhang Li,Reena Elangovan,Xin Dong,Priyadarshini Panda,Brucek Khailany*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QuRL accelerates RL rollout in LLMs using quantization, addressing challenges with Adaptive Clipping Range and invariant scaling, achieving 20%-80% faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RLVR training with LLMs suffers from slow rollout due to autoregressive decoding, consuming up to 70% of training time.

Method: Introduces Quantized Reinforcement Learning (QuRL) with Adaptive Clipping Range (ACR) and invariant scaling to address efficiency and stability challenges.

Result: Achieves 20%-80% faster rollout in INT8 and FP8 quantization experiments on DeepScaleR and DAPO.

Conclusion: QuRL effectively improves RL training efficiency in LLMs by leveraging quantization and dynamic clipping techniques.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a trending paradigm for training reasoning large language models (LLMs). However, due to the autoregressive decoding nature of LLMs, the rollout process becomes the efficiency bottleneck of RL training, consisting of up to 70\% of the total training time. In this work, we propose Quantized Reinforcement Learning (QuRL) that uses a quantized actor for accelerating the rollout. We address two challenges in QuRL. First, we propose Adaptive Clipping Range (ACR) that dynamically adjusts the clipping ratio based on the policy ratio between the full-precision actor and the quantized actor, which is essential for mitigating long-term training collapse. Second, we identify the weight update problem, where weight changes between RL steps are extremely small, making it difficult for the quantization operation to capture them effectively. We mitigate this problem through the invariant scaling technique that reduces quantization noise and increases weight update. We evaluate our method with INT8 and FP8 quantization experiments on DeepScaleR and DAPO, and achieve 20% to 80% faster rollout during training.

### [403] [Steady-State Behavior of Constant-Stepsize Stochastic Approximation: Gaussian Approximation and Tail Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13960)
*Zedong Wang,Yuyang Wang,Ijay Narang,Felix Wang,Yuzhou Wang,Siva Theja Maguluri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides explicit, non-asymptotic error bounds for fixed stepsize stochastic approximation (SA) methods, focusing on Wasserstein distance and Berry-Esseen-type tail bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of usable error bounds for steady-state approximations in SA methods with fixed stepsizes, the paper aims to provide concrete, non-asymptotic results.

Method: The authors prove general theorems bounding Wasserstein distance under drift and noise conditions, covering i.i.d. and Markovian noise, and apply these to SGD, linear SA, and nonlinear SA.

Result: Dimension- and stepsize-dependent bounds of order O(α^(1/2)log(1/α)) are derived for Wasserstein distance, along with non-uniform tail bounds.

Conclusion: The results offer practical error bounds for SA methods, extend beyond strongly convex objectives, and highlight non-Gaussian limiting behavior in certain cases.

Abstract: Constant-stepsize stochastic approximation (SA) is widely used in learning for computational efficiency. For a fixed stepsize, the iterates typically admit a stationary distribution that is rarely tractable. Prior work shows that as the stepsize $α\downarrow 0$, the centered-and-scaled steady state converges weakly to a Gaussian random vector. However, for fixed $α$, this weak convergence offers no usable error bound for approximating the steady-state by its Gaussian limit. This paper provides explicit, non-asymptotic error bounds for fixed $α$. We first prove general-purpose theorems that bound the Wasserstein distance between the centered-scaled steady state and an appropriate Gaussian distribution, under regularity conditions for drift and moment conditions for noise. To ensure broad applicability, we cover both i.i.d. and Markovian noise models. We then instantiate these theorems for three representative SA settings: (1) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for smooth strongly convex objectives, (2) linear SA, and (3) contractive nonlinear SA. We obtain dimension- and stepsize-dependent, explicit bounds in Wasserstein distance of order $α^{1/2}\log(1/α)$ for small $α$. Building on the Wasserstein approximation error, we further derive non-uniform Berry--Esseen-type tail bounds that compare the steady-state tail probability to Gaussian tails. We achieve an explicit error term that decays in both the deviation level and stepsize $α$. We adapt the same analysis for SGD beyond strongly convexity and study general convex objectives. We identify a non-Gaussian (Gibbs) limiting law under the correct scaling, which is validated numerically, and provide a corresponding pre-limit Wasserstein error bound.

*Liangyu Su,Jun Shu,Rui Liu,Deyu Meng,Zongben Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KoopGen is a neural Koopman framework that improves prediction accuracy and stability in high-dimensional chaotic systems by leveraging structured representations of Koopman generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of predicting high-dimensional chaotic systems, existing methods lack stability and interpretability, especially in continuous-spectrum regimes.

Method: KoopGen uses a generator-based neural framework with Cartesian decomposition to separate conservative transport from dissipation, enforcing operator-theoretic constraints during learning.

Result: KoopGen outperforms existing methods in accuracy and stability across various systems, including chaotic and spatiotemporal dynamics.

Conclusion: KoopGen provides a scalable and interpretable solution for modeling complex dynamical systems, clarifying learnable components of continuous-spectrum dynamics.

Abstract: Representing and predicting high-dimensional and spatiotemporally chaotic dynamical systems remains a fundamental challenge in dynamical systems and machine learning. Although data-driven models can achieve accurate short-term forecasts, they often lack stability, interpretability, and scalability in regimes dominated by broadband or continuous spectra. Koopman-based approaches provide a principled linear perspective on nonlinear dynamics, but existing methods rely on restrictive finite-dimensional assumptions or explicit spectral parameterizations that degrade in high-dimensional settings. Against these issues, we introduce KoopGen, a generator-based neural Koopman framework that models dynamics through a structured, state-dependent representation of Koopman generators. By exploiting the intrinsic Cartesian decomposition into skew-adjoint and self-adjoint components, KoopGen separates conservative transport from irreversible dissipation while enforcing exact operator-theoretic constraints during learning. Across systems ranging from nonlinear oscillators to high-dimensional chaotic and spatiotemporal dynamics, KoopGen improves prediction accuracy and stability, while clarifying which components of continuous-spectrum dynamics admit interpretable and learnable representations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces S2SServiceBench, a benchmark evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for translating subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasts into actionable climate services, highlighting challenges in signal comprehension, uncertainty handling, and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the last-mile gap in S2S forecasts by assessing MLLMs' ability to generate reliable, actionable climate services under uncertainty.

Method: Creation of S2SServiceBench, a multimodal benchmark with 10 service products and 150+ expert-selected cases across six domains, totaling 500 tasks and 1,000+ evaluation items.

Result: Benchmarking reveals persistent challenges in actionable signal comprehension, uncertainty operationalization, and evidence-grounded planning for dynamic hazards.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable insights for improving climate-service agents, addressing gaps in S2S forecast translation and decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasts play an essential role in providing a decision-critical weeks-to-months planning window for climate resilience and sustainability, yet a growing bottleneck is the last-mile gap: translating scientific forecasts into trusted, actionable climate services, requiring reliable multimodal understanding and decision-facing reasoning under uncertainty. Meanwhile, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and corresponding agentic paradigms have made rapid progress in supporting various workflows, but it remains unclear whether they can reliably generate decision-making deliverables from operational service products (e.g., actionable signal comprehension, decision-making handoff, and decision analysis & planning) under uncertainty. We introduce S2SServiceBench, a multimodal benchmark for last-mile S2S climate services curated from an operational climate-service system to evaluate this capability. S2SServiceBenchcovers 10 service products with about 150+ expert-selected cases in total, spanning six application domains - Agriculture, Disasters, Energy, Finance, Health, and Shipping. Each case is instantiated at three service levels, yielding around 500 tasks and 1,000+ evaluation items across climate resilience and sustainability applications. Using S2SServiceBench, we benchmark state-of-the-art MLLMs and agents, and analyze performance across products and service levels, revealing persistent challenges in S2S service plot understanding and reasoning - namely, actionable signal comprehension, operationalizing uncertainty into executable handoffs, and stable, evidence-grounded analysis and planning for dynamic hazards-while offering actionable guidance for building future climate-service agents.

*Xinxing Zhou,Qingren Yao,Yiji Zhao,Chenghao Liu,Flora Salim,Xiaojie Yuan,Yanlong Wen,Ming Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EIDOS shifts pretraining from predicting future values to learning latent-space dynamics, improving representation coherence and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time series models predict future observations directly, often capturing noise instead of coherent dynamics. EIDOS aims to address this by focusing on latent-space predictive learning.

Method: EIDOS trains a causal Transformer to predict latent representation evolution, using a lightweight aggregation branch for stable targets and a joint objective combining latent-space alignment, observational grounding, and forecasting supervision.

Result: On the GIFT-Eval benchmark, EIDOS reduces structural fragmentation and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Learning predictable latent dynamics leads to more robust and reliable time series foundation models.

Abstract: Most time series foundation models are pretrained by directly predicting future observations, which often yields weakly structured latent representations that capture surface noise rather than coherent and predictable temporal dynamics. In this work, we introduce EIDOS, a foundation model family that shifts pretraining from future value prediction to latent-space predictive learning. We train a causal Transformer to predict the evolution of latent representations, encouraging the emergence of structured and temporally coherent latent states. To ensure stable targets for latent-space learning, we design a lightweight aggregation branch to construct target representations. EIDOS is optimized via a joint objective that integrates latent-space alignment, observational grounding to anchor representations to the input signal, and direct forecasting supervision. On the GIFT-Eval benchmark, EIDOS mitigates structural fragmentation in the representation space and achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results demonstrate that constraining models to learn predictable latent dynamics is a principled step toward more robust and reliable time series foundation models.

*Yue Wang,Areg Karapetyan,Djellel Difallah,Samer Madanat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniST-Pred is a lightweight, unified spatio-temporal forecasting framework that decouples temporal and spatial modeling for robust traffic prediction under uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing structural and observational uncertainties in traffic forecasting, often overlooked in model design, while balancing predictive performance and modularity.

Method: Decouples temporal modeling from spatial representation learning, integrating them via adaptive fusion. Evaluated using simulated and real-world datasets.

Result: Competitive performance against established models, strong robustness in network disconnection scenarios, and interpretable representations.

Conclusion: UniST-Pred offers a lightweight, effective solution for spatio-temporal forecasting with robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is a core component of intelligent transportation systems, supporting various downstream tasks such as signal control and network-level traffic management. In real-world deployments, forecasting models must operate under structural and observational uncertainties, conditions that are rarely considered in model design. Recent approaches achieve strong short-term predictive performance by tightly coupling spatial and temporal modeling, often at the cost of increased complexity and limited modularity. In contrast, efficient time-series models capture long-range temporal dependencies without relying on explicit network structure. We propose UniST-Pred, a unified spatio-temporal forecasting framework that first decouples temporal modeling from spatial representation learning, then integrates both through adaptive representation-level fusion. To assess robustness of the proposed approach, we construct a dataset based on an agent-based, microscopic traffic simulator (MATSim) and evaluate UniST-Pred under severe network disconnection scenarios. Additionally, we benchmark UniST-Pred on standard traffic prediction datasets, demonstrating its competitive performance against existing well-established models despite a lightweight design. The results illustrate that UniST-Pred maintains strong predictive performance across both real-world and simulated datasets, while also yielding interpretable spatio-temporal representations under infrastructure disruptions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduced Random Float Sampling (RFS) for better length generalization in language models by using continuous position indices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of maintaining performance on inputs longer than those seen during pretraining.

Method: Proposed RFS, which uses randomly sampled continuous values for position encoding instead of predefined discrete indices.

Result: RFS improves performance on length generalization tasks and zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: RFS is a simple yet effective position encoding strategy that enhances model generalization.

Abstract: Length generalization is the ability of language models to maintain performance on inputs longer than those seen during pretraining. In this work, we introduce a simple yet powerful position encoding (PE) strategy, Random Float Sampling (RFS), that generalizes well to lengths unseen during pretraining or fine-tuning. In particular, instead of selecting position indices from a predefined discrete set, RFS uses randomly sampled continuous values, thereby avoiding out-of-distribution (OOD) issues on unseen lengths by exposing the model to diverse indices during training. Since assigning indices to tokens is a common and fundamental procedure in widely used PEs, the advantage of RFS can easily be incorporated into, for instance, the absolute sinusoidal encoding, RoPE, and ALiBi. Experiments corroborate its effectiveness by showing that RFS results in superior performance in length generalization tasks as well as zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks.

*Kai Zhang,Xuanyu Cao,Khaled B. Letaief*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces energy harvesting in decentralized federated learning (DFL) to mitigate energy depletion issues. It proposes a decentralized policy iteration algorithm to optimize device scheduling and power control, reducing overhead and complexity while achieving asymptotic optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy-intensive operations in DFL drain device batteries, limiting performance and lifespan. The study aims to enable sustainable operation via energy harvesting and efficient decentralized optimization.

Method: The authors derive a convergence bound for DFL with energy harvesting and formulate the problem as a multi-agent MDP. They propose a decentralized policy iteration algorithm using local state information from neighboring devices.

Result: The proposed algorithm reduces communication and computational complexity while achieving asymptotic optimality. Numerical experiments validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Energy harvesting and decentralized optimization enhance DFL sustainability and performance, with the proposed algorithm offering practical scalability.

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) enables edge devices to collaboratively train models through local training and fully decentralized device-to-device (D2D) model exchanges. However, these energy-intensive operations often rapidly deplete limited device batteries, reducing their operational lifetime and degrading the learning performance. To address this limitation, we apply energy harvesting technique to DFL systems, allowing edge devices to extract ambient energy and operate sustainably. We first derive the convergence bound for wireless DFL with energy harvesting, showing that the convergence is influenced by partial device participation and transmission packet drops, both of which further depend on the available energy supply. To accelerate convergence, we formulate a joint device scheduling and power control problem and model it as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP). Traditional MDP algorithms (e.g., value or policy iteration) require a centralized coordinator with access to all device states and exhibit exponential complexity in the number of devices, making them impractical for large-scale decentralized networks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a fully decentralized policy iteration algorithm that leverages only local state information from two-hop neighboring devices, thereby substantially reducing both communication overhead and computational complexity. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed decentralized algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality. Finally, comprehensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to validate the theoretical results and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses catastrophic forgetting in large pretrained vision models during class-incremental adaptation. It introduces Expected Policy Gradient (EPG) to directly minimize misclassification error and proposes adaptive entropy annealing (aEPG) to transition from exploratory to exploitative learning, outperforming traditional cross-entropy loss methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large pretrained vision models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when adapted incrementally. Current PEFT methods rely on cross-entropy loss, which is suboptimal. The goal is to leverage reinforcement learning to optimize the true objective (0-1 loss).

Method: Formulates classification as a one-step Markov Decision Process, deriving EPG for low-variance gradient estimation. Introduces aEPG to transition from CE-like exploration to EPG-like exploitation.

Result: aEPG outperforms CE-based methods across benchmarks and PEFT modules. Lower entropy in output predictions improves adaptation.

Conclusion: Directly optimizing the 0-1 loss via EPG and transitioning with aEPG enhances incremental learning in pretrained models, reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Despite their success, large pretrained vision models remain vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting when adapted to new tasks in class-incremental settings. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) alleviates this by restricting trainable parameters, yet most approaches still rely on cross-entropy (CE) loss, a surrogate for the 0-1 loss, to learn from new data. We revisit this choice and revive the true objective (0-1 loss) through a reinforcement learning perspective. By formulating classification as a one-step Markov Decision Process, we derive an Expected Policy Gradient (EPG) method that directly minimizes misclassification error with a low-variance gradient estimation. Our analysis shows that CE can be interpreted as EPG with an additional sample-weighting mechanism: CE encourages exploration by emphasizing low-confidence samples, while EPG prioritizes high-confidence ones. Building on this insight, we propose adaptive entropy annealing (aEPG), a training strategy that transitions from exploratory (CE-like) to exploitative (EPG-like) learning. aEPG-based methods outperform CE-based methods across diverse benchmarks and with various PEFT modules. More broadly, we evaluate various entropy regularization methods and demonstrate that lower entropy of the output prediction distribution enhances adaptation in pretrained vision models.

TL;DR: The paper addresses spurious solutions in Neural Optimal Transport (OT) in infinite-dimensional spaces by introducing Gaussian smoothing, proving well-posedness, and showing empirical improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spurious solutions in Semi-dual Neural OT hinder accurate distribution capture; the study aims to resolve this using regular measures and smoothing.

Method: Extends the semi-dual OT framework with Gaussian smoothing via Brownian motion, focusing on regular source measures.

Result: Under regular measures, the approach is well-posed and recovers a unique Monge map; empirical tests show superior performance.

Conclusion: Gaussian smoothing resolves ill-posedness in Neural OT, proving effective in theory and practice.

Abstract: We study Neural Optimal Transport in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In non-regular settings, Semi-dual Neural OT often generates spurious solutions that fail to accurately capture target distributions. We analytically characterize this spurious solution problem using the framework of regular measures, which generalize Lebesgue absolute continuity in finite dimensions. To resolve ill-posedness, we extend the semi-dual framework via a Gaussian smoothing strategy based on Brownian motion. Our primary theoretical contribution proves that under a regular source measure, the formulation is well-posed and recovers a unique Monge map. Furthermore, we establish a sharp characterization for the regularity of smoothed measures, proving that the success of smoothing depends strictly on the kernel of the covariance operator. Empirical results on synthetic functional data and time-series datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively suppresses spurious solutions and outperforms existing baselines.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Physics Informed PointNets (PIPN) and Physics Informed Geometry Aware Neural Operator (PI-GANO) for predicting flows through and around porous bodies, demonstrating their accuracy and generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting flows involving porous bodies is complex due to coupled physics and diverse geometries. The study aims to address this using Physics Informed learning approaches.

Method: The authors enforce Navier-Stokes equations for free-flow and Darcy Forchheimer extension for porous regions. Datasets are generated using OpenFOAM for 2D and 3D scenarios.

Result: The models show low velocity and pressure errors, accurately reproducing wake structures, though performance drops near sharp interfaces and high-gradient regions.

Conclusion: PIPN and PI-GANO offer potential for accelerating design studies without retraining per geometry, showing promise for porous flow predictions.

Abstract: Predicting flows that occur both through and around porous bodies is challenging due to coupled physics across fluid and porous regions and the need to generalize across diverse geometries and boundary conditions. We address this problem using two Physics Informed learning approaches: Physics Informed PointNets (PIPN) and Physics Informed Geometry Aware Neural Operator (P-IGANO). We enforce the incompressible Navier Stokes equations in the free-flow region and a Darcy Forchheimer extension in the porous region within a unified loss and condition the networks on geometry and material parameters. Datasets are generated with OpenFOAM on 2D ducts containing porous obstacles and on 3D windbreak scenarios with tree canopies and buildings. We first verify the pipeline via the method of manufactured solutions, then assess generalization to unseen shapes, and for PI-GANO, to variable boundary conditions and parameter settings. The results show consistently low velocity and pressure errors in both seen and unseen cases, with accurate reproduction of the wake structures. Performance degrades primarily near sharp interfaces and in regions with large gradients. Overall, the study provides a first systematic evaluation of PIPN/PI-GANO for simultaneous through-and-around porous flows and shows their potential to accelerate design studies without retraining per geometry.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAEs fail to reliably recover meaningful features despite strong reconstruction, as shown by synthetic and real-activation tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether SAEs recover true features in neural networks, given growing doubts from negative downstream results.

Method: Two evaluations: synthetic setup with known features and real-activation tests using random baselines.

Result: SAEs recover only 9% of true features despite high explained variance (71%), and random baselines match SAEs in key metrics.

Conclusion: Current SAEs do not reliably decompose model mechanisms.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for interpreting neural networks by decomposing their activations into sparse sets of human-interpretable features. Recent work has introduced multiple SAE variants and successfully scaled them to frontier models. Despite much excitement, a growing number of negative results in downstream tasks casts doubt on whether SAEs recover meaningful features. To directly investigate this, we perform two complementary evaluations. On a synthetic setup with known ground-truth features, we demonstrate that SAEs recover only $9\%$ of true features despite achieving $71\%$ explained variance, showing that they fail at their core task even when reconstruction is strong. To evaluate SAEs on real activations, we introduce three baselines that constrain SAE feature directions or their activation patterns to random values. Through extensive experiments across multiple SAE architectures, we show that our baselines match fully-trained SAEs in interpretability (0.87 vs 0.90), sparse probing (0.69 vs 0.72), and causal editing (0.73 vs 0.72). Together, these results suggest that SAEs in their current state do not reliably decompose models' internal mechanisms.

### [414] [A Penalty Approach for Differentiation Through Black-Box Quadratic Programming Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14154)
*Yuxuan Linghu,Zhiyuan Liu,Qi Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: dXPP is a penalty-based differentiable optimization framework that decouples QP solving from differentiation, improving efficiency and robustness compared to KKT-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KKT-based differentiation methods face challenges in computational cost and robustness at scale, motivating a decoupled approach.

Method: dXPP uses a solver-agnostic forward pass for QP solving and a backward pass mapping solutions to a smooth penalty problem for differentiation via smaller linear systems.

Result: dXPP matches KKT-based methods in performance and achieves significant speedups on large-scale problems, including sparse projections and portfolio optimization.

Conclusion: dXPP offers a scalable, efficient, and robust alternative to KKT-based differentiation for quadratic programs.

Abstract: Differentiating through the solution of a quadratic program (QP) is a central problem in differentiable optimization. Most existing approaches differentiate through the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) system, but their computational cost and numerical robustness can degrade at scale. To address these limitations, we propose dXPP, a penalty-based differentiation framework that decouples QP solving from differentiation. In the solving step (forward pass), dXPP is solver-agnostic and can leverage any black-box QP solver. In the differentiation step (backward pass), we map the solution to a smooth approximate penalty problem and implicitly differentiate through it, requiring only the solution of a much smaller linear system in the primal variables. This approach bypasses the difficulties inherent in explicit KKT differentiation and significantly improves computational efficiency and robustness. We evaluate dXPP on various tasks, including randomly generated QPs, large-scale sparse projection problems, and a real-world multi-period portfolio optimization task. Empirical results demonstrate that dXPP is competitive with KKT-based differentiation methods and achieves substantial speedups on large-scale problems.

### [415] [Synergistic Intra- and Cross-Layer Regularization Losses for MoE Expert Specialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14159)
*Rizhen Hu,Yuan Cao,Boao Kong,Mou Sun,Kun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two regularization losses to improve specialization and routing efficiency in Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models without architectural changes. These losses enhance expert specialization and routing coherence, leading to better performance and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models face issues like redundant expert representations and routing ambiguity, leading to underutilized capacity. Existing solutions require structural changes and lack comprehensive signals.

Method: Two plug-and-play losses are proposed: (1) intra-layer specialization loss penalizes similarity between expert activations, and (2) cross-layer coupling loss ensures coherent routing pathways across layers.

Result: Experiments show consistent task improvements, higher expert specialization, lower-entropy routing, and faster inference due to stable expert pathways.

Conclusion: The proposed losses effectively enhance MoE specialization and routing efficiency without modifying architectures, offering practical benefits for training and inference.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale Transformers efficiently but suffer from expert overlap -- redundant representations across experts and routing ambiguity, resulting in severely underutilized model capacity. While architectural solutions like DeepSeekMoE promote specialization, they require substantial structural modifications and rely solely on intra-layer signals. In this paper, we propose two plug-and-play regularization losses that enhance MoE specialization and routing efficiency without modifying router or model architectures. First, an intra-layer specialization loss penalizes cosine similarity between experts' SwiGLU activations on identical tokens, encouraging experts to specialize in complementary knowledge. Second, a cross-layer coupling loss maximizes joint Top-$k$ routing probabilities across adjacent layers, establishing coherent expert pathways through network depth while reinforcing intra-layer expert specialization. Both losses are orthogonal to the standard load-balancing loss and compatible with both the shared-expert architecture in DeepSeekMoE and vanilla top-$k$ MoE architectures. We implement both losses as a drop-in Megatron-LM module. Extensive experiments across pre-training, fine-tuning, and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate consistent task gains, higher expert specialization, and lower-entropy routing; together, these improvements translate into faster inference via more stable expert pathways.

### [416] [When Benchmarks Lie: Evaluating Malicious Prompt Classifiers Under True Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14161)
*Max Fomin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights limitations in current methods for detecting prompt injection and jailbreak attacks in LLM-based agents, proposes Leave-One-Dataset-Out (LODO) evaluation for better generalization, and analyzes failures in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical need for robust detection of prompt injection and jailbreak attacks as LLM-based agents increasingly handle untrusted data.

Method: Proposes LODO evaluation using 18 diverse datasets, analyzes Sparse Auto-Encoder (SAE) features, and compares production guardrails and LLM-as-judge approaches.

Result: Current methods overestimate performance (8.4% AUC inflation), with heterogeneous failure modes (1-25% accuracy gaps). Existing guardrails fail on indirect attacks (7-37% detection).

Conclusion: LODO evaluation is essential for reliable prompt attack detection, and SAE features filtered by LODO provide more stable explanations.

Abstract: Detecting prompt injection and jailbreak attacks is critical for deploying LLM-based agents safely. As agents increasingly process untrusted data from emails, documents, tool outputs, and external APIs, robust attack detection becomes essential. Yet current evaluation practices and production systems have fundamental limitations. We present a comprehensive analysis using a diverse benchmark of 18 datasets spanning harmful requests, jailbreaks, indirect prompt injections, and extraction attacks. We propose Leave-One-Dataset-Out (LODO) evaluation to measure true out-of-distribution generalization, revealing that the standard practice of train-test splits from the same dataset sources severely overestimates performance: aggregate metrics show an 8.4 percentage point AUC inflation, but per-dataset gaps range from 1% to 25% accuracy-exposing heterogeneous failure modes. To understand why classifiers fail to generalize, we analyze Sparse Auto-Encoder (SAE) feature coefficients across LODO folds, finding that 28% of top features are dataset-dependent shortcuts whose class signal depends on specific dataset compositions rather than semantic content. We systematically compare production guardrails (PromptGuard 2, LlamaGuard) and LLM-as-judge approaches on our benchmark, finding all three fail on indirect attacks targeting agents (7-37% detection) and that PromptGuard 2 and LlamaGuard cannot evaluate agentic tool injection due to architectural limitations. Finally, we show that LODO-stable SAE features provide more reliable explanations for classifier decisions by filtering dataset artifacts. We release our evaluation framework at https://github.com/maxf-zn/prompt-mining to establish LODO as the appropriate protocol for prompt attack detection research.

### [417] [Deep Dense Exploration for LLM Reinforcement Learning via Pivot-Driven Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14169)
*Yiran Guo,Zhongjian Qiao,Yingqi Xie,Jie Liu,Dan Ye,Ruiqing Zhang,Shuang Qiu,Lijie Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep Dense Exploration (DDE) improves reinforcement learning for large language models by targeting deep, recoverable states (pivots) and outperforms existing methods like GRPO and tree-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like GRPO and tree-based exploration struggle with uneven sampling and dilution, failing to explore deep, recoverable states effectively.

Method: DDE introduces DEEP-GRPO with three innovations: a utility function for pivot identification, local dense resampling at pivots, and a dual-stream optimization objective.

Result: Experiments show DDE outperforms GRPO and tree-based methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: DDE enhances exploration efficiency by focusing on pivotal states, leading to better performance in reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: Effective exploration is a key challenge in reinforcement learning for large language models: discovering high-quality trajectories within a limited sampling budget from the vast natural language sequence space. Existing methods face notable limitations: GRPO samples exclusively from the root, saturating high-probability trajectories while leaving deep, error-prone states under-explored. Tree-based methods blindly disperse budgets across trivial or unrecoverable states, causing sampling dilution that fails to uncover rare correct suffixes and destabilizes local baselines. To address this, we propose Deep Dense Exploration (DDE), a strategy that focuses exploration on $\textit{pivots}$-deep, recoverable states within unsuccessful trajectories. We instantiate DDE with DEEP-GRPO, which introduces three key innovations: (1) a lightweight data-driven utility function that automatically balances recoverability and depth bias to identify pivot states; (2) local dense resampling at each pivot to increase the probability of discovering correct subsequent trajectories; and (3) a dual-stream optimization objective that decouples global policy learning from local corrective updates. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms GRPO, tree-based methods, and other strong baselines.

### [418] [TS-Haystack: A Multi-Scale Retrieval Benchmark for Time Series Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14200)
*Nicolas Zumarraga,Thomas Kaar,Ning Wang,Maxwell A. Xu,Max Rosenblattl,Markus Kreft,Kevin O'Sullivan,Paul Schmiedmayer,Patrick Langer,Robert Jakob*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TS-Haystack introduces a long-context temporal retrieval benchmark highlighting limitations of current Time Series Language Models in handling extended sequences, revealing trade-offs between classification accuracy and retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for temporal localization in long-context time-series data exposes limitations of existing models, which are typically trained on short sequences.

Method: TS-Haystack benchmarks four task categories with controlled needle insertion in accelerometer recordings, evaluating models across varying context lengths.

Result: Compression aids classification but degrades retrieval performance, underscoring a trade-off between accuracy and temporal fidelity.

Conclusion: Architectural designs balancing sequence length and computational complexity without losing temporal detail are crucial for advancing TSLMs.

Abstract: Time Series Language Models (TSLMs) are emerging as unified models for reasoning over continuous signals in natural language. However, long-context retrieval remains a major limitation: existing models are typically trained and evaluated on short sequences, while real-world time-series sensor streams can span millions of datapoints. This mismatch requires precise temporal localization under strict computational constraints, a regime that is not captured by current benchmarks. We introduce TS-Haystack, a long-context temporal retrieval benchmark comprising ten task types across four categories: direct retrieval, temporal reasoning, multi-step reasoning and contextual anomaly. The benchmark uses controlled needle insertion by embedding short activity bouts into longer longitudinal accelerometer recordings, enabling systematic evaluation across context lengths ranging from seconds to 2 hours per sample. We hypothesize that existing TSLM time series encoders overlook temporal granularity as context length increases, creating a task-dependent effect: compression aids classification but impairs retrieval of localized events. Across multiple model and encoding strategies, we observe a consistent divergence between classification and retrieval behavior. Learned latent compression preserves or improves classification accuracy at compression ratios up to 176$\times$, but retrieval performance degrades with context length, incurring in the loss of temporally localized information. These results highlight the importance of architectural designs that decouple sequence length from computational complexity while preserving temporal fidelity.

### [419] [Fast Catch-Up, Late Switching: Optimal Batch Size Scheduling via Functional Scaling Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14208)
*Jinbo Wang,Binghui Li,Zhanpeng Zhou,Mingze Wang,Yuxuan Sun,Jiaqi Zhang,Xunliang Cai,Lei Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Batch size scheduling (BSS) impacts deep learning training, with optimal schedules varying by task difficulty. Easy tasks benefit from increasing batch sizes, while hard tasks require small batches until late training. A 'fast catch-up effect' explains rapid loss alignment after switching to large batches. Experiments confirm late-switch schedules outperform others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the theoretical foundations of batch size scheduling in deep learning, its optimization dynamics, and computational efficiency.

Method: Using the functional scaling law (FSL) framework to analyze BSS, characterizing optimal schedules under fixed data budgets and uncovering the 'fast catch-up effect'.

Result: Optimal BSS depends on task difficulty: easy tasks favor increasing batches; hard tasks require late switching. Late-switch schedules outperform constant-batch and early-switch baselines in LLM pretraining.

Conclusion: Late-switch batch size scheduling reduces data consumption without sacrificing performance, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Batch size scheduling (BSS) plays a critical role in large-scale deep learning training, influencing both optimization dynamics and computational efficiency. Yet, its theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we show that the functional scaling law (FSL) framework introduced in Li et al. (2025a) provides a principled lens for analyzing BSS. Specifically, we characterize the optimal BSS under a fixed data budget and show that its structure depends sharply on task difficulty. For easy tasks, optimal schedules keep increasing batch size throughout. In contrast, for hard tasks, the optimal schedule maintains small batch sizes for most of training and switches to large batches only in a late stage. To explain the emergence of late switching, we uncover a dynamical mechanism -- the fast catch-up effect -- which also manifests in large language model (LLM) pretraining. After switching from small to large batches, the loss rapidly aligns with the constant large-batch trajectory. Using FSL, we show that this effect stems from rapid forgetting of accumulated gradient noise, with the catch-up speed determined by task difficulty. Crucially, this effect implies that large batches can be safely deferred to late training without sacrificing performance, while substantially reducing data consumption. Finally, extensive LLM pretraining experiments -- covering both Dense and MoE architectures with up to 1.1B parameters and 1T tokens -- validate our theoretical predictions. Across all settings, late-switch schedules consistently outperform constant-batch and early-switch baselines.

### [420] [MAGE: All-[MASK] Block Already Knows Where to Look in Diffusion LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14209)
*Omin Kwon,Yeonjae Kim,Doyeon Kim,Minseo Kim,Yeonhong Park,Jae W. Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Block diffusion LLMs face memory bottlenecks due to KV caching. MAGE leverages attention patterns from the first denoising step to enable efficient, training-free sparse denoising, achieving near-lossless accuracy and speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Block diffusion LLMs suffer from memory access bottlenecks in long-context settings, and existing sparse attention methods for autoregressive models perform poorly when adapted. This work aims to address this gap.

Method: MAGE uses attention patterns from the first denoising step to predict important KV entries and budget requirements, enabling exact attention reuse for sparse denoising. A lightweight fine-tuning strategy strengthens patterns.

Result: MAGE achieves near-lossless accuracy on benchmarks like LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack, with 3-4x speedups and reduced KV budget usage, outperforming autoregressive baselines.

Conclusion: MAGE offers an efficient solution for block diffusion LLMs by leveraging unique attention opportunities, delivering significant performance gains with minimal training costs.

Abstract: Block diffusion LLMs are emerging as a promising next paradigm for language generation, but their use of KV caching makes memory access a dominant bottleneck in long-context settings. While dynamic sparse attention has been actively explored, existing methods designed for autoregressive LLMs rely on approximate importance estimation and perform poorly when adapted to block diffusion. This work identifies a key opportunity unique to block diffusion: attention at the first All-[MASK] denoising step reliably predicts important KV entries and budget requirements, enabling MAGE to perform a single exact attention pass per block and reuse it for training-free sparse denoising. Across long-context benchmarks including LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack, MAGE achieves near-lossless accuracy with a fraction of the KV budget while delivering up to 3-4x end-to-end speedup, consistently outperforming AR-oriented sparse attention baselines. A lightweight fine-tuning strategy further strengthens [MASK]-guided patterns with minimal cost, requiring only a few hours of training on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU for both 1.5B and 7B models.

*Seyedsaman Emami,Daniel Hernández-Lobato,Gonzalo Martínez-Muñoz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RMB-CLE is a robust multi-task learning framework that uses clustering and local ensembling to prevent negative transfer, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MTL suffers from negative transfer when unrelated tasks share representations. RMB-CLE addresses this by dynamically clustering tasks based on cross-task errors.

Method: RMB-CLE combines error-based task clustering (via agglomerative methods) and local ensembling to share knowledge adaptively while preserving task-specific patterns.

Result: Experiments confirm RMB-CLE accurately clusters tasks and outperforms multi-task, single-task, and ensemble methods in synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: RMB-CLE provides a scalable, theoretically grounded framework for robust MTL, reducing negative transfer and improving performance.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) aims to boost predictive performance by sharing information across related tasks, yet conventional methods often suffer from negative transfer when unrelated or noisy tasks are forced to share representations. We propose Robust Multi-Task Boosting using Clustering and Local Ensembling (RMB-CLE), a principled MTL framework that integrates error-based task clustering with local ensembling. Unlike prior work that assumes fixed clusters or hand-crafted similarity metrics, RMB-CLE derives inter-task similarity directly from cross-task errors, which admit a risk decomposition into functional mismatch and irreducible noise, providing a theoretically grounded mechanism to prevent negative transfer. Tasks are grouped adaptively via agglomerative clustering, and within each cluster, a local ensemble enables robust knowledge sharing while preserving task-specific patterns. Experiments show that RMB-CLE recovers ground-truth clusters in synthetic data and consistently outperforms multi-task, single-task, and pooling-based ensemble methods across diverse real-world and synthetic benchmarks. These results demonstrate that RMB-CLE is not merely a combination of clustering and boosting but a general and scalable framework that establishes a new basis for robust multi-task learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights recurring biases in financial LLM applications, proposing a framework to ensure structural validity before deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation practices in financial LLMs overlook biases, leading to inflated performance and unreliable results.

Method: Identifies five key biases (look-ahead, survivorship, narrative, objective, cost) and reviews 164 papers to assess bias awareness.

Result: Only 28% of studies discuss any bias, revealing widespread neglect. A Structural Validity Framework and checklist are proposed.

Conclusion: Explicit attention to biases and structural validity is crucial for reliable financial LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into financial workflows, but evaluation practice has not kept up. Finance-specific biases can inflate performance, contaminate backtests, and make reported results useless for any deployment claim. We identify five recurring biases in financial LLM applications. They include look-ahead bias, survivorship bias, narrative bias, objective bias, and cost bias. These biases break financial tasks in distinct ways and they often compound to create an illusion of validity. We reviewed 164 papers from 2023 to 2025 and found that no single bias is discussed in more than 28 percent of studies. This position paper argues that bias in financial LLM systems requires explicit attention and that structural validity should be enforced before any result is used to support a deployment claim. We propose a Structural Validity Framework and an evaluation checklist with minimal requirements for bias diagnosis and future system design.

*Pinqiao Wang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAD is a Multi-Agent Debating framework leveraging heterogeneous model disagreement for robust tabular anomaly detection, integrating ML and LLM critics with regret guarantees and improved benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tabular anomaly detection lacks robustness under distribution shifts and rare anomalies, motivating a dynamic, debate-driven approach.

Method: MAD employs ML-based detectors and LLM critics to produce anomaly scores, confidence, and evidence, coordinated via exponentiated-gradient updates.

Result: MAD outperforms baselines in robustness and provides auditable debate traces, supported by regret guarantees and conformal calibration.

Conclusion: MAD offers a unified, agentic solution for tabular anomaly detection, enhancing performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Tabular anomaly detection is often handled by single detectors or static ensembles, even though strong performance on tabular data typically comes from heterogeneous model families (e.g., tree ensembles, deep tabular networks, and tabular foundation models) that frequently disagree under distribution shift, missingness, and rare-anomaly regimes. We propose MAD, a Multi-Agent Debating framework that treats this disagreement as a first-class signal and resolves it through a mathematically grounded coordination layer. Each agent is a machine learning (ML)-based detector that produces a normalized anomaly score, confidence, and structured evidence, augmented by a large language model (LLM)-based critic. A coordinator converts these messages into bounded per-agent losses and updates agent influence via an exponentiated-gradient rule, yielding both a final debated anomaly score and an auditable debate trace. MAD is a unified agentic framework that can recover existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts gating and learning-with-expert-advice aggregation, by restricting the message space and synthesis operator. We establish regret guarantees for the synthesized losses and show how conformal calibration can wrap the debated score to control false positives under exchangeability. Experiments on diverse tabular anomaly benchmarks show improved robustness over baselines and clearer traces of model disagreement

TL;DR: DELTAiF, a transfer learning framework, optimizes hot water demand forecasting by leveraging knowledge from a representative household, reducing training time by 67% while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing hot water production in households with heat pumps requires scalable and accurate demand forecasting to reduce energy waste and ensure comfort.

Method: DELTAiF uses transfer learning to predict hot water consumption, starting with a representative household and fine-tuning across others, avoiding separate model training for each installation.

Result: DELTAiF achieves predictive accuracy values of 0.874-0.991 and mean absolute percentage error of 0.001-0.017, with a 67% reduction in training time.

Conclusion: Transfer learning is effective for scalable hot water demand forecasting, especially when source households exhibit regular consumption patterns.

Abstract: With the rapid increase in residential heat pump (HP) installations, optimizing hot water production in households is essential, yet it faces major technical and scalability challenges. Adapting production to actual household needs requires accurate forecasting of hot water demand to ensure comfort and, most importantly, to reduce energy waste. However, the conventional approach of training separate machine learning models for each household becomes computationally expensive at scale, particularly in cloud-connected HP deployments.
  This study introduces DELTAiF, a transfer learning (TL) based framework that provides scalable and accurate prediction of household hot water consumption. By predicting large hot water usage events, such as showers, DELTAiF enables adaptive yet scalable hot water production at the household level. DELTAiF leverages learned knowledge from a representative household and fine-tunes it across others, eliminating the need to train separate machine learning models for each HP installation. This approach reduces overall training time by approximately 67 percent while maintaining high predictive accuracy values between 0.874 and 0.991, and mean absolute percentage error values between 0.001 and 0.017. The results show that TL is particularly effective when the source household exhibits regular consumption patterns, enabling hot water demand forecasting at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised learning faces challenges in maximizing information due to dimensionality, and existing methods like VCReg are limited in achieving maximum entropy.

Method: The proposed Radial-VCReg augments VCReg with a radial Gaussianization loss to align feature norms with the Chi distribution, promoting more Gaussian-like representations.

Result: Radial-VCReg outperforms VCReg by reducing higher-order dependencies and enhancing representation diversity and informativeness, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Radial-VCReg effectively improves self-supervised learning by better aligning feature distributions with high-dimensional Gaussians, leading to more informative representations.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning aims to learn maximally informative representations, but explicit information maximization is hindered by the curse of dimensionality. Existing methods like VCReg address this by regularizing first and second-order feature statistics, which cannot fully achieve maximum entropy. We propose Radial-VCReg, which augments VCReg with a radial Gaussianization loss that aligns feature norms with the Chi distribution-a defining property of high-dimensional Gaussians. We prove that Radial-VCReg transforms a broader class of distributions towards normality compared to VCReg and show on synthetic and real-world datasets that it consistently improves performance by reducing higher-order dependencies and promoting more diverse and informative representations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal inference relies on structured data, which is often incomplete or unavailable. The paper addresses this gap.

Method: A framework leveraging transformer-based language models to perform causal inference using unstructured text.

Result: Consistent causal estimates derived from unstructured text compared to structured data at various levels.

Conclusion: The framework extends causal inference to scenarios with only textual data, aiding decision-making where structured data is scarce.

Abstract: Causal inference, a critical tool for informing business decisions, traditionally relies heavily on structured data. However, in many real-world scenarios, such data can be incomplete or unavailable. This paper presents a framework that leverages transformer-based language models to perform causal inference using unstructured text. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by comparing causal estimates derived from unstructured text against those obtained from structured data across population, group, and individual levels. Our findings show consistent results between the two approaches, validating the potential of unstructured text in causal inference tasks. Our approach extends the applicability of causal inference methods to scenarios where only textual data is available, enabling data-driven business decision-making when structured tabular data is scarce.

*Lamine Rihani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces reverse n-wise output testing, a method to test AI/ML and quantum computing systems by focusing on output behaviors and properties rather than deterministic inputs, improving fault detection and test efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional testing methods struggle with AI/ML and quantum systems due to their high-dimensional inputs, probabilistic outputs, and complex interactions among output properties. The paper aims to address these challenges by shifting focus to output behaviors.

Method: The method involves constructing covering arrays over output equivalence classes (e.g., ML confidence buckets, quantum measurement distributions) and using gradient-free metaheuristic optimization to synthesize inputs that elicit targeted behaviors from opaque models.

Result: The framework improves fault detection rates for ML calibration/boundary failures and quantum error syndromes, enhances test suite efficiency, and provides structured validation pipelines with automated coverage monitoring.

Conclusion: Reverse n-wise output testing offers a novel, customer-centric approach to testing AI/ML and quantum systems, addressing their unique challenges and improving reliability and coverage guarantees.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) systems and emerging quantum computing software present unprecedented testing challenges characterized by high-dimensional/continuous input spaces, probabilistic/non-deterministic output distributions, behavioral correctness defined exclusively over observable prediction behaviors and measurement outcomes, and critical quality dimensions, trustworthiness, fairness, calibration, robustness, error syndrome patterns, that manifest through complex multi-way interactions among semantically meaningful output properties rather than deterministic input-output mappings. This paper introduces reverse n-wise output testing, a mathematically principled paradigm inversion that constructs covering arrays directly over domain-specific output equivalence classes, ML confidence calibration buckets, decision boundary regions, fairness partitions, embedding clusters, ranking stability bands, quantum measurement outcome distributions (0-dominant, 1-dominant, superposition collapse), error syndrome patterns (bit-flip, phase-flip, correlated errors), then solves the computationally challenging black-box inverse mapping problem via gradient-free metaheuristic optimization to synthesize input feature configurations or quantum circuit parameters capable of eliciting targeted behavioral signatures from opaque models. The framework delivers synergistic benefits across both domains: explicit customer-centric prediction/measurement coverage guarantees, substantial improvements in fault detection rates for ML calibration/boundary failures and quantum error syndromes, enhanced test suite efficiency, and structured MLOps/quantum validation pipelines with automated partition discovery from uncertainty analysis and coverage drift monitoring.

TL;DR: A framework for adaptive group elicitation combines LLM-based question scoring and graph neural networks to efficiently gather population-level data under budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack adaptability in respondent selection and struggle with incomplete data, while large language models offer potential for better interaction.

Method: Uses an LLM-based information gain objective and heterogeneous graph neural networks to adaptively select questions and respondents under budgets.

Result: Achieves >12% relative gain in population-level response prediction at a 10% respondent budget on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves efficiency and accuracy in eliciting group-level information under constraints.

Abstract: Eliciting information to reduce uncertainty about latent group-level properties from surveys and other collective assessments requires allocating limited questioning effort under real costs and missing data. Although large language models enable adaptive, multi-turn interactions in natural language, most existing elicitation methods optimize what to ask with a fixed respondent pool, and do not adapt respondent selection or leverage population structure when responses are partial or incomplete. To address this gap, we study adaptive group elicitation, a multi-round setting where an agent adaptively selects both questions and respondents under explicit query and participation budgets. We propose a theoretically grounded framework that combines (i) an LLM-based expected information gain objective for scoring candidate questions with (ii) heterogeneous graph neural network propagation that aggregates observed responses and participant attributes to impute missing responses and guide per-round respondent selection. This closed-loop procedure queries a small, informative subset of individuals while inferring population-level responses via structured similarity. Across three real-world opinion datasets, our method consistently improves population-level response prediction under constrained budgets, including a >12% relative gain on CES at a 10% respondent budget.

Motivation: Optimizing CUDA code across GPU generations is complex due to hardware-specific nuances, and traditional methods (compilers, LLM finetuning) are limited or costly. Existing agentic workflows lack knowledge aggregation, leading to biases.

Method: Proposes KernelBlaster, using MAIC-RL to accumulate optimization knowledge in a Persistent CUDA Knowledge Base. Introduces a profile-guided, textual-gradient-based agentic flow for systematic CUDA optimization.

Result: Achieves geometric mean speedups of 1.43x, 2.50x, and 1.50x on KernelBench Levels 1-3 vs. PyTorch baseline.

Conclusion: KernelBlaster effectively improves CUDA optimization by leveraging learned knowledge, outperforming baselines and providing an open-source framework for reproducible evaluation.

Abstract: Optimizing CUDA code across multiple generations of GPU architectures is challenging, as achieving peak performance requires an extensive exploration of an increasingly complex, hardware-specific optimization space. Traditional compilers are constrained by fixed heuristics, whereas finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be expensive. However, agentic workflows for CUDA code optimization have limited ability to aggregate knowledge from prior exploration, leading to biased sampling and suboptimal solutions. We propose KernelBlaster, a Memory-Augmented In-context Reinforcement Learning (MAIC-RL) framework designed to improve CUDA optimization search capabilities of LLM-based GPU coding agents. KernelBlaster enables agents to learn from experience and make systematically informed decisions on future tasks by accumulating knowledge into a retrievable Persistent CUDA Knowledge Base. We propose a novel profile-guided, textual-gradient-based agentic flow for CUDA generation and optimization to achieve high performance across generations of GPU architectures. KernelBlaster guides LLM agents to systematically explore high-potential optimization strategies beyond naive rewrites. Compared to the PyTorch baseline, our method achieves geometric mean speedups of 1.43x, 2.50x, and 1.50x on KernelBench Levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively. We release KernelBlaster as an open-source agentic framework, accompanied by a test harness, verification components, and a reproducible evaluation pipeline.

### [430] [Machine Learning as a Tool (MLAT): A Framework for Integrating Statistical ML Models as Callable Tools within LLM Agent Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14295)
*Edwin Chen,Zulekha Bibi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLAT is a design pattern integrating pre-trained ML models as tools in LLM workflows, validated by PitchCraft, a system reducing proposal generation time significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLM workflows by integrating ML models as dynamic tools for quantitative predictions, improving efficiency and context-aware reasoning.

Method: MLAT exposes ML models as callable tools in LLM workflows. PitchCraft uses two agents: Research Agent gathers data, Draft Agent invokes an XGBoost model for pricing and generates proposals.

Result: PitchCraft reduces proposal time from hours to under 10 minutes. The XGBoost model achieves R^2 = 0.807 and MAE of 3688 USD.

Conclusion: MLAT effectively integrates ML models into LLM workflows, enabling dynamic, context-aware quantitative predictions and efficiency gains.

Abstract: We introduce Machine Learning as a Tool (MLAT), a design pattern in which pre-trained statistical machine learning models are exposed as callable tools within large language model (LLM) agent workflows. This allows an orchestrating agent to invoke quantitative predictions when needed and reason about their outputs in context. Unlike conventional pipelines that treat ML inference as a static preprocessing step, MLAT positions the model as a first-class tool alongside web search, database queries, and APIs, enabling the LLM to decide when and how to use it based on conversational context.
  To validate MLAT, we present PitchCraft, a pilot production system that converts discovery call recordings into professional proposals with ML-predicted pricing. The system uses two agents: a Research Agent that gathers prospect intelligence via parallel tool calls, and a Draft Agent that invokes an XGBoost pricing model as a tool call and generates a complete proposal through structured outputs. The pricing model, trained on 70 examples combining real and human-verified synthetic data, achieves R^2 = 0.807 on held-out data with a mean absolute error of 3688 USD. The system reduces proposal generation time from multiple hours to under 10 minutes.
  We describe the MLAT framework, structured output architecture, training methodology under extreme data scarcity, and sensitivity analysis demonstrating meaningful learned relationships. MLAT generalizes to domains requiring quantitative estimation combined with contextual reasoning.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for further research to address trustworthiness issues in transformer models.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized machine learning across a wide range of domains, from natural language processing to scientific computing. However, their growing deployment in high-stakes applications, such as computer vision, natural language processing, healthcare, autonomous systems, and critical areas of scientific computing including climate modeling, materials discovery, drug discovery, nuclear science, and robotics, necessitates a deeper and more rigorous understanding of their trustworthiness. In this work, we critically examine the foundational question: \textitHow trustworthy are transformer models?} We evaluate their reliability through a comprehensive review of interpretability, explainability, robustness against adversarial attacks, fairness, and privacy. We systematically examine the trustworthiness of transformer-based models in safety-critical applications spanning natural language processing, computer vision, and science and engineering domains, including robotics, medicine, earth sciences, materials science, fluid dynamics, nuclear science, and automated theorem proving; highlighting high-impact areas where these architectures are central and analyzing the risks associated with their deployment. By synthesizing insights across these diverse areas, we identify recurring structural vulnerabilities, domain-specific risks, and open research challenges that limit the reliable deployment of transformers.

*Hani Beirami,M M Manjurul Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications and a conformal shield enhances RL control safety and robustness in aerospace applications, outperforming baseline and classical STL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the safety and robustness of RL control in aerospace by integrating formal temporal logic specifications.

Method: Train a PPO agent for throttle control and airspeed tracking in an F-16 simulation, enforce STL requirements with a conformal shield, and compare it with baseline and classical shields under stress scenarios.

Result: The conformal shield maintains STL satisfaction, near baseline performance, and stronger robustness guarantees compared to the classical shield.

Conclusion: Integrating formal specifications with RL control significantly enhances autonomous flight reliability in challenging environments.

Abstract: We investigate how formal temporal logic specifications can enhance the safety and robustness of reinforcement learning (RL) control in aerospace applications. Using the open source AeroBench F-16 simulation benchmark, we train a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent to regulate engine throttle and track commanded airspeed. The control objective is encoded as a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) requirement to maintain airspeed within a prescribed band during the final seconds of each maneuver. To enforce this specification at run time, we introduce a conformal STL shield that filters the RL agent's actions using online conformal prediction. We compare three settings: (i) PPO baseline, (ii) PPO with a classical rule-based STL shield, and (iii) PPO with the proposed conformal shield, under both nominal conditions and a severe stress scenario involving aerodynamic model mismatch, actuator rate limits, measurement noise, and mid-episode setpoint jumps. Experiments show that the conformal shield preserves STL satisfaction while maintaining near baseline performance and providing stronger robustness guarantees than the classical shield. These results demonstrate that combining formal specification monitoring with data driven RL control can substantially improve the reliability of autonomous flight control in challenging environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AERO enhances GRPO by using adaptive rollouts, selective pruning, and Bayesian posterior to avoid zero-advantage scenarios, reducing compute by 48% and wall-clock time by 45% without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO wastes compute when all rollouts in a group share the same outcome, yielding no gradient signal. AERO addresses this inefficiency.

Method: AERO employs adaptive rollout strategies, selective rejection to prune rollouts, and maintains a Bayesian posterior to prevent zero-advantage dead zones.

Result: AERO reduces training compute by ~48% and wall-clock time by ~45%, while maintaining or improving Pass@8 and Avg@8 metrics.

Conclusion: AERO is a scalable, compute-efficient strategy for RL-based LLM alignment, outperforming GRPO without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a central role in large language model (LLM) post-training. Among existing approaches, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is widely used, especially for RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR) fine-tuning. In GRPO, each query prompts the LLM to generate a group of rollouts with a fixed group size $N$. When all rollouts in a group share the same outcome, either all correct or all incorrect, the group-normalized advantages become zero, yielding no gradient signal and wasting fine-tuning compute. We introduce Adaptive Efficient Rollout Optimization (AERO), an enhancement of GRPO. AERO uses an adaptive rollout strategy, applies selective rejection to strategically prune rollouts, and maintains a Bayesian posterior to prevent zero-advantage dead zones. Across three model configurations (Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct), AERO improves compute efficiency without sacrificing performance. Under the same total rollout budget, AERO reduces total training compute by about 48% while shortening wall-clock time per step by about 45% on average. Despite the substantial reduction in compute, AERO matches or improves Pass@8 and Avg@8 over GRPO, demonstrating a practical, scalable, and compute-efficient strategy for RL-based LLM alignment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical neural architecture with an attention mechanism to improve multi-task reinforcement learning by leveraging linear temporal logic (LTL) for structured task representations and better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to capture the logical and temporal structure in LTL specifications, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot execution of novel tasks.

Method: Proposes conditioning policies on sequences of Boolean formulae derived from task automata, using a hierarchical neural architecture and attention mechanism.

Result: Experiments show superior performance and generalization in complex environments compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses limitations in capturing LTL structure, enhancing task execution and generalization.

Abstract: We study instruction following in multi-task reinforcement learning, where an agent must zero-shot execute novel tasks not seen during training. In this setting, linear temporal logic (LTL) has recently been adopted as a powerful framework for specifying structured, temporally extended tasks. While existing approaches successfully train generalist policies, they often struggle to effectively capture the rich logical and temporal structure inherent in LTL specifications. In this work, we address these concerns with a novel approach to learn structured task representations that facilitate training and generalisation. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of Boolean formulae constructed from a finite automaton of the task. We propose a hierarchical neural architecture to encode the logical structure of these formulae, and introduce an attention mechanism that enables the policy to reason about future subgoals. Experiments in a variety of complex environments demonstrate the strong generalisation capabilities and superior performance of our approach.

TL;DR: WIMLE, a model-based RL method, improves sample efficiency and performance by leveraging IMLE for multi-modal dynamics and uncertainty-aware weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of traditional model-based RL—such as compounding model error, unimodal world models, and overconfident predictions—by introducing stochastic, multi-modal dynamics and uncertainty estimation.

Method: Extends IMLE to learn multi-modal world models without iterative sampling, uses ensembles and latent sampling for uncertainty estimation, and weights synthetic transitions by confidence during training.

Result: Superior sample efficiency and competitive/asymptotic performance across 40 tasks (DeepMind Control, MyoSuite, HumanoidBench). Notable improvements include 50%+ efficiency on Humanoid-run and solving 8/14 tasks in HumanoidBench.

Conclusion: WIMLE demonstrates the effectiveness of IMLE-based multi-modality and uncertainty-aware weighting for stable and efficient model-based RL.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning promises strong sample efficiency but often underperforms in practice due to compounding model error, unimodal world models that average over multi-modal dynamics, and overconfident predictions that bias learning. We introduce WIMLE, a model-based method that extends Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) to the model-based RL framework to learn stochastic, multi-modal world models without iterative sampling and to estimate predictive uncertainty via ensembles and latent sampling. During training, WIMLE weights each synthetic transition by its predicted confidence, preserving useful model rollouts while attenuating bias from uncertain predictions and enabling stable learning. Across $40$ continuous-control tasks spanning DeepMind Control, MyoSuite, and HumanoidBench, WIMLE achieves superior sample efficiency and competitive or better asymptotic performance than strong model-free and model-based baselines. Notably, on the challenging Humanoid-run task, WIMLE improves sample efficiency by over $50$\% relative to the strongest competitor, and on HumanoidBench it solves $8$ of $14$ tasks (versus $4$ for BRO and $5$ for SimbaV2). These results highlight the value of IMLE-based multi-modality and uncertainty-aware weighting for stable model-based RL.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-class online fuzzy classifier for dynamic environments, extending conventional two-class methods to handle multi-class problems, validated through experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of conventional online fuzzy classifiers, which only handle two-class problems, by extending them to multi-class scenarios in dynamic environments.

Method: The method involves using fuzzy if-then rules with antecedent fuzzy sets predefined by humans and consequent values learned from training data, adapting to patterns available incrementally over time steps.

Result: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-class online fuzzy classifier through numerical experiments on synthetic dynamic data and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The conclusion affirms the feasibility and performance of extending online fuzzy classifiers to multi-class problems in dynamic environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-class online fuzzy classifier for dynamic environments. A fuzzy classifier comprises a set of fuzzy if-then rules where human users determine the antecedent fuzzy sets beforehand. In contrast, the consequent real values are determined by learning from training data. In an online framework, not all training dataset patterns are available beforehand. Instead, only a few patterns are available at a time step, and the subsequent patterns become available at the following time steps. The conventional online fuzzy classifier considered only two-class problems. This paper investigates the extension to the conventional fuzzy classifiers for multi-class problems. We evaluate the performance of the multi-class online fuzzy classifiers through numerical experiments on synthetic dynamic data and also several benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an information-theoretic framework to analyze how data augmentation affects generalization and invariance learning in machine learning. It introduces a generalization bound decomposed into three interpretable terms and validates the theory with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand the theoretical role of data augmentation in improving generalization and invariance learning, which remains partially understood despite its widespread use.

Method: The authors extend mutual information-based bounds by modeling augmented distributions and introducing an orbit-averaged loss function. Under sub-Gaussian assumptions, they derive a generalization bound decomposed into three terms: distributional divergence, stability, and sensitivity.

Result: The framework yields a generalization bound that decomposes the gap into interpretable components and introduces the concept of group diameter to highlight trade-offs in augmentation. Experiments confirm the theory's predictive reliability.

Conclusion: The information-theoretic framework provides a clear understanding of data augmentation's role, linking geometry (group diameter) to generalization trade-offs. Empirical results support the theoretical insights.

Abstract: Data augmentation is one of the most widely used techniques to improve generalization in modern machine learning, often justified by its ability to promote invariance to label-irrelevant transformations. However, its theoretical role remains only partially understood. In this work, we propose an information-theoretic framework that systematically accounts for the effect of augmentation on generalization and invariance learning. Our approach builds upon mutual information-based bounds, which relate the generalization gap to the amount of information a learning algorithm retains about its training data. We extend this framework by modeling the augmented distribution as a composition of the original data distribution with a distribution over transformations, which naturally induces an orbit-averaged loss function. Under mild sub-Gaussian assumptions on the loss function and the augmentation process, we derive a new generalization bound that decompose the expected generalization gap into three interpretable terms: (1) a distributional divergence between the original and augmented data, (2) a stability term measuring the algorithm dependence on training data, and (3) a sensitivity term capturing the effect of augmentation variability. To connect our bounds to the geometry of the augmentation group, we introduce the notion of group diameter, defined as the maximal perturbation that augmentations can induce in the input space. The group diameter provides a unified control parameter that bounds all three terms and highlights an intrinsic trade-off: small diameters preserve data fidelity but offer limited regularization, while large diameters enhance stability at the cost of increased bias and sensitivity. We validate our theoretical bounds with numerical experiments, demonstrating that it reliably tracks and predicts the behavior of the true generalization gap.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework using counterfactuals, necessity, and sufficiency to evaluate the robustness of LIME and SHAP explanations for hydrocarbon prospect risking, aiming to improve trustworthiness in machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of transparency in machine learning models for hydrocarbon exploration and differing explanations from XAI methods like LIME and SHAP necessitate a more reliable evaluation framework.

Method: The paper introduces a unified framework to generate counterfactuals and quantify necessity and sufficiency, applying it to assess LIME and SHAP on high-dimensional prospect risking data.

Result: The framework provides deeper insights into model robustness and identifies the best XAI-module pairings for hydrocarbon indication tasks.

Conclusion: Grounding explanations with causal concepts improves reliability, aiding in better decision-making for hydrocarbon exploration.

Abstract: In geophysics, hydrocarbon prospect risking involves assessing the risks associated with hydrocarbon exploration by integrating data from various sources. Machine learning-based classifiers trained on tabular data have been recently used to make faster decisions on these prospects. The lack of transparency in the decision-making processes of such models has led to the emergence of explainable AI (XAI). LIME and SHAP are two such examples of these XAI methods which try to generate explanations of a particular decision by ranking the input features in terms of importance. However, explanations of the same scenario generated by these two different explanation strategies have shown to disagree or be different, particularly for complex data. This is because the definitions of "importance" and "relevance" differ for different explanation strategies. Thus, grounding these ranked features using theoretically backed causal ideas of necessity and sufficiency can prove to be a more reliable and robust way to improve the trustworthiness of the concerned explanation strategies.We propose a unified framework to generate counterfactuals as well as quantify necessity and sufficiency and use these to perform a robustness evaluation of the explanations provided by LIME and SHAP on high dimensional structured prospect risking data. This robustness test gives us deeper insights into the models capabilities to handle erronous data and which XAI module works best in pair with which model for our dataset for hydorcarbon indication.

*Arnav Chavan,Nahush Lele,Udbhav Bamba,Sankalp Dayal,Aditi Raghunathan,Deepak Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses activation outliers in transformer models, linking them to dominant singular values in weights, and proposes Selective Spectral Decay ($S^2D$) to improve quantization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Activation outliers in large-scale transformer models hinder quantization, causing accuracy drops. The severity increases with pre-training scale, necessitating a solution.

Method: The authors propose $S^2D$, a method that selectively regularizes weight components tied to the largest singular values during fine-tuning to reduce outliers.

Result: $S^2D$ reduces activation outliers, improves model conditioning, and achieves up to 7% better PTQ accuracy on ImageNet under W4A4 quantization.

Conclusion: $S^2D$ effectively mitigates outlier issues, enhances quantization-friendliness, and scales well across tasks and models, maintaining deployment efficiency.

Abstract: Activation outliers in large-scale transformer models pose a fundamental challenge to model quantization, creating excessively large ranges that cause severe accuracy drops during quantization. We empirically observe that outlier severity intensifies with pre-training scale (e.g., progressing from CLIP to the more extensively trained SigLIP and SigLIP2). Through theoretical analysis as well as empirical correlation studies, we establish the direct link between these activation outliers and dominant singular values of the weights. Building on this insight, we propose Selective Spectral Decay ($S^2D$), a geometrically-principled conditioning method that surgically regularizes only the weight components corresponding to the largest singular values during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that $S^2D$ significantly reduces activation outliers and produces well-conditioned representations that are inherently quantization-friendly. Models trained with $S^2D$ achieve up to 7% improved PTQ accuracy on ImageNet under W4A4 quantization and 4% gains when combined with QAT. These improvements also generalize across downstream tasks and vision-language models, enabling the scaling of increasingly large and rigorously trained models without sacrificing deployment efficiency.

*Hasi Hays*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Selective Synchronization Attention (SSA), a novel attention mechanism based on the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators, offering sparsity, unified encoding, and efficient computation for Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the quadratic computational complexity of standard self-attention and lack of biological grounding in Transformers, the authors propose SSA as a more efficient and biologically plausible alternative.

Method: SSA replaces dot-product self-attention with a closed-form operator from the Kuramoto model, representing tokens as oscillators with learnable frequencies and phases. Attention weights are derived from synchronization strength based on frequency coupling and phase-locking.

Result: SSA provides natural sparsity, unified positional-semantic encoding, and efficient computation without explicit masking or iterative steps. Tests show its non-uniform coupling patterns offer stronger inductive bias than standard Transformers.

Conclusion: SSA and the Oscillatory Synchronization Network (OSN) present a promising alternative to standard Transformers, combining efficiency, biological inspiration, and improved architectural biases.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become the foundation of modern deep learning, yet its core self-attention mechanism suffers from quadratic computational complexity and lacks grounding in biological neural computation. We propose Selective Synchronization Attention (SSA), a novel attention mechanism that replaces the standard dot-product self-attention with a closed-form operator derived from the steady-state solution of the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators. In SSA, each token is represented as an oscillator characterized by a learnable natural frequency and phase; the synchronization strength between token pairs, determined by a frequency-dependent coupling and phase-locking condition, serves as the attention weight. This formulation provides three key advantages: (i) natural sparsity arising from the phase-locking threshold, whereby tokens with incompatible frequencies automatically receive zero attention weight without explicit masking; (ii) unified positional-semantic encoding through the natural frequency spectrum, eliminating the need for separate positional encodings; and (iii) a single-pass, closed-form computation that avoids iterative ODE integration, with all components (coupling, order parameter, synchronization) derived from the oscillatory framework. We instantiate SSA within the Oscillatory Synchronization Network (OSN), a drop-in replacement for the Transformer block. Analysis of the synchronization matrices reveals non-uniform, head-diverse coupling patterns even at initialization, demonstrating a stronger architectural inductive bias than the approximately uniform attention produced by randomly initialized Transformers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WiSparse leverages activation and weight information for adaptive sparsity allocation in LLMs, preserving performance while reducing inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for efficient LLM inference rely on uniform sparsity ratios and overlook weight-activation interplay, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: WiSparse combines weight-aware mechanisms with mixed-granularity allocation, using evolutionary search to distribute sparsity and minimize reconstruction error.

Result: At 50% sparsity, WiSparse preserves 97% of Llama3.1's dense performance and achieves a 21.4% speedup, outperforming baselines by 2.23 percentage points.

Conclusion: WiSparse advances training-free activation sparsity for LLMs, demonstrating significant speedup without performance loss.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong capabilities but incur high inference costs due to dense computation and memory access. Training-free activation sparsity is a promising approach for efficient LLM inference, yet existing methods often rely solely on activation information and uniform sparsity ratios. This overlooks the critical interplay with weights and inter-block sensitivity variation, leading to suboptimal performance. We identify two key phenomena in modern LLMs: 1) less significant activations may align with highly important weights, and 2) sparsity sensitivity varies non-monotonically across model blocks. We propose Weight-aware Mixed-Granularity Training-free Activation Sparsity (WiSparse), which leverages both activation and weight information for adaptive sparsity allocation. Specifically, we introduce a weight-aware mechanism integrating activation magnitudes with precomputed weight norms to accurately identify salient channels. This is combined with a mixed-granularity allocation scheme: a global budget is distributed across blocks via evolutionary search to protect sensitive regions, then refined within blocks to minimize reconstruction error. We improve sparse kernels and demonstrate effectiveness on three representative models. Notably, at 50% sparsity, WiSparse preserves 97% of Llama3.1's dense performance, surpassing the strongest baseline by 2.23 percentage points while achieving a 21.4% acceleration in end-to-end inference speed. Our research advances the limits of training-free approaches for efficient LLM inference, pushing the boundaries of achievable speedup without training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TLVD, a novel causal modeling framework that combines LLMs and traditional causal discovery algorithms to infer latent variables, addressing limitations like no latent confounders assumption and semantic precision. TLVD shows significant improvements in accuracy and reliability across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal discovery algorithms (TCDA) face challenges due to assumptions of no latent confounders and imprecise semantics of latent variables. The need for better causal mechanisms motivates the integration of LLMs to enhance inferencing.

Method: TLVD first constructs a causal graph with latent variables using a data-driven approach. It then employs multi-LLM collaboration, modeled as a game with incomplete information, to infer latent variables via Bayesian Nash Equilibrium. LLMs are also used for evidence validation.

Result: TLVD demonstrated effectiveness and reliability with average improvements of 32.67% in accuracy (Acc), 62.21% in conditional accuracy (CAcc), and 26.72% in evidence citation (ECit) across five datasets.

Conclusion: The TLVD framework successfully addresses limitations of TCDA by leveraging LLMs for latent variable inference and validation, achieving significant performance gains in real-world applications.

Abstract: Revealing the underlying causal mechanisms in the real world is crucial for scientific and technological progress. Despite notable advances in recent decades, the lack of high-quality data and the reliance of traditional causal discovery algorithms (TCDA) on the assumption of no latent confounders, as well as their tendency to overlook the precise semantics of latent variables, have long been major obstacles to the broader application of causal discovery. To address this issue, we propose a novel causal modeling framework, TLVD, which integrates the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with the data-driven modeling capabilities of TCDA for inferring latent variables and their semantics. Specifically, we first employ a data-driven approach to construct a causal graph that incorporates latent variables. Then, we employ multi-LLM collaboration for latent variable inference, modeling this process as a game with incomplete information and seeking its Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) to infer the possible specific latent variables. Finally, to validate the inferred latent variables across multiple real-world web-based data sources, we leverage LLMs for evidence exploration to ensure traceability. We comprehensively evaluate TLVD on three de-identified real patient datasets provided by a hospital and two benchmark datasets. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of TLVD, with average improvements of 32.67% in Acc, 62.21% in CAcc, and 26.72% in ECit across the five datasets.

*Hong Li,Zhen Zhou,Honggang Zhang,Yuping Luo,Xinyue Wang,Han Gong,Zhiyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies 'silent inconsistency' in DP training of LLMs, where worker-level optimization dynamics diverge despite synchronized weights. It proposes a lightweight diagnostic framework with three metrics to quantify this inconsistency, validated experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the hidden divergence in worker-level losses and gradients during DP training, which conventional aggregated signals fail to detect.

Method: Introduces three metrics—loss dispersion, gradient-norm dispersion, and gradient-direction consistency—measured using existing training signals, requiring no pipeline modifications.

Result: Experiments show increased divergence under controlled perturbations, despite smooth global loss curves, validating the metrics' effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework provides actionable insights into hidden instability modes in DP fine-tuning, aiding reliable diagnosis and configuration assessment.

Abstract: Data-parallel (DP) training with synchronous all-reduce is a dominant paradigm for full-parameter fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). While parameter synchronization guarantees numerical equivalence of model weights after each iteration, it does not necessarily imply alignment of worker-level optimization dynamics before gradient aggregation. This paper identifies and studies this latent mismatch, termed \emph{silent inconsistency}, where cross-worker divergence in losses and gradients can remain invisible under conventional aggregated monitoring signals. We propose a lightweight, model-agnostic diagnostic framework that quantifies worker-level consistency using training signals readily available in standard pipelines. Specifically, we introduce three complementary metrics: loss dispersion, gradient-norm dispersion, and gradient-direction consistency measured by inter-worker cosine similarity. The proposed metrics incur negligible overhead and require no modification to model architecture, synchronization mechanisms, or optimization algorithms. We validate the framework by fully fine-tuning the 1B-parameter \texttt{openPangu-Embedded-1B-V1.1} model on the \texttt{tatsu-lab/alpaca} dataset using an 8-NPU DP setup, under controlled perturbations of cross-rank stochasticity. Experimental results show that progressively desynchronized data shuffling and random seeds lead to substantial increases in loss/gradient dispersion and reduced directional alignment, despite smooth globally averaged loss curves.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LACONIC is a reinforcement learning method that enforces a target token budget during training, balancing brevity and task performance by adaptively adjusting a length-based cost. It reduces output length by over 50% while preserving or improving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for LLMs often produce excessively long responses, increasing inference latency and computational overhead. Fixed heuristic approaches for length control misalign with task objectives and require brittle tuning.

Method: LACONIC combines task reward with a length-based cost in the training objective, adaptively adjusting the cost scale to balance brevity and performance. It integrates into standard RL-tuning without inference changes.

Result: LACONIC reduces output length by over 50% across mathematical reasoning models and datasets while preserving or improving pass@1. It also maintains performance on general knowledge and multilingual benchmarks with 44% fewer tokens.

Conclusion: LACONIC provides robust length control for LLMs during RL training, improving efficiency without compromising task performance or requiring significant deployment overhead.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through reward-driven training. Nevertheless, this process can introduce excessively long responses, inflating inference latency and computational overhead. Prior length-control approaches typically rely on fixed heuristic reward shaping, which can misalign with the task objective and require brittle tuning. In this work, we propose LACONIC, a reinforcement learning method that enforces a target token budget during training. Specifically, we update policy models using an augmented objective that combines the task reward with a length-based cost. To balance brevity and task performance, the cost scale is adaptively adjusted throughout training. This yields robust length control while preserving task reward. We provide a theoretical guarantee that support the method. Across mathematical reasoning models and datasets, LACONIC preserves or improves pass@1 while reducing output length by over 50%. It maintains out-of-domain performance on general knowledge and multilingual benchmarks with 44% fewer tokens. Moreover, LACONIC integrates into standard RL-tuning with no inference changes and minimal deployment overhead.

*Aadirupa Saha,Amith Bhat,Haipeng Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOAR algorithm addresses MAB with heterogeneous data sources by pruning high-variance sources and balancing min-max LCB-UCB, achieving optimal regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling MAB problems with multiple data sources of unknown variances, aiming to minimize regret while identifying the best arm and optimal source.

Method: SOAR uses variance-concentration bounds to prune high-variance sources and integrates min-max LCB-UCB for arm and source optimization.

Result: SOAR achieves an instance-dependent regret bound of ~O(σ*²∑(log T)/Δ_i + √(K∑σ_j²)), outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: SOAR efficiently minimizes regret without prior knowledge of the optimal source, bridging gaps in existing methods.

Abstract: We study $K$-armed Multiarmed Bandit (MAB) problem with $M$ heterogeneous data sources, each exhibiting unknown and distinct noise variances $\{σ_j^2\}_{j=1}^M$. The learner's objective is standard MAB regret minimization, with the additional complexity of adaptively selecting which data source to query from at each round. We propose Source-Optimistic Adaptive Regret minimization (SOAR), a novel algorithm that quickly prunes high-variance sources using sharp variance-concentration bounds, followed by a `balanced min-max LCB-UCB approach' that seamlessly integrates the parallel tasks of identifying the best arm and the optimal (minimum-variance) data source. Our analysis shows SOAR achieves an instance-dependent regret bound of $\tilde{O}\left({σ^*}^2\sum_{i=2}^K \frac{\log T}{Δ_i} + \sqrt{K \sum_{j=1}^M σ_j^2}\right)$, up to preprocessing costs depending only on problem parameters, where ${σ^*}^2 := \min_j σ_j^2$ is the minimum source variance and $Δ_i$ denotes the suboptimality gap of the $i$-th arm. This result is both surprising as despite lacking prior knowledge of the minimum-variance source among $M$ alternatives, SOAR attains the optimal instance-dependent regret of standard single-source MAB with variance ${σ^*}^2$, while incurring only an small (and unavoidable) additive cost of $\tilde O(\sqrt{K \sum_{j=1}^M σ_j^2})$ towards the optimal (minimum variance) source identification. Our theoretical bounds represent a significant improvement over some proposed baselines, e.g. Uniform UCB or Explore-then-Commit UCB, which could potentially suffer regret scaling with $σ_{\max}^2$ in place of ${σ^*}^2$-a gap that can be arbitrarily large when $σ_{\max} \gg σ^*$. Experiments on multiple synthetic problem instances and the real-world MovieLens\;25M dataset, demonstrating the superior performance of SOAR over the baselines.

TL;DR: The paper addresses confounds in measuring neural network representational similarity due to network scale and introduces a calibration framework. It revisits the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, revealing nuanced convergence patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To correct inflated representational similarity scores caused by network scale and reassess the Platonic Representation Hypothesis.

Method: Introduces a permutation-based null-calibration framework to transform similarity metrics into calibrated scores.

Result: Global convergence largely disappears after calibration, but local neighborhood similarity retains agreement.

Conclusion: Proposes the Aristotelian Representation Hypothesis, emphasizing convergence to shared local neighborhood relationships.

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that representations from neural networks are converging to a common statistical model of reality. We show that the existing metrics used to measure representational similarity are confounded by network scale: increasing model depth or width can systematically inflate representational similarity scores. To correct these effects, we introduce a permutation-based null-calibration framework that transforms any representational similarity metric into a calibrated score with statistical guarantees. We revisit the Platonic Representation Hypothesis with our calibration framework, which reveals a nuanced picture: the apparent convergence reported by global spectral measures largely disappears after calibration, while local neighborhood similarity, but not local distances, retains significant agreement across different modalities. Based on these findings, we propose the Aristotelian Representation Hypothesis: representations in neural networks are converging to shared local neighborhood relationships.

TL;DR: Mixture of Space (MoS) introduces a framework combining multiple geometric spaces for richer representations, extended by MoSLoRA for dynamic space selection, improving performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods in Euclidean space limit capturing complex geometric structures in language data, prompting exploration of alternative geometric spaces.

Method: Proposes MoS for multiple geometric spaces and MoSLoRA for dynamic selection, with a lightweight routing mechanism to reduce computational overhead.

Result: MoSLoRA outperforms baselines, achieving up to 5.6% and 15.9% improvements on MATH500 and MAWPS benchmarks.

Conclusion: MoSLoRA enhances model expressiveness and performance by leveraging diverse geometric spaces dynamically.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) emerging as a key technique for downstream task adaptation. However, existing PEFT methods mainly operate in Euclidean space, fundamentally limiting their capacity to capture complex geometric structures inherent in language data. While alternative geometric spaces, like hyperbolic geometries for hierarchical data and spherical manifolds for circular patterns, offer theoretical advantages, forcing representations into a single manifold type ultimately limits expressiveness, even when curvature parameters are learnable. To address this, we propose Mixture of Space (MoS), a unified framework that leverages multiple geometric spaces simultaneously to learn richer, curvature-aware representations. Building on this scheme, we develop MoSLoRA, which extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with heterogeneous geometric experts, enabling models to dynamically select or combine appropriate geometric spaces based on input context. Furthermore, to address the computational overhead of frequent manifold switching, we develop a lightweight routing mechanism. Moreover, we provide empirical insights into how curvature optimization impacts training stability and model performance. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoSLoRA consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 5.6% improvement on MATH500 and 15.9% on MAWPS.

### [448] [Divine Benevolence is an $x^2$: GLUs scale asymptotically faster than MLPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14495)
*Alejandro Francisco Queiruga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explains the superior scaling of GLU variants in LLMs using numerical analysis, showing they achieve faster asymptotic scaling (L(P)∝P−3) than MLPs (L(P)=P−2) due to their piecewise quadratic forms. It introduces the Gated Quadratic Unit for even better scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond empirical discoveries and explain why GLU variants dominate large models, leveraging numerical analysis to uncover their superior scaling properties.

Method: Applies numerical analysis to compare GLUs and MLPs, demonstrating their scaling slopes (L(P)) via theoretical derivation and empirical verification on 1D function approximation. Introduces the Gated Quadratic Unit.

Result: GLUs scale as L(P)∝P−3, outperforming MLPs (L(P)=P−2). The proposed Gated Quadratic Unit shows steeper scaling, suggesting potential for improved large model architectures.

Conclusion: Architecture design can be guided by numerical theory, unlocking better scaling in large models. The Gated Quadratic Unit exemplifies this approach.

Abstract: Scaling laws can be understood from ground-up numerical analysis, where traditional function approximation theory can explain shifts in model architecture choices. GLU variants now dominate frontier LLMs and similar outer-product architectures are prevalent in ranking models. The success of these architectures has mostly been left as an empirical discovery. In this paper, we apply the tools of numerical analysis to expose a key factor: these models have an $x^2$ which enables \emph{asymptotically} faster scaling than MLPs. GLUs have piecewise quadratic functional forms that are sufficient to exhibit quadratic order of approximation. Our key contribution is to demonstrate that the $L(P)$ scaling slope is $L(P)\propto P^{-3}$ for GLUs but only $L(P)=P^{-2}$ for MLPs on function reconstruction problems. We provide a parameter construction and empirical verification of these slopes for 1D function approximation. From the first principles we discover, we make one stride and propose the ``Gated Quadratic Unit'' which has an even steeper $L(P)$ slope than the GLU and MLP. This opens the possibility of architecture design from first principles numerical theory to unlock superior scaling in large models.

TL;DR: Transformers solve quadratic programs (QPs) via linear attention and MLPs, benefiting decision-making like portfolio optimization by outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage transformers for solving QPs and improving decision-making tasks involving covariance matrices.

Method: Tokenizes matrix variables row-by-row, emulates gradient descent, and extends to $ℓ_1$-penalized/constrained QPs with MLPs and feedback loops. Introduces Time2Decide for enhancing time series foundation models with covariance matrices.

Result: Time2Decide outperforms base models and traditional Predict-then-Optimize methods in portfolio optimization.

Conclusion: Transformers effectively solve QPs and complex decision problems like portfolio construction by utilizing second-order statistics.

Abstract: We explore the use of transformers for solving quadratic programs and how this capability benefits decision-making problems that involve covariance matrices. We first show that the linear attention mechanism can provably solve unconstrained QPs by tokenizing the matrix variables (e.g.~$A$ of the objective $\frac{1}{2}x^\top Ax+b^\top x$) row-by-row and emulating gradient descent iterations. Furthermore, by incorporating MLPs, a transformer block can solve (i) $\ell_1$-penalized QPs by emulating iterative soft-thresholding and (ii) $\ell_1$-constrained QPs when equipped with an additional feedback loop. Our theory motivates us to introduce Time2Decide: a generic method that enhances a time series foundation model (TSFM) by explicitly feeding the covariance matrix between the variates. We empirically find that Time2Decide uniformly outperforms the base TSFM model for the classical portfolio optimization problem that admits an $\ell_1$-constrained QP formulation. Remarkably, Time2Decide also outperforms the classical "Predict-then-Optimize (PtO)" procedure, where we first forecast the returns and then explicitly solve a constrained QP, in suitable settings. Our results demonstrate that transformers benefit from explicit use of second-order statistics, and this can enable them to effectively solve complex decision-making problems, like portfolio construction, in one forward pass.

*Francesco Emanuele Stradi,Kalana Kalupahana,Matteo Castiglioni,Alberto Marchesi,Nicola Gatti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses a constrained multi-armed bandit problem with unknown constraints and non-stationary environments, providing algorithms for optimal regret and positive constraint violation under full and bandit feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of minimizing loss while controlling constraint violations in non-stationary environments, where prior work either assumes stochastic constraints or relaxes benchmarks with adversarial constraints.

Method: Proposes algorithms for both full and bandit feedback scenarios, ensuring sublinear regret and positive violation rates. Specifically, it handles stochastic constraints with arbitrary losses and adapts to adversarial constraint variations.

Result: Algorithms achieve Õ(√T + C) regret and positive violation under full feedback, extending to bandit feedback for losses. Bandit feedback for constraints yields Õ(√T + C√T) regret.

Conclusion: The work provides optimal solutions for constrained MAB problems in non-stationary settings, balancing regret and constraint violation under varying feedback conditions.

Abstract: We study the constrained variant of the \emph{multi-armed bandit} (MAB) problem, in which the learner aims not only at minimizing the total loss incurred during the learning dynamic, but also at controlling the violation of multiple \emph{unknown} constraints, under both \emph{full} and \emph{bandit feedback}. We consider a non-stationary environment that subsumes both stochastic and adversarial models and where, at each round, both losses and constraints are drawn from distributions that may change arbitrarily over time. In such a setting, it is provably not possible to guarantee both sublinear regret and sublinear violation. Accordingly, prior work has mainly focused either on settings with stochastic constraints or on relaxing the benchmark with fully adversarial constraints (\emph{e.g.}, via competitive ratios with respect to the optimum). We provide the first algorithms that achieve optimal rates of regret and \emph{positive} constraint violation when the constraints are stochastic while the losses may vary arbitrarily, and that simultaneously yield guarantees that degrade smoothly with the degree of adversariality of the constraints. Specifically, under \emph{full feedback} we propose an algorithm attaining $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T}+C)$ regret and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T}+C)$ {positive} violation, where $C$ quantifies the amount of non-stationarity in the constraints. We then show how to extend these guarantees when only bandit feedback is available for the losses. Finally, when \emph{bandit feedback} is available for the constraints, we design an algorithm achieving $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T}+C)$ {positive} violation and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T}+C\sqrt{T})$ regret.

*Qinqi Lin,Ningning Ding,Lingjie Duan,Jianwei Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an economic framework for auditing machine unlearning (MU) compliance, addressing the gap between technical feasibility and regulatory enforcement. It uses certified unlearning theory and game theory to model strategic interactions between auditors and operators, revealing counterintuitive insights about inspection intensity and auditing disclosure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of ensuring AI operators comply with legal mandates for data deletion requests, despite technical solutions like machine unlearning (MU). The gap between MU's feasibility and practical regulatory implementation drives the need for an economic auditing framework.

Method: The method involves characterizing MU's verification uncertainty using certified unlearning theory and proposing a game-theoretic model for strategic interactions. It transforms a complex bivariate nonlinear fixed-point problem into a tractable univariate auxiliary problem to analyze equilibrium properties.

Result: Results show auditors can optimally reduce inspection intensity as deletion requests increase because weakened unlearning makes non-compliance easier to detect. Additionally, undisclosed auditing reduces regulatory cost-effectiveness compared to disclosed auditing, despite offering informational advantages.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that integrating certified unlearning theory with regulatory enforcement provides a viable framework for auditing MU compliance. It highlights counterintuitive strategic behaviors and trade-offs in auditing practices, offering practical insights for regulatory policy.

Abstract: Despite legal mandates for the right to be forgotten, AI operators routinely fail to comply with data deletion requests. While machine unlearning (MU) provides a technical solution to remove personal data's influence from trained models, ensuring compliance remains challenging due to the fundamental gap between MU's technical feasibility and regulatory implementation. In this paper, we introduce the first economic framework for auditing MU compliance, by integrating certified unlearning theory with regulatory enforcement. We first characterize MU's inherent verification uncertainty using a hypothesis-testing interpretation of certified unlearning to derive the auditor's detection capability, and then propose a game-theoretic model to capture the strategic interactions between the auditor and the operator. A key technical challenge arises from MU-specific nonlinearities inherent in the model utility and the detection probability, which create complex strategic couplings that traditional auditing frameworks do not address and that also preclude closed-form solutions. We address this by transforming the complex bivariate nonlinear fixed-point problem into a tractable univariate auxiliary problem, enabling us to decouple the system and establish the equilibrium existence, uniqueness, and structural properties without relying on explicit solutions. Counterintuitively, our analysis reveals that the auditor can optimally reduce the inspection intensity as deletion requests increase, since the operator's weakened unlearning makes non-compliance easier to detect. This is consistent with recent auditing reductions in China despite growing deletion requests. Moreover, we prove that although undisclosed auditing offers informational advantages for the auditor, it paradoxically reduces the regulatory cost-effectiveness relative to disclosed auditing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RNM-TD3, a framework applying N:M structured sparsity to deep reinforcement learning, balancing compression, performance, and hardware efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparsity methods in DRL either limit hardware acceleration (unstructured sparsity) or degrade performance (structured sparsity). The study explores N:M sparsity to address this trade-off.

Method: RNM-TD3 enforces row-wise N:M sparsity during training in off-policy RL (TD3), compatible with accelerators supporting N:M sparse operations.

Result: RNM-TD3 outperforms dense networks at 50%-75% sparsity (e.g., 14% performance increase at 2:4 sparsity) and remains competitive at 87.5% sparsity.

Conclusion: N:M structured sparsity is viable for RL, offering hardware-friendly compression without performance loss.

Abstract: Sparsity is a well-studied technique for compressing deep neural networks (DNNs) without compromising performance. In deep reinforcement learning (DRL), neural networks with up to 5% of their original weights can still be trained with minimal performance loss compared to their dense counterparts. However, most existing methods rely on unstructured fine-grained sparsity, which limits hardware acceleration opportunities due to irregular computation patterns. Structured coarse-grained sparsity enables hardware acceleration, yet typically degrades performance and increases pruning complexity. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first study on N:M structured sparsity in RL, which balances compression, performance, and hardware efficiency. Our framework enforces row-wise N:M sparsity throughout training for all networks in off-policy RL (TD3), maintaining compatibility with accelerators that support N:M sparse matrix operations. Experiments on continuous-control benchmarks show that RNM-TD3, our N:M sparse agent, outperforms its dense counterpart at 50%-75% sparsity (e.g., 2:4 and 1:4), achieving up to a 14% increase in performance at 2:4 sparsity on the Ant environment. RNM-TD3 remains competitive even at 87.5% sparsity (1:8), while enabling potential training speedups.

Method: Develops replicable UCB-like algorithms for unconstrained MABs and extends them to constrained settings, leveraging optimism-in-the-face-of-uncertainty principles.

Result: Achieves replicability in constrained MABs with regret and constraint violation matching non-replicable algorithms.

Conclusion: Replicability is feasible in constrained MABs, with algorithmic performance comparable to non-replicable counterparts.

Abstract: Algorithmic \emph{replicability} has recently been introduced to address the need for reproducible experiments in machine learning. A \emph{replicable online learning} algorithm is one that takes the same sequence of decisions across different executions in the same environment, with high probability. We initiate the study of algorithmic replicability in \emph{constrained} MAB problems, where a learner interacts with an unknown stochastic environment for $T$ rounds, seeking not only to maximize reward but also to satisfy multiple constraints. Our main result is that replicability can be achieved in constrained MABs. Specifically, we design replicable algorithms whose regret and constraint violation match those of non-replicable ones in terms of $T$. As a key step toward these guarantees, we develop the first replicable UCB-like algorithm for \emph{unconstrained} MABs, showing that algorithms that employ the optimism in-the-face-of-uncertainty principle can be replicable, a result that we believe is of independent interest.

TL;DR: A novel decoupled continuous-time actor-critic algorithm addresses the collapse of the Q-function in RL for event-driven control problems by using alternating updates of q and V, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL struggles with continuous-time problems due to collapsing Q-functions, while existing methods complicate optimization with entangled V and q.

Method: Proposes alternating updates: q from diffusion generators on V, and V via Hamiltonian-based value flow, avoiding Bellman collapse.

Result: Achieves 21% profit in trading, nearly doubling competitors, and outperforms baselines in continuous-control tasks.

Conclusion: The method reliably trains RL in continuous time, surpassing discrete-time and continuous-time approaches.

Abstract: Many real-world control problems, ranging from finance to robotics, evolve in continuous time with non-uniform, event-driven decisions. Standard discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL), based on fixed-step Bellman updates, struggles in this setting: as time gaps shrink, the $Q$-function collapses to the value function $V$, eliminating action ranking. Existing continuous-time methods reintroduce action information via an advantage-rate function $q$. However, they enforce optimality through complicated martingale losses or orthogonality constraints, which are sensitive to the choice of test processes. These approaches entangle $V$ and $q$ into a large, complex optimization problem that is difficult to train reliably. To address these limitations, we propose a novel decoupled continuous-time actor-critic algorithm with alternating updates: $q$ is learned from diffusion generators on $V$, and $V$ is updated via a Hamiltonian-based value flow that remains informative under infinitesimal time steps, where standard max/softmax backups fail. Theoretically, we prove rigorous convergence via new probabilistic arguments, sidestepping the challenge that generator-based Hamiltonians lack Bellman-style contraction under the sup-norm. Empirically, our method outperforms prior continuous-time and leading discrete-time baselines across challenging continuous-control benchmarks and a real-world trading task, achieving 21% profit over a single quarter$-$nearly doubling the second-best method.

Result: Extensive experiments analyze existing graph learning methods, offering insights for future research.

Conclusion: OPBench provides a foundation for fair and systematic comparison of graph learning methods in combating the opioid crisis.

Abstract: The opioid epidemic continues to ravage communities worldwide, straining healthcare systems, disrupting families, and demanding urgent computational solutions. To combat this lethal opioid crisis, graph learning methods have emerged as a promising paradigm for modeling complex drug-related phenomena. However, a significant gap remains: there is no comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating these methods across real-world opioid crisis scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce OPBench, the first comprehensive opioid benchmark comprising five datasets across three critical application domains: opioid overdose detection from healthcare claims, illicit drug trafficking detection from digital platforms, and drug misuse prediction from dietary patterns. Specifically, OPBench incorporates diverse graph structures, including heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs, to preserve the rich and complex relational information among drug-related data. To address data scarcity, we collaborate with domain experts and authoritative institutions to curate and annotate datasets while adhering to privacy and ethical guidelines. Furthermore, we establish a unified evaluation framework with standardized protocols, predefined data splits, and reproducible baselines to facilitate fair and systematic comparison among graph learning methods. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the strengths and limitations of existing graph learning methods, thereby providing actionable insights for future research in combating the opioid crisis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBMs suffer from reduced accuracy and concept leakage, undermining interpretability and faithfulness.

Method: Authors propose an Information Bottleneck regularizer penalizing $I(X;C)$ while preserving $I(C;Y)$, deriving two practical variants integrated into standard CBM training.

Result: IB-regularized models outperform vanilla CBMs across six model families and three benchmarks, showing improved predictive performance and intervention reliability.

Conclusion: The regularizer provides a theory-backed, architecture-agnostic solution for more faithful and intervenable CBMs, resolving prior inconsistencies and demonstrating robust improvements.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to deliver interpretable predictions by routing decisions through a human-understandable concept layer, yet they often suffer reduced accuracy and concept leakage that undermines faithfulness. We introduce an explicit Information Bottleneck regularizer on the concept layer that penalizes $I(X;C)$ while preserving task-relevant information in $I(C;Y)$, encouraging minimal-sufficient concept representations. We derive two practical variants (a variational objective and an entropy-based surrogate) and integrate them into standard CBM training without architectural changes or additional supervision. Evaluated across six CBM families and three benchmarks, the IB-regularized models consistently outperform their vanilla counterparts. Information-plane analyses further corroborate the intended behavior. These results indicate that enforcing a minimal-sufficient concept bottleneck improves both predictive performance and the reliability of concept-level interventions. The proposed regularizer offers a theoretic-grounded, architecture-agnostic path to more faithful and intervenable CBMs, resolving prior evaluation inconsistencies by aligning training protocols and demonstrating robust gains across model families and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compressed DL models often underperform compared to large-scale counterparts. AlAd aims to bridge this gap.

Method: AlAd uses sliding-window-based token-level embedding alignment, works flexibly across dimensions/architectures, and is compression-method agnostic.

Result: AlAd significantly boosts compressed model performance on BERT-family models across three NLP tasks with minimal size/latency impact.

Conclusion: AlAd is effective for enhancing compressed DL models, offering adaptability and performance gains.

Abstract: Compressed Deep Learning (DL) models are essential for deployment in resource-constrained environments. But their performance often lags behind their large-scale counterparts. To bridge this gap, we propose Alignment Adapter (AlAd): a lightweight, sliding-window-based adapter. It aligns the token-level embeddings of a compressed model with those of the original large model. AlAd preserves local contextual semantics, enables flexible alignment across differing dimensionalities or architectures, and is entirely agnostic to the underlying compression method. AlAd can be deployed in two ways: as a plug-and-play module over a frozen compressed model, or by jointly fine-tuning AlAd with the compressed model for further performance gains. Through experiments on BERT-family models across three token-level NLP tasks, we demonstrate that AlAd significantly boosts the performance of compressed models with only marginal overhead in size and latency.

### [460] [An Embarrassingly Simple Way to Optimize Orthogonal Matrices at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14656)
*Adrián Javaloy,Antonio Vergari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POGO is an efficient optimizer for orthogonality constraints in ML, improving on the Landing algorithm with adaptive optimizers and maintaining orthogonality effectively at minimal cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimizers for orthogonality constraints are computationally expensive and impractical for large-scale problems, motivating the need for a scalable solution.

Method: POGO builds on the Landing algorithm, incorporating modern adaptive optimizers and ensuring orthogonality with only 5 matrix products.

Result: POGO outperforms recent optimizers, handling thousands of orthogonal matrices in minutes, far faster than alternatives.

Conclusion: POGO marks a milestone for scalable orthogonality constraints in ML, offering efficiency, minimal hyperparameters, and GPU compatibility.

Abstract: Orthogonality constraints are ubiquitous in robust and probabilistic machine learning. Unfortunately, current optimizers are computationally expensive and do not scale to problems with hundreds or thousands of constraints. One notable exception is the Landing algorithm (Ablin et al., 2024) which, however comes at the expense of temporarily relaxing orthogonality. In this work, we revisit and improve on the ideas behind Landing, enabling the inclusion of modern adaptive optimizers while ensuring that orthogonal constraints are effectively met. Remarkably, these improvements come at little to no cost, and reduce the number of required hyperparemeters. Our algorithm POGO is fast and GPU-friendly, consisting of only 5 matrix products, and in practice maintains orthogonality at all times. On several challenging benchmarks, POGO greatly outperforms recent optimizers and shows it can optimize problems with thousands of orthogonal matrices in minutes while alternatives would take hours. As such, POGO sets a milestone to finally exploit orthogonality constraints in ML at scale. A PyTorch implementation of POGO is publicly available at https://github.com/adrianjav/pogo.

*Andrew Gracyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces pseudo-differential enhanced PINNs, leveraging Fourier transforms for faster, more efficient training with improved spectral learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance training fidelity and learning efficiency in PINNs by extending gradient enhancement to Fourier space.

Method: Applies Fourier transforms to differentiate residuals, improving spectral eigenvalue decay and high-frequency learning.

Result: Achieves superior error rates in fewer iterations, works with few collocation samples, and accommodates fractional derivatives.

Conclusion: The method enhances PINN performance, mitigates frequency bias, and supports advanced techniques like Fourier feature embeddings.

Abstract: We present pseudo-differential enhanced physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), an extension of gradient enhancement but in Fourier space. Gradient enhancement of PINNs dictates that the PDE residual is taken to a higher differential order than prescribed by the PDE, added to the objective as an augmented term in order to improve training and overall learning fidelity. We propose the same procedure after application via Fourier transforms, since differentiating in Fourier space is multiplication with the Fourier wavenumber under suitable decay. Our methods are fast and efficient. Our methods oftentimes achieve superior PINN versus numerical error in fewer training iterations, potentially pair well with few samples in collocation, and can on occasion break plateaus in low collocation settings. Moreover, our methods are suitable for fractional derivatives. We establish that our methods improve spectral eigenvalue decay of the neural tangent kernel (NTK), and so our methods contribute towards the learning of high frequencies in early training, mitigating the effects of frequency bias up to the polynomial order and possibly greater with smooth activations. Our methods accommodate advanced techniques in PINNs, such as Fourier feature embeddings. A pitfall of discrete Fourier transforms via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is mesh subjugation, and so we demonstrate compatibility of our methods for greater mesh flexibility and invariance on alternative Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains via Monte Carlo methods and otherwise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores state-tracking tasks like permutation composition using REPL traces in code, showing linear RNNs excel while Transformers fail, and examines challenges in tracking partially observable states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between sequence-to-sequence state-tracking tasks and next-token prediction in language models by converting permutation composition into code via REPL traces.

Method: Convert permutation composition tasks into code using REPL traces, interleaving state-reveals and transformations, and analyze performance of linear RNNs vs. Transformers and non-linear RNNs.

Result: Linear RNNs perform well in this setting, outperforming Transformers, but struggle compared to non-linear RNNs with partially observable states.

Conclusion: The representation of state-tracking tasks in code highlights limitations of architectures like Transformers and linear RNNs, particularly with partial observability.

Abstract: Over the last years, state-tracking tasks, particularly permutation composition, have become a testbed to understand the limits of sequence models architectures like Transformers and RNNs (linear and non-linear). However, these are often sequence-to-sequence tasks: learning to map actions (permutations) to states, which is incompatible with the next-token prediction setting commonly used to train language models. We address this gap by converting permutation composition into code via REPL traces that interleave state-reveals through prints and variable transformations. We show that linear RNNs capable of state-tracking excel also in this setting, while Transformers still fail. Motivated by this representation, we investigate why tracking states in code is generally difficult: actions are not always fully observable. We frame this as tracking the state of a probabilistic finite-state automaton with deterministic state reveals and show that linear RNNs can be worse than non-linear RNNs at tracking states in this setup.

### [463] [Exposing Diversity Bias in Deep Generative Models: Statistical Origins and Correction of Diversity Error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14682)
*Farzan Farnia,Mohammad Jalali,Azim Ospanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates diversity biases in deep generative models, showing generated samples lack diversity compared to test data. It proposes entropy-based metrics and suggests mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the systematic underestimation of diversity in generative models compared to real data distributions, despite their high sample quality.

Method: Uses reference-free entropy-based diversity scores (Vendi and RKE) to compare diversity between generated and test samples across datasets. Analyzes finite-sample behavior of these scores.

Result: Test data consistently scores higher diversity than generated samples, revealing a downward bias in models. Finite-sample behavior exacerbates this bias.

Conclusion: Proposes diversity-aware regularization and guidance strategies using Vendi and RKE to mitigate bias, showing empirical promise.

Abstract: Deep generative models have achieved great success in producing high-quality samples, making them a central tool across machine learning applications. Beyond sample quality, an important yet less systematically studied question is whether trained generative models faithfully capture the diversity of the underlying data distribution. In this work, we address this question by directly comparing the diversity of samples generated by state-of-the-art models with that of test samples drawn from the target data distribution, using recently proposed reference-free entropy-based diversity scores, Vendi and RKE. Across multiple benchmark datasets, we find that test data consistently attains substantially higher Vendi and RKE diversity scores than the generated samples, suggesting a systematic downward diversity bias in modern generative models. To understand the origin of this bias, we analyze the finite-sample behavior of entropy-based diversity scores and show that their expected values increase with sample size, implying that diversity estimated from finite training sets could inherently underestimate the diversity of the true distribution. As a result, optimizing the generators to minimize divergence to empirical data distributions would induce a loss of diversity. Finally, we discuss potential diversity-aware regularization and guidance strategies based on Vendi and RKE as principled directions for mitigating this bias, and provide empirical evidence suggesting their potential to improve the results.

TL;DR: SynthSAEBench is a toolkit for large-scale synthetic data with realistic features, addressing noisy benchmarks and enabling precise SAE architectural comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAE benchmarks lack precision for architectural improvements due to noise and small-scale, unrealistic synthetic data.

Method: Introduces SynthSAEBench with realistic feature characteristics (correlation, hierarchy, superposition) and a standardized model (SynthSAEBench-16k).

Result: Reproduces LLM SAE phenomena, identifies a new failure mode (Matching Pursuit SAEs exploiting noise), and enables ground-truth comparisons.

Conclusion: SynthSAEBench provides precise diagnostics for SAE failures and validates improvements before scaling to LLMs.

Abstract: Improving Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) requires benchmarks that can precisely validate architectural innovations. However, current SAE benchmarks on LLMs are often too noisy to differentiate architectural improvements, and current synthetic data experiments are too small-scale and unrealistic to provide meaningful comparisons. We introduce SynthSAEBench, a toolkit for generating large-scale synthetic data with realistic feature characteristics including correlation, hierarchy, and superposition, and a standardized benchmark model, SynthSAEBench-16k, enabling direct comparison of SAE architectures. Our benchmark reproduces several previously observed LLM SAE phenomena, including the disconnect between reconstruction and latent quality metrics, poor SAE probing results, and a precision-recall trade-off mediated by L0. We further use our benchmark to identify a new failure mode: Matching Pursuit SAEs exploit superposition noise to improve reconstruction without learning ground-truth features, suggesting that more expressive encoders can easily overfit. SynthSAEBench complements LLM benchmarks by providing ground-truth features and controlled ablations, enabling researchers to precisely diagnose SAE failure modes and validate architectural improvements before scaling to LLMs.

*Dhruva Karkada,Daniel J. Korchinski,Andres Nava,Matthieu Wyart,Yasaman Bahri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Summary


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the fundamental properties of learned representations in neural networks, particularly the emergence of simple geometric structures like circles and manifolds in LLM representations.

Method: The authors analyze the statistics of language, identifying translation symmetry in co-occurrence probabilities. They theoretically prove this symmetry governs geometric structures in word embeddings and validate their findings empirically across various models.

Result: They find that geometric structures persist even when co-occurrence statistics are perturbed or embedding dimensions are moderate, attributing this robustness to underlying continuous latent variables.

Conclusion: The study provides a theoretical framework explaining the robustness of geometric structures in embeddings, validated across word, text, and large language models.

Abstract: Although learned representations underlie neural networks' success, their fundamental properties remain poorly understood. A striking example is the emergence of simple geometric structures in LLM representations: for example, calendar months organize into a circle, years form a smooth one-dimensional manifold, and cities' latitudes and longitudes can be decoded by a linear probe. We show that the statistics of language exhibit a translation symmetry -- e.g., the co-occurrence probability of two months depends only on the time interval between them -- and we prove that the latter governs the aforementioned geometric structures in high-dimensional word embedding models. Moreover, we find that these structures persist even when the co-occurrence statistics are strongly perturbed (for example, by removing all sentences in which two months appear together) and at moderate embedding dimension. We show that this robustness naturally emerges if the co-occurrence statistics are collectively controlled by an underlying continuous latent variable. We empirically validate this theoretical framework in word embedding models, text embedding models, and large language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes instruction selection for LLM fine-tuning, focusing on data representation and selection algorithms, finding gradient-based methods most effective at low budgets and unifying existing methods under a distance minimization framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of clarity and actionable guidance in selecting instruction training data for LLM fine-tuning, the paper aims to systematically analyze core components: data representation and selection algorithms.

Method: The study disentangles and evaluates data representation and selection algorithms, using a framework for controlled comparisons across models, tasks, and budgets.

Result: Gradient-based data representations consistently predict performance, with greedy round-robin selection performing best at low budgets. Benefits diminish at larger budgets. Existing methods are unified as forms of distance minimization.

Conclusion: The findings offer insights for principled data selection in LLM fine-tuning and provide a foundation for future work. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often involves selecting a subset of instruction training data from a large candidate pool, using a small query set from the target task. Despite growing interest, the literature on targeted instruction selection remains fragmented and opaque: methods vary widely in selection budgets, often omit zero-shot baselines, and frequently entangle the contributions of key components. As a result, practitioners lack actionable guidance on selecting instructions for their target tasks. In this work, we aim to bring clarity to this landscape by disentangling and systematically analyzing the two core ingredients: data representation and selection algorithms. Our framework enables controlled comparisons across models, tasks, and budgets. We find that only gradient-based data representations choose subsets whose similarity to the query consistently predicts performance across datasets and models. While no single method dominates, gradient-based representations paired with a greedy round-robin selection algorithm tend to perform best on average at low budgets, but these benefits diminish at larger budgets. Finally, we unify several existing selection algorithms as forms of approximate distance minimization between the selected subset and the query set, and support this view with new generalization bounds. More broadly, our findings provide critical insights and a foundation for more principled data selection in LLM fine-tuning. The code is available at https://github.com/dcml-lab/targeted-instruction-selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To lower the computational and memory burdens of training deep neural networks without sacrificing performance.

Method: Replace exact vector-jacobian products with randomized, unbiased approximations during backpropagation, analyze trade-offs, and identify optimal estimators under sparsity constraints.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows cost reduction per epoch, and experiments confirm effectiveness on MLPs, BagNets, and Visual Transformers.

Conclusion: The proposed unbiased randomized backpropagation approach effectively reduces deep learning costs while maintaining performance.

Abstract: In this work we introduce methods to reduce the computational and memory costs of training deep neural networks. Our approach consists in replacing exact vector-jacobian products by randomized, unbiased approximations thereof during backpropagation. We provide a theoretical analysis of the trade-off between the number of epochs needed to achieve a target precision and the cost reduction for each epoch. We then identify specific unbiased estimates of vector-jacobian products for which we establish desirable optimality properties of minimal variance under sparsity constraints. Finally we provide in-depth experiments on multi-layer perceptrons, BagNets and Visual Transfomers architectures. These validate our theoretical results, and confirm the potential of our proposed unbiased randomized backpropagation approach for reducing the cost of deep learning.

*Nozomu Fujisawa,Masaaki Kondo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D2-LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, achieves high accuracy (76.4%) across Q&A and reading comprehension benchmarks with minimal training data (5k samples per task). It combines low-rank residual updates with train-time projections, adds no inference latency, and outperforms LoRA and DoRA in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for efficient fine-tuning methods under practical data and compute constraints, ensuring minimal training samples and epochs while preserving inference efficiency.

Method: D2-LoRA integrates signed low-rank residual updates with additive/subtractive components and a train-time column-wise projection to maintain norm fidelity. The adapter merges into a single weight matrix post-training.

Result: D2-LoRA outperforms LoRA (2.2% accuracy gain) and DoRA, improves generative tasks (+1.2 ROUGE-L), reduces training volatility (36%), and recovers 1.91x throughput with 19% training overhead.

Conclusion: D2-LoRA efficiently balances accuracy and computational constraints, showcasing architectural design advantages over parameterization increases, with broad applicability beyond Q&A tasks.

Abstract: We systematically investigate the parameter-efficient fine-tuning design space under practical data and compute constraints, and propose D2-LoRA. D2-LoRA achieves 76.4 percent average accuracy across eight question answering and reading comprehension benchmarks using only 5k training samples per task and two epochs, while preserving algebraic mergeability at inference with near-exact numerical equivalence. The method combines signed low-rank residual updates with additive and subtractive components, together with a train-time column-wise projection that keeps each column close to its original norm. After training, the adapter is merged into a single weight matrix, adding zero inference latency. Compared with LoRA, D2-LoRA improves average accuracy by 2.2 percentage points; at matched parameter counts (LoRA rank 2r versus D2-LoRA rank r), the improvement is 1.6 points, indicating gains from architectural design rather than increased parameterization. Compared with DoRA, it matches or exceeds performance on most tasks. Beyond QA and reading comprehension, D2-LoRA improves generative tasks (plus 1.2 ROUGE-L and plus 1.1 percent win rate) and shows 36 percent lower training volatility. The merge preserves numerical fidelity (mean gap about 0.03 percentage points) and recovers about 1.91x evaluation throughput. Training overhead is 19 percent, comparable to DoRA, and decreases with longer input sequences. We provide a geometric analysis explaining how the projection stabilizes training, together with ablation studies isolating the contribution of each design component.

TL;DR: The paper explores a gauge-theoretic approach to neural networks with positively homogeneous activations, improving optimization stability by balancing redundant scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the instability in training neural networks caused by redundant scale symmetries, drawing inspiration from gauge theory in physics.

Method: The authors introduce gauge-adapted coordinates and a soft orbit-selection functional to separate invariant and scale-imbalance directions, balancing redundant scales analytically.

Result: The proposed method expands the stable learning-rate regime, suppresses scale drift, and maintains network expressivity.

Conclusion: The study establishes a connection between gauge theory and machine learning, showing how gauge-orbit geometry impacts optimization conditioning.

Abstract: Neural networks with positively homogeneous activations exhibit an exact continuous reparametrization symmetry: neuron-wise rescalings generate parameter-space orbits along which the input--output function is invariant. We interpret this symmetry as a gauge redundancy and introduce gauge-adapted coordinates that separate invariant and scale-imbalance directions. Inspired by gauge fixing in field theory, we introduce a soft orbit-selection (norm-balancing) functional acting only on redundant scale coordinates. We show analytically that it induces dissipative relaxation of imbalance modes to preserve the realized function. In controlled experiments, this orbit-selection penalty expands the stable learning-rate regime and suppresses scale drift without changing expressivity. These results establish a structural link between gauge-orbit geometry and optimization conditioning, providing a concrete connection between gauge-theoretic concepts and machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient, resource-light models for solving differential equations while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Proposes Horner-factorized polynomials for implicit trial solutions, enforces initial conditions by construction, and extends to piecewise models for better approximation.

Result: Outperforms MLP and sinusoidal baselines with fewer parameters, demonstrating practical accuracy-parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Horner networks offer a resource-efficient, accurate alternative for solving differential equations with minimal parameters.

Abstract: We propose a parameter-minimal neural architecture for solving differential equations by restricting the hypothesis class to Horner-factorized polynomials, yielding an implicit, differentiable trial solution with only a small set of learnable coefficients. Initial conditions are enforced exactly by construction by fixing the low-order polynomial degrees of freedom, so training focuses solely on matching the differential-equation residual at collocation points. To reduce approximation error without abandoning the low-parameter regime, we introduce a piecewise ("spline-like") extension that trains multiple small Horner models on subintervals while enforcing continuity (and first-derivative continuity) at segment boundaries. On illustrative ODE benchmarks and a heat-equation example, Horner networks with tens (or fewer) parameters accurately match the solution and its derivatives and outperform small MLP and sinusoidal-representation baselines under the same training settings, demonstrating a practical accuracy-parameter trade-off for resource-efficient scientific modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces inference-time inner looping to extend refinement in pretrained language models by reapplying selected block ranges, yielding modest but consistent accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore the iterative refinement nature of Transformer layers, suggesting that inner representations can be decoded early and that some layers act as refinement layers. They propose a method to leverage this for better performance.

Method: The method involves looping a selected range of Transformer blocks during inference to prolong refinement in pretrained models.

Result: Experiments show modest but consistent accuracy improvements across benchmarks, with analyses indicating more stable state evolution and continued semantic refinement.

Conclusion: The results suggest that simple test-time looping can provide additional refinement in frozen pretrained models, enhancing their performance.

Abstract: Deep Learning architectures, and in particular Transformers, are conventionally viewed as a composition of layers. These layers are actually often obtained as the sum of two contributions: a residual path that copies the input and the output of a Transformer block. As a consequence, the inner representations (i.e. the input of these blocks) can be interpreted as iterative refinement of a propagated latent representation. Under this lens, many works suggest that the inner space is shared across layers, meaning that tokens can be decoded at early stages. Mechanistic interpretability even goes further by conjecturing that some layers act as refinement layers. Following this path, we propose inference-time inner looping, which prolongs refinement in pretrained off-the-shelf language models by repeatedly re-applying a selected block range. Across multiple benchmarks, inner looping yields modest but consistent accuracy improvements. Analyses of the resulting latent trajectories suggest more stable state evolution and continued semantic refinement. Overall, our results suggest that additional refinement can be obtained through simple test-time looping, extending computation in frozen pretrained models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current meta-learning methods are limited to narrow task distributions and lack consistent definitions for key terms like 'universal,' hindering comparability and broader applicability.

Method: TAIL employs random projections for cross-modal feature encoding, random injection label embeddings, and efficient inline query processing.

Result: TAIL outperforms existing methods on few-shot benchmarks, generalizes to unseen domains and modalities, handles tasks with significantly more classes, and offers computational savings.

Conclusion: TAIL provides a principled framework for universal meta-learning, demonstrating superior performance, generalization, and efficiency compared to prior approaches.

Abstract: Current meta-learning methods are constrained to narrow task distributions with fixed feature and label spaces, limiting applicability. Moreover, the current meta-learning literature uses key terms like "universal" and "general-purpose" inconsistently and lacks precise definitions, hindering comparability. We introduce a theoretical framework for meta-learning which formally defines practical universality and introduces a distinction between algorithm-explicit and algorithm-implicit learning, providing a principled vocabulary for reasoning about universal meta-learning methods. Guided by this framework, we present TAIL, a transformer-based algorithm-implicit meta-learner that functions across tasks with varying domains, modalities, and label configurations. TAIL features three innovations over prior transformer-based meta-learners: random projections for cross-modal feature encoding, random injection label embeddings that extrapolate to larger label spaces, and efficient inline query processing. TAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard few-shot benchmarks while generalizing to unseen domains. Unlike other meta-learning methods, it also generalizes to unseen modalities, solving text classification tasks despite training exclusively on images, handles tasks with up to 20$\times$ more classes than seen during training, and provides orders-of-magnitude computational savings over prior transformer-based approaches.

TL;DR: The paper investigates predicting when combinatorial auction instances are hard for greedy heuristics, using a lightweight MLP classifier and GNN specialist for hard cases, achieving high accuracy and low optimality gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with predicting hard instances for greedy heuristics in combinatorial auctions, and GNNs often fail to outperform classical solvers. The goal is to predict instance hardness for better algorithm selection.

Method: A 20-dimensional structural feature vector is designed, and a lightweight MLP classifier predicts greedy optimality gaps. A GNN specialist is used for hard instances.

Result: The MLP classifier achieves high accuracy (94.7%) and low error (0.033). The hybrid allocator achieves a 0.51% overall gap, outperforming greedy alone. GNNs still lag behind Gurobi.

Conclusion: Predicting when to use expensive solvers (like GNNs) is more effective than replacing them. The hybrid approach balances performance and efficiency.

Abstract: The Winner Determination Problem (WDP) in combinatorial auctions is NP-hard, and no existing method reliably predicts which instances will defeat fast greedy heuristics. The ML-for-combinatorial-optimization community has focused on learning to \emph{replace} solvers, yet recent evidence shows that graph neural networks (GNNs) rarely outperform well-tuned classical methods on standard benchmarks. We pursue a different objective: learning to predict \emph{when} a given instance is hard for greedy allocation, enabling instance-dependent algorithm selection. We design a 20-dimensional structural feature vector and train a lightweight MLP hardness classifier that predicts the greedy optimality gap with mean absolute error 0.033, Pearson correlation 0.937, and binary classification accuracy 94.7\% across three random seeds. For instances identified as hard -- those exhibiting ``whale-fish'' trap structure where greedy provably fails -- we deploy a heterogeneous GNN specialist that achieves ${\approx}0\%$ optimality gap on all six adversarial configurations tested (vs.\ 3.75--59.24\% for greedy). A hybrid allocator combining the hardness classifier with GNN and greedy solvers achieves 0.51\% overall gap on mixed distributions. Our honest evaluation on CATS benchmarks confirms that GNNs do not outperform Gurobi (0.45--0.71 vs.\ 0.20 gap), motivating the algorithm selection framing. Learning \emph{when} to deploy expensive solvers is more tractable than learning to replace them.

*Rotem Mulayoff,Sebastian U. Stich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the role of nonlinear dynamics in the stability of optimization algorithms like GD and SGD, showing that linear analysis can be misleading and deriving exact criteria for stable oscillations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether linearized dynamics accurately capture the full nonlinear behavior of optimization algorithms, especially in scenarios like stable oscillations near minima and the divergence of SGD due to unstable batches.

Method: The authors derive an exact criterion for stable oscillations of GD near minima, involving high-order derivatives. They extend this analysis to SGD, examining the impact of unstable batches on nonlinear dynamics.

Result: Nonlinear terms can lead to stable oscillations in GD and unexpected divergence in SGD, even if only one batch is unstable. They also show that linearly stable batches ensure nonlinear stability in SGD.

Conclusion: Linear analysis may not fully predict the behavior of optimization algorithms; nonlinear terms play a critical role in stability, with implications for understanding minima and convergence in machine learning.

Abstract: The dynamical stability of the iterates during training plays a key role in determining the minima obtained by optimization algorithms. For example, stable solutions of gradient descent (GD) correspond to flat minima, which have been associated with favorable features. While prior work often relies on linearization to determine stability, it remains unclear whether linearized dynamics faithfully capture the full nonlinear behavior. Recent work has shown that GD may stably oscillate near a linearly unstable minimum and still converge once the step size decays, indicating that linear analysis can be misleading. In this work, we explicitly study the effect of nonlinear terms. Specifically, we derive an exact criterion for stable oscillations of GD near minima in the multivariate setting. Our condition depends on high-order derivatives, generalizing existing results. Extending the analysis to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we show that nonlinear dynamics can diverge in expectation even if a single batch is unstable. This implies that stability can be dictated by a single batch that oscillates unstably, rather than an average effect, as linear analysis suggests. Finally, we prove that if all batches are linearly stable, the nonlinear dynamics of SGD are stable in expectation.

Conclusion: MSCBO enhances optimization efficiency by combining causality principles with multi-source data, reducing operational costs and improving performance.

Abstract: Multi-Source Bayesian Optimization (MSBO) serves as a variant of the traditional Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework applicable to situations involving optimization of an objective black-box function over multiple information sources such as simulations, surrogate models, or real-world experiments. However, traditional MSBO assumes the input variables of the objective function to be independent and identically distributed, limiting its effectiveness in scenarios where causal information is available and interventions can be performed, such as clinical trials or policy-making. In the single-source domain, Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO) extends standard BO with the principles of causality, enabling better modeling of variable dependencies. This leads to more accurate optimization, improved decision-making, and more efficient use of low-cost information sources. In this article, we propose a principled integration of the MSBO and CBO methodologies in the multi-source domain, leveraging the strengths of both to enhance optimization efficiency and reduce computational complexity in higher-dimensional problems. We present the theoretical foundations of both Causal and Multi-Source Bayesian Optimization, and demonstrate how their synergy informs our Multi-Source Causal Bayesian Optimization (MSCBO) algorithm. We compare the performance of MSCBO against its foundational counterparts for both synthetic and real-world datasets with varying levels of noise, highlighting the robustness and applicability of MSCBO. Based on our findings, we conclude that integrating MSBO with the causality principles of CBO facilitates dimensionality reduction and lowers operational costs, ultimately improving convergence speed, performance, and scalability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Interactionless Inverse Reinforcement Learning to address Alignment Waste in AI alignment, decoupling safety objectives from policy. It also proposes the Alignment Flywheel for iterative reward model improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI alignment methods mix safety objectives with agent policy, leading to opaque, single-use alignment artifacts (Alignment Waste).

Method: Proposes Interactionless Inverse Reinforcement Learning to decouple alignment artifacts from policy, creating an inspectable reward model. Introduces the Alignment Flywheel for iterative hardening via human-in-the-loop audits and refinement.

Result: Transforms AI safety into a durable, verifiable engineering asset by producing model-agnostic, editable reward models.

Conclusion: The approach improves alignment by decoupling safety objectives and enabling continuous reward model refinement, making safety more scalable and reliable.

Abstract: AI alignment is growing in importance, yet current approaches suffer from a critical structural flaw that entangles the safety objectives with the agent's policy. Methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization create opaque, single-use alignment artifacts, which we term Alignment Waste. We propose Interactionless Inverse Reinforcement Learning to decouple alignment artifact learning from policy optimization, producing an inspectable, editable, and model-agnostic reward model. Additionally, we introduce the Alignment Flywheel, a human-in-the-loop lifecycle that iteratively hardens the reward model through automated audits and refinement. This architecture transforms safety from a disposable expense into a durable, verifiable engineering asset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BEACONS framework uses verified neural networks to solve PDEs with guaranteed correctness beyond training data, outperforming traditional PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unreliability of neural networks in extrapolatory regimes for PDE solving in computational physics.

Method: Combines method of characteristics for a priori PDE solution properties with compositional deep learning to construct verified neural solvers.

Result: Demonstrated reliable extrapolation beyond training data for various PDEs, with bounded errors and correctness certificates.

Conclusion: BEACONS provides a robust, verified approach for PDE solving, surpassing traditional methods like PINNs.

Abstract: The traditional limitations of neural networks in reliably generalizing beyond the convex hulls of their training data present a significant problem for computational physics, in which one often wishes to solve PDEs in regimes far beyond anything which can be experimentally or analytically validated. In this paper, we show how it is possible to circumvent these limitations by constructing formally-verified neural network solvers for PDEs, with rigorous convergence, stability, and conservation properties, whose correctness can therefore be guaranteed even in extrapolatory regimes. By using the method of characteristics to predict the analytical properties of PDE solutions a priori (even in regions arbitrarily far from the training domain), we show how it is possible to construct rigorous extrapolatory bounds on the worst-case L^inf errors of shallow neural network approximations. Then, by decomposing PDE solutions into compositions of simpler functions, we show how it is possible to compose these shallow neural networks together to form deep architectures, based on ideas from compositional deep learning, in which the large L^inf errors in the approximations have been suppressed. The resulting framework, called BEACONS (Bounded-Error, Algebraically-COmposable Neural Solvers), comprises both an automatic code-generator for the neural solvers themselves, as well as a bespoke automated theorem-proving system for producing machine-checkable certificates of correctness. We apply the framework to a variety of linear and non-linear PDEs, including the linear advection and inviscid Burgers' equations, as well as the full compressible Euler equations, in both 1D and 2D, and illustrate how BEACONS architectures are able to extrapolate solutions far beyond the training data in a reliable and bounded way. Various advantages of the approach over the classical PINN approach are discussed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A pragmatic similarity measure is introduced for comparing clusterings with overlaps and outliers, addressing gaps in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clustering comparison measures lack the capability to handle overlaps and outliers, creating a need for a more versatile similarity measure.

Method: The paper proposes a new similarity measure designed for clusterings with overlaps and outliers, ensuring it meets desirable properties and avoids common biases.

Result: Experimental results confirm that the proposed measure is effective and unbiased compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The introduced similarity measure fills a critical gap in clustering evaluation, offering practical benefits for comparing complex clusterings.

Abstract: Clustering algorithms are an essential part of the unsupervised data science ecosystem, and extrinsic evaluation of clustering algorithms requires a method for comparing the detected clustering to a ground truth clustering. In a general setting, the detected and ground truth clusterings may have outliers (objects belonging to no cluster), overlapping clusters (objects may belong to more than one cluster), or both, but methods for comparing these clusterings are currently undeveloped. In this note, we define a pragmatic similarity measure for comparing clusterings with overlaps and outliers, show that it has several desirable properties, and experimentally confirm that it is not subject to several common biases afflicting other clustering comparison measures.

*Ilia Mahrooghi,Aryo Lotfi,Emmanuel Abbe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Goldilocks is a teacher-driven data sampling strategy that selects questions of optimal difficulty for student models during reinforcement learning, improving performance efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning in large language models struggles with sparse rewards and inefficient sampling. Classic curriculum learning lacks adaptability for specific models.

Method: Proposes Goldilocks, where a teacher model predicts question difficulty for the student and selects 'just right' questions, training the student with GRPO while adapting to its progress.

Result: Goldilocks outperforms standard GRPO training on the OpenMathReasoning dataset within the same compute budget.

Conclusion: Adaptive data sampling via Goldilocks enhances reinforcement learning efficiency by dynamically aligning question difficulty with student model capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models. However, relying on sparse rewards makes this process highly sample-inefficient, as models must navigate vast search spaces with minimal feedback. While classic curriculum learning aims to mitigate this by ordering data based on complexity, the right ordering for a specific model is often unclear. To address this, we propose Goldilocks, a novel teacher-driven data sampling strategy that aims to predict each question's difficulty for the student model. The teacher model selects questions of appropriate difficulty for the student model, i.e., questions that are neither too easy nor too hard (Goldilocks principle), while training the student with GRPO. By leveraging the student's performance on seen samples, the teacher continuously adapts to the student's evolving abilities. On OpenMathReasoning dataset, Goldilocks data sampling improves the performance of models trained with standard GRPO under the same compute budget.

*Yu Huang,Zixin Wen,Yuejie Chi,Yuting Wei,Aarti Singh,Yingbin Liang,Yuxin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR's effectiveness hinges on the smoothness of task difficulty; smooth spectra enable steady improvement, while abrupt changes cause learning plateaus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how RLVR overcomes long-horizon reasoning barriers with outcome-based rewards.

Method: Develop a theory using Fourier analysis on finite groups, validated via synthetic experiments.

Result: Smooth difficulty spectra enable relay effects for steady learning, whereas abrupt changes cause grokking-type plateaus.

Conclusion: RLVR's success depends on task difficulty design, suggesting scalable gains from well-structured data mixtures.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been a main driver of recent breakthroughs in large reasoning models. Yet it remains a mystery how rewards based solely on final outcomes can help overcome the long-horizon barrier to extended reasoning. To understand this, we develop a theory of the training dynamics of RL for transformers on compositional reasoning tasks. Our theory characterizes how the effectiveness of RLVR is governed by the smoothness of the difficulty spectrum. When data contains abrupt discontinuities in difficulty, learning undergoes grokking-type phase transitions, producing prolonged plateaus before progress recurs. In contrast, a smooth difficulty spectrum leads to a relay effect: persistent gradient signals on easier problems elevate the model's capabilities to the point where harder ones become tractable, resulting in steady and continuous improvement. Our theory explains how RLVR can improve performance at the edge of competence, and suggests that appropriately designed data mixtures can yield scalable gains. As a technical contribution, our analysis develops and adapts tools from Fourier analysis on finite groups to our setting. We validate the predicted mechanisms empirically via synthetic experiments.

We expose the system via a Gradio-based API with controllable parameters and preconfigured presets.Evaluation on 500 image-caption pairs with 20:1 contrastive negatives yields a ROC-AUC of 0.9270, an F1-score of 0.6504, and an accuracy of 96.99%, demonstrating strong multimodal alignment.

*Pedram Bakhtiarifard,Tong Chen,Jonathan Wenshøj,Erik B Dam,Raghavendra Selvan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep neural networks are compressible due to their trained parameters exhibiting lower algorithmic complexity than random initializations. The proposed MoMos method leverages reusable motifs to achieve simpler parameterization without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explain why deep neural networks are highly compressible by analyzing the algorithmic complexity of their trained parameters compared to random initializations.

Method: The study introduces the MoMos method, which partitions parameters into blocks and restricts each block to reusable motifs, formalizing Kolmogorov complexity to measure algorithmic simplicity.

Result: Experiments show that MoMos reduces algorithmic complexity while maintaining model performance comparable to unconstrained models.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that trained neural networks exhibit lower algorithmic complexity, making them inherently suited for compression.

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models are well-suited for compression. Methods like pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation have been used to achieve massive reductions in the number of model parameters, with marginal performance drops across a variety of architectures and tasks. This raises the central question: \emph{Why are deep neural networks suited for compression?} In this work, we take up the perspective of algorithmic complexity to explain this behavior. We hypothesize that the parameters of trained models have more structure and, hence, exhibit lower algorithmic complexity compared to the weights at (random) initialization. Furthermore, that model compression methods harness this reduced algorithmic complexity to compress models. Although an unconstrained parameterization of model weights, $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, can represent arbitrary weight assignments, the solutions found during training exhibit repeatability and structure, making them algorithmically simpler than a generic program. To this end, we formalize the Kolmogorov complexity of $\mathbf{w}$ by $\mathcal{K}(\mathbf{w})$. We introduce a constrained parameterization $\widehat{\mathbf{w}}$, that partitions parameters into blocks of size $s$, and restricts each block to be selected from a set of $k$ reusable motifs, specified by a reuse pattern (or mosaic). The resulting method, $\textit{Mosaic-of-Motifs}$ (MoMos), yields algorithmically simpler model parameterization compared to unconstrained models. Empirical evidence from multiple experiments shows that the algorithmic complexity of neural networks, measured using approximations to Kolmogorov complexity, can be reduced during training. This results in models that perform comparably with unconstrained models while being algorithmically simpler.

*Farbod Siahkali,Ashwin Verma,Vijay Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: "Pseudo-calibration" is introduced to maintain coverage guarantees in conformal prediction under data distribution shifts, using domain adaptation tools and a proposed algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the failure of conformal prediction's coverage guarantees under distribution shifts by leveraging pseudo-calibration and domain adaptation techniques.

Method: Derives a lower bound on target coverage using classifier loss and Wasserstein shift measure, introduces a method to inflate conformal thresholds, and proposes a source-tuned pseudo-calibration algorithm.

Result: Numerical experiments confirm the bounds track pseudo-calibration behavior and the proposed scheme mitigates coverage degradation while keeping prediction set sizes reasonable.

Conclusion: Pseudo-calibration, especially with the source-tuned algorithm, effectively counters coverage loss under distribution shifts while maintaining practical prediction set sizes.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) offers distribution-free marginal coverage guarantees under an exchangeability assumption, but these guarantees can fail if the data distribution shifts. We analyze the use of pseudo-calibration as a tool to counter this performance loss under a bounded label-conditional covariate shift model. Using tools from domain adaptation, we derive a lower bound on target coverage in terms of the source-domain loss of the classifier and a Wasserstein measure of the shift. Using this result, we provide a method to design pseudo-calibrated sets that inflate the conformal threshold by a slack parameter to keep target coverage above a prescribed level. Finally, we propose a source-tuned pseudo-calibration algorithm that interpolates between hard pseudo-labels and randomized labels as a function of classifier uncertainty. Numerical experiments show that our bounds qualitatively track pseudo-calibration behavior and that the source-tuned scheme mitigates coverage degradation under distribution shift while maintaining nontrivial prediction set sizes.

*Olivier Jeunen,Shashank Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proves that $β^\star$-IPS, an estimator with an optimal additive baseline, outperforms SNIPS in Mean Squared Error for off-policy evaluation, advocating a shift from self-normalisation to optimal baseline corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of theoretical guarantees for additive control variates (baseline corrections) in off-policy evaluation, aiming to improve variance reduction methods for ranking and recommendation systems.

Method: The paper analytically compares the performance of SNIPS and $β^\star$-IPS, decomposing the variance gap to show the superiority of the additive baseline approach.

Result: $β^\star$-IPS asymptotically dominates SNIPS in Mean Squared Error, demonstrating the advantages of optimal additive baselines over self-normalisation.

Conclusion: The findings justify transitioning from self-normalisation to optimal baseline corrections for more effective off-policy evaluation in ranking and recommendation systems.

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is essential for assessing ranking and recommendation systems without costly online interventions. Self-Normalised Inverse Propensity Scoring (SNIPS) is a standard tool for variance reduction in OPE, leveraging a multiplicative control variate. Recent advances in off-policy learning suggest that additive control variates (baseline corrections) may offer superior performance, yet theoretical guarantees for evaluation are lacking. This paper provides a definitive answer: we prove that $β^\star$-IPS, an estimator with an optimal additive baseline, asymptotically dominates SNIPS in Mean Squared Error. By analytically decomposing the variance gap, we show that SNIPS is asymptotically equivalent to using a specific -- but generally sub-optimal -- additive baseline. Our results theoretically justify shifting from self-normalisation to optimal baseline corrections for both ranking and recommendation.

*Tianyi Ma,Yiyue Qian,Zehong Wang,Zheyuan Zhang,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BHyGNN+ is a self-supervised learning framework for heterophilic hypergraphs, leveraging hypergraph duality to avoid labeled data and negative samples, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HyGNNs struggle with heterophilic hypergraphs due to reliance on labeled data, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: BHyGNN+ uses hypergraph duality to contrast augmented views against dual hypergraphs, capturing structural patterns unsupervised.

Result: Experiments on 11 datasets show BHyGNN+ outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised baselines.

Conclusion: BHyGNN+ effectively leverages duality for self-supervised learning, offering a new paradigm for unlabeled hypergraphs.

Abstract: Hypergraph Neural Networks (HyGNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in modeling higher-order relationships among entities. However, their performance often degrades on heterophilic hypergraphs, where nodes connected by the same hyperedge tend to have dissimilar semantic representations or belong to different classes. While several HyGNNs, including our prior work BHyGNN, have been proposed to address heterophily, their reliance on labeled data significantly limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where annotations are scarce or costly. To overcome this limitation, we introduce BHyGNN+, a self-supervised learning framework that extends BHyGNN for representation learning on heterophilic hypergraphs without requiring ground-truth labels. The core idea of BHyGNN+ is hypergraph duality, a structural transformation where the roles of nodes and hyperedges are interchanged. By contrasting augmented views of a hypergraph against its dual using cosine similarity, our framework captures essential structural patterns in a fully unsupervised manner. Notably, this duality-based formulation eliminates the need for negative samples, a common requirement in existing hypergraph contrastive learning methods that is often difficult to satisfy in practice. Extensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHyGNN+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised baselines on both heterophilic and homophilic hypergraphs. Our results validate the effectiveness of leveraging hypergraph duality for self-supervised learning and establish a new paradigm for representation learning on challenging, unlabeled hypergraphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VRU is a first-order algorithm for machine unlearning that directly uses forget set gradients, achieving formal guarantees and better convergence rates compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between theoretically sound methods (which ignore forget set gradients) and empirical heuristics (which lack guarantees) for machine unlearning.

Method: Proposes the Variance-Reduced Unlearning (VRU) algorithm, which incorporates forget set gradients in its update rule while ensuring formal unlearning guarantees.

Result: VRU achieves better convergence rates and outperforms existing methods in low-error regimes, validated by experiments.

Conclusion: VRU effectively combines theoretical guarantees with practical performance improvements in machine unlearning by leveraging forget set gradients.

Abstract: In machine unlearning, $(\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning is a popular framework that provides formal guarantees on the effectiveness of the removal of a subset of training data, the forget set, from a trained model. For strongly convex objectives, existing first-order methods achieve $(\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning, but they only use the forget set to calibrate injected noise, never as a direct optimization signal. In contrast, efficient empirical heuristics often exploit the forget samples (e.g., via gradient ascent) but come with no formal unlearning guarantees. We bridge this gap by presenting the Variance-Reduced Unlearning (VRU) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, VRU is the first first-order algorithm that directly includes forget set gradients in its update rule, while provably satisfying ($(\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning. We establish the convergence of VRU and show that incorporating the forget set yields strictly improved rates, i.e. a better dependence on the achieved error compared to existing first-order $(\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning methods. Moreover, we prove that, in a low-error regime, VRU asymptotically outperforms any first-order method that ignores the forget set.Experiments corroborate our theory, showing consistent gains over both state-of-the-art certified unlearning methods and over empirical baselines that explicitly leverage the forget set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-objective learning lack adaptability to distribution shifts, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: The proposed method replaces part of the multi-objective learning framework with an adaptive online algorithm to achieve local adaptivity.

Result: Empirical results show improved performance on energy forecasting and fairness datasets, with unbiased predictions and robustness to shifts.

Conclusion: The adaptive approach outperforms existing methods by better handling distribution shifts and achieving balanced objectives.

Abstract: We consider the general problem of learning a predictor that satisfies multiple objectives of interest simultaneously, a broad framework that captures a range of specific learning goals including calibration, regret, and multiaccuracy. We work in an online setting where the data distribution can change arbitrarily over time. Existing approaches to this problem aim to minimize the set of objectives over the entire time horizon in a worst-case sense, and in practice they do not necessarily adapt to distribution shifts. Earlier work has aimed to alleviate this problem by incorporating additional objectives that target local guarantees over contiguous subintervals. Empirical evaluation of these proposals is, however, scarce. In this article, we consider an alternative procedure that achieves local adaptivity by replacing one part of the multi-objective learning method with an adaptive online algorithm. Empirical evaluations on datasets from energy forecasting and algorithmic fairness show that our proposed method improves upon existing approaches and achieves unbiased predictions over subgroups, while remaining robust under distribution shift.

TL;DR: Enhancing Causal Foundation Models (CFMs) by incorporating domain knowledge, such as causal graphs or ancestral information, improves their performance. Methods include conditioning strategies and injecting learnable biases into attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CFMs lack the ability to incorporate domain knowledge, leading to suboptimal predictions. Addressing this gap aims to improve CFMs’ versatility and accuracy.

Method: Introduce methods to condition CFMs on causal information (e.g., causal graphs or ancestral data). Evaluate strategies, focusing on injecting learnable biases into attention mechanisms.

Result: Conditioning CFMs with causal information matches the performance of specialised models. Partial causal information is also effectively leveraged.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain expertise into CFMs bridges a critical gap, enabling more accurate and flexible causal inference.

Abstract: Estimating causal quantities traditionally relies on bespoke estimators tailored to specific assumptions. Recently proposed Causal Foundation Models (CFMs) promise a more unified approach by amortising causal discovery and inference in a single step. However, in their current state, they do not allow for the incorporation of any domain knowledge, which can lead to suboptimal predictions. We bridge this gap by introducing methods to condition CFMs on causal information, such as the causal graph or more readily available ancestral information. When access to complete causal graph information is too strict a requirement, our approach also effectively leverages partial causal information. We systematically evaluate conditioning strategies and find that injecting learnable biases into the attention mechanism is the most effective method to utilise full and partial causal information. Our experiments show that this conditioning allows a general-purpose CFM to match the performance of specialised models trained on specific causal structures. Overall, our approach addresses a central hurdle on the path towards all-in-one causal foundation models: the capability to answer causal queries in a data-driven manner while effectively leveraging any amount of domain expertise.

TL;DR: MacroGuide is a diffusion guidance mechanism using Persistent Homology to enhance macrocycle generation in pretrained models, achieving high success rates and quality metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Macrocycles are valuable but underexplored in generative modeling due to dataset scarcity and topological constraints.

Method: MacroGuide employs Persistent Homology via Vietoris-Rips complexes to steer sampling toward macrocycles in diffusion models.

Result: Macrocycle generation rates improve from 1% to 99%, maintaining or surpassing quality metrics like validity and diversity.

Conclusion: MacroGuide effectively addresses macrocycle generation challenges, demonstrating significant improvements over standard methods.

Abstract: Macrocycles are ring-shaped molecules that offer a promising alternative to small-molecule drugs due to their enhanced selectivity and binding affinity against difficult targets. Despite their chemical value, they remain underexplored in generative modeling, likely owing to their scarcity in public datasets and the challenges of enforcing topological constraints in standard deep generative models. We introduce MacroGuide: Topological Guidance for Macrocycle Generation, a diffusion guidance mechanism that uses Persistent Homology to steer the sampling of pretrained molecular generative models toward the generation of macrocycles, in both unconditional and conditional (protein pocket) settings. At each denoising step, MacroGuide constructs a Vietoris-Rips complex from atomic positions and promotes ring formation by optimizing persistent homology features. Empirically, applying MacroGuide to pretrained diffusion models increases macrocycle generation rates from 1% to 99%, while matching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance on key quality metrics such as chemical validity, diversity, and PoseBusters checks.

TL;DR: COrAL is a multimodal learning framework that explicitly preserves redundant, unique, and synergistic information, outperforming existing methods with stable and comprehensive embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal contrastive learning methods often neglect unique and synergistic information, leading to incomplete representations.

Method: COrAL uses a dual-path architecture with orthogonality constraints to disentangle shared and modality-specific features, along with asymmetric masking for synergy modeling.

Result: COrAL matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods with low performance variance, demonstrating stable and comprehensive embeddings.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling redundant, unique, and synergistic information improves multimodal representation stability and reliability.

Abstract: Multimodal learning seeks to integrate information from heterogeneous sources, where signals may be shared across modalities, specific to individual modalities, or emerge only through their interaction. While self-supervised multimodal contrastive learning has achieved remarkable progress, most existing methods predominantly capture redundant cross-modal signals, often neglecting modality-specific (unique) and interaction-driven (synergistic) information. Recent extensions broaden this perspective, yet they either fail to explicitly model synergistic interactions or learn different information components in an entangled manner, leading to incomplete representations and potential information leakage. We introduce \textbf{COrAL}, a principled framework that explicitly and simultaneously preserves redundant, unique, and synergistic information within multimodal representations. COrAL employs a dual-path architecture with orthogonality constraints to disentangle shared and modality-specific features, ensuring a clean separation of information components. To promote synergy modeling, we introduce asymmetric masking with complementary view-specific patterns, compelling the model to infer cross-modal dependencies rather than rely solely on redundant cues. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and diverse MultiBench datasets demonstrate that COrAL consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods while exhibiting low performance variance across runs. These results indicate that explicitly modeling the full spectrum of multimodal information yields more stable, reliable, and comprehensive embeddings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a growing need for machine learning methods that handle non-Euclidean data structures, such as orbifolds, inspired by application demands.

Method: The paper proposes spectral convolution on orbifolds as a foundational technique for convolutional neural network-like architectures in GDL.

Result: The method makes learning on orbifold-structured data accessible within the GDL framework, illustrated through a music theory application.

Conclusion: Spectral convolution on orbifolds expands GDL's applicability to diverse geometric and topological data structures.

Abstract: Geometric deep learning (GDL) deals with supervised learning on data domains that go beyond Euclidean structure, such as data with graph or manifold structure. Due to the demand that arises from application-related data, there is a need to identify further topological and geometric structures with which these use cases can be made accessible to machine learning. There are various techniques, such as spectral convolution, that form the basic building blocks for some convolutional neural network-like architectures on non-Euclidean data. In this paper, the concept of spectral convolution on orbifolds is introduced. This provides a building block for making learning on orbifold structured data accessible using GDL. The theory discussed is illustrated using an example from music theory.

Method: BPJ converts harmful strings into intermediate attack targets and selects boundary points to optimize attacks using only a binary flag (flagged or not) per query.

Result: BPJ successfully develops universal jailbreaks against Constitutional Classifiers and evades GPT-5's input classifier without human attack seeds.

Conclusion: BPJ is hard to counter in single interactions but flags frequently during optimization, indicating defenses need batch-level monitoring alongside single-interaction methods.

Abstract: Frontier LLMs are safeguarded against attempts to extract harmful information via adversarial prompts known as "jailbreaks". Recently, defenders have developed classifier-based systems that have survived thousands of hours of human red teaming. We introduce Boundary Point Jailbreaking (BPJ), a new class of automated jailbreak attacks that evade the strongest industry-deployed safeguards. Unlike previous attacks that rely on white/grey-box assumptions (such as classifier scores or gradients) or libraries of existing jailbreaks, BPJ is fully black-box and uses only a single bit of information per query: whether or not the classifier flags the interaction. To achieve this, BPJ addresses the core difficulty in optimising attacks against robust real-world defences: evaluating whether a proposed modification to an attack is an improvement. Instead of directly trying to learn an attack for a target harmful string, BPJ converts the string into a curriculum of intermediate attack targets and then actively selects evaluation points that best detect small changes in attack strength ("boundary points"). We believe BPJ is the first fully automated attack algorithm that succeeds in developing universal jailbreaks against Constitutional Classifiers, as well as the first automated attack algorithm that succeeds against GPT-5's input classifier without relying on human attack seeds. BPJ is difficult to defend against in individual interactions but incurs many flags during optimisation, suggesting that effective defence requires supplementing single-interaction methods with batch-level monitoring.

TL;DR: Pretraining AI foundation models on diverse PDEs enables skillful Martian weather prediction, with a 34.4% performance boost through model extension and pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop predictive weather emulators for the Martian atmosphere using AI foundation models pretrained on PDEs, addressing data scarcity and compute constraints.

Method: Extends the Poseidon PDE foundation model from 2D to 3D while retaining pretraining, tested with sparse initial conditions and 34 GB of Martian data.

Result: Achieves a 34.4% performance improvement on held-out data, demonstrating the utility of PDEs-FMs for real-world problems with limited resources.

Conclusion: Pretraining and extending PDE foundation models effectively anchor solutions for complex, data-scarce real-world applications like Martian weather prediction.

Abstract: We show that AI foundation models that are pretrained on numerical solutions to a diverse corpus of partial differential equations can be adapted and fine-tuned to obtain skillful predictive weather emulators for the Martian atmosphere. We base our work on the Poseidon PDE foundation model for two-dimensional systems. We develop a method to extend Poseidon from two to three dimensions while keeping the pretraining information. Moreover, we investigate the performance of the model in the presence of sparse initial conditions. Our results make use of four Martian years (approx.~34 GB) of training data and a median compute budget of 13 GPU hours. We find that the combination of pretraining and model extension yields a performance increase of 34.4\% on a held-out year. This shows that PDEs-FMs can not only approximate solutions to (other) PDEs but also anchor models for real-world problems with complex interactions that lack a sufficient amount of training data or a suitable compute budget.

*Daniil Dmitriev,Zhihan Huang,Yuting Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TL;DR: The paper analyzes the sampling efficiency of score-based discrete diffusion models using CTMC, focusing on τ-leaping-based samplers. It provides convergence guarantees for KL divergence accuracy, improving bounds for uniform diffusion and introducing an adaptive sampler for masking diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the incomplete theoretical foundations of diffusion models over discrete spaces, particularly focusing on their sampling efficiency under CTMC.

Method: The method involves analyzing τ-leaping-based samplers for uniform and masking noising processes, establishing convergence guarantees for KL divergence accuracy. A modified τ-leaping sampler is introduced for masking diffusion.

Result: Results show improved iteration complexity for uniform diffusion (dependence on ambient dimension, not vocabulary size) and adaptive convergence rates for masking diffusion (governed by effective total correlation).

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the theoretical advancements in understanding discrete diffusion models, demonstrating adaptability to low-dimensional structure and improved bounds.

Abstract: Diffusion models over discrete spaces have recently shown striking empirical success, yet their theoretical foundations remain incomplete. In this paper, we study the sampling efficiency of score-based discrete diffusion models under a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) formulation, with a focus on $τ$-leaping-based samplers. We establish sharp convergence guarantees for attaining $\varepsilon$ accuracy in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for both uniform and masking noising processes. For uniform discrete diffusion, we show that the $τ$-leaping algorithm achieves an iteration complexity of order $\tilde O(d/\varepsilon)$, with $d$ the ambient dimension of the target distribution, eliminating linear dependence on the vocabulary size $S$ and improving existing bounds by a factor of $d$; moreover, we establish a matching algorithmic lower bound showing that linear dependence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable in general. For masking discrete diffusion, we introduce a modified $τ$-leaping sampler whose convergence rate is governed by an intrinsic information-theoretic quantity, termed the effective total correlation, which is bounded by $d \log S$ but can be sublinear or even constant for structured data. As a consequence, the sampler provably adapts to low-dimensional structure without prior knowledge or algorithmic modification, yielding sublinear convergence rates for various practical examples (such as hidden Markov models, image data, and random graphs). Our analysis requires no boundedness or smoothness assumptions on the score estimator beyond control of the score entropy loss.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces canonicalization as an alternative to equivariant models for invariant distributions in generative tasks, proving its theoretical advantages and demonstrating superior performance in 3D molecule generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of traditional equivariant and invariant methods in generative tasks by proposing canonicalization, which simplifies training and improves performance.

Method: Proposes canonicalization: mapping samples to orbit representatives, training unconstrained models on canonical slices, and sampling random symmetry transforms during generation. It leverages formal quotient-space theory and tests on molecular graph generation.

Result: Canonical diffusion outperforms equivariant baselines in 3D molecule generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on GEOM-DRUG with improved efficiency.

Conclusion: Canonicalization offers a theoretically sound and practically superior alternative to equivariant models for invariant distributions, with demonstrated efficiency and performance gains.

Abstract: Many generative tasks in chemistry and science involve distributions invariant to group symmetries (e.g., permutation and rotation). A common strategy enforces invariance and equivariance through architectural constraints such as equivariant denoisers and invariant priors. In this paper, we challenge this tradition through the alternative canonicalization perspective: first map each sample to an orbit representative with a canonical pose or order, train an unconstrained (non-equivariant) diffusion or flow model on the canonical slice, and finally recover the invariant distribution by sampling a random symmetry transform at generation time. Building on a formal quotient-space perspective, our work provides a comprehensive theory of canonical diffusion by proving: (i) the correctness, universality and superior expressivity of canonical generative models over invariant targets; (ii) canonicalization accelerates training by removing diffusion score complexity induced by group mixtures and reducing conditional variance in flow matching. We then show that aligned priors and optimal transport act complementarily with canonicalization and further improves training efficiency. We instantiate the framework for molecular graph generation under $S_n \times SE(3)$ symmetries. By leveraging geometric spectra-based canonicalization and mild positional encodings, canonical diffusion significantly outperforms equivariant baselines in 3D molecule generation tasks, with similar or even less computation. Moreover, with a novel architecture Canon, CanonFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging GEOM-DRUG dataset, and the advantage remains large in few-step generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAPerBench, a benchmark to study how context length affects personalization and privacy in LLMs, revealing performance degradation with longer contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the unexplored impact of context length on privacy leakage and personalization effectiveness in LLMs.

Method: Creation of PAPerBench with ~29K instances (1K-256K tokens) and 377K evaluation questions to analyze long-context model behavior.

Result: Performance degrades in personalization and privacy as context length increases due to attention dilution.

Conclusion: Longer contexts lead to less focus in current LLMs, highlighting a scaling gap.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in privacy-critical and personalization-oriented scenarios, yet the role of context length in shaping privacy leakage and personalization effectiveness remains largely unexplored. We introduce a large-scale benchmark, PAPerBench, to systematically study how increasing context length influences both personalization quality and privacy protection in LLMs. The benchmark comprises approximately 29,000 instances with context lengths ranging from 1K to 256K tokens, yielding a total of 377K evaluation questions. It jointly evaluates personalization performance and privacy risks across diverse scenarios, enabling controlled analysis of long-context model behavior. Extensive evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal consistent performance degradation in both personalization and privacy as context length increases. We further provide a theoretical analysis of attention dilution under context scaling, explaining this behavior as an inherent limitation of soft attention in fixed-capacity Transformers. The empirical and theoretical findings together suggest a general scaling gap in current models -- long context, less focus. We release the benchmark to support reproducible evaluation and future research on scalable privacy and personalization. Code and data are available at https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/PAPerBench

TL;DR: Agent Mars is a multi-agent simulation framework designed for Mars base operations, addressing coordination challenges among humans, robots, and digital services in extreme conditions. It features hierarchical organization, dynamic role handover, and mission-critical mechanisms, validated through reproducible scripts and performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Space exploration presents unique challenges like delayed communications, resource scarcity, and strict safety requirements. Agent Mars aims to enable auditable coordination among specialized agents in such environments.

Method: Agent Mars formalizes a 93-agent roster across seven command layers, implementing hierarchical and cross-layer coordination, dynamic role handover, and mission-critical mechanisms like memory and consensus protocols.

Result: The framework demonstrates coordination trade-offs and identifies regimes where cross-layer collaboration reduces overhead without compromising reliability, validated by the Agent Mars Performance Index (AMPI).

Conclusion: Agent Mars provides a benchmarkable and auditable foundation for AI applications in space exploration, addressing critical coordination challenges for Mars operations.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed robotics, healthcare, industry, and scientific discovery, yet a major frontier may lie beyond Earth. Space exploration and settlement offer vast environments and resources, but impose constraints unmatched on Earth: delayed/intermittent communications, extreme resource scarcity, heterogeneous expertise, and strict safety, accountability, and command authority. The key challenge is auditable coordination among specialised humans, robots, and digital services in a safety-critical system-of-systems. We introduce Agent Mars, an open, end-to-end multi-agent simulation framework for Mars base operations. Agent Mars formalises a realistic organisation with a 93-agent roster across seven layers of command and execution (human roles and physical assets), enabling base-scale studies beyond toy settings. It implements hierarchical and cross-layer coordination that preserves chain-of-command while allowing vetted cross-layer exchanges with audit trails; supports dynamic role handover with automatic failover under outages; and enables phase-dependent leadership for routine operations, emergencies, and science campaigns. Agent Mars further models mission-critical mechanisms-scenario-aware short/long-horizon memory, configurable propose-vote consensus, and translator-mediated heterogeneous protocols-to capture how teams align under stress. To quantify behaviour, we propose the Agent Mars Performance Index (AMPI), an interpretable composite score with diagnostic sub-metrics. Across 13 reproducible Mars-relevant operational scripts, Agent Mars reveals coordination trade-offs and identifies regimes where curated cross-layer collaboration and functional leadership reduce overhead without sacrificing reliability. Agent Mars provides a benchmarkable, auditable foundation for Space AI.

TL;DR: AVD is a cooperative MARL framework addressing dynamic agent populations and action homogenization in semi-MARL settings, outperforming baselines in bike-sharing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL methods rely on restrictive assumptions violated in urban systems, like dynamic agent numbers and asynchronous actions. Shared policies can also degrade coordination by homogenizing actions.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Value Decomposition (AVD), featuring adaptability to changing agent populations and a lightweight mechanism for action diversity. Includes a training-execution strategy for asynchronous actions.

Result: AVD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in real-world bike-sharing tasks in London and Washington, D.C.

Conclusion: AVD effectively addresses challenges in semi-MARL settings, demonstrating strong performance and generalizability.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) provides a promising paradigm for coordinating multi-agent systems (MAS). However, most existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions, such as a fixed number of agents and fully synchronous action execution. These assumptions are often violated in urban systems, where the number of active agents varies over time, and actions may have heterogeneous durations, resulting in a semi-MARL setting. Moreover, while sharing policy parameters among agents is commonly adopted to improve learning efficiency, it can lead to highly homogeneous actions when a subset of agents make decisions concurrently under similar observations, potentially degrading coordination quality. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Value Decomposition (AVD), a cooperative MARL framework that adapts to a dynamically changing agent population. AVD further incorporates a lightweight mechanism to mitigate action homogenization induced by shared policies, thereby encouraging behavioral diversity and maintaining effective cooperation among agents. In addition, we design a training-execution strategy tailored to the semi-MARL setting that accommodates asynchronous decision-making when some agents act at different times. Experiments on real-world bike-sharing redistribution tasks in two major cities, London and Washington, D.C., demonstrate that AVD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PeroMAS, a multi-agent system for end-to-end perovskite material discovery, outperforming traditional methods by integrating physical constraints and achieving validated real-world results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI approaches for perovskite solar cells lack end-to-end optimization due to isolated models. PeroMAS aims to bridge this gap by integrating the entire workflow under physical constraints.

Method: PeroMAS encapsulates perovskite-specific tools into Model Context Protocols (MCPs), enabling multi-objective material design from literature retrieval to synthesis validation.

Result: PeroMAS significantly improves discovery efficiency over single LLMs or search strategies, identifying viable materials and demonstrating real-world synthesis success.

Conclusion: PeroMAS offers a robust, integrated solution for perovskite material discovery, validated by expert benchmarks and real experiments.

Abstract: As a pioneer of the third-generation photovoltaic revolution, Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) are renowned for their superior optoelectronic performance and cost potential. The development process of PSCs is precise and complex, involving a series of closed-loop workflows such as literature retrieval, data integration, experimental design, and synthesis. However, existing AI perovskite approaches focus predominantly on discrete models, including material design, process optimization,and property prediction. These models fail to propagate physical constraints across the workflow, hindering end-to-end optimization. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system for perovskite material discovery, named PeroMAS. We first encapsulated a series of perovskite-specific tools into Model Context Protocols (MCPs). By planning and invoking these tools, PeroMAS can design perovskite materials under multi-objective constraints, covering the entire process from literature retrieval and data extraction to property prediction and mechanism analysis. Furthermore, we construct an evaluation benchmark by perovskite human experts to assess this multi-agent system. Results demonstrate that, compared to single Large Language Model (LLM) or traditional search strategies, our system significantly enhances discovery efficiency. It successfully identified candidate materials satisfying multi-objective constraints. Notably, we verify PeroMAS's effectiveness in the physical world through real synthesis experiments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new equilibrium concept, MF-RQE, combining risk aversion and bounded rationality to address limitations in mean-field game literature, with proven convergence and improved robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mean-field game approaches assume fixed initial distributions and fully rational agents, limiting robustness under uncertainty and cognitive constraints.

Method: Introduces risk aversion regarding the initial population distribution and bounded rationality, leading to MF-RQE. Establishes existence results and convergence proofs.

Result: Develops a scalable reinforcement learning algorithm. Numerical experiments show MF-RQE policies improve robustness over classical methods.

Conclusion: MF-RQE provides a more general and robust equilibrium solution by addressing distributional uncertainty and cognitive constraints.

Abstract: Recent advances in mean-field game literature enable the reduction of large-scale multi-agent problems to tractable interactions between a representative agent and a population distribution. However, existing approaches typically assume a fixed initial population distribution and fully rational agents, limiting robustness under distributional uncertainty and cognitive constraints. We address these limitations by introducing risk aversion with respect to the initial population distribution and by incorporating bounded rationality to model deviations from fully rational decision-making agents. The combination of these two elements yields a new and more general equilibrium concept, which we term the mean-field risk-averse quantal response equilibrium (MF-RQE). We establish existence results and prove convergence of fixed-point iteration and fictitious play to MF-RQE. Building on these insights, we develop a scalable reinforcement learning algorithm for scenarios with large state-action spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate that MF-RQE policies achieve improved robustness relative to classical mean-field approaches that optimize expected cumulative rewards under a fixed initial distribution and are restricted to entropy-based regularizers.

TL;DR: G2CP introduces a graph-based communication protocol for multi-agent systems, reducing ambiguity and improving efficiency compared to free-text communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems using natural language communication suffer from semantic drift, hallucination propagation, and inefficiency.

Method: G2CP replaces free-text messages with structured graph operations (traversal commands, subgraph fragments, updates) over a shared knowledge graph.

Result: In industrial settings, G2CP reduces communication tokens by 73%, improves accuracy by 34%, eliminates hallucinations, and ensures auditable reasoning.

Conclusion: G2CP shifts multi-agent communication from linguistic to structured, enhancing precision and coordination in domains requiring exact agent interactions.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models face a critical challenge: agents communicate through natural language, leading to semantic drift, hallucination propagation, and inefficient token consumption. We propose G2CP (Graph-Grounded Communication Protocol), a structured agent communication language where messages are graph operations rather than free text. Agents exchange explicit traversal commands, subgraph fragments, and update operations over a shared knowledge graph, enabling verifiable reasoning traces and eliminating ambiguity. We validate G2CP within an industrial knowledge management system where specialized agents (Diagnostic, Procedural, Synthesis, and Ingestion) coordinate to answer complex queries. Experimental results on 500 industrial scenarios and 21 real-world maintenance cases show that G2CP reduces inter-agent communication tokens by 73%, improves task completion accuracy by 34% over free-text baselines, eliminates cascading hallucinations, and produces fully auditable reasoning chains. G2CP represents a fundamental shift from linguistic to structural communication in multi-agent systems, with implications for any domain requiring precise agent coordination. Code, data, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems lack dynamic adaptability post-deployment, unlike biological systems.

Method: MASFly uses retrieval-augmented SOP instantiation and experience-guided supervision for dynamic adaptation.

Result: Achieves 61.7% success rate on TravelPlanner, showing strong adaptability and robustness.

Conclusion: MASFly outperforms existing methods, offering dynamic adaptability and high performance.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex tasks. However, existing works often rely on manual designs or "one-size-fits-all" automation, lacking dynamic adaptability after deployment. Inspired by how biological systems adapt, we introduce MASFly, a novel multi-agent framework enabling dynamic adaptation at test time. To adapt system generation, MASFly employs a retrieval-augmented SOP instantiation mechanism that leverages a self-constructed repository of successful collaboration patterns, enabling the LLM to assemble customized MASs for new queries. For adaptive execution, MASFly incorporates an experience-guided supervision mechanism, where a dedicated Watcher agent monitors system behaviors with reference to a personalized experience pool and provides real-time interventions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MASFly achieves state-of-the-art performance, most notably a 61.7% success rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, while exhibiting strong task adaptability and robustness.

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating BDI agents into Discrete Event Simulation for testing, demonstrating varying fidelity levels with a prototype.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing multi-agent systems, especially BDI models, is challenging due to fidelity gaps between simulation and real-world deployment.

Method: Mapping BDI agent control flow onto Discrete Event Simulation (DES) at varying granularities using a prototype (JaKtA and Alchemist).

Result: Successful integration of BDI agents into DES, proving feasibility for simulation-based testing with adjustable fidelity.

Conclusion: The approach enables testing BDI agents directly in simulation, bridging the reality gap with flexible granularity.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems are designed to deal with open, distributed systems with unpredictable dynamics, which makes them inherently hard to test. The value of using simulation for this purpose is recognized in the literature, although achieving sufficient fidelity (i.e., the degree of similarity between the simulation and the real-world system) remains a challenging task. This is exacerbated when dealing with cognitive agent models, such as the Belief Desire Intention (BDI) model, where the agent codebase is not suitable to run unchanged in simulation environments, thus increasing the reality gap between the deployed and simulated systems. We argue that BDI developers should be able to test in simulation the same specification that will be later deployed, with no surrogate representations. Thus, in this paper, we discuss how the control flow of BDI agents can be mapped onto a Discrete Event Simulation (DES), showing that such integration is possible at different degrees of granularity. We substantiate our claims by producing an open-source prototype integration between two pre-existing tools (JaKtA and Alchemist), showing that it is possible to produce a simulation-based testing environment for distributed BDI} agents, and that different granularities in mapping BDI agents over DESs may lead to different degrees of fidelity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Socially-Weighted Alignment (SWA), a framework balancing individual and collective goals in LLM agents, showing a phase transition to stability under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the tension between individual alignment and system-level stability in shared environments with LLM agents.

Method: Proposes SWA, a game-theoretic framework adjusting decision-making by interpolating private objectives and group welfare using a social weight λ.

Result: SWA induces a critical threshold λ* for stability, validated empirically in simulations.

Conclusion: SWA effectively balances individual and collective goals, enabling stable system operation near capacity.

Abstract: Deploying large language model (LLM) agents in shared environments introduces a fundamental tension between individual alignment and collective stability: locally rational decisions can impose negative externalities that degrade system-level performance. We propose Socially-Weighted Alignment (SWA), a game-theoretic framework that modifies inference-time decision making by interpolating between an agent's private objective and an estimate of group welfare via a social weight $λ\in[0,1]$. In a shared-resource congestion game with $n$ agents and congestion severity $β$, we show that SWA induces a critical threshold $λ^*=(n-β)/(n-1)$ above which agents no longer have marginal incentive to increase demand under overload, yielding a phase transition from persistent congestion to stable operation near capacity. We further provide an inference-time algorithmic instantiation of SWA that does not require parameter updates or multi-agent reinforcement learning, and use a multi-agent simulation to empirically validate the predicted threshold behavior.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a governance architecture for autonomous agentic systems in regulated domains, focusing on bounding selection and action autonomy while preserving cognitive freedom. It introduces mechanical primitives to ensure safety and evaluates the system in adversarial financial scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety mechanisms like alignment and interpretability are insufficient for governing selection power in autonomous systems operating in high-stakes environments.

Method: The architecture separates cognition, selection, and action into distinct domains, using primitives like external candidate generation (CEFL), governed reducers, and fail-loud circuit breakers.

Result: The system is implementable, auditable, and prevents deterministic outcome capture while maintaining reasoning capacity, though probabilistic concentration persists.

Conclusion: Mechanical governance of selection authority offers a viable approach for deploying autonomous agents in regulated settings where silent failures are unacceptable.

Abstract: Autonomous agentic systems are increasingly deployed in regulated, high-stakes domains where decisions may be irreversible and institutionally constrained. Existing safety approaches emphasize alignment, interpretability, or action-level filtering. We argue that these mechanisms are necessary but insufficient because they do not directly govern selection power: the authority to determine which options are generated, surfaced, and framed for decision. We propose a governance architecture that separates cognition, selection, and action into distinct domains and models autonomy as a vector of sovereignty. Cognitive autonomy remains unconstrained, while selection and action autonomy are bounded through mechanically enforced primitives operating outside the agent's optimization space. The architecture integrates external candidate generation (CEFL), a governed reducer, commit-reveal entropy isolation, rationale validation, and fail-loud circuit breakers. We evaluate the system across multiple regulated financial scenarios under adversarial stress targeting variance manipulation, threshold gaming, framing skew, ordering effects, and entropy probing. Metrics quantify selection concentration, narrative diversity, governance activation cost, and failure visibility. Results show that mechanical selection governance is implementable, auditable, and prevents deterministic outcome capture while preserving reasoning capacity. Although probabilistic concentration remains, the architecture measurably bounds selection authority relative to conventional scalar pipelines. This work reframes governance as bounded causal power rather than internal intent alignment, offering a foundation for deploying autonomous agents where silent failure is unacceptable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-evolving MAS lack flexibility by focusing only on Spatial or Temporal evolution, limiting LLMs' collaborative potential. ST-EVO addresses this gap.

Method: ST-EVO introduces a Spatio-Temporal evolving approach with dialogue-wise communication scheduling and a flow-matching based Scheduler, enhanced by uncertainty perception and self-feedback.

Result: Experiments on nine benchmarks show ST-EVO achieves state-of-the-art performance with 5%-25% accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: ST-EVO's Spatio-Temporal evolving framework significantly enhances collaborative intelligence in MAS, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: LLM-powered Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as an effective approach towards collaborative intelligence, and have attracted wide research interests. Among them, ``self-evolving'' MAS, treated as a more flexible and powerful technical route, can construct task-adaptive workflows or communication topologies, instead of relying on a predefined static structue template. Current self-evolving MAS mainly focus on Spatial Evolving or Temporal Evolving paradigm, which only considers the single dimension of evolution and does not fully incentivize LLMs' collaborative capability. In this work, we start from a novel Spatio-Temporal perspective by proposing ST-EVO, which supports dialogue-wise communication scheduling with a compact yet powerful flow-matching based Scheduler. To make precise Spatio-Temporal scheduling, ST-EVO can also perceive the uncertainty of MAS, and possesses self-feedback ability to learn from accumulated experience. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ST-EVO, achieving about 5%--25% accuracy improvement.

Trained for single-step prediction and deployed autoregressively, it generates deterministic outputs, enabling actionable speed advisories. Incorporating motion dynamics, the model achieves high accuracy (ADE: 1.29m, FDE: 2.99m at a five-second prediction horizon), surpassing prior work. Adding route intention further improves performance (ADE: 1.10m, FDE: 2.36m), demonstrating the value of connected vehicle data. Based on predicted conflicts with VRUs and circulating vehicles, ROSA provides real-time, proactive speed advisories for approaching and entering the roundabout. Despite prediction uncertainty, ROSA significantly improves vehicle efficiency and safety, with positive effects even on perceived safety from a VRU perspective.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a powerful tool for probabilistic modeling, but their performance is often constrained in complex, largescale real-world domains due to the limited expressivity of classical kernels. Quantum computing offers the potential to overcome this limitation by embedding data into exponentially large Hilbert spaces, capturing complex correlations that remain inaccessible to classical computing approaches. In this paper, we propose a Distributed Quantum Gaussian Process (DQGP) method in a multiagent setting to enhance modeling capabilities and scalability. To address the challenging non-Euclidean optimization problem, we develop a Distributed consensus Riemannian Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (DR-ADMM) algorithm that aggregates local agent models into a global model. We evaluate the efficacy of our method through numerical experiments conducted on a quantum simulator in classical hardware. We use real-world, non-stationary elevation datasets of NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and synthetic datasets generated by Quantum Gaussian Processes. Beyond modeling advantages, our framework highlights potential computational speedups that quantum hardware may provide, particularly in Gaussian processes and distributed optimization.
