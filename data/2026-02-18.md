*Abdul Joseph Fofanah,Lian Wen,Alpha Alimamy Kamara,Zhongyi Zhang,David Chen,Albert Patrick Sankoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAFNet is a biologically inspired deep learning model for polyp segmentation in colonoscopy. It improves accuracy and generalization by mimicking human visual processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polyp segmentation is crucial for cancer prevention but challenging due to morphological variability, visual similarity to normal structures, and multi-scale detection needs.

Method: GRAFNet integrates GAAM for boundary emphasis, MSRM for multi-feature analysis, and GCAFM for iterative refinement, unified in PEDM for spatial-semantic consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks with 3-8% Dice improvements and 10-20% higher generalization.

Conclusion: GRAFNet bridges AI accuracy with clinically trustworthy reasoning, offering interpretable decision pathways.

Abstract: Accurate polyp segmentation in colonoscopy is essential for cancer prevention but remains challenging due to: (1) high morphological variability (from flat to protruding lesions), (2) strong visual similarity to normal structures such as folds and vessels, and (3) the need for robust multi-scale detection. Existing deep learning approaches suffer from unidirectional processing, weak multi-scale fusion, and the absence of anatomical constraints, often leading to false positives (over-segmentation of normal structures) and false negatives (missed subtle flat lesions). We propose GRAFNet, a biologically inspired architecture that emulates the hierarchical organisation of the human visual system. GRAFNet integrates three key modules: (1) a Guided Asymmetric Attention Module (GAAM) that mimics orientation-tuned cortical neurones to emphasise polyp boundaries, (2) a MultiScale Retinal Module (MSRM) that replicates retinal ganglion cell pathways for parallel multi-feature analysis, and (3) a Guided Cortical Attention Feedback Module (GCAFM) that applies predictive coding for iterative refinement. These are unified in a Polyp Encoder-Decoder Module (PEDM) that enforces spatial-semantic consistency via resolution-adaptive feedback. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks (Kvasir-SEG, CVC-300, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-Clinic, and PolypGen) demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance, with 3-8% Dice improvements and 10-20% higher generalisation over leading methods, while offering interpretable decision pathways. This work establishes a paradigm in which neural computation principles bridge the gap between AI accuracy and clinically trustworthy reasoning.

### [2] [Zero-shot HOI Detection with MLLM-based Detector-agnostic Interaction Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15124)
*Shiyu Xuan,Dongkai Wang,Zechao Li,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decoupled framework for zero-shot HOI detection, separating object detection from interaction recognition and leveraging MLLMs, achieving superior performance without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for HOI detection struggle with generalization to unseen interactions due to tight coupling with specific detectors and coarse-grained VLM features.

Method: The framework decouples object detection from IR, uses MLLMs for zero-shot IR, introduces deterministic generation, spatial-aware pooling, and one-pass matching.

Result: The method achieves superior zero-shot performance on HICO-DET and V-COCO, with strong cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: The decoupled framework enhances flexibility and performance in zero-shot HOI detection, compatible with any object detector.

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-object interaction (HOI) detection aims to locate humans and objects in images and recognize their interactions. While advances in open-vocabulary object detection provide promising solutions for object localization, interaction recognition (IR) remains challenging due to the combinatorial diversity of interactions. Existing methods, including two-stage methods, tightly couple IR with a specific detector and rely on coarse-grained vision-language model (VLM) features, which limit generalization to unseen interactions. In this work, we propose a decoupled framework that separates object detection from IR and leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for zero-shot IR. We introduce a deterministic generation method that formulates IR as a visual question answering task and enforces deterministic outputs, enabling training-free zero-shot IR. To further enhance performance and efficiency by fine-tuning the model, we design a spatial-aware pooling module that integrates appearance and pairwise spatial cues, and a one-pass deterministic matching method that predicts all candidate interactions in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO demonstrate that our method achieves superior zero-shot performance, strong cross-dataset generalization, and the flexibility to integrate with any object detectors without retraining. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/SY-Xuan/DA-HOI.

### [3] [Loss Knows Best: Detecting Annotation Errors in Videos via Loss Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15154)
*Praditha Alwis,Soumyadeep Chandra,Deepak Ravikumar,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a model-agnostic method (CSL analysis) to detect video annotation errors (mislabeling/disordering) by tracking frame-level loss trajectories across training epochs, showing strong performance on real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address annotation errors (mislabeling, disordering) in video datasets, which harm model training, especially for tasks requiring temporal consistency.

Method: Uses Cumulative Sample Loss (CSL)—average loss per frame across training epochs—to identify frames with persistently high or irregular loss, indicating annotation errors.

Result: Demonstrates effective detection of mislabeling and disordering on EgoPER and Cholec80 datasets without needing ground truth on errors.

Conclusion: CSL-based method offers a robust, generalizable tool for auditing video datasets and enhancing training reliability.

Abstract: High-quality video datasets are foundational for training robust models in tasks like action recognition, phase detection, and event segmentation. However, many real-world video datasets suffer from annotation errors such as *mislabeling*, where segments are assigned incorrect class labels, and *disordering*, where the temporal sequence does not follow the correct progression. These errors are particularly harmful in phase-annotated tasks, where temporal consistency is critical. We propose a novel, model-agnostic method for detecting annotation errors by analyzing the Cumulative Sample Loss (CSL)--defined as the average loss a frame incurs when passing through model checkpoints saved across training epochs. This per-frame loss trajectory acts as a dynamic fingerprint of frame-level learnability. Mislabeled or disordered frames tend to show consistently high or irregular loss patterns, as they remain difficult for the model to learn throughout training, while correctly labeled frames typically converge to low loss early. To compute CSL, we train a video segmentation model and store its weights at each epoch. These checkpoints are then used to evaluate the loss of each frame in a test video. Frames with persistently high CSL are flagged as likely candidates for annotation errors, including mislabeling or temporal misalignment. Our method does not require ground truth on annotation errors and is generalizable across datasets. Experiments on EgoPER and Cholec80 demonstrate strong detection performance, effectively identifying subtle inconsistencies such as mislabeling and frame disordering. The proposed approach provides a powerful tool for dataset auditing and improving training reliability in video-based machine learning.

### [4] [Distributional Deep Learning for Super-Resolution of 4D Flow MRI under Domain Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15167)
*Xiaoyi Wen,Fei Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A distributional deep learning framework is proposed to enhance super-resolution in medical imaging, specifically for 4D Flow MRI, addressing domain shift issues and improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional super-resolution methods rely on paired datasets of downsampled and high-resolution images, but real-world clinical data often differ from training data, leading to poor generalization due to domain shift.

Method: A distributional deep learning framework is developed, initially trained on high-resolution CFD simulations and their downsampled versions, then fine-tuned on a small dataset of paired 4D Flow MRI and CFD samples.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms traditional deep learning approaches, demonstrating effectiveness in addressing domain shift and improving super-resolution in realistic clinical scenarios.

Conclusion: Distributional learning enhances robustness and domain generalization, making it a promising solution for super-resolution in medical imaging.

Abstract: Super-resolution is widely used in medical imaging to enhance low-quality data, reducing scan time and improving abnormality detection. Conventional super-resolution approaches typically rely on paired datasets of downsampled and original high resolution images, training models to reconstruct high resolution images from their artificially degraded counterparts. However, in real-world clinical settings, low resolution data often arise from acquisition mechanisms that differ significantly from simple downsampling. As a result, these inputs may lie outside the domain of the training data, leading to poor model generalization due to domain shift. To address this limitation, we propose a distributional deep learning framework that improves model robustness and domain generalization. We develop this approch for enhancing the resolution of 4D Flow MRI (4DF). This is a novel imaging modality that captures hemodynamic flow velocity and clinically relevant metrics such as vessel wall stress. These metrics are critical for assessing aneurysm rupture risk. Our model is initially trained on high resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and their downsampled counterparts. It is then fine-tuned on a small, harmonized dataset of paired 4D Flow MRI and CFD samples. We derive the theoretical properties of our distributional estimators and demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional deep learning approaches through real data applications. This highlights the effectiveness of distributional learning in addressing domain shift and improving super-resolution performance in clinically realistic scenarios.

### [5] [Time-Archival Camera Virtualization for Sports and Visual Performances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15181)
*Yunxiao Zhang,William Stone,Suryansh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a neural volume rendering method for camera virtualization to address challenges in dynamic scene rendering, offering improved quality and time-archival capabilities for applications like sports broadcasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for novel view synthesis struggle with dynamic scenes, especially fast-paced or non-rigid motions, and lack efficient time-archival features.

Method: The paper introduces a neural volume rendering approach by modeling dynamic scenes as rigid transformations across synchronized camera views, enabling enhanced rendering quality and temporal archiving.

Result: The method supports time-archival, allowing users to revisit past instances of dynamic scenes and perform novel view synthesis retrospectively.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances camera virtualization for dynamic scenes, offering practical benefits for sports broadcasting and archival applications.

Abstract: Camera virtualization -- an emerging solution to novel view synthesis -- holds transformative potential for visual entertainment, live performances, and sports broadcasting by enabling the generation of photorealistic images from novel viewpoints using images from a limited set of calibrated multiple static physical cameras. Despite recent advances, achieving spatially and temporally coherent and photorealistic rendering of dynamic scenes with efficient time-archival capabilities, particularly in fast-paced sports and stage performances, remains challenging for existing approaches. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for dynamic scenes could offer real-time view-synthesis results. Yet, they are hindered by their dependence on accurate 3D point clouds from the structure-from-motion method and their inability to handle large, non-rigid, rapid motions of different subjects (e.g., flips, jumps, articulations, sudden player-to-player transitions). Moreover, independent motions of multiple subjects can break the Gaussian-tracking assumptions commonly used in 4DGS, ST-GS, and other dynamic splatting variants. This paper advocates reconsidering a neural volume rendering formulation for camera virtualization and efficient time-archival capabilities, making it useful for sports broadcasting and related applications. By modeling a dynamic scene as rigid transformations across multiple synchronized camera views at a given time, our method performs neural representation learning, providing enhanced visual rendering quality at test time. A key contribution of our approach is its support for time-archival, i.e., users can revisit any past temporal instance of a dynamic scene and can perform novel view synthesis, enabling retrospective rendering for replay, analysis, and archival of live events, a functionality absent in existing neural rendering approaches and novel view synthesis...

*Austin Veselka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a large-scale study on training long-context vision-language models (up to 344K context) for tasks like long-document visual question answering, achieving state-of-the-art results on MMLongBenchDoc. It includes findings on optimal context length training, the impact of page indices, synthetic data pipelines for self-improvement, and bidirectional context transfer between text and visuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of reproducibility in training recipes and data pipelines for existing open-weight models (e.g., Qwen3 VL, GLM 4.5/6V) and improve long-context vision-language model performance.

Method: The authors systematically explore continued pretraining, supervised finetuning, and preference optimization for 24B and 32B parameter models, backed by extensive evaluations and ablations. They also introduce synthetic data pipelines for self-improvement.

Result: The models achieve state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBenchDoc. Key findings include the benefits of matching training and evaluation context lengths, the boost from page indices, and bidirectional text-to-visual context transfer.

Conclusion: The study bridges gaps in reproducibility and performance for long-context vision-language models, offering practical insights and releasing MMLBD-C, a corrected benchmark version to improve evaluation quality.

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive, large-scale study of training long-context vision language models up to 344K context, targeting long-document visual question answering with measured transfer to long-context text. While several such strong are open-weight, namely Qwen3 VL and GLM 4.5/6V, their training recipes and data pipelines are not reproducible. We systematically study continued pretraining, supervised finetuning, and preference optimization for 24B and 32B parameter models, backed by extensive LC evaluations and ablations to bridge this gap, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBenchDoc for both parameter scales. In addition to this, our key findings include: (i) training on context lengths that match evaluation context lengths outperforms training on longer contexts, (ii) training and evaluating with page indices provides a simple, high-impact boost to long-document performance, (iii) our synthetic data pipelines enable self-improvement via continued pretraining and supervised finetuning, and (iv) we extend the known text-to-visual long context transfer to the reverse, showing that visual long context training transfers to long-context text performance. We also release MMLBD-C, a manually corrected version of MMLongBenchDoc to reduce erroneous and low quality examples in the benchmark.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses the original data into compact synthetic datasets, reducing training time and storage while retaining model performance, enabling deployment under limited resources. Although recent decoupling-based distillation methods enable dataset distillation at large-scale, they continue to face an efficiency gap: optimization-based decoupling methods achieve higher accuracy but demand intensive computation, whereas optimization-free decoupling methods are efficient but sacrifice accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, we propose Exploration-Exploitation Distillation (E^2D), a simple, practical method that minimizes redundant computation through an efficient pipeline that begins with full-image initialization to preserve semantic integrity and feature diversity. It then uses a two-phase optimization strategy: an exploration phase that performs uniform updates and identifies high-loss regions, and an exploitation phase that focuses updates on these regions to accelerate convergence. We evaluate E^2D on large-scale benchmarks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K while being 18x faster, and on ImageNet-21K, our method substantially improves accuracy while remaining 4.3x faster. These results demonstrate that targeted, redundancy-reducing updates, rather than brute-force optimization, bridge the gap between accuracy and efficiency in large-scale dataset distillation.

### [8] [Visual Persuasion: What Influences Decisions of Vision-Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15278)
*Manuel Cherep,Pranav M R,Pattie Maes,Nikhil Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to study visual preferences of vision-language models (VLMs) by analyzing their choices in controlled image-based tasks. It proposes methods for visual prompt optimization and evaluates how edits affect selection probabilities, aiming to uncover visual vulnerabilities proactively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding VLMs' visual decision-making is crucial as they increasingly influence actions like clicking, recommending, or buying. Current knowledge about their visual preferences is limited.

Method: The study uses controlled choice tasks with systematically edited images, treating VLMs' decisions as latent visual utility. It adapts text optimization methods for visual prompts, iteratively modifying images (e.g., composition, lighting) and evaluating their impact on selection probabilities.

Result: Optimized edits significantly shift VLMs' choice probabilities in comparisons. An interpretability pipeline identifies consistent visual themes driving preferences, revealing potential vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The framework offers a proactive way to audit and govern image-based AI agents, uncovering visual biases or safety concerns before they manifest in real-world applications.

Abstract: The web is littered with images, once created for human consumption and now increasingly interpreted by agents using vision-language models (VLMs). These agents make visual decisions at scale, deciding what to click, recommend, or buy. Yet, we know little about the structure of their visual preferences. We introduce a framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agent's decision function as a latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background). We then evaluate which edits increase selection probability. Through large-scale experiments on frontier VLMs, we demonstrate that optimized edits significantly shift choice probabilities in head-to-head comparisons. We develop an automatic interpretability pipeline to explain these preferences, identifying consistent visual themes that drive selection. We argue that this approach offers a practical and efficient way to surface visual vulnerabilities, safety concerns that might otherwise be discovered implicitly in the wild, supporting more proactive auditing and governance of image-based AI agents.

### [9] [Consistency-Preserving Diverse Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15287)
*Xinshuang Liu,Runfa Blark Li,Truong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a joint-sampling framework for text-to-video generation that enhances batch diversity without sacrificing temporal consistency, using lightweight latent-space models to avoid costly computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video generation is resource-intensive, often limiting the number of samples per prompt. Existing methods struggle to balance diversity and temporal consistency, requiring expensive computations.

Method: The proposed framework uses diversity-driven updates and selectively removes components that harm temporal consistency. It avoids image-space gradients by leveraging lightweight latent-space models.

Result: Experiments show improved diversity comparable to baselines while significantly enhancing temporal consistency and color naturalness.

Conclusion: The approach efficiently balances diversity and consistency in text-to-video generation, avoiding costly video decoding and backpropagation.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation is expensive, so only a few samples are typically produced per prompt. In this low-sample regime, maximizing the value of each batch requires high cross-video diversity. Recent methods improve diversity for image generation, but for videos they often degrade within-video temporal consistency and require costly backpropagation through a video decoder. We propose a joint-sampling framework for flow-matching video generators that improves batch diversity while preserving temporal consistency. Our approach applies diversity-driven updates and then removes only the components that would decrease a temporal-consistency objective. To avoid image-space gradients, we compute both objectives with lightweight latent-space models, avoiding video decoding and decoder backpropagation. Experiments on a state-of-the-art text-to-video flow-matching model show diversity comparable to strong joint-sampling baselines while substantially improving temporal consistency and color naturalness. Code will be released.

### [10] [Training-Free Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection in 3D Brain MRI with 2D Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15315)
*Tai Le-Gia,Jaehyun Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework for zero-shot anomaly detection in 3D brain MRI, using multi-axis slices and 2D foundation models to create 3D patch tokens, achieving effective volumetric anomaly detection without supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending zero-shot anomaly detection to 3D medical images is challenging due to existing methods' reliance on slice-wise features, which fail to capture volumetric structure.

Method: The framework constructs localized volumetric tokens by aggregating multi-axis slices processed by 2D foundation models, integrating these with distance-based anomaly detection pipelines.

Result: The approach effectively extends zero-shot anomaly detection from 2D to 3D MRI volumes, providing compact 3D representations compatible with standard GPUs.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free method offers a simple and robust solution for volumetric anomaly detection in 3D brain MRI, without requiring fine-tuning or supervision.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) has gained increasing attention in medical imaging as a way to identify abnormalities without task-specific supervision, but most advances remain limited to 2D datasets. Extending ZSAD to 3D medical images has proven challenging, with existing methods relying on slice-wise features and vision-language models, which fail to capture volumetric structure. In this paper, we introduce a fully training-free framework for ZSAD in 3D brain MRI that constructs localized volumetric tokens by aggregating multi-axis slices processed by 2D foundation models. These 3D patch tokens restore cubic spatial context and integrate directly with distance-based, batch-level anomaly detection pipelines. The framework provides compact 3D representations that are practical to compute on standard GPUs and require no fine-tuning, prompts, or supervision. Our results show that training-free, batch-based ZSAD can be effectively extended from 2D encoders to full 3D MRI volumes, offering a simple and robust approach for volumetric anomaly detection.

### [11] [Sparrow: Text-Anchored Window Attention with Visual-Semantic Glimpsing for Speculative Decoding in Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15318)
*Libo Zhang,Zhaoning Zhang,Wangyang Hong,Peng Qiao,Dongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparrow accelerates Vid-LLMs inference by addressing visual redundancy and attention issues via hidden state reuse and intermediate-layer training, achieving a 2.82x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative decoding struggles with Vid-LLMs due to attention dilution and visual redundancy, prompting a need for efficient solutions.

Method: Sparrow uses visually-aware text-anchored attention and intermediate-layer training to filter noise and reuse hidden states.

Result: Achieves a 2.82x speedup with 25k visual tokens, resolving long-sequence performance issues.

Conclusion: Sparrow offers a practical, efficient solution for real-time Vid-LLMs tasks.

Abstract: Although speculative decoding is widely used to accelerate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) inference, it faces severe performance collapse when applied to Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs). The draft model typically falls into the trap of attention dilution and negative visual gain due to key-value cache explosion and context window mismatches. We observe a visual semantic internalization phenomenon in Vid-LLMs, indicating that critical visual semantics are implicitly encoded into text hidden states during deep-layer interactions, which renders raw visual inputs structurally redundant during deep inference. To address this, we propose the Sparrow framework, which first utilizes visually-aware text-anchored window attention via hidden state reuse to fully offload visual computation to the target model, and leverages intermediate-layer visual state bridging to train the draft model with semantic-rich intermediate states, thereby filtering out low-level visual noise. Additionally, a multi-token prediction strategy is introduced to bridge the training-inference distribution shift. Experiments show that Sparrow achieves an average speedup of 2.82x even with 25k visual tokens, effectively resolving the performance degradation in long sequences and offering a practical solution for real-time long video tasks.

*Siwei Wen,Zhangcheng Wang,Xingjian Zhang,Lei Huang,Wenjun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EventMemAgent is an active online video agent framework using hierarchical memory to balance long-range reasoning and fine-grained details in streaming videos, outperforming passive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The conflict between unbounded streaming media and the limited context window of MLLMs necessitates an active approach to online video understanding.

Method: Introduces EventMemAgent with short-term memory for event boundary detection and fixed-length buffering, and long-term memory for structured archiving. Uses Agentic RL for reasoning and tool-use.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on online video benchmarks.

Conclusion: EventMemAgent effectively addresses the challenges of online video understanding with its hierarchical memory and active processing framework.

Abstract: Online video understanding requires models to perform continuous perception and long-range reasoning within potentially infinite visual streams. Its fundamental challenge lies in the conflict between the unbounded nature of streaming media input and the limited context window of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods primarily rely on passive processing, which often face a trade-off between maintaining long-range context and capturing the fine-grained details necessary for complex tasks. To address this, we introduce EventMemAgent, an active online video agent framework based on a hierarchical memory module. Our framework employs a dual-layer strategy for online videos: short-term memory detects event boundaries and utilizes event-granular reservoir sampling to process streaming video frames within a fixed-length buffer dynamically; long-term memory structuredly archives past observations on an event-by-event basis. Furthermore, we integrate a multi-granular perception toolkit for active, iterative evidence capture and employ Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) to end-to-end internalize reasoning and tool-use strategies into the agent's intrinsic capabilities. Experiments show that EventMemAgent achieves competitive results on online video benchmarks. The code will be released here: https://github.com/lingcco/EventMemAgent.

*Joy Dhar,Nayyar Zaidi,Maryam Haghighat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MAIL and Robust-MAIL networks to address limitations in Multimodal Fusion Learning (MFL) for medical imaging, improving generalizability, computational efficiency, and adversarial robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MFL methods struggle with modality specialization, high computational costs, and adversarial vulnerabilities, limiting their reliability in medical applications.

Method: The MAIL network uses residual learning attention blocks and multimodal cross-attention modules. Robust-MAIL adds random projection filters and modulated attention noise for robustness.

Result: Evaluations on 20 datasets show MAIL and Robust-MAIL outperform competitors by up to 9.34%, reducing computational costs by 78.3%.

Conclusion: The proposed networks offer superior performance and reliability, making them viable for resource-limited and adversarial medical AI applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Fusion Learning (MFL), leveraging disparate data from various imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT, SPECT), has shown great potential for addressing medical problems such as skin cancer and brain tumor prediction. However, existing MFL methods face three key limitations: a) they often specialize in specific modalities, and overlook effective shared complementary information across diverse modalities, hence limiting their generalizability for multi-disease analysis; b) they rely on computationally expensive models, restricting their applicability in resource-limited settings; and c) they lack robustness against adversarial attacks, compromising reliability in medical AI applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multi-Attention Integration Learning (MAIL) network, incorporating two key components: a) an efficient residual learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific multi-scale patterns and b) an efficient multimodal cross-attention module for learning enriched complementary shared representations across diverse modalities. Furthermore, to ensure adversarial robustness, we extend MAIL network to design Robust-MAIL by incorporating random projection filters and modulated attention noise. Extensive evaluations on 20 public datasets show that both MAIL and Robust-MAIL outperform existing methods, achieving performance gains of up to 9.34% while reducing computational costs by up to 78.3%. These results highlight the superiority of our approaches, ensuring more reliable predictions than top competitors. Code: https://github.com/misti1203/MAIL-Robust-MAIL.

*Jinho Baek,Houwei Cao,Kate Blackwell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CREMD, a dataset analyzing how presentation modes and annotator traits affect dog emotion recognition, revealing insights on context, audio, and annotator demographics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving dog emotion recognition enhances human-animal interactions and veterinary care, but current methods lack standardization.

Method: CREMD uses 923 video clips presented in three modes, annotated by diverse participants to study factors influencing emotion recognition.

Result: Visual context improves agreement, audio effects are inconclusive, and annotator demographics (non-owners, males, professionals) influence reliability.

Conclusion: The study highlights the impact of context and annotator traits on dog emotion recognition, suggesting areas for future research.

Abstract: Dog emotion recognition plays a crucial role in enhancing human-animal interactions, veterinary care, and the development of automated systems for monitoring canine well-being. However, accurately interpreting dog emotions is challenging due to the subjective nature of emotional assessments and the absence of standardized ground truth methods. We present the CREMD (Crowd-sourced Emotional Multimodal Dogs Dataset), a comprehensive dataset exploring how different presentation modes (e.g., context, audio, video) and annotator characteristics (e.g., dog ownership, gender, professional experience) influence the perception and labeling of dog emotions. The dataset consists of 923 video clips presented in three distinct modes: without context or audio, with context but no audio, and with both context and audio. We analyze annotations from diverse participants, including dog owners, professionals, and individuals with varying demographic backgrounds and experience levels, to identify factors that influence reliable dog emotion recognition. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) while adding visual context significantly improved annotation agreement, our findings regarding audio cues are inconclusive due to design limitations (specifically, the absence of a no-context-with-audio condition and limited clean audio availability); (2) contrary to expectations, non-owners and male annotators showed higher agreement levels than dog owners and female annotators, respectively, while professionals showed higher agreement levels, aligned with our initial hypothesis; and (3) the presence of audio substantially increased annotators' confidence in identifying specific emotions, particularly anger and fear.

TL;DR: DAV-GSWT is a data-efficient framework combining diffusion priors and active view sampling to create high-fidelity Gaussian Splatting Wang Tiles from minimal input, reducing data dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of procedural methods like Wang Tiles, which rely on densely sampled exemplars, by developing a more efficient framework for photorealistic neural rendering.

Method: DAV-GSWT integrates hierarchical uncertainty quantification and generative diffusion models to autonomously select informative viewpoints and hallucinate missing structural details for seamless tile transitions.

Result: Experimental results show the system significantly reduces data requirements while maintaining visual integrity and interactive performance for large-scale environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances data efficiency in synthesizing high-fidelity Gaussian Splatting Wang Tiles, advancing photorealistic neural rendering capabilities.

Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has fundamentally redefined the capabilities of photorealistic neural rendering by enabling high-throughput synthesis of complex environments. While procedural methods like Wang Tiles have recently been integrated to facilitate the generation of expansive landscapes, these systems typically remain constrained by a reliance on densely sampled exemplar reconstructions. We present DAV-GSWT, a data-efficient framework that leverages diffusion priors and active view sampling to synthesize high-fidelity Gaussian Splatting Wang Tiles from minimal input observations. By integrating a hierarchical uncertainty quantification mechanism with generative diffusion models, our approach autonomously identifies the most informative viewpoints while hallucinating missing structural details to ensure seamless tile transitions. Experimental results indicate that our system significantly reduces the required data volume while maintaining the visual integrity and interactive performance necessary for large-scale virtual environments.

### [16] [GMAIL: Generative Modality Alignment for generated Image Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15368)
*Shentong Mo,Sukmin Yun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GMAIL, a framework to discriminatively use generated images by treating them as a separate modality from real images, leveraging cross-modality alignment to enhance vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address modality discrepancies between real and synthetic images and prevent mode collapse, enabling effective use of generative models for training.

Method: Proposes GMAIL, which fine-tunes models on generated images using cross-modality alignment loss and then trains vision-language models with aligned modalities.

Result: Improves performance on vision-language tasks like image captioning, retrieval, and classification, showing scalable benefits and enhancements in large models like LLaVA.

Conclusion: GMAIL effectively bridges synthetic and real modalities, boosting the utility of generated images in diverse vision-language applications.

Abstract: Generative models have made it possible to synthesize highly realistic images, potentially providing an abundant data source for training machine learning models. Despite the advantages of these synthesizable data sources, the indiscriminate use of generated images as real images for training can even cause mode collapse due to modality discrepancies between real and synthetic domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for discriminative use of generated images, coined GMAIL, that explicitly treats generated images as a separate modality from real images. Instead of indiscriminately replacing real images with generated ones in the pixel space, our approach bridges the two distinct modalities in the same latent space through a multi-modal learning approach. To be specific, we first fine-tune a model exclusively on generated images using a cross-modality alignment loss and then employ this aligned model to further train various vision-language models with generated images. By aligning the two modalities, our approach effectively leverages the benefits of recent advances in generative models, thereby boosting the effectiveness of generated image learning across a range of vision-language tasks. Our framework can be easily incorporated with various vision-language models, and we demonstrate its efficacy throughout extensive experiments. For example, our framework significantly improves performance on image captioning, zero-shot image retrieval, zero-shot image classification, and long caption retrieval tasks. It also shows positive generated data scaling trends and notable enhancements in the captioning performance of the large multimodal model, LLaVA.

*Shuwei Li,Lei Tan,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework detects and suppresses semantic hallucinations in day-to-night unpaired image translation, improving downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Day-to-night image translation faces challenges like large appearance shifts and lack of supervision, leading to harmful semantic hallucinations.

Method: Uses a dual-head discriminator for hallucination detection and class-specific prototypes to suppress hallucinations in feature space.

Result: Outperforms existing methods, with a 15.5% mAP improvement on BDD100K and a 31.7% gain for hallucination-prone classes like traffic lights.

Conclusion: The framework effectively preserves object semantics during translation, enhancing domain adaptation performance.

Abstract: Day-to-night unpaired image translation is important to downstream tasks but remains challenging due to large appearance shifts and the lack of direct pixel-level supervision. Existing methods often introduce semantic hallucinations, where objects from target classes such as traffic signs and vehicles, as well as man-made light effects, are incorrectly synthesized. These hallucinations significantly degrade downstream performance. We propose a novel framework that detects and suppresses hallucinations of target-class features during unpaired translation. To detect hallucination, we design a dual-head discriminator that additionally performs semantic segmentation to identify hallucinated content in background regions. To suppress these hallucinations, we introduce class-specific prototypes, constructed by aggregating features of annotated target-domain objects, which act as semantic anchors for each class. Built upon a Schrodinger Bridge-based translation model, our framework performs iterative refinement, where detected hallucination features are explicitly pushed away from class prototypes in feature space, thus preserving object semantics across the translation trajectory.Experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. On the BDD100K dataset, it improves mAP by 15.5% for day-to-night domain adaptation, with a notable 31.7% gain for classes such as traffic lights that are prone to hallucinations.

*Jeongwoo Shin,Jinhwan Sul,Joonseok Lee,Jaewong Choi,Jaemoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASBM improves diffusion models by learning optimal trajectories via a two-stage approach, enhancing stability, efficiency, and generation fidelity with fewer steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency and noise in diffusion models caused by uninformative forward processes, ASBM aims to recover optimal trajectories for better generative modeling.

Method: ASBM learns forward dynamics through a data-to-energy sampling perspective and backward dynamics with a matching loss, operating in a non-memoryless regime for straighter paths.

Result: ASBM scales well in high dimensions, improves stability, and achieves better image generation fidelity with fewer sampling steps.

Conclusion: ASBM offers a robust framework for generating high-quality samples efficiently, demonstrated by successful distillation to a one-step generator.

Abstract: Diffusion models often yield highly curved trajectories and noisy score targets due to an uninformative, memoryless forward process that induces independent data-noise coupling. We propose Adjoint Schrödinger Bridge Matching (ASBM), a generative modeling framework that recovers optimal trajectories in high dimensions via two stages. First, we view the Schrödinger Bridge (SB) forward dynamic as a coupling construction problem and learn it through a data-to-energy sampling perspective that transports data to an energy-defined prior. Then, we learn the backward generative dynamic with a simple matching loss supervised by the induced optimal coupling. By operating in a non-memoryless regime, ASBM produces significantly straighter and more efficient sampling paths. Compared to prior works, ASBM scales to high-dimensional data with notably improved stability and efficiency. Extensive experiments on image generation show that ASBM improves fidelity with fewer sampling steps. We further showcase the effectiveness of our optimal trajectory via distillation to a one-step generator.

*Marija Ivanovska,Vitomir Štruc*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for zero-shot face morphing attack detection (MAD), showing they outperform task-specific systems without fine-tuning. LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieves state-of-the-art results, suggesting MLLMs can detect morphing artifacts inherently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored potential of open-source MLLMs in biometric forensics, particularly for detecting face morphing attacks without task-specific training.

Method: Conducts a systematic zero-shot evaluation of MLLMs for MAD using public weights and a standardized protocol, testing across diverse morphing techniques.

Result: LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieves 23% lower equal error rate than task-specific MAD systems, demonstrating MLLMs' inherent forensic sensitivity.

Conclusion: Open-source MLLMs offer reproducible, interpretable, and competitive foundations for MAD and forensic image analysis, with potential for further improvement through targeted adaptation.

Abstract: Face morphing attacks threaten biometric verification, yet most morphing attack detection (MAD) systems require task-specific training and generalize poorly to unseen attack types. Meanwhile, open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong visual-linguistic reasoning, but their potential in biometric forensics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of open-source MLLMs for single-image MAD, using publicly available weights and a standardized, reproducible protocol. Across diverse morphing techniques, many MLLMs show non-trivial discriminative ability without any fine-tuning or domain adaptation, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing highly competitive task-specific MAD baselines by at least 23% in terms of equal error rate (EER). The results indicate that multimodal pretraining can implicitly encode fine-grained facial inconsistencies indicative of morphing artifacts, enabling zero-shot forensic sensitivity. Our findings position open-source MLLMs as reproducible, interpretable, and competitive foundations for biometric security and forensic image analysis. This emergent capability also highlights new opportunities to develop state-of-the-art MAD systems through targeted fine-tuning or lightweight adaptation, further improving accuracy and efficiency while preserving interpretability. To support future research, all code and evaluation protocols will be released upon publication.

*Youngwan Jin,Incheol Park,Yagiz Nalcakan,Hyeongjin Ju,Sanghyeop Yeo,Shiho Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RPT-SR, a novel Transformer-based model for infrared image super-resolution, leveraging regional priors to improve efficiency and performance in fixed-viewpoint scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing super-resolution models, including Vision Transformers, are inefficient for infrared imaging in fixed-viewpoint scenarios like surveillance, as they don't exploit persistent spatial priors.

Method: RPT-SR uses a dual-token framework combining regional prior tokens (for global scene structure) and local tokens (for frame-specific content) to dynamically modulate reconstruction.

Result: RPT-SR achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse infrared datasets, including Long-Wave (LWIR) and Short-Wave (SWIR) spectra.

Conclusion: The proposed RPT-SR effectively addresses inefficiencies in general-purpose super-resolution models by incorporating scene layout information, demonstrating broad applicability and superior performance in infrared imaging.

Abstract: General-purpose super-resolution models, particularly Vision Transformers, have achieved remarkable success but exhibit fundamental inefficiencies in common infrared imaging scenarios like surveillance and autonomous driving, which operate from fixed or nearly-static viewpoints. These models fail to exploit the strong, persistent spatial priors inherent in such scenes, leading to redundant learning and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Regional Prior attention Transformer for infrared image Super-Resolution (RPT-SR), a novel architecture that explicitly encodes scene layout information into the attention mechanism. Our core contribution is a dual-token framework that fuses (1) learnable, regional prior tokens, which act as a persistent memory for the scene's global structure, with (2) local tokens that capture the frame-specific content of the current input. By utilizing these tokens into an attention, our model allows the priors to dynamically modulate the local reconstruction process. Extensive experiments validate our approach. While most prior works focus on a single infrared band, we demonstrate the broad applicability and versatility of RPT-SR by establishing new state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets covering both Long-Wave (LWIR) and Short-Wave (SWIR) spectra

*Raffaele Cappelli,Matteo Ferrara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEADER is a lightweight, end-to-end neural network for minutiae extraction from raw fingerprint images, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and cross-domain generalization with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of truly end-to-end methods in fingerprint recognition by eliminating separate preprocessing and postprocessing steps, aiming for efficiency and accuracy.

Method: LEADER integrates non-maximum suppression and angular decoding, using a novel ground-truth encoding and dual-autoencoder structure with attention-gating.

Result: LEADER achieves a 34% higher F1-score on NIST SD27 and outperforms commercial software in computational efficiency (15ms on GPU, 322ms on CPU).

Conclusion: LEADER sets a new standard for end-to-end minutiae extraction with high accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, and its code is released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Minutiae extraction, a fundamental stage in fingerprint recognition, is increasingly shifting toward deep learning. However, truly end-to-end methods that eliminate separate preprocessing and postprocessing steps remain scarce. This paper introduces LEADER (Lightweight End-to-end Attention-gated Dual autoencodER), a neural network that maps raw fingerprint images to minutiae descriptors, including location, direction, and type. The proposed architecture integrates non-maximum suppression and angular decoding to enable complete end-to-end inference using only 0.9M parameters. It employs a novel "Castle-Moat-Rampart" ground-truth encoding and a dual-autoencoder structure, interconnected through an attention-gating mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on plain fingerprints and robust cross-domain generalization to latent impressions. Specifically, LEADER attains a 34% higher F1-score on the NIST SD27 dataset compared to specialized latent minutiae extractors. Sample-level analysis on this challenging benchmark reveals an average rank of 2.07 among all compared methods, with LEADER securing the first-place position in 47% of the samples-more than doubling the frequency of the second-best extractor. The internal representations learned by the model align with established fingerprint domain features, such as segmentation masks, orientation fields, frequency maps, and skeletons. Inference requires 15ms on GPU and 322ms on CPU, outperforming leading commercial software in computational efficiency. The source code and pre-trained weights are publicly released to facilitate reproducibility.

*Aditi Prabakaran,Priyesh Shukla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semantic filtering framework using vision-language models improves 3DGS reconstruction by removing transient objects with minimal memory overhead and real-time rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transient objects in multi-view captures cause ghosting artifacts in 3DGS, and existing solutions are memory-intensive or prone to parallax ambiguity.

Method: The proposed framework uses CLIP similarity scores to classify and prune Gaussians exceeding a threshold, resolving parallax ambiguity semantically.

Result: Experiments showed improved reconstruction quality over vanilla 3DGS with minimal memory cost and real-time performance.

Conclusion: Semantic guidance is validated as a practical strategy for transient removal in scenarios with predictable distractor categories.

Abstract: Transient objects in casual multi-view captures cause ghosting artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstruction. Existing solutions relied on scene decomposition at significant memory cost or on motion-based heuristics that were vulnerable to parallax ambiguity. A semantic filtering framework was proposed for category-aware transient removal using vision-language models. CLIP similarity scores between rendered views and distractor text prompts were accumulated per-Gaussian across training iterations. Gaussians exceeding a calibrated threshold underwent opacity regularization and periodic pruning. Unlike motion-based approaches, semantic classification resolved parallax ambiguity by identifying object categories independently of motion patterns. Experiments on the RobustNeRF benchmark demonstrated consistent improvement in reconstruction quality over vanilla 3DGS across four sequences, while maintaining minimal memory overhead and real-time rendering performance. Threshold calibration and comparisons with baselines validated semantic guidance as a practical strategy for transient removal in scenarios with predictable distractor categories.

*Aman Verma,Seshan Srirangarajan,Sumantra Dutta Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes advanced evaluation measures for biometric gesture scores, focusing on ranking order and relevance, and validates their effectiveness through extensive experimentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing biometric capacity estimation relies on error rates, which fail to assess score quality, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: The authors introduce evaluation measures considering rank deviation, score rewards for high/low-ranked gestures, trend correspondence, and disentanglement of identity features, combined into an advanced acceptance score.

Result: Experiments on three datasets with five SOTA models show the proposed measure selects more appropriate scores and correlates with existing measures.

Conclusion: The advanced acceptance score provides a holistic and reliable evaluation method for biometric gesture scores, outperforming existing measures.

Abstract: Quantifying biometric characteristics within hand gestures involve derivation of fitness scores from a gesture and identity aware feature space. However, evaluating the quality of these scores remains an open question. Existing biometric capacity estimation literature relies upon error rates. But these rates do not indicate goodness of scores. Thus, in this manuscript we present an exhaustive set of evaluation measures. We firstly identify ranking order and relevance of output scores as the primary basis for evaluation. In particular, we consider both rank deviation as well as rewards for: (i) higher scores of high ranked gestures and (ii) lower scores of low ranked gestures. We also compensate for correspondence between trends of output and ground truth scores. Finally, we account for disentanglement between identity features of gestures as a discounting factor. Integrating these elements with adequate weighting, we formulate advanced acceptance score as a holistic evaluation measure. To assess effectivity of the proposed we perform in-depth experimentation over three datasets with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Results show that the optimal score selected with our measure is more appropriate than existing other measures. Also, our proposed measure depicts correlation with existing measures. This further validates its reliability. We have made our \href{https://github.com/AmanVerma2307/MeasureSuite}{code} public.

*Qinglong Cao,Yuntian Chen,Chao Ma,Xiaokang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic training-free framework for fusing LoRA weights in generative models, improving subject-style synthesis by adapting weights during generation and refining trajectories with metric guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA fusion methods use static heuristics, deviating from LoRA's adaptive feature adjustment purpose and ignoring input randomness. This motivates a dynamic approach.

Method: The framework dynamically computes KL divergence for weight fusion during the forward pass and applies gradient-based corrections in the reverse denoising stage using metrics like CLIP and DINO scores.

Result: Experiments show the method outperforms state-of-the-art LoRA fusion techniques in generating coherent subject-style combinations, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic fusion framework achieves superior synthesis without retraining, leveraging feature-level selection and metric-guided latent adjustment throughout the diffusion process.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored the combination of multiple LoRAs to simultaneously generate user-specified subjects and styles. However, most existing approaches fuse LoRA weights using static statistical heuristics that deviate from LoRA's original purpose of learning adaptive feature adjustments and ignore the randomness of sampled inputs. To address this, we propose a dynamic training-free fusion framework that operates throughout the generation process. During the forward pass, at each LoRA-applied layer, we dynamically compute the KL divergence between the base model's original features and those produced by subject and style LoRAs, respectively, and adaptively select the most appropriate weights for fusion. In the reverse denoising stage, we further refine the generation trajectory by dynamically applying gradient-based corrections derived from objective metrics such as CLIP and DINO scores, providing continuous semantic and stylistic guidance. By integrating these two complementary mechanisms-feature-level selection and metric-guided latent adjustment-across the entire diffusion timeline, our method dynamically achieves coherent subject-style synthesis without any retraining. Extensive experiments across diverse subject-style combinations demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LoRA fusion methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: PADE is a training-free method that leverages internal Positive Attention Dynamics to improve visual grounding and reduce hallucinations in LVLMs by dynamically enhancing attention to core visual regions while maintaining instruction consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from hallucinations and attention sink issues despite their strong multimodal reasoning capabilities. Existing methods are computationally expensive or ineffective.

Method: PADE constructs a PAD map to identify core visual regions, uses Median Absolute Deviation Scaling for adaptive intervention, and employs System-Token Compensation for instruction consistency.

Result: Experiments show PADE enhances visual grounding and reduces hallucinations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks.

Conclusion: PADE effectively leverages internal attention dynamics for reliable multimodal reasoning without additional training.

Abstract: LVLMs have achieved strong multimodal reasoning capabilities but remain prone to hallucinations, producing outputs inconsistent with visual inputs or user instructions. Existing training-free methods, including contrastive decoding and auxiliary expert models, which incur several times more computational overhead and may introduce potential interference, as well as static internal signal enhancement, are often vulnerable to the attention sink phenomenon. We find that internal Positive Attention Dynamics (PAD) in LVLMs naturally reveal semantically core visual regions under the distortions of attention sinks. Based on this, we propose Positive Attention Dynamics Enhancement (PADE), a training-free attention intervention that constructs a PAD map to identify semantically core visual regions, applies per-head Median Absolute Deviation Scaling to adaptively control the intervention strength, and leverages System-Token Compensation to maintain attention to complex user instructions and support long-term output consistency. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that PADE improves visual grounding and reduces hallucinations, validating the effectiveness of leveraging internal attention dynamics for reliable multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Aligning functional schematics with 2D and 3D scene acquisitions is crucial for building digital twins, especially for old industrial facilities that lack native digital models. Current manual alignment using images and LiDAR data does not scale due to tediousness and complexity of industrial sites. Inconsistencies between schematics and reality, and the scarcity of public industrial datasets, make the problem both challenging and underexplored. This paper introduces IRIS-v2, a comprehensive dataset to support further research. It includes images, point clouds, 2D annotated boxes and segmentation masks, a CAD model, 3D pipe routing information, and the P&ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram). The alignment is experimented on a practical case study, aiming at reducing the time required for this task by combining segmentation and graph matching.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG (CEMRAG), a unified framework combining interpretable clinical concepts with multimodal RAG to improve Radiology Report Generation (RRG) in terms of interpretability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical adoption of RRG via VLMs is hindered by interpretability issues and factual inaccuracies. Existing methods treat interpretability and accuracy separately, lacking a unified approach.

Method: CEMRAG decomposes visual representations into clinical concepts and integrates them with multimodal RAG, using enriched contextual prompts for RRG.

Result: Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray datasets show CEMRAG outperforms conventional RAG and concept-only baselines in clinical accuracy and NLP metrics.

Conclusion: CEMRAG demonstrates that interpretability and performance can coexist in medical VLMs, offering a pathway to clinically trustworthy AI-assisted radiology.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) through Vision-Language Models (VLMs) promises to reduce documentation burden, improve reporting consistency, and accelerate clinical workflows. However, their clinical adoption remains limited by the lack of interpretability and the tendency to hallucinate findings misaligned with imaging evidence. Existing research typically treats interpretability and accuracy as separate objectives, with concept-based explainability techniques focusing primarily on transparency, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods targeting factual grounding through external retrieval. We present Concept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG (CEMRAG), a unified framework that decomposes visual representations into interpretable clinical concepts and integrates them with multimodal RAG. This approach exploits enriched contextual prompts for RRG, improving both interpretability and factual accuracy. Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray across multiple VLM architectures, training regimes, and retrieval configurations demonstrate consistent improvements over both conventional RAG and concept-only baselines on clinical accuracy metrics and standard NLP measures. These results challenge the assumed trade-off between interpretability and performance, showing that transparent visual concepts can enhance rather than compromise diagnostic accuracy in medical VLMs. Our modular design decomposes interpretability into visual transparency and structured language model conditioning, providing a principled pathway toward clinically trustworthy AI-assisted radiology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for assessing strawberry ripeness are subjective and error-prone, necessitating computer-assisted systems and standardized datasets for comparison.

Method: A dataset of 566 images with 1,201 labeled objects was created under varied conditions in Turkey and tested with YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLO11 models.

Result: YOLOv9c achieved the highest precision (90.94%), YOLO11s the highest recall (83.74%), and YOLOv8s the best mAP@50 (86.09%).

Conclusion: Smaller YOLO models perform efficiently on this dataset, providing a benchmark for smart agriculture applications.

Abstract: The strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa), known worldwide for its economic value and nutritional richness, is a widely cultivated fruit. Determining the correct ripeness level during the harvest period is crucial for both preventing losses for producers and ensuring consumers receive a quality product. However, traditional methods, i.e., visual assessments alone, can be subjective and have a high margin of error. Therefore, computer-assisted systems are needed. However, the scarcity of comprehensive datasets accessible to everyone in the literature makes it difficult to compare studies in this field. In this study, a new and publicly available strawberry ripeness dataset, consisting of 566 images and 1,201 labeled objects, prepared under variable light and environmental conditions in two different greenhouses in Turkey, is presented to the literature. Comparative tests conducted on the data set using YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLO11-based models showed that the highest precision value was 90.94% in the YOLOv9c model, while the highest recall value was 83.74% in the YOLO11s model. In terms of the general performance criterion mAP@50, YOLOv8s was the best performing model with a success rate of 86.09%. The results show that small and medium-sized models work more balanced and efficiently on this type of dataset, while also establishing a fundamental reference point for smart agriculture applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 3D data Analysis Optimization Pipeline using Bayesian Optimization to streamline segmentation and classification model selection and parameter tuning for biomedical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual analysis of 3D biomedical imaging is impractical, and existing methods face challenges in model selection and parameter tuning.

Method: The pipeline employs two Bayesian Optimization stages: one for segmentation model selection and postprocessing optimization using a benchmark dataset, and another for classifier design choices. It includes an assisted annotation workflow to reduce manual effort.

Result: In four case studies, the pipeline successfully identifies optimal model and parameter configurations for specific datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline efficiently addresses bottlenecks in 3D biomedical imaging analysis by automating model and parameter selection.

Abstract: Deep learning-based segmentation and classification are crucial to large-scale biomedical imaging, particularly for 3D data, where manual analysis is impractical. Although many methods exist, selecting suitable models and tuning parameters remains a major bottleneck in practice. Hence, we introduce the 3D data Analysis Optimization Pipeline, a method designed to facilitate the design and parameterization of segmentation and classification using two Bayesian Optimization stages. First, the pipeline selects a segmentation model and optimizes postprocessing parameters using a domain-adapted syntactic benchmark dataset. To ensure a concise evaluation of segmentation performance, we introduce a segmentation quality metric that serves as the objective function. Second, the pipeline optimizes design choices of a classifier, such as encoder and classifier head architectures, incorporation of prior knowledge, and pretraining strategies. To reduce manual annotation effort, this stage includes an assisted class-annotation workflow that extracts predicted instances from the segmentation results and sequentially presents them to the operator, eliminating the need for manual tracking. In four case studies, the 3D data Analysis Optimization Pipeline efficiently identifies effective model and parameter configurations for individual datasets.

TL;DR: The paper argues for shifting from a semantics-first to a criteria-first approach in image-based science to improve reproducibility, cross-domain comparability, and adaptability to evolving ontologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantics-first approaches fail in open-ended discovery, cross-domain comparability, and long-term monitoring due to label drift and inflexibility.

Method: Introduces a unified framework for criteria-first structure discovery, separating structure extraction from semantic mapping.

Result: Criteria-first approaches yield stable, reproducible structures and allow flexible semantic mapping downstream.

Conclusion: Criteria-first methods enhance reproducibility and adaptability in image-based sciences, supporting long-term monitoring and plural interpretations.

Abstract: Across the natural and life sciences, images have become a primary measurement modality, yet the dominant analytic paradigm remains semantics-first. Structure is recovered by predicting or enforcing domain-specific labels. This paradigm fails systematically under the conditions that make image-based science most valuable, including open-ended scientific discovery, cross-sensor and cross-site comparability, and long-term monitoring in which domain ontologies and associated label sets drift culturally, institutionally, and ecologically. A deductive inversion is proposed in the form of criteria-first and semantics-later. A unified framework for criteria-first structure discovery is introduced. It separates criterion-defined, semantics-free structure extraction from downstream semantic mapping into domain ontologies or vocabularies and provides a domain-general scaffold for reproducible analysis across image-based sciences. Reproducible science requires that the first analytic layer perform criterion-driven, semantics-free structure discovery, yielding stable partitions, structural fields, or hierarchies defined by explicit optimality criteria rather than local domain ontologies. Semantics is not discarded; it is relocated downstream as an explicit mapping from the discovered structural product to a domain ontology or vocabulary, enabling plural interpretations and explicit crosswalks without rewriting upstream extraction. Grounded in cybernetics, observation-as-distinction, and information theory's separation of information from meaning, the argument is supported by cross-domain evidence showing that criteria-first components recur whenever labels do not scale. Finally, consequences are outlined for validation beyond class accuracy and for treating structural products as FAIR, AI-ready digital objects for long-term monitoring and digital twins.

*Hyunchan Moon,Cheonjun Park,Steven L. Waslander*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToaSt is a decoupled framework for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that uses specialized strategies for different components, improving efficiency and accuracy while avoiding common pitfalls like retraining time and global propagation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational costs of ViTs hinder their deployment, and existing solutions like structured pruning and token compression have drawbacks such as prolonged retraining and optimization challenges.

Method: ToaSt employs head-wise structured pruning for Multi-Head Self-Attention modules and Token Channel Selection (TCS) for Feed-Forward Networks, enhancing robustness and compression ratios.

Result: ToaSt achieves superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, outperforming baselines, with 88.52% accuracy (+1.64%) and 39.4% FLOPs reduction on ViT-MAE-Huge. It also transfers well to downstream tasks.

Conclusion: ToaSt effectively addresses computational inefficiencies in ViTs with specialized strategies, offering better performance and practicality for vision tasks.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success across various vision tasks, yet their deployment is often hindered by prohibitive computational costs. While structured weight pruning and token compression have emerged as promising solutions, they suffer from prolonged retraining times and global propagation that creates optimization challenges, respectively. We propose ToaSt, a decoupled framework applying specialized strategies to distinct ViT components. We apply coupled head-wise structured pruning to Multi-Head Self-Attention modules, leveraging attention operation characteristics to enhance robustness. For Feed-Forward Networks (over 60\% of FLOPs), we introduce Token Channel Selection (TCS) that enhances compression ratios while avoiding global propagation issues. Our analysis reveals TCS effectively filters redundant noise during selection. Extensive evaluations across nine diverse models, including DeiT, ViT-MAE, and Swin Transformer, demonstrate that ToaSt achieves superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, consistently outperforming existing baselines. On ViT-MAE-Huge, ToaSt achieves 88.52\% accuracy (+1.64 \%) with 39.4\% FLOPs reduction. ToaSt transfers effectively to downstream tasks, cccccachieving 52.2 versus 51.9 mAP on COCO object detection. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

*Shutian Gu,Chengkai Huang,Ruoyu Wang,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A retrieval-augmented framework boosts LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation by improving efficiency and stability without modifying the LLM, using instruction-level and step-level retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficient decision-making in prompt-based LLM navigation for VLN tasks, where repeated instruction interpretation and noisy candidate handling degrade performance.

Method: Introduces two lightweight retrieval modules: an instruction-level embedding retriever for task-specific priors and an imitation-learned candidate retriever to prune irrelevant directions.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements in Success Rate, Oracle Success Rate, and SPL on the R2R benchmark for both seen and unseen environments.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented decision support is effective and scalable for enhancing LLM-based VLN, providing complementary benefits for global guidance and step-wise efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to follow natural-language instructions and navigate through previously unseen environments. Recent approaches increasingly employ large language models (LLMs) as high-level navigators due to their flexibility and reasoning capability. However, prompt-based LLM navigation often suffers from inefficient decision-making, as the model must repeatedly interpret instructions from scratch and reason over noisy and verbose navigable candidates at each step. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented framework to improve the efficiency and stability of LLM-based VLN without modifying or fine-tuning the underlying language model. Our approach introduces retrieval at two complementary levels. At the episode level, an instruction-level embedding retriever selects semantically similar successful navigation trajectories as in-context exemplars, providing task-specific priors for instruction grounding. At the step level, an imitation-learned candidate retriever prunes irrelevant navigable directions before LLM inference, reducing action ambiguity and prompt complexity. Both retrieval modules are lightweight, modular, and trained independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method on the Room-to-Room (R2R) benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in Success Rate, Oracle Success Rate, and SPL on both seen and unseen environments. Ablation studies further show that instruction-level exemplar retrieval and candidate pruning contribute complementary benefits to global guidance and step-wise decision efficiency. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented decision support is an effective and scalable strategy for enhancing LLM-based vision-and-language navigation.

### [34] [Language and Geometry Grounded Sparse Voxel Representations for Holistic Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15734)
*Guile Wu,David Huang,Bingbing Liu,Dongfeng Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified 3D scene understanding approach using sparse voxel representations to synergize appearance, semantics, and geometry, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on transferring 2D language features to 3D but neglect the interplay between scene appearance, semantics, and geometry, leading to decoupled understanding.

Method: The approach uses sparse voxels with appearance, density, feature, and confidence fields. It integrates a feature modulation module and distills 2D language features and geometric knowledge into the 3D model via depth and pattern regularization.

Result: The method achieves superior performance in holistic scene understanding and reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The unified framework effectively synergizes appearance, semantics, and geometry, enhancing 3D scene understanding and reconstruction.

Abstract: Existing 3D open-vocabulary scene understanding methods mostly emphasize distilling language features from 2D foundation models into 3D feature fields, but largely overlook the synergy among scene appearance, semantics, and geometry. As a result, scene understanding often deviates from the underlying geometric structure of scenes and becomes decoupled from the reconstruction process. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages language and geometry grounded sparse voxel representations to comprehensively model appearance, semantics, and geometry within a unified framework. Specifically, we use 3D sparse voxels as primitives and employ an appearance field, a density field, a feature field, and a confidence field to holistically represent a 3D scene. To promote synergy among the appearance, density, and feature fields, we construct a feature modulation module and distill language features from a 2D foundation model into our 3D scene model. In addition, we integrate geometric distillation into feature field distillation to transfer geometric knowledge from a geometry foundation model to our 3D scene representations via depth correlation regularization and pattern consistency regularization. These components work together to synergistically model the appearance, semantics, and geometry of the 3D scene within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior overall performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in holistic scene understanding and reconstruction.

TL;DR: RaCo is a lightweight neural network for robust keypoint detection in 3D vision tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance without needing paired images or complex architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a simple yet effective keypoint detector adaptable to various 3D vision tasks without requiring covisible image pairs or costly equivariant networks.

Method: RaCo combines a repeatable keypoint detector, differentiable ranker for match optimization, and covariance estimator for uncertainty quantification, trained solely on perspective image crops.

Result: RaCo excels in keypoint repeatability and matching under large rotations, outperforming existing methods on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: RaCo offers a practical solution for robust keypoint detection with minimal computational and labeling overhead.

Abstract: This paper introduces RaCo, a lightweight neural network designed to learn robust and versatile keypoints suitable for a variety of 3D computer vision tasks. The model integrates three key components: the repeatable keypoint detector, a differentiable ranker to maximize matches with a limited number of keypoints, and a covariance estimator to quantify spatial uncertainty in metric scale. Trained on perspective image crops only, RaCo operates without the need for covisible image pairs. It achieves strong rotational robustness through extensive data augmentation, even without the use of computationally expensive equivariant network architectures. The method is evaluated on several challenging datasets, where it demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in keypoint repeatability and two-view matching, particularly under large in-plane rotations. Ultimately, RaCo provides an effective and simple strategy to independently estimate keypoint ranking and metric covariance without additional labels, detecting interpretable and repeatable interest points.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R3 framework mitigates the trade-off between generative capabilities and understanding in multimodal models by dividing generation into steps of generate-understand-regenerate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the competitive dynamic between generation and understanding in multimodal models, which often hinders performance improvements.

Method: Introduces the Reason-Reflect-Refine (R3) framework, turning single-step generation into a multi-step process involving understanding during regeneration.

Result: Achieves stronger generation results and improved understanding ability, resolving the optimization dilemma.

Conclusion: The R3 framework provides insights for developing next-generation unified multimodal models.

Abstract: Current research in multimodal models faces a key challenge where enhancing generative capabilities often comes at the expense of understanding, and vice versa. We analyzed this trade-off and identify the primary cause might be the potential conflict between generation and understanding, which creates a competitive dynamic within the model. To address this, we propose the Reason-Reflect-Refine (R3) framework. This innovative algorithm re-frames the single-step generation task into a multi-step process of "generate-understand-regenerate". By explicitly leveraging the model's understanding capability during generation, we successfully mitigate the optimization dilemma, achieved stronger generation results and improved understanding ability which are related to the generation process. This offers valuable insights for designing next-generation unified multimodal models. Code is available at https://github.com/sen-ye/R3.

TL;DR: NeRFscopy is a self-supervised pipeline for 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis in endoscopic videos, addressing challenges like tissue deformability and monocular camera limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing endoscopic visualization and accuracy for diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical guidance despite challenges like tissue deformability and illumination changes.

Method: NeRFscopy combines a deformable model with a canonical radiance field and SE(3) transformations, using self-supervised learning from monocular video data.

Result: NeRFscopy outperforms competing methods in novel view synthesis across challenging endoscopic scenes.

Conclusion: NeRFscopy offers a robust solution for dynamic 3D reconstruction in endoscopy, improving diagnostic and surgical outcomes.

Abstract: Endoscopy is essential in medical imaging, used for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Developing a robust dynamic 3D reconstruction pipeline for endoscopic videos could enhance visualization, improve diagnostic accuracy, aid in treatment planning, and guide surgery procedures. However, challenges arise due to the deformable nature of the tissues, the use of monocular cameras, illumination changes, occlusions and unknown camera trajectories. Inspired by neural rendering, we introduce NeRFscopy, a self-supervised pipeline for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction of deformable endoscopic tissues from a monocular video. NeRFscopy includes a deformable model with a canonical radiance field and a time-dependent deformation field parameterized by SE(3) transformations. In addition, the color images are efficiently exploited by introducing sophisticated terms to learn a 3D implicit model without assuming any template or pre-trained model, solely from data. NeRFscopy achieves accurate results in terms of novel view synthesis, outperforming competing methods across various challenging endoscopy scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining sky images, photovoltaic energy history, and meteorological data improves solar energy forecasting accuracy, especially for cloudy days and ramp events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address variability in photovoltaic energy production and improve forecasting accuracy for better power grid operation and solar variability management.

Method: Deep neural models integrating sky images, photovoltaic energy history, meteorological data (e.g., surface long-wave radiation, wind), and solar position analysis.

Result: Incorporating meteorological data enhances nowcasting and forecasting, particularly on cloudy days, improving prediction robustness.

Conclusion: Integrating diverse data sources boosts solar energy prediction reliability and interpretability.

Abstract: Due to the rise in the use of renewable energies as an alternative to traditional ones, and especially solar energy, there is increasing interest in studying how to address photovoltaic forecasting in the face of the challenge of variability in photovoltaic energy production, using different methodologies. This work develops a hybrid approach for short and long-term forecasting based on two studies with the same purpose. A multimodal approach that combines images of the sky and photovoltaic energy history with meteorological data is proposed. The main goal is to improve the accuracy of ramp event prediction, increase the robustness of forecasts in cloudy conditions, and extend capabilities beyond nowcasting, to support more efficient operation of the power grid and better management of solar variability. Deep neural models are used for both nowcasting and forecasting solutions, incorporating individual and multiple meteorological variables, as well as an analytical solar position. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of meteorological data, particularly the surface long-wave, radiation downwards, and the combination of wind and solar position, significantly improves current predictions in both nowcasting and forecasting tasks, especially on cloudy days. This study highlights the importance of integrating diverse data sources to improve the reliability and interpretability of solar energy prediction models.

*Lucas Sancéré,Noémie Moreau,Katarzyna Bozek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Graph Transformers outperform image-based methods in classifying healthy and tumor epithelial cells in cSCC by leveraging full-WSI cell graphs and cellular context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSIs contain rich diagnostic information, but existing deep learning methods relying on patch-based representations lose vital tissue-level context. A graph-based approach is proposed to retain this context.

Method: Proposed scalable Graph Transformers (SGFormer and DIFFormer) on full-WSI cell graphs for classification, comparing them with image-based methods using morphological, texture features, and non-epithelial cell context.

Result: Graph Transformers achieved higher balanced accuracies (SGFormer: 85.2 ± 1.5, DIFFormer: 85.1 ± 2.5) vs. image-based methods (best: 81.2 ± 3.0) on single WSI. DIFFormer also outperformed (83.6 ± 1.9) state-of-the-art image-based models (78.1 ± 0.5) on multi-WSI tasks.

Conclusion: Graph-based methods leveraging cellular context outperform image-based approaches in challenging cell classification tasks, highlighting the importance of tissue-level information.

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) from cancer patients contain rich information that can be used for medical diagnosis or to follow treatment progress. To automate their analysis, numerous deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks and Vision Transformers have been developed and have achieved strong performance in segmentation and classification tasks. However, due to the large size and complex cellular organization of WSIs, these models rely on patch-based representations, losing vital tissue-level context. We propose using scalable Graph Transformers on a full-WSI cell graph for classification. We evaluate this methodology on a challenging task: the classification of healthy versus tumor epithelial cells in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), where both cell types exhibit very similar morphologies and are therefore difficult to differentiate for image-based approaches. We first compared image-based and graph-based methods on a single WSI. Graph Transformer models SGFormer and DIFFormer achieved balanced accuracies of $85.2 \pm 1.5$ ($\pm$ standard error) and $85.1 \pm 2.5$ in 3-fold cross-validation, respectively, whereas the best image-based method reached $81.2 \pm 3.0$. By evaluating several node feature configurations, we found that the most informative representation combined morphological and texture features as well as the cell classes of non-epithelial cells, highlighting the importance of the surrounding cellular context. We then extended our work to train on several WSIs from several patients. To address the computational constraints of image-based models, we extracted four $2560 \times 2560$ pixel patches from each image and converted them into graphs. In this setting, DIFFormer achieved a balanced accuracy of $83.6 \pm 1.9$ (3-fold cross-validation), while the state-of-the-art image-based model CellViT256 reached $78.1 \pm 0.5$.

*Muthu Subash Kavitha,Anas Zafar,Amgad Muneer,Jia Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARL-XRay introduces a continual learning strategy for chest radiograph classification using lightweight adapters and task-specific heads, achieving robust performance without retraining on old data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable clinical deployment of chest radiograph classifiers that can adapt to new datasets without retraining on old data or degrading performance.

Method: Uses a fixed backbone with task-specific adapters, a latent task selector, and feature-level replay for stable task identification and adaptation.

Result: Outperforms joint training with 75.0% routing accuracy and maintains diagnostic performance (AUROC 0.74-0.75) using fewer parameters.

Conclusion: CARL-XRay is a practical solution for continual clinical deployment, avoiding full retraining while retaining performance.

Abstract: Clinical deployment of chest radiograph classifiers requires models that can be updated as new datasets become available without retraining on previously ob- served data or degrading validated performance. We study, for the first time, a task-incremental continual learning setting for chest radiograph classification, in which heterogeneous chest X-ray datasets arrive sequentially and task identifiers are unavailable at inference. We propose a continual adapter-based routing learning strategy for Chest X-rays (CARL-XRay) that maintains a fixed high-capacity backbone and incrementally allocates lightweight task-specific adapters and classifier heads. A latent task selector operates on task-adapted features and leverages both current and historical context preserved through compact prototypes and feature-level experience replay. This design supports stable task identification and adaptation across sequential updates while avoiding raw-image storage. Experiments on large-scale public chest radiograph datasets demonstrate robust performance retention and reliable task-aware inference under continual dataset ingestion. CARL-XRay outperforms joint training under task-unknown deployment, achieving higher routing accuracy (75.0\% vs.\ 62.5\%), while maintaining competitive diagnostic performance with AUROC of 0.74 in the oracle setting with ground-truth task identity and 0.75 under task-unknown inference, using significantly fewer trainable parameters. Finally, the proposed framework provides a practical alternative to joint training and repeated full retraining in continual clinical deployment.

*Hui Ren,Yuval Alaluf,Omer Bar Tal,Alexander Schwing,Antonio Torralba,Yael Vinker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for sequential sketch generation combines large language models (LLMs) and video diffusion models to leverage temporal structure in sketches, achieving high-quality results with minimal human-drawn data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models treat sketches as static images, ignoring the sequential nature of sketching, which limits their ability to capture creative drawing processes.

Method: The approach adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models, using LLMs for semantic planning and stroke ordering, and video diffusion models for rendering. A two-stage fine-tuning strategy decouples stroke ordering (learned from synthetic shapes) and visual appearance (distilled from few human sketches).

Result: The method generates high-quality sequential sketches adhering to text-specified orderings with rich visual detail, despite minimal human-drawn training data.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges temporal and structural aspects of sketching, offering flexibility for extensions like brush style conditioning and interactive drawing.

Abstract: Sketching is inherently a sequential process, in which strokes are drawn in a meaningful order to explore and refine ideas. However, most generative models treat sketches as static images, overlooking the temporal structure that underlies creative drawing. We present a data-efficient approach for sequential sketch generation that adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to generate sketching processes. Our key insight is that large language models and video diffusion models offer complementary strengths for this task: LLMs provide semantic planning and stroke ordering, while video diffusion models serve as strong renderers that produce high-quality, temporally coherent visuals. We leverage this by representing sketches as short videos in which strokes are progressively drawn on a blank canvas, guided by text-specified ordering instructions. We introduce a two-stage fine-tuning strategy that decouples the learning of stroke ordering from the learning of sketch appearance. Stroke ordering is learned using synthetic shape compositions with controlled temporal structure, while visual appearance is distilled from as few as seven manually authored sketching processes that capture both global drawing order and the continuous formation of individual strokes. Despite the extremely limited amount of human-drawn sketch data, our method generates high-quality sequential sketches that closely follow text-specified orderings while exhibiting rich visual detail. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach through extensions such as brush style conditioning and autoregressive sketch generation, enabling additional controllability and interactive, collaborative drawing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EduResearchBench is a new platform for evaluating LLMs in educational academic writing, using a hierarchical task decomposition framework and curriculum learning to improve performance over general-purpose models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs in scholarly writing are insufficient for complex academic workflows, prompting the need for a fine-grained evaluation platform.

Method: Introduced EduResearchBench with a Hierarchical Atomic Task Decomposition (HATD) framework, decomposing research workflows into 24 atomic tasks. Used curriculum learning and 55K academic samples to train EduWrite.

Result: EduWrite (30B) outperformed larger general-purpose models (72B) on core metrics, showing the importance of data quality and staged training over parameter scale.

Conclusion: Specialized models with structured frameworks and curriculum learning can outperform larger general-purpose models in vertical domains like educational scholarly writing.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping the paradigm of AI for Social Science (AI4SS), rigorously evaluating their capabilities in scholarly writing remains a major challenge. Existing benchmarks largely emphasize single-shot, monolithic generation and thus lack the fine-grained assessments required to reflect complex academic research workflows. To fill this gap, we introduce EduResearchBench, the first comprehensive evaluation platform dedicated to educational academic writing. EduResearchBench is built upon our Hierarchical Atomic Task Decomposition (HATD) framework, which decomposes an end-to-end research workflow into six specialized research modules (e.g., Quantitative Analysis, Qualitative Research, and Policy Research) spanning 24 fine-grained atomic tasks. This taxonomy enables an automated evaluation pipeline that mitigates a key limitation of holistic scoring, where aggregate scores often obscure specific capability bottlenecks, and instead provides fine-grained, diagnostic feedback on concrete deficiencies. Moreover, recognizing the high cognitive load inherent in scholarly writing, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that progressively builds competence from foundational skills to complex methodological reasoning and argumentation. Leveraging 55K raw academic samples, we curate 11K high-quality instruction pairs to train EduWrite, a specialized educational scholarly writing model. Experiments show that EduWrite (30B) substantially outperforms larger general-purpose models (72B) on multiple core metrics, demonstrating that in vertical domains, data quality density and hierarchically staged training curricula are more decisive than parameter scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of interpretability tools tailored for Indian languages in multilingual LLMs.

Method: Introduces Indic-TunedLens, which adjusts hidden states for each target language using affine transformations.

Result: Significantly outperforms SOTA interpretability methods on 10 Indian languages, especially for low-resource ones.

Conclusion: Provides insights into multilingual transformers' semantic encoding, enhancing interpretability for diverse languages.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in linguistically diverse regions like India, yet most interpretability tools remain tailored to English. Prior work reveals that LLMs often operate in English centric representation spaces, making cross lingual interpretability a pressing concern. We introduce Indic-TunedLens, a novel interpretability framework specifically for Indian languages that learns shared affine transformations. Unlike the standard Logit Lens, which directly decodes intermediate activations, Indic-TunedLens adjusts hidden states for each target language, aligning them with the target output distributions to enable more faithful decoding of model representations. We evaluate our framework on 10 Indian languages using the MMLU benchmark and find that it significantly improves over SOTA interpretability methods, especially for morphologically rich, low resource languages. Our results provide crucial insights into the layer-wise semantic encoding of multilingual transformers. Our model is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/AnonymousAccountACL/IndicTunedLens.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CGRA DeBERTa, a concept-guided transformer framework addressing challenges in QA over Islamic texts, outperforming BERT and DeBERTa with enhanced theological precision and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate QA for classical Islamic texts is difficult due to domain-specific semantics and contextual dependencies, necessitating a tailored solution.

Method: CGRA DeBERTa combines a DeBERTa backbone with LoRA adaptations, a residual concept-aware gating mechanism, and an Islamic Concept Dictionary for theological priors.

Result: CGRA DeBERTa achieved an EM score of 97.85, surpassing BERT (75.87) and DeBERTa (89.77), with minimal added inference overhead.

Conclusion: The framework provides efficient, interpretable, and accurate Hadith QA, enhancing educational materials with theological nuance.

Abstract: Accurate QA over classical Islamic texts remains challenging due to domain specific semantics, long context dependencies, and concept sensitive reasoning. Therefore, a new CGRA DeBERTa, a concept guided residual domain augmentation transformer framework, is proposed that enhances theological QA over Hadith corpora. The CGRA DeBERTa builds on a customized DeBERTa transformer backbone with lightweight LoRA based adaptations and a residual concept aware gating mechanism. The customized DeBERTa embedding block learns global and positional context, while Concept Guided Residual Blocks incorporate theological priors from a curated Islamic Concept Dictionary of 12 core terms. Moreover, the Concept Gating Mechanism selectively amplifies semantically critical tokens via importance weighted attention, applying differential scaling from 1.04 to 3.00. This design preserves contextual integrity, strengthens domain-specific semantic representations, and enables accurate, efficient span extraction while maintaining computational efficiency. This paper reports the results of training CGRA using a specially constructed dataset of 42591 QA pairs from the text of Sahih alBukhari and Sahih Muslim. While BERT achieved an EM score of 75.87 and DeBERTa one of 89.77, our model scored 97.85 and thus surpassed them by 8.08 on an absolute scale, all while adding approximately 8 inference overhead due to parameter efficient gating. The qualitative evaluation noted better extraction and discrimination and theological precision. This study presents Hadith QA systems that are efficient, interpretable, and accurate and that scale provide educational materials with necessary theological nuance.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our 3rd place system in the AVerImaTeC shared task, which combines our last year's retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline with a reverse image search (RIS) module. Despite its simplicity, our system delivers competitive performance with a single multimodal LLM call per fact-check at just $0.013 on average using GPT5.1 via OpenAI Batch API. Our system is also easy to reproduce and tweak, consisting of only three decoupled modules - a textual retrieval module based on similarity search, an image retrieval module based on API-accessed RIS, and a generation module using GPT5.1 - which is why we suggest it as an accesible starting point for further experimentation.

Abstract: Tool-calling is essential for Large Language Model (LLM) agents to complete real-world tasks. While most existing benchmarks assume simple, perfectly documented tools, real-world tools (e.g., general "search" APIs) are often opaque, lacking clear best practices or failure modes. Can LLM agents improve their performance in environments with opaque tools by interacting and subsequently improving documentation? To study this, we create OpaqueToolsBench, a benchmark consisting of three distinct task-oriented environments: general function calling, interactive chess playing, and long-trajectory agentic search. Each environment provides underspecified tools that models must learn to use effectively to complete the task. Results on OpaqueToolsBench suggest existing methods for automatically documenting tools are expensive and unreliable when tools are opaque. To address this, we propose a simple framework, ToolObserver, that iteratively refines tool documentation by observing execution feedback from tool-calling trajectories. Our approach outperforms existing methods on OpaqueToolsBench across datasets, even in relatively hard settings. Furthermore, for test-time tool exploration settings, our method is also efficient, consuming 3.5-7.5x fewer total tokens than the best baseline.

### [47] [Extracting Consumer Insight from Text: A Large Language Model Approach to Emotion and Evaluation Measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15312)
*Stephan Ludwig,Peter J. Danaher,Xiaohao Yang,Yu-Ting Lin,Ehsan Abedin,Dhruv Grewal,Lan Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Linguistic eXtractor (LX), a fine-tuned language model for measuring consumer emotions and evaluations from text, outperforming leading models and demonstrating practical applications in marketing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately measuring consumer emotions and evaluations from unstructured text in marketing research and practice.

Method: Developed LX, a large language model fine-tuned on labeled consumer-authored text, tested against models like GPT-4 Turbo, RoBERTa, and DeepSeek.

Result: LX achieved 81% macro-F1 accuracy on survey responses and >95% accuracy on third-party-annotated reviews, with validated applications predicting purchase behavior.

Conclusion: LX provides a scalable, accurate tool for measuring consumer perceptions, advancing marketing research with direct applications in understanding emotional impacts on behavior.

Abstract: Accurately measuring consumer emotions and evaluations from unstructured text remains a core challenge for marketing research and practice. This study introduces the Linguistic eXtractor (LX), a fine-tuned, large language model trained on consumer-authored text that also has been labeled with consumers' self-reported ratings of 16 consumption-related emotions and four evaluation constructs: trust, commitment, recommendation, and sentiment. LX consistently outperforms leading models, including GPT-4 Turbo, RoBERTa, and DeepSeek, achieving 81% macro-F1 accuracy on open-ended survey responses and greater than 95% accuracy on third-party-annotated Amazon and Yelp reviews. An application of LX to online retail data, using seemingly unrelated regression, affirms that review-expressed emotions predict product ratings, which in turn predict purchase behavior. Most emotional effects are mediated by product ratings, though some emotions, such as discontent and peacefulness, influence purchase directly, indicating that emotional tone provides meaningful signals beyond star ratings. To support its use, a no-code, cost-free, LX web application is available, enabling scalable analyses of consumer-authored text. In establishing a new methodological foundation for consumer perception measurement, this research demonstrates new methods for leveraging large language models to advance marketing research and practice, thereby achieving validated detection of marketing constructs from consumer data.

*Zihao Tang,Xin Yu,Ziyu Xiao,Zengxuan Wen,Zelin Li,Jiaxi Zhou,Hualei Wang,Haohua Wang,Haizhen Huang,Weiwei Deng,Feng Sun,Qi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mnemis integrates System-1 similarity search with System-2 global reasoning for memory retrieval, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory retrieval methods like RAG and Graph-RAG rely on similarity-based mechanisms, which are limited in scenarios requiring global reasoning or comprehensive coverage of all relevant information.

Method: Mnemis combines System-1 similarity search (base graph) with a System-2 mechanism (Global Selection using a hierarchical graph) for top-down, deliberate traversal over semantic hierarchies.

Result: Mnemis achieves state-of-the-art performance, scoring 93.9 on LoCoMo and 91.6 on LongMemEval-S benchmarks using GPT-4.1-mini.

Conclusion: The integration of System-1 and System-2 mechanisms in Mnemis enhances memory retrieval by ensuring semantic and structural relevance, setting a new benchmark in memory frameworks for LLMs.

Abstract: AI Memory, specifically how models organizes and retrieves historical messages, becomes increasingly valuable to Large Language Models (LLMs), yet existing methods (RAG and Graph-RAG) primarily retrieve memory through similarity-based mechanisms. While efficient, such System-1-style retrieval struggles with scenarios that require global reasoning or comprehensive coverage of all relevant information. In this work, We propose Mnemis, a novel memory framework that integrates System-1 similarity search with a complementary System-2 mechanism, termed Global Selection. Mnemis organizes memory into a base graph for similarity retrieval and a hierarchical graph that enables top-down, deliberate traversal over semantic hierarchies. By combining the complementary strength from both retrieval routes, Mnemis retrieves memory items that are both semantically and structurally relevant. Mnemis achieves state-of-the-art performance across all compared methods on long-term memory benchmarks, scoring 93.9 on LoCoMo and 91.6 on LongMemEval-S using GPT-4.1-mini.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeuroSymActive combines neural-symbolic reasoning with active exploration for efficient and accurate Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA), outperforming retrieval-augmented baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large pretrained models struggle with knowledge-intensive queries requiring structured multi-hop inference. Knowledge graphs offer factual grounding, but integrating them with neural models is challenging due to inefficiency and fragility.

Method: NeuroSymActive uses a differentiable neural-symbolic reasoning layer and an active exploration controller. It features soft-unification symbolic modules, a neural path evaluator, and a Monte-Carlo exploration policy prioritizing high-value paths.

Result: Empirical results show NeuroSymActive achieves strong answer accuracy while reducing expensive graph lookups and model calls compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in KGQA by integrating neural and symbolic methods with active exploration.

Abstract: Large pretrained language models and neural reasoning systems have advanced many natural language tasks, yet they remain challenged by knowledge-intensive queries that require precise, structured multi-hop inference. Knowledge graphs provide a compact symbolic substrate for factual grounding, but integrating graph structure with neural models is nontrivial: naively embedding graph facts into prompts leads to inefficiency and fragility, while purely symbolic or search-heavy approaches can be costly in retrievals and lack gradient-based refinement. We introduce NeuroSymActive, a modular framework that combines a differentiable neural-symbolic reasoning layer with an active, value-guided exploration controller for Knowledge Graph Question Answering. The method couples soft-unification style symbolic modules with a neural path evaluator and a Monte-Carlo style exploration policy that prioritizes high-value path expansions. Empirical results on standard KGQA benchmarks show that NeuroSymActive attains strong answer accuracy while reducing the number of expensive graph lookups and model calls compared to common retrieval-augmented baselines.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates slang awareness in Indian and Australian English across seven language models, revealing performance disparities between generative and discriminative tasks and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored ability of language models to comprehend slang in non-standard language varieties, focusing on Indian and Australian English.

Method: Constructed two datasets (web-sourced and synthetic) and assessed models on three tasks: target word prediction (TWP), guided TWP (TWP$^*$), and target word selection (TWS).

Result: Key findings include higher performance in TWS vs. TWP/TWP$^*$, better results on web-sourced data, and greater accuracy for Indian English tasks.

Conclusion: The study highlights asymmetries in generative and discriminative competencies for slang comprehension in non-standard English varieties.

Abstract: Language models exhibit systematic performance gaps when processing text in non-standard language varieties, yet their ability to comprehend variety-specific slang remains underexplored for several languages. We present a comprehensive evaluation of slang awareness in Indian English (en-IN) and Australian English (en-AU) across seven state-of-the-art language models. We construct two complementary datasets: \textsc{web}, containing 377 web-sourced usage examples from Urban Dictionary, and \textsc{gen}, featuring 1,492 synthetically generated usages of these slang terms, across diverse scenarios. We assess language models on three tasks: target word prediction (TWP), guided target word prediction (TWP$^*$) and target word selection (TWS). Our results reveal four key findings: (1) Higher average model performance TWS versus TWP and TWP$^*$, with average accuracy score increasing from 0.03 to 0.49 respectively (2) Stronger average model performance on \textsc{web} versus \textsc{gen} datasets, with average similarity score increasing by 0.03 and 0.05 across TWP and TWP$^*$ tasks respectively (3) en-IN tasks outperform en-AU when averaged across all models and datasets, with TWS demonstrating the largest disparity, increasing average accuracy from 0.44 to 0.54. These findings underscore fundamental asymmetries between generative and discriminative competencies for variety-specific language, particularly in the context of slang expressions despite being in a technologically rich language such as English.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current customer service automation approaches—such as poor generalizability and reliance on complex orchestration—by proposing an orchestration-free framework.

Method: Defines TOF components and metrics, formalizes a cost-efficient flowchart construction algorithm, and uses decentralized distillation with small language models for training.

Result: Validated effectiveness across service tasks, outperforming baselines and market products in quantitative and application performance.

Conclusion: The TOF framework enables streamlined, end-to-end automation and addresses data scarcity and privacy issues, aiming to influence future service automation development.

Abstract: Customer service automation has seen growing demand within digital transformation. Existing approaches either rely on modular system designs with extensive agent orchestration or employ over-simplified instruction schemas, providing limited guidance and poor generalizability. This paper introduces an orchestration-free framework using Task-Oriented Flowcharts (TOFs) to enable end-to-end automation without manual intervention. We first define the components and evaluation metrics for TOFs, then formalize a cost-efficient flowchart construction algorithm to abstract procedural knowledge from service dialogues. We emphasize local deployment of small language models and propose decentralized distillation with flowcharts to mitigate data scarcity and privacy issues in model training. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness in various service tasks, with superior quantitative and application performance compared to strong baselines and market products. By releasing a web-based system demonstration with case studies, we aim to promote streamlined creation of future service automation.

*Prathamesh Devadiga,Paras Chopra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether structured prompts can enable large language models (LLMs) to converse in Tulu, a low-resource language, without fine-tuning. The approach reduces vocabulary contamination and improves grammatical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if LLMs can converse in languages like Tulu, which have minimal digital presence and no training data, using structured prompts instead of fine-tuning.

Method: Combines explicit grammar documentation, negative constraints, romanization standardization, and synthetic data generation via self-play.

Result: Achieves 85% grammatical accuracy and reduces vocabulary contamination from 80% to 5% across three LLMs. Negative constraints consistently improve performance.

Conclusion: Structured prompting can effectively enable LLMs to converse in low-resource languages, with negative constraints being particularly impactful.

Abstract: Can large language models converse in languages virtually absent from their training data? We investigate this question through a case study on Tulu, a Dravidian language with over 2 million speakers but minimal digital presence. Rather than fine-tuning an LLM, we examine whether structured prompts alone can elicit basic conversational ability under controlled prompting. We systematically tackle various challenges posed by absence of training data for Tulu by combining explicit grammar documentation, negative constraints to suppress high-probability tokens from related languages, romanization standardization, and quality-controlled synthetic data generation via self-play. Evaluated on a manually curated held-out set across three LLMs (Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 70B) and validated by native speakers, our approach reduces vocabulary contamination from 80% to 5% while achieving 85% grammatical accuracy. Cross-model analysis reveals that negative constraints provide consistent improvements (12--18 percentage points), while grammar documentation effects vary by model architecture (8--22 points).

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models have unlocked advanced collaborative reasoning, yet they remain shackled by the inefficiency of discrete text communication, which imposes significant runtime overhead and information quantization loss. While latent state transfer offers a high-bandwidth alternative, existing approaches either assume homogeneous sender-receiver architectures or rely on pair-specific learned translators, limiting scalability and modularity across diverse model families with disjoint manifolds. In this work, we propose the Vision Wormhole, a novel framework that repurposes the visual interface of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable model-agnostic, text-free communication. By introducing a Universal Visual Codec, we map heterogeneous reasoning traces into a shared continuous latent space and inject them directly into the receiver's visual pathway, effectively treating the vision encoder as a universal port for inter-agent telepathy. Our framework adopts a hub-and-spoke topology to reduce pairwise alignment complexity from O(N^2) to O(N) and leverages a label-free, teacher-student distillation objective to align the high-speed visual channel with the robust reasoning patterns of the text pathway. Extensive experiments across heterogeneous model families (e.g., Qwen-VL, Gemma) demonstrate that the Vision Wormhole reduces end-to-end wall-clock time in controlled comparisons while maintaining reasoning fidelity comparable to standard text-based MAS.

*Joonatan Laato,Veera Schroderus,Jenna Kanerva,Jenni Kauppi,Virpi Lummaa,Filip Ginter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a categorization framework for analyzing leisure activities and organizational memberships from Finnish WWII evacuee interviews, leverages LLMs to scale annotations, and creates a structured dataset for social integration studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical archives contain rich data on social life, but extracting quantitative insights directly from unstructured text is challenging due to the volume and diversity of activity mentions.

Method: Developed a categorization framework for activities/organizations, annotated a gold-standard set, and tested LLMs for scalable annotation using a voting approach.

Result: An open-weight LLM matched expert judgments closely, enabling successful labeling of 350K entities.

Conclusion: The method produces a structured resource for studying social integration, demonstrating LLMs' utility in large-scale historical text analysis.

Abstract: Digitized historical archives make it possible to study everyday social life on a large scale, but the information extracted directly from text often does not directly allow one to answer the research questions posed by historians or sociologists in a quantitative manner. We address this problem in a large collection of Finnish World War II Karelian evacuee family interviews. Prior work extracted more than 350K mentions of leisure time activities and organizational memberships from these interviews, yielding 71K unique activity and organization names -- far too many to analyze directly.
  We develop a categorization framework that captures key aspects of participation (the kind of activity/organization, how social it typically is, how regularly it happens, and how physically demanding it is). We annotate a gold-standard set to allow for a reliable evaluation, and then test whether large language models can apply the same schema at scale. Using a simple voting approach across multiple model runs, we find that an open-weight LLM can closely match expert judgments. Finally, we apply the method to label the 350K entities, producing a structured resource for downstream studies of social integration and related outcomes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAROT introduces a capability-adaptive reinforcement fine-tuning method for LLMs in code generation, using a structured four-tier test suite to improve code correctness and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of synthesizing sophisticated and robust code with LLMs by tackling imbalanced reward signals from heterogeneous test case difficulty.

Method: Proposes TAROT, a method that constructs a four-tier test suite (basic to edge) and decouples curriculum progression from raw rewards, enabling adaptive curriculum policies based on model capability.

Result: Finds optimal curricula vary by model capability, with less capable models benefiting from easy-to-hard progression and more competent ones from hard-first. TAROT consistently improves code correctness and robustness.

Conclusion: TAROT reproducibly tailors curriculum design to model capability, enhancing LLM performance in code generation, with all code and data released for community use.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are changing the coding paradigm, known as vibe coding, yet synthesizing algorithmically sophisticated and robust code still remains a critical challenge. Incentivizing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs is essential to overcoming this hurdle. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy to address this need. However, most existing approaches overlook the heterogeneous difficulty and granularity inherent in test cases, leading to an imbalanced distribution of reward signals and consequently biased gradient updates during training. To address this, we propose Test-driven and cApability-adaptive cuRriculum reinfOrcement fine-Tuning (TAROT). TAROT systematically constructs, for each problem, a four-tier test suite (basic, intermediate, complex, edge), providing a controlled difficulty landscape for curriculum design and evaluation. Crucially, TAROT decouples curriculum progression from raw reward scores, enabling capability-conditioned evaluation and principled selection from a portfolio of curriculum policies rather than incidental test-case difficulty composition. This design fosters stable optimization and more efficient competency acquisition. Extensive experimental results reveal that the optimal curriculum for RFT in code generation is closely tied to a model's inherent capability, with less capable models achieving greater gains with an easy-to-hard progression, whereas more competent models excel under a hard-first curriculum. TAROT provides a reproducible method that adaptively tailors curriculum design to a model's capability, thereby consistently improving the functional correctness and robustness of the generated code. All code and data are released to foster reproducibility and advance community research at https://github.com/deep-diver/TAROT.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how LLM agents exhibit systematic source preferences when filtering and presenting information, influencing user perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in understanding the biases in LLM-driven information selection, particularly latent source preferences.

Method: Controlled experiments on twelve LLMs from six providers, testing synthetic and real-world tasks.

Result: Several LLMs consistently show strong source preferences, influenced by contextual framing and resistant to prompts.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for transparency and user control over biases in LLM-powered agents.

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as interfaces to information on online platforms. These agents filter, prioritize, and synthesize information retrieved from the platforms' back-end databases or via web search. In these scenarios, LLM agents govern the information users receive, by drawing users' attention to particular instances of retrieved information at the expense of others. While much prior work has focused on biases in the information LLMs themselves generate, less attention has been paid to the factors that influence what information LLMs select and present to users. We hypothesize that when information is attributed to specific sources (e.g., particular publishers, journals, or platforms), current LLMs exhibit systematic latent source preferences- that is, they prioritize information from some sources over others. Through controlled experiments on twelve LLMs from six model providers, spanning both synthetic and real-world tasks, we find that several models consistently exhibit strong and predictable source preferences. These preferences are sensitive to contextual framing, can outweigh the influence of content itself, and persist despite explicit prompting to avoid them. They also help explain phenomena such as the observed left-leaning skew in news recommendations in prior work. Our findings advocate for deeper investigation into the origins of these preferences, as well as for mechanisms that provide users with transparency and control over the biases guiding LLM-powered agents.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Expectation Detection, a novel NLP task, and presents RedHOTExpect, a corpus of Reddit posts to analyze patient treatment expectations, revealing linguistic patterns and thematic differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore patients' treatment expectations shared online, which are often omitted in clinical settings, and to introduce Expectation Detection as a relevant NLP task.

Method: Uses a large language model (LLM) to silver-label 4.5K Reddit posts (RedHOTExpect corpus), manually validates labels (~78% accuracy), and analyzes linguistic patterns and themes.

Result: Optimism and proactive framing are more common in physical/treatment-related posts versus mental-health contexts, with patients mostly discussing benefits over negative outcomes.

Conclusion: The RedHOTExpect corpus enables study of patient expectations online, highlighting its utility for NLP applications like opinion mining and product design.

Abstract: Patients' expectations towards their treatment have a substantial effect on the treatments' success. While primarily studied in clinical settings, online patient platforms like medical subreddits may hold complementary insights: treatment expectations that patients feel unnecessary or uncomfortable to share elsewhere. Despite this, no studies examine what type of expectations users discuss online and how they express them. Presumably this is because expectations have not been studied in natural language processing (NLP) before. Therefore, we introduce the task of Expectation Detection, arguing that expectations are relevant for many applications, including opinion mining and product design. Subsequently, we present a case study for the medical domain, where expectations are particularly crucial to extract. We contribute RedHOTExpect, a corpus of Reddit posts (4.5K posts) to study expectations in this context. We use a large language model (LLM) to silver-label the data and validate its quality manually (label accuracy ~78%). Based on this, we analyze which linguistic patterns characterize expectations and explore what patients expect and why. We find that optimism and proactive framing are more pronounced in posts about physical or treatment-related illnesses compared to mental-health contexts, and that in our dataset, patients mostly discuss benefits rather than negative outcomes. The RedHOTExpect corpus can be obtained from https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/data/RedHOTExpect

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of efficient translation systems for Luxembourgish (LB) into French (FR) and English (EN), leveraging existing datasets and novel benchmarks.

Method: LuxMT uses Gemma 3 27B, fine-tuned with data from LuxAlign (news articles and parliamentary transcripts) and filtered using LuxEmbedder for quality. Performance is tested on human-translated data.

Result: LuxMT shows strong improvements over the baseline, even for untrained language pairs like LB-DE. LuxEmbedder also correlates well with reference-based metrics.

Conclusion: While LuxMT performs well, further research is needed to fully validate LuxEmbedder's utility as a quality estimation metric.

Abstract: We introduce LuxMT, a machine translation system based on Gemma 3 27B and fine-tuned for translation from Luxembourgish (LB) into French (FR) and English (EN). To assess translation performance, we construct a novel benchmark covering LB-FR, LB-EN, and LB-FR using human-translated data from Luci, a tourist magazine about Luxembourg. Training data stems from LuxAlign, a parallel corpus of multilingual Luxembourgish news articles, and LB parliamentary transcripts augmented with Google Translate. We filter the data using LuxEmbedder, LB sentence embeddings, to remove low-equivalence segment-pairs. Overall, LuxMT's results suggest strong improvements over the Gemma 3 baseline, even for translating LB to German (DE), despite the training data not containing any DE. We also explore LuxEmbedder's potential to be used as a quality estimation metric and find strong correlations with other reference-based metrics. However, we call for further research to fully assess the metric's utility and advise using it with caution.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-Refine is a framework that improves LLM dialogue systems by decomposing responses into atomic units for fine-grained verification and correction, significantly reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs exhibit hallucinations, producing factually incorrect responses that mislead users and erode trust in dialogue systems.

Method: Fine-Refine decomposes responses into atomic units, verifies each unit externally, assesses fluency via perplexity, and iteratively corrects errors.

Result: Experimental evaluation on HybriDialogue and OpendialKG datasets shows Fine-Refine improves factual accuracy (7.63-point gain) with minor trade-offs in quality.

Conclusion: Fine-Refine effectively addresses LLM hallucinations by fine-grained refinement, enhancing dialogue system trustworthiness.

Abstract: The tendency for hallucination in current large language models (LLMs) negatively impacts dialogue systems. Such hallucinations produce factually incorrect responses that may mislead users and undermine system trust. Existing refinement methods for dialogue systems typically operate at the response level, overlooking the fact that a single response may contain multiple verifiable or unverifiable facts. To address this gap, we propose Fine-Refine, a fine-grained refinement framework that decomposes responses into atomic units, verifies each unit using external knowledge, assesses fluency via perplexity, and iteratively corrects granular errors. We evaluate factuality across the HybriDialogue and OpendialKG datasets in terms of factual accuracy (fact score) and coverage (Not Enough Information Proportion), and experiments show that Fine-Refine substantially improves factuality, achieving up to a 7.63-point gain in dialogue fact score, with a small trade-off in dialogue quality.

Motivation: To address the growing prevalence of LLMs and mitigate risks by developing reliable AI-generated text detection methods.

Method: Uses labels of linguistic dependency relations to detect AI-generated text, focusing on syntactic structures for interpretability.

Result: Competitive performance in monolingual, multi-generator, and multilingual settings, with insights into generator-specific writing styles.

Conclusion: Dependency relations offer a robust signal for detection, positioning DependencyAI as an effective, interpretable, and non-neural baseline.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, reliable methods for detecting AI-generated text are critical for mitigating potential risks. We introduce DependencyAI, a simple and interpretable approach for detecting AI-generated text using only the labels of linguistic dependency relations. Our method achieves competitive performance across monolingual, multi-generator, and multilingual settings. To increase interpretability, we analyze feature importance to reveal syntactic structures that distinguish AI-generated from human-written text. We also observe a systematic overprediction of certain models on unseen domains, suggesting that generator-specific writing styles may affect cross-domain generalization. Overall, our results demonstrate that dependency relations alone provide a robust signal for AI-generated text detection, establishing DependencyAI as a strong linguistically grounded, interpretable, and non-neural network baseline.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ExpertWeaver, a training-free framework for converting dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures by leveraging activation patterns from GLU, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training MoEs from scratch is costly, and existing dense-to-MoE methods disrupt intrinsic activation patterns, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: ExpertWeaver partitions neurons based on GLU activation patterns, creating shared and specialized experts with layer-adaptive configurations.

Result: ExpertWeaver outperforms existing methods in both dynamic structural pruning and downcycling for MoE initialization.

Conclusion: GLU activation patterns naturally reveal an inherent MoE structure, enabling efficient and high-quality dense-to-MoE conversion with ExpertWeaver.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) effectively scales model capacity while preserving computational efficiency through sparse expert activation. However, training high-quality MoEs from scratch is prohibitively expensive. A promising alternative is to convert pretrained dense models into sparse MoEs. Existing dense-to-MoE methods fall into two categories: \textbf{dynamic structural pruning} that converts dense models into MoE architectures with moderate sparsity to balance performance and inference efficiency, and \textbf{downcycling} approaches that use pretrained dense models to initialize highly sparse MoE architectures. However, existing methods break the intrinsic activation patterns within dense models, leading to suboptimal expert construction. In this work, we argue that the Gated Linear Unit (GLU) mechanism provides a natural blueprint for dense-to-MoE conversion. We show that the fine-grained neural-wise activation patterns of GLU reveal a coarse-grained structure, uncovering an inherent MoE architecture composed of consistently activated universal neurons and dynamically activated specialized neurons. Leveraging this discovery, we introduce ExpertWeaver, a training-free framework that partitions neurons according to their activation patterns and constructs shared experts and specialized routed experts with layer-adaptive configurations. Our experiments demonstrate that ExpertWeaver significantly outperforms existing methods, both as a training-free dynamic structural pruning technique and as a downcycling strategy for superior MoE initialization.

Motivation: Pure speech language models face challenges with long sequences from discrete tokens; ZeroSyl simplifies syllable extraction without complex training pipelines.

Method: ZeroSyl uses L2 norms of WavLM's intermediate features for syllable segmentation, mean-pools and discretizes segments with K-means, then trains a language model.

Result: ZeroSyl achieves competitive segmentation and outperforms syllabic tokenizers in lexical, syntactic, and narrative tasks, showing better scaling for syntax.

Conclusion: ZeroSyl offers a simple, effective approach for syllable-based speech language modeling, with advantages in syntactic performance and scalability.

Abstract: Pure speech language models aim to learn language directly from raw audio without textual resources. A key challenge is that discrete tokens from self-supervised speech encoders result in excessively long sequences, motivating recent work on syllable-like units. However, methods like Sylber and SyllableLM rely on intricate multi-stage training pipelines. We propose ZeroSyl, a simple training-free method to extract syllable boundaries and embeddings directly from a frozen WavLM model. Using L2 norms of features in WavLM's intermediate layers, ZeroSyl achieves competitive syllable segmentation performance. The resulting segments are mean-pooled, discretized using K-means, and used to train a language model. ZeroSyl outperforms prior syllabic tokenizers across lexical, syntactic, and narrative benchmarks. Scaling experiments show that while finer-grained units are beneficial for lexical tasks, our discovered syllabic units exhibit better scaling behavior for syntactic modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel training regimen combining model distillation and task-specific contrastive loss produces compact, high-performance text embedding models (jina-embeddings-v5-text) that outperform or match state-of-the-art models of similar size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop more effective training methods for small text embedding models, addressing limitations of purely contrastive or distillation-based approaches.

Method: Combines model distillation techniques with task-specific contrastive loss to train compact embedding models.

Result: The resulting models (jina-embeddings-v5-text-small and jina-embeddings-v5-text-nano) exceed or match state-of-the-art benchmarks for similar-sized models and support long texts and robustness under truncation and quantization.

Conclusion: The hybrid training approach is more effective for small models, and the publicly released jina-embeddings-v5-text models advance the field of embedding model development.

Abstract: Text embedding models are widely used for semantic similarity tasks, including information retrieval, clustering, and classification. General-purpose models are typically trained with single- or multi-stage processes using contrastive loss functions. We introduce a novel training regimen that combines model distillation techniques with task-specific contrastive loss to produce compact, high-performance embedding models. Our findings suggest that this approach is more effective for training small models than purely contrastive or distillation-based training paradigms alone. Benchmark scores for the resulting models, jina-embeddings-v5-text-small and jina-embeddings-v5-text-nano, exceed or match the state-of-the-art for models of similar size. jina-embeddings-v5-text models additionally support long texts (up to 32k tokens) in many languages, and generate embeddings that remain robust under truncation and binary quantization. Model weights are publicly available, hopefully inspiring further advances in embedding model development.

TL;DR: SquRL, a reinforcement learning framework, improves Text-to-SQL performance by dynamically constructing workflows, outperforming static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static workflows in Text-to-SQL limit scalability for out-of-distribution and long-tail scenarios. The goal is to enable adaptive workflow construction at inference time.

Method: Proposes SquRL, a reinforcement learning framework with a rule-based reward function, dynamic actor masking, and pseudo rewards for training.

Result: Dynamic workflow construction consistently outperforms static methods, especially on complex and out-of-distribution queries.

Conclusion: SquRL enhances LLMs' reasoning for adaptive workflow construction, offering significant performance gains over static approaches.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL has recently achieved impressive progress, yet remains difficult to apply effectively in real-world scenarios. This gap stems from the reliance on single static workflows, fundamentally limiting scalability to out-of-distribution and long-tail scenarios. Instead of requiring users to select suitable methods through extensive experimentation, we attempt to enable systems to adaptively construct workflows at inference time. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that optimal dynamic policies consistently outperform the best static workflow, with performance gains fundamentally driven by heterogeneity across candidate workflows. Motivated by this, we propose SquRL, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances LLMs' reasoning capability in adaptive workflow construction. We design a rule-based reward function and introduce two effective training mechanisms: dynamic actor masking to encourage broader exploration, and pseudo rewards to improve training efficiency. Experiments on widely-used Text-to-SQL benchmarks demonstrate that dynamic workflow construction consistently outperforms the best static workflow methods, with especially pronounced gains on complex and out-of-distribution queries.

*Chaithra Nerella,Chiranjeevi Yarra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a symptom-specific framework for depression severity estimation from speech, using a symptom-guided cross-attention mechanism to align speech representations with PHQ-8 questionnaire items, improving performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depression prediction methods treat depression as a binary label or overall severity score, lacking symptom-specific analysis crucial for clinical screening.

Method: A symptom-guided cross-attention mechanism aligns PHQ-8 items with emotion-aware speech representations, with learnable symptom-specific parameters controlling attention sharpness.

Result: The framework outperforms prior works on the EDAIC dataset, with attention analysis highlighting interpretability by focusing on utterances related to depressive symptoms.

Conclusion: Symptom-guided and emotion-aware modeling enhances speech-based depression screening, providing clinically relevant insights.

Abstract: Depression manifests through a diverse set of symptoms such as sleep disturbance, loss of interest, and concentration difficulties. However, most existing works treat depression prediction either as a binary label or an overall severity score without explicitly modeling symptom-specific information. This limits their ability to provide symptom-level analysis relevant to clinical screening. To address this, we propose a symptom-specific and clinically inspired framework for depression severity estimation from speech. Our approach uses a symptom-guided cross-attention mechanism that aligns PHQ-8 questionnaire items with emotion-aware speech representations to identify which segments of a participant's speech are more important to each symptom. To account for differences in how symptoms are expressed over time, we introduce a learnable symptom-specific parameter that adaptively controls the sharpness of attention distributions. Our results on EDAIC, a standard clinical-style dataset, demonstrate improved performance outperforming prior works. Further, analyzing the attention distributions showed that higher attention is assigned to utterances containing cues related to multiple depressive symptoms, highlighting the interpretability of our approach. These findings outline the importance of symptom-guided and emotion-aware modeling for speech-based depression screening.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies spurious tokens as a cause of instability in RL fine-tuning for large language models and introduces STAPO to selectively mitigate their impact, improving performance and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL fine-tuning methods suffer from late-stage performance collapse due to heuristic techniques, prompting the need for a more stable approach.

Method: The authors propose Spurious-Token-Aware Policy Optimization (STAPO), which masks updates from spurious tokens and renormalizes loss over valid tokens.

Result: STAPO improves entropy stability and achieves a 7.13% average performance boost across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: Addressing spurious tokens through selective masking enhances RL fine-tuning stability and reasoning quality in large language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has significantly improved large language model reasoning, but existing RL fine-tuning methods rely heavily on heuristic techniques such as entropy regularization and reweighting to maintain stability. In practice, they often experience late-stage performance collapse, leading to degraded reasoning quality and unstable training. We derive that the magnitude of token-wise policy gradients in RL is negatively correlated with token probability and local policy entropy. Building on this result, we prove that training instability is driven by a tiny fraction of tokens, approximately 0.01\%, which we term \emph{spurious tokens}. When such tokens appear in correct responses, they contribute little to the reasoning outcome but inherit the full sequence-level reward, leading to abnormally amplified gradient updates. Motivated by this observation, we propose Spurious-Token-Aware Policy Optimization (STAPO) for large-scale model refining, which selectively masks such updates and renormalizes the loss over valid tokens. Across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks using Qwen 1.7B, 8B, and 14B base models, STAPO consistently demonstrates superior entropy stability and achieves an average performance improvement of 7.13\% over GRPO, 20-Entropy and JustRL.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NileTTS, a new dataset and pipeline for Egyptian Arabic text-to-speech (TTS), addressing the under-resourcing of this widely understood dialect. It uses synthetic data generation and fine-tunes a multilingual TTS model, releasing all resources publicly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of resources for Egyptian Arabic in TTS, despite its wide usage, by creating a comprehensive dataset and reproducible pipeline.

Method: A synthetic pipeline using LLMs to generate Egyptian Arabic content, convert it to speech, and transcribe it automatically with manual verification. XTTS v2 is fine-tuned on this dataset.

Result: The first publicly available Egyptian Arabic TTS dataset, a reproducible synthetic data pipeline, and an open-source fine-tuned model are produced.

Conclusion: The work advances Egyptian Arabic TTS research by providing essential resources and a scalable synthetic data generation method.

Abstract: Despite the advances in neural text to speech (TTS), many Arabic dialectal varieties remain marginally addressed, with most resources concentrated on Modern Spoken Arabic (MSA) and Gulf dialects, leaving Egyptian Arabic -- the most widely understood Arabic dialect -- severely under-resourced. We address this gap by introducing NileTTS: 38 hours of transcribed speech from two speakers across diverse domains including medical, sales, and general conversations. We construct this dataset using a novel synthetic pipeline: large language models (LLM) generate Egyptian Arabic content, which is then converted to natural speech using audio synthesis tools, followed by automatic transcription and speaker diarization with manual quality verification. We fine-tune XTTS v2, a state-of-the-art multilingual TTS model, on our dataset and evaluate against the baseline model trained on other Arabic dialects. Our contributions include: (1) the first publicly available Egyptian Arabic TTS dataset, (2) a reproducible synthetic data generation pipeline for dialectal TTS, and (3) an open-source fine-tuned model. All resources are released to advance Egyptian Arabic speech synthesis research.

*Edirlei Soares de Lima,Marco A. Casanova,Antonio L. Furtado*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a character function framework aligned with Northrop Frye's genres and Jungian archetypes, validated by LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Focusing on character functions complements existing pattern-based analyses, addressing gaps in computational approaches to Frye's narrative genres.

Method: Derived four universal character functions from Jungian archetypes, specialized into sixteen genre-specific roles, and validated using six LLMs across 40 narrative works.

Result: LLMs achieved 82.5% balanced accuracy, with genre-specific performance variations reflecting narrative properties like archetype subversion in satire.

Conclusion: The framework supports LLM-driven computational narratology and holds promise for future narrative generation and interactive storytelling.

Abstract: Northrop Frye's theory of four fundamental narrative genres (comedy, romance, tragedy, satire) has profoundly influenced literary criticism, yet computational approaches to his framework have focused primarily on narrative patterns rather than character functions. In this paper, we present a new character function framework that complements pattern-based analysis by examining how archetypal roles manifest differently across Frye's genres. Drawing on Jungian archetype theory, we derive four universal character functions (protagonist, mentor, antagonist, companion) by mapping them to Jung's psychic structure components. These functions are then specialized into sixteen genre-specific roles based on prototypical works. To validate this framework, we conducted a multi-model study using six state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate character-role correspondences across 40 narrative works. The validation employed both positive samples (160 valid correspondences) and negative samples (30 invalid correspondences) to evaluate whether models both recognize valid correspondences and reject invalid ones. LLMs achieved substantial performance (mean balanced accuracy of 82.5%) with strong inter-model agreement (Fleiss' $κ$ = 0.600), demonstrating that the proposed correspondences capture systematic structural patterns. Performance varied by genre (ranging from 72.7% to 89.9%) and role (52.5% to 99.2%), with qualitative analysis revealing that variations reflect genuine narrative properties, including functional distribution in romance and deliberate archetypal subversion in satire. This character-based approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-supported methods for computational narratology and provides a foundation for future development of narrative generation methods and interactive storytelling applications.

*Meirav Segal,Noa Linder,Omer Antverg,Gil Gekker,Tomer Fichman,Omri Bodenheimer,Edan Maor,Omer Nevo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a content-based framework for designing cyber refusal policies in LLM-based agents, focusing on offense-defense tradeoffs rather than intent or topic bans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current refusal systems for cybersecurity tasks often lead to inconsistent decisions, over-restriction of legitimate defenders, and brittleness under obfuscation.

Method: Introduces a framework assessing requests along five dimensions: Offensive Action Contribution, Offensive Risk, Technical Complexity, Defensive Benefit, and Expected Frequency for Legitimate Users.

Result: Demonstrates that this approach resolves inconsistencies in frontier model behavior and enables tunable, risk-aware refusal policies.

Conclusion: Effective refusal policies should explicitly model offense-defense tradeoffs rather than relying on intent or offensive classification.

Abstract: Large language models and LLM-based agents are increasingly used for cybersecurity tasks that are inherently dual-use. Existing approaches to refusal, spanning academic policy frameworks and commercially deployed systems, often rely on broad topic-based bans or offensive-focused taxonomies. As a result, they can yield inconsistent decisions, over-restrict legitimate defenders, and behave brittlely under obfuscation or request segmentation. We argue that effective refusal requires explicitly modeling the trade-off between offensive risk and defensive benefit, rather than relying solely on intent or offensive classification. In this paper, we introduce a content-based framework for designing and auditing cyber refusal policies that makes offense-defense tradeoffs explicit. The framework characterizes requests along five dimensions: Offensive Action Contribution, Offensive Risk, Technical Complexity, Defensive Benefit, and Expected Frequency for Legitimate Users, grounded in the technical substance of the request rather than stated intent. We demonstrate that this content-grounded approach resolves inconsistencies in current frontier model behavior and allows organizations to construct tunable, risk-aware refusal policies.

### [71] [Rethinking Metrics for Lexical Semantic Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15716)
*Roksana Goworek,Haim Dubossarsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces two new metrics, AMD and SAMD, for lexical semantic change detection using contextualized embeddings, showing improved robustness compared to existing methods like APD and PRT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic change metrics (APD and PRT) are limited, and the paper aims to enhance lexical semantic change detection with more robust alternatives.

Method: The authors propose AMD and SAMD, which measure semantic change by analyzing local correspondence between word usages across time periods.

Result: AMD performs well with non-specialized encoders and dimensionality reduction, while SAMD excels with specialized encoders.

Conclusion: LSCD can benefit from adopting AMD and SAMD, offering more robust options for contextualized embedding-based analysis.

Abstract: Lexical semantic change detection (LSCD) increasingly relies on contextualised language model embeddings, yet most approaches still quantify change using a small set of semantic change metrics, primarily Average Pairwise Distance (APD) and cosine distance over word prototypes (PRT). We introduce Average Minimum Distance (AMD) and Symmetric Average Minimum Distance (SAMD), new measures that quantify semantic change via local correspondence between word usages across time periods. Across multiple languages, encoder models, and representation spaces, we show that AMD often provides more robust performance, particularly under dimensionality reduction and with non-specialised encoders, while SAMD excels with specialised encoders. We suggest that LSCD may benefit from considering alternative semantic change metrics beyond APD and PRT, with AMD offering a robust option for contextualised embedding-based analysis.

*Omri Feldman,Amar Venugopal,Jann Spiess,Amir Feder*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an end-to-end pipeline for generating and estimating causal effects of textual interventions, addressing bias in naive estimation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the causal impact of text on outcomes is crucial, but existing methods struggle with controlled text variation and bias.

Method: The pipeline uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for hypothesis generation and steering, followed by covariate residualization for robust causal estimation.

Result: Naive estimation suffers from bias; the proposed pipeline successfully mitigates this and induces target feature variation.

Conclusion: The pipeline provides a robust solution for causal effect estimation in text-as-treatment experiments.

Abstract: Understanding the causal effects of text on downstream outcomes is a central task in many applications. Estimating such effects requires researchers to run controlled experiments that systematically vary textual features. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise for generating text, producing and evaluating controlled variation requires more careful attention. In this paper, we present an end-to-end pipeline for the generation and causal estimation of latent textual interventions. Our work first performs hypothesis generation and steering via sparse autoencoders (SAEs), followed by robust causal estimation. Our pipeline addresses both computational and statistical challenges in text-as-treatment experiments. We demonstrate that naive estimation of causal effects suffers from significant bias as text inherently conflates treatment and covariate information. We describe the estimation bias induced in this setting and propose a solution based on covariate residualization. Our empirical results show that our pipeline effectively induces variation in target features and mitigates estimation error, providing a robust foundation for causal effect estimation in text-as-treatment settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs like GPT-4 and Mistral show promise in few-shot POS-tagging and lemmatization for low-resource languages, outperforming task-specific baselines in some cases, though challenges remain for complex morphologies and non-Latin scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the persistent challenges of NLP tasks (lemmatization, POS-tagging) in low-resource languages by leveraging LLMs in few-shot and zero-shot settings.

Method: Evaluated GPT-4 variants and Mistral models on four under-resourced languages using aligned training and out-of-domain test corpora, comparing against a task-specific RNN baseline (PIE).

Result: LLMs achieved competitive or superior performance without fine-tuning in few-shot settings, though struggles persisted with complex morphology and non-Latin scripts.

Conclusion: LLMs are a credible option for initiating linguistic annotation tasks in data-scarce scenarios, acting as effective aids for annotation despite lingering challenges.

Abstract: Low-resource languages pose persistent challenges for Natural Language Processing tasks such as lemmatization and part-of-speech (POS) tagging. This paper investigates the capacity of recent large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 variants and open-weight Mistral models, to address these tasks in few-shot and zero-shot settings for four historically and linguistically diverse under-resourced languages: Ancient Greek, Classical Armenian, Old Georgian, and Syriac. Using a novel benchmark comprising aligned training and out-of-domain test corpora, we evaluate the performance of foundation models across lemmatization and POS-tagging, and compare them with PIE, a task-specific RNN baseline. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, even without fine-tuning, achieve competitive or superior performance in POS-tagging and lemmatization across most languages in few-shot settings. Significant challenges persist for languages characterized by complex morphology and non-Latin scripts, but we demonstrate that LLMs are a credible and relevant option for initiating linguistic annotation tasks in the absence of data, serving as an effective aid for annotation.

TL;DR: FineMuSe introduces a multimodal Spanish dataset with fine-grained sexism annotations, a hierarchical taxonomy, and evaluates LLMs for nuanced detection, showing competitive performance but limitations with visual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated tools for sexism detection lack fine-grained labels, missing subtle manifestations, prompting the creation of FineMuSe.

Method: Developed FineMuSe dataset with binary and fine-grained annotations, a hierarchical taxonomy, and evaluated various LLMs for sexism detection.

Result: Multimodal LLMs performed comparably to humans in nuanced detection but struggled with co-occurring sexist types conveyed visually.

Conclusion: FineMuSe advances sexism detection with fine-grained labels and multimodal analysis, though visual cue challenges remain.

Abstract: Online sexism appears in various forms, which makes its detection challenging. Although automated tools can enhance the identification of sexist content, they are often restricted to binary classification. Consequently, more subtle manifestations of sexism may remain undetected due to the lack of fine-grained, context-sensitive labels. To address this issue, we make the following contributions: (1) we present FineMuSe, a new multimodal sexism detection dataset in Spanish that includes both binary and fine-grained annotations; (2) we introduce a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy that encompasses forms of sexism, non-sexism, and rhetorical devices of irony and humor; and (3) we evaluate a wide range of LLMs for both binary and fine-grained sexism detection. Our findings indicate that multimodal LLMs perform competitively with human annotators in identifying nuanced forms of sexism; however, they struggle to capture co-occurring sexist types when these are conveyed through visual cues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs excel at single-turn chart generation but lack exploration of multi-turn interactions for real-world exploratory data analysis, which requires maintaining context and adapting to user preferences.

Method: ChartEditBench is a benchmark for incremental chart editing via code, featuring 5,000 difficulty-controlled modification chains and a human-verified subset. It includes an evaluation framework with execution-based fidelity checks, pixel-level visual similarity, and logical code verification.

Result: Experiments show MLLMs degrade in multi-turn settings due to error accumulation and context breakdowns, performing well on stylistic edits but poorly on data-centric transformations.

Conclusion: ChartEditBench provides a challenging testbed for evaluating grounded, intent-aware multimodal programming in MLLMs.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform strongly on single-turn chart generation, their ability to support real-world exploratory data analysis remains underexplored. In practice, users iteratively refine visualizations through multi-turn interactions that require maintaining common ground, tracking prior edits, and adapting to evolving preferences. We introduce ChartEditBench, a benchmark for incremental, visually grounded chart editing via code, comprising 5,000 difficulty-controlled modification chains and a rigorously human-verified subset. Unlike prior one-shot benchmarks, ChartEditBench evaluates sustained, context-aware editing. We further propose a robust evaluation framework that mitigates limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge metrics by integrating execution-based fidelity checks, pixel-level visual similarity, and logical code verification. Experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal substantial degradation in multi-turn settings due to error accumulation and breakdowns in shared context, with strong performance on stylistic edits but frequent execution failures on data-centric transformations. ChartEditBench, establishes a challenging testbed for grounded, intent-aware multimodal programming.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational expense and post-processing requirements of LLM-as-a-judge methods for evaluating generated text quality.

Method: The authors develop *-PLUIE, task-specific prompting variants of the perplexity-based ParaPLUIE metric, which estimates confidence without text generation.

Result: Personalized *-PLUIE achieves stronger correlations with human ratings while maintaining low computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed method (*-PLUIE) is a more efficient and effective alternative to traditional LLM-judge approaches for text quality evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of automatically generated text often relies on LLM-as-a-judge (LLM-judge) methods. While effective, these approaches are computationally expensive and require post-processing. To address these limitations, we build upon ParaPLUIE, a perplexity-based LLM-judge metric that estimates confidence over ``Yes/No'' answers without generating text. We introduce *-PLUIE, task specific prompting variants of ParaPLUIE and evaluate their alignment with human judgement. Our experiments show that personalised *-PLUIE achieves stronger correlations with human ratings while maintaining low computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve compact pretrained bidirectional encoders by adapting autoregressive attention-free Avey for encoder-only tasks, addressing compute and memory constraints.

Method: Reformulate Avey for encoder-only tasks with innovations: decoupled static/dynamic parameterizations, stability-oriented normalization, and neural compression.

Result: The reformulated Avey outperforms four widely used Transformer-based encoders on token-classification and information-retrieval benchmarks, scaling better to long contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed Avey adaptation is a highly effective and efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based encoders.

Abstract: Compact pretrained bidirectional encoders remain the backbone of industrial NLP under tight compute and memory budgets. Their effectiveness stems from self-attention's ability to deliver high-quality bidirectional contextualization with sequence-level parallelism, as popularized by BERT-style architectures. Recently, Avey was introduced as an autoregressive, attention-free alternative that naturally admits an encoder-only adaptation. In this paper, we reformulate Avey for the encoder-only paradigm and propose several innovations to its architecture, including decoupled static and dynamic parameterizations, stability-oriented normalization, and neural compression. Results show that this reformulated architecture compares favorably to four widely used Transformer-based encoders, consistently outperforming them on standard token-classification and information-retrieval benchmarks while scaling more efficiently to long contexts.

Motivation: Agent-based models face computational challenges in parameter estimation, limiting their use as decision-support tools. This study aims to address these challenges by leveraging neural networks for scalable and efficient parameter estimation.

Method: A simulation-based inference framework using neural networks is applied to a labour market ABM initialized with synthetic and real U.S. labour market data. The effectiveness of NN-learned summary statistics is compared with traditional statistical measures.

Result: The NN-based approach successfully recovers original parameters across dataset scales and outperforms traditional Bayesian methods in efficiency.

Conclusion: Neural networks offer a promising solution for scalable parameter estimation in agent-based models, enhancing their utility as decision-support tools.

Abstract: Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a widespread approach to simulate complex systems. Advancements in computational processing and storage have facilitated the adoption of ABMs across many fields; however, ABMs face challenges that limit their use as decision-support tools. A significant issue is parameter estimation in large-scale ABMs, particularly due to computational constraints on exploring the parameter space. This study evaluates a state-of-the-art simulation-based inference (SBI) framework that uses neural networks (NN) for parameter estimation. This framework is applied to an established labour market ABM based on job transition networks. The ABM is initiated with synthetic datasets and the real U.S. labour market. Next, we compare the effectiveness of summary statistics derived from a list of statistical measures with that learned by an embedded NN. The results demonstrate that the NN-based approach recovers the original parameters when evaluating posterior distributions across various dataset scales and improves efficiency compared to traditional Bayesian methods.

Motivation: Safety is critical in RL applications like autonomous driving and healthcare, but existing methods suffer from safety violations or high sample complexity. The paper aims to mitigate these issues.

Method: A model-based primal-dual algorithm is introduced, combining online RL and constrained optimization techniques to balance regret and constraint violations.

Result: For relaxed feasibility, the algorithm achieves ε-optimal policies with ε-bounded violations in Õ(SAH³/ε²) episodes. For strict feasibility, it achieves ε-optimal policies with zero violations in Õ(SAH⁵/ε²ζ²) episodes, matching lower bounds.

Conclusion: Learning CMDPs online is as efficient as with generative models and comparable to unconstrained MDPs when minor violations are allowed.

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in real-world applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare. To address this, Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are commonly used to enforce safety constraints while optimizing performance. However, existing methods often suffer from significant safety violations or require a high sample complexity to generate near-optimal policies. We address two settings: relaxed feasibility, where small violations are allowed, and strict feasibility, where no violation is allowed. We propose a model-based primal-dual algorithm that balances regret and bounded constraint violations, drawing on techniques from online RL and constrained optimization. For relaxed feasibility, we prove that our algorithm returns an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy with $\varepsilon$-bounded violation with arbitrarily high probability, requiring $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{SAH^3}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ learning episodes, matching the lower bound for unconstrained MDPs. For strict feasibility, we prove that our algorithm returns an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy with zero violation with arbitrarily high probability, requiring $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{SAH^5}{\varepsilon^2ζ^2}\right)$ learning episodes, where $ζ$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant characterizing the size of the feasible region. This result matches the lower bound for learning CMDPs with access to a generative model.
  Our results demonstrate that learning CMDPs in an online setting is as easy as learning with a generative model and is no more challenging than learning unconstrained MDPs when small violations are allowed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid approach combining deep learning embeddings and statistical features for HVAC equipment anomaly prediction, achieving high accuracy and production-ready performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pure deep learning methods often lack accuracy in real-world predictive maintenance tasks, prompting the need for a hybrid approach.

Method: Integrates 64-dimensional time series embeddings from Granite TinyTimeMixer (fine-tuned with LoRA) with 28 statistical features (trend, volatility, etc.), learned using LightGBM.

Result: Achieved Precision of 91--95%, ROC-AUC of 0.995, false positive rate ≤1.1%, and detection rate of 88--94% across 30, 60, and 90-day horizons.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach leverages deep learning and statistical features for effective predictive maintenance, showing practical viability.

Abstract: In predictive maintenance of equipment, deep learning-based time series anomaly detection has garnered significant attention; however, pure deep learning approaches often fail to achieve sufficient accuracy on real-world data. This study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates 64-dimensional time series embeddings from Granite TinyTimeMixer with 28-dimensional statistical features based on domain knowledge for HVAC equipment anomaly prediction tasks. Specifically, we combine time series embeddings extracted from a Granite TinyTimeMixer encoder fine-tuned with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and 28 types of statistical features including trend, volatility, and drawdown indicators, which are then learned using a LightGBM gradient boosting classifier. In experiments using 64 equipment units and 51,564 samples, we achieved Precision of 91--95\% and ROC-AUC of 0.995 for anomaly prediction at 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day horizons. Furthermore, we achieved production-ready performance with a false positive rate of 1.1\% or less and a detection rate of 88--94\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the system for predictive maintenance applications. This work demonstrates that practical anomaly detection systems can be realized by leveraging the complementary strengths between deep learning's representation learning capabilities and statistical feature engineering.

TL;DR: PolyNODEs extend Neural ODEs to M-polyfolds, enabling variable-dimensional flow-based models for geometric deep learning, with applications like reconstruction and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NODE models are limited to fixed-dimensional dynamics due to manifold constraints, prompting the need for flexible, variable-dimensional solutions.

Method: Introduces PolyNODEs, leveraging M-polyfolds and parametrised vector fields to navigate dimensional bottlenecks, exemplified in PolyNODE autoencoders.

Result: Experimental results show successful training for reconstruction tasks and extraction of latent representations usable for downstream classification.

Conclusion: PolyNODEs represent a significant advancement in geometric deep learning by overcoming dimensional constraints of traditional NODE models.

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) are geometric deep learning models based on dynamical systems and flows generated by vector fields on manifolds. Despite numerous successful applications, particularly within the flow matching paradigm, all existing NODE models are fundamentally constrained to fixed-dimensional dynamics by the intrinsic nature of the manifold's dimension. In this paper, we extend NODEs to M-polyfolds (spaces that can simultaneously accommodate varying dimensions and a notion of differentiability) and introduce PolyNODEs, the first variable-dimensional flow-based model in geometric deep learning. As an example application, we construct explicit M-polyfolds featuring dimensional bottlenecks and PolyNODE autoencoders based on parametrised vector fields that traverse these bottlenecks. We demonstrate experimentally that our PolyNODE models can be trained to solve reconstruction tasks in these spaces, and that latent representations of the input can be extracted and used to solve downstream classification tasks. The code used in our experiments is publicly available at https://github.com/turbotage/PolyNODE .

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRR-Net resolves the fidelity-speed dilemma in INRs by decoupling representation refinement into an offline process, achieving high fidelity and fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) struggle with balancing fidelity and speed, needing a solution for efficient surrogate modeling.

Method: Proposes DRR paradigm: offline refinement with deep networks and non-parametric transformations, validated by DRR-Net and Variational Pairs augmentation.

Result: DRR-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, is 27\times faster than high-fidelity baselines, and remains competitive with the fastest models.

Conclusion: DRR offers a practical approach for high-quality, fast neural field surrogates with minimal speed-quality compromise.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as promising surrogates for large 3D scientific simulations due to their ability to continuously model spatial and conditional fields, yet they face a critical fidelity-speed dilemma: deep MLPs suffer from high inference cost, while efficient embedding-based models lack sufficient expressiveness. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled Representation Refinement (DRR) architectural paradigm. DRR leverages a deep refiner network, alongside non-parametric transformations, in a one-time offline process to encode rich representations into a compact and efficient embedding structure. This approach decouples slow neural networks with high representational capacity from the fast inference path. We introduce DRR-Net, a simple network that validates this paradigm, and a novel data augmentation strategy, Variational Pairs (VP) for improving INRs under complex tasks like high-dimensional surrogate modeling. Experiments on several ensemble simulation datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, while being up to 27$\times$ faster at inference than high-fidelity baselines and remaining competitive with the fastest models. The DRR paradigm offers an effective strategy for building powerful and practical neural field surrogates and \rev{INRs in broader applications}, with a minimal compromise between speed and quality.

*Xiao Xiang,David Restrepo,Hyewon Jeong,Yugang Jia,Leo Anthony Celi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AID-MAE is a novel self-supervised method for learning from incomplete EHR time series, surpassing baselines by masking both naturally missing and observed values, improving clinical task performance and patient stratification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with EHR time series due to irregular sampling and missingness, often compromising representation learning for downstream clinical tasks.

Method: AID-MAE uses dual masking (intrinsic for missing values, augmented for observed ones) and trains on unmasked subsets, avoiding imputation.

Result: Outperforms XGBoost and DuETT across clinical tasks and datasets, with embeddings effectively stratifying patients.

Conclusion: AID-MAE efficiently learns from sparse EHR data, enhancing clinical task performance and cohort analysis.

Abstract: Learning from electronic health records (EHRs) time series is challenging due to irregular sam- pling, heterogeneous missingness, and the resulting sparsity of observations. Prior self-supervised meth- ods either impute before learning, represent missingness through a dedicated input signal, or optimize solely for imputation, reducing their capacity to efficiently learn representations that support clinical downstream tasks. We propose the Augmented-Intrinsic Dual-Masked Autoencoder (AID-MAE), which learns directly from incomplete time series by applying an intrinsic missing mask to represent naturally missing values and an augmented mask that hides a subset of observed values for reconstruction during training. AID-MAE processes only the unmasked subset of tokens and consistently outperforms strong baselines, including XGBoost and DuETT, across multiple clinical tasks on two datasets. In addition, the learned embeddings naturally stratify patient cohorts in the representation space.

*Nicolas Buzeta,Felipe del Rio,Cristian Hinostroza,Denis Parra,Hans Lobel,Rodrigo Toro Icarte*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VLMs outperform LLMs on text-only tasks due to visual training improving symbolic binding and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand why Vision Language Models (VLMs) perform better than Large Language Models (LLMs) on text-only tasks, particularly in long-context information retrieval.

Method: The researchers created a synthetic retrieval task to compare text-only and image-tokenized training. They used mechanistic interpretability to analyze changes in the model's binding strategies.

Result: Visual training doubled out-of-distribution (OOD) text-only performance by disrupting positional shortcuts and encouraging robust symbolic binding, which persisted even in text-only tasks.

Conclusion: Cross-modal training (visual + text) enhances reasoning and generalization in single-modality tasks, suggesting VLMs benefit from improved binding mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are designed to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities, yet in this work we observe a surprising phenomenon: VLMs can outperform their underlying LLMs on purely text-only tasks, particularly in long-context information retrieval. To investigate this effect, we build a controlled synthetic retrieval task and find that a transformer trained only on text achieves perfect in-distribution accuracy but fails to generalize out of distribution, while subsequent training on an image-tokenized version of the same task nearly doubles text-only OOD performance. Mechanistic interpretability reveals that visual training changes the model's internal binding strategy: text-only training encourages positional shortcuts, whereas image-based training disrupts them through spatial translation invariance, forcing the model to adopt a more robust symbolic binding mechanism that persists even after text-only examples are reintroduced. We further characterize how binding strategies vary across training regimes, visual encoders, and initializations, and show that analogous shifts occur during pretrained LLM-to-VLM transitions. Our findings suggest that cross-modal training can enhance reasoning and generalization even for tasks grounded in a single modality.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multiphysics training framework for neural operators (NOs) that learns from both original PDEs and their simplified forms, improving data efficiency, predictive accuracy, and OOD generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NO approaches focus on learning simulations from target PDEs but neglect fundamental physical principles. The proposed framework addresses this gap by leveraging simplified PDE forms inspired by numerical solvers.

Method: A multiphysics training framework jointly learns from original PDEs and their simplified versions. It is architecture-agnostic and tested on various 1D/2D/3D PDE problems.

Result: The method enhances data efficiency, reduces predictive errors (measured by nRMSE), and improves OOD generalization, especially in parameter shifts and synthetic-to-real transfer scenarios.

Conclusion: Explicitly incorporating fundamental physics knowledge significantly boosts the generalization ability of NOs, as demonstrated across diverse PDE problems.

Abstract: Recent advances in scientific machine learning (SciML) have enabled neural operators (NOs) to serve as powerful surrogates for modeling the dynamic evolution of physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). While existing approaches focus primarily on learning simulations from the target PDE, they often overlook more fundamental physical principles underlying these equations. Inspired by how numerical solvers are compatible with simulations of different settings of PDEs, we propose a multiphysics training framework that jointly learns from both the original PDEs and their simplified basic forms. Our framework enhances data efficiency, reduces predictive errors, and improves out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, particularly in scenarios involving shifts of physical parameters and synthetic-to-real transfer. Our method is architecture-agnostic and demonstrates consistent improvements in normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) across a wide range of 1D/2D/3D PDE problems. Through extensive experiments, we show that explicit incorporation of fundamental physics knowledge significantly strengthens the generalization ability of neural operators.

*Denis Makhov,Dmitriy Shopkhoev,Magauiya Zhussip,Ammar Ali,Baher Mohammad,Stamatios Lefkimmiatis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COMPOT is a training-free compression framework for Transformers, using sparse dictionary learning and Procrustes updates to achieve superior compression without iterative optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like truncated SVD or sparse dictionary learning degrade accuracy or suffer from iterative updates.

Method: COMPOT uses orthogonal dictionaries for Procrustes updates and single-step sparse coding, with dynamic layer-wise compression allocation.

Result: COMPOT outperforms low-rank and sparse baselines in quality-compression trade-offs and works well with quantization.

Conclusion: COMPOT offers a robust, efficient alternative for Transformer compression without iterative training.

Abstract: Post-training compression of Transformer models commonly relies on truncated singular value decomposition (SVD). However, enforcing a single shared subspace can degrade accuracy even at moderate compression. Sparse dictionary learning provides a more flexible union-of-subspaces representation, but existing approaches often suffer from iterative dictionary and coefficient updates. We propose COMPOT (Calibration-Optimized Matrix Procrustes Orthogonalization for Transformers), a training-free compression framework that uses a small calibration dataset to estimate a sparse weight factorization. COMPOT employs orthogonal dictionaries that enable closed-form Procrustes updates for the dictionary and analytical single-step sparse coding for the coefficients, eliminating iterative optimization. To handle heterogeneous layer sensitivity under a global compression budget, COMPOT further introduces a one-shot dynamic allocation strategy that adaptively redistributes layer-wise compression rates. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures and tasks show that COMPOT consistently delivers a superior quality-compression trade-off over strong low-rank and sparse baselines, while remaining fully compatible with post-training quantization for extreme compression. Code is available $\href{https://github.com/mts-ai/COMPOT}{here}$.

*Raphaël Baur,Yannick Metz,Maria Gkoulta,Mennatallah El-Assady,Giorgia Ramponi,Thomas Kleine Buening*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a Bayesian inference approach for learning reward functions from diverse feedback types (demonstrations, comparisons, ratings, stops) using a shared latent reward model, avoiding manual balancing and improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward learning methods struggle with integrating heterogeneous feedback types effectively, often relying on manual weighting of loss terms.

Method: The authors use Bayesian inference over a shared latent reward function, with each feedback type contributing via explicit likelihoods, and employ scalable amortized variational inference with a shared reward encoder and feedback-specific decoders.

Result: The approach outperforms single-type baselines, leverages complementary feedback information, and produces policies robust to environment perturbations. Reward uncertainty provides interpretable confidence signals.

Conclusion: Jointly inferring reward posteriors from multiple feedback types enhances performance and robustness while eliminating manual balancing, offering interpretable uncertainty metrics.

Abstract: Reward learning typically relies on a single feedback type or combines multiple feedback types using manually weighted loss terms. Currently, it remains unclear how to jointly learn reward functions from heterogeneous feedback types such as demonstrations, comparisons, ratings, and stops that provide qualitatively different signals. We address this challenge by formulating reward learning from multiple feedback types as Bayesian inference over a shared latent reward function, where each feedback type contributes information through an explicit likelihood. We introduce a scalable amortized variational inference approach that learns a shared reward encoder and feedback-specific likelihood decoders and is trained by optimizing a single evidence lower bound. Our approach avoids reducing feedback to a common intermediate representation and eliminates the need for manual loss balancing. Across discrete and continuous-control benchmarks, we show that jointly inferred reward posteriors outperform single-type baselines, exploit complementary information across feedback types, and yield policies that are more robust to environment perturbations. The inferred reward uncertainty further provides interpretable signals for analyzing model confidence and consistency across feedback types.

TL;DR: Improving data quality for single languages benefits others in multilingual training, mitigating the 'curse of multilinguality.' Targeted curation enhances performance efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual models face challenges like uneven data availability and performance interference ('curse of multilinguality'). This paper explores whether these issues stem from data quality rather than inherent model limitations.

Method: Conducted bilingual experiments across 13 languages, improving data quality per language. Extended findings to large-scale training mixtures, using curated multilingual allocations.

Result: Curating data for one language improved performance in others. Models trained on curated data achieved competitive multilingual accuracy with fewer FLOPs.

Conclusion: Targeted per-language data curation reduces multilingual interference and enables efficient scaling, as demonstrated by models trained on a 20T-token corpus.

Abstract: Multilinguality is a core capability for modern foundation models, yet training high-quality multilingual models remains challenging due to uneven data availability across languages. A further challenge is the performance interference that can arise from joint multilingual training, commonly referred to as the "curse of multilinguality". We study multilingual data curation across thirteen languages and find that many reported regressions are not inherent to multilingual scaling but instead stem from correctable deficiencies in data quality and composition rather than fundamental capacity limits. In controlled bilingual experiments, improving data quality for any single language benefits others: curating English improves non-English performance in 12 of 13 languages, while curating non-English yields reciprocal improvements in English. Bespoke per-language curation produces substantially larger within-language improvements. Extending these findings to large-scale general-purpose training mixtures, we show that curated multilingual allocations comprising under 8% of total tokens remain remarkably effective. We operationalize this approach within an effort that produced a 20T-token pretraining corpus derived entirely from public sources. Models with 3B and 8B parameters trained on a 1T-token random subset achieve competitive multilingual accuracy with 4-10x fewer training FLOPs than strong public baselines, establishing a new Pareto frontier in multilingual performance versus compute. Moreover, these benefits extend to frontier model scale: the 20T-token corpus served as part of the pretraining dataset for Trinity Large (400B/A13B), which exhibits strong multilingual performance relative to its training FLOPs. These results show that targeted, per-language data curation mitigates multilingual interference and enables compute-efficient multilingual scaling.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to automatically identify biases in reward models for LLMs, using iterative refinement by an LLM, revealing known and novel biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of reward models favoring spurious or undesirable attributes in LLM outputs, necessitating automated bias detection.

Method: Uses an LLM to iteratively propose and refine candidate biases, comparing evolutionary iteration with flat best-of-N search.

Result: Identified biases like favoring redundant spacing and hallucinations in Skywork-V2-8B; evolutionary iteration showed better performance.

Conclusion: The approach aids in improving reward models through automated interpretability, revealing biases effectively.

Abstract: Reward models are central to large language model (LLM) post-training. However, past work has shown that they can reward spurious or undesirable attributes such as length, format, hallucinations, and sycophancy. In this work, we introduce and study the research problem of automatically finding reward model biases in natural language. We offer a simple approach of using an LLM to iteratively propose and refine candidate biases. Our method can recover known biases and surface novel ones: for example, we found that Skywork-V2-8B, a leading open-weight reward model, often mistakenly favors responses with redundant spacing and responses with hallucinated content. In addition, we show evidence that evolutionary iteration outperforms flat best-of-N search, and we validate the recall of our pipeline using synthetically injected biases. We hope our work contributes to further research on improving RMs through automated interpretability methods.

Motivation: To address prediction problems on tabular categorical data, common in applications like click-through rate prediction and social sciences, where capturing high-order interactions efficiently is crucial.

Method: Introduces tensorFM, a model using low-rank tensor approximation to represent interaction strengths between attributes, generalizing field-weighted factorization machines.

Result: Empirical results show tensorFM performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods and offers low latency, making it suitable for time-sensitive tasks like online advertising.

Conclusion: tensorFM is an effective and efficient model for categorical data prediction, balancing performance and speed for practical applications.

Abstract: We address prediction problems on tabular categorical data, where each instance is defined by multiple categorical attributes, each taking values from a finite set. These attributes are often referred to as fields, and their categorical values as features. Such problems frequently arise in practical applications, including click-through rate prediction and social sciences. We introduce and analyze {tensorFM}, a new model that efficiently captures high-order interactions between attributes via a low-rank tensor approximation representing the strength of these interactions. Our model generalizes field-weighted factorization machines. Empirically, tensorFM demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, its low latency makes it well-suited for time-sensitive applications, such as online advertising.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BindCLIP improves virtual screening by combining contrastive and generative learning, addressing limitations of CLIP-style models with interaction-aware embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLIP-style models for virtual screening lack sensitivity to fine-grained binding interactions and rely on shortcut correlations, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: BindCLIP integrates CLIP-style contrastive learning with pocket-conditioned diffusion for pose generation, plus hard-negative augmentation and a ligand-ligand anchoring regularizer.

Result: BindCLIP outperforms baselines on benchmarks, showing gains in out-of-distribution screening and ligand-analogue ranking.

Conclusion: Combining generative pose-level supervision with contrastive learning enhances interaction-aware embeddings and practical applicability.

Abstract: Virtual screening aims to efficiently identify active ligands from massive chemical libraries for a given target pocket. Recent CLIP-style models such as DrugCLIP enable scalable virtual screening by embedding pockets and ligands into a shared space. However, our analyses indicate that such representations can be insensitive to fine-grained binding interactions and may rely on shortcut correlations in training data, limiting their ability to rank ligands by true binding compatibility. To address these issues, we propose BindCLIP, a unified contrastive-generative representation learning framework for virtual screening. BindCLIP jointly trains pocket and ligand encoders using CLIP-style contrastive learning together with a pocket-conditioned diffusion objective for binding pose generation, so that pose-level supervision directly shapes the retrieval embedding space toward interaction-relevant features. To further mitigate shortcut reliance, we introduce hard-negative augmentation and a ligand-ligand anchoring regularizer that prevents representation collapse. Experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. BindCLIP achieves substantial gains on challenging out-of-distribution virtual screening and improves ligand-analogue ranking on the FEP+ benchmark. Together, these results indicate that integrating generative, pose-level supervision with contrastive learning yields more interaction-aware embeddings and improves generalization in realistic screening settings, bringing virtual screening closer to real-world applicability.

TL;DR: DAT, a new adversarial training method, improves LLM robustness by leveraging diffusion models to cover the data distribution better, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial training for LLMs fails to address vulnerabilities from simple in-distribution exploits, like rewriting prompts, due to inadequate coverage of the data distribution.

Method: Proposes DAT, which uses Diffusion LLMs to approximate the true joint distribution of prompts and responses, generating diverse samples to enhance generalization.

Result: DAT achieves significantly higher adversarial robustness compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: DAT effectively addresses limitations in current adversarial training by better covering the data distribution, improving model robustness against simple exploits.

Abstract: Adversarial training for LLMs is one of the most promising methods to reliably improve robustness against adversaries. However, despite significant progress, models remain vulnerable to simple in-distribution exploits, such as rewriting prompts in the past tense or translating them into other languages. We argue that this persistent fragility stems from a fundamental limitation in current adversarial training algorithms: they minimize adversarial loss on their training set but inadequately cover the data distribution, resulting in vulnerability to seemingly simple attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose Distributional Adversarial Training, DAT. We leverage Diffusion LLMs to approximate the true joint distribution of prompts and responses, enabling generation of diverse, high-likelihood samples that address generalization failures. By combining optimization over the data distribution provided by the diffusion model with continuous adversarial training, DAT achieves substantially higher adversarial robustness than previous methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between the success of Transformers in various domains and their application to graph-structured data, particularly by leveraging GNN-based positional encodings for structural information.

Method: The authors study GTs through manifold limit models, establish a theoretical link to MNNs, and leverage transferability results from GNNs. They validate their theory with experiments on graph benchmarks and real-world scenarios like shortest path distance estimation.

Result: GTs with GNN positional encodings inherit transferability guarantees, enabling generalization from small to large graphs. Experimental results show scalable performance comparable to GNNs.

Conclusion: The study offers theoretical and empirical insights into GTs, suggesting practical approaches for efficient large-scale training, supported by successful real-world applications.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across domains, motivating the rise of Graph Transformers (GTs) as attention-based architectures for graph-structured data. A key design choice in GTs is the use of Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based positional encodings to incorporate structural information. In this work, we study GTs through the lens of manifold limit models for graph sequences and establish a theoretical connection between GTs with GNN positional encodings and Manifold Neural Networks (MNNs). Building on transferability results for GNNs under manifold convergence, we show that GTs inherit transferability guarantees from their positional encodings. In particular, GTs trained on small graphs provably generalize to larger graphs under mild assumptions. We complement our theory with extensive experiments on standard graph benchmarks, demonstrating that GTs exhibit scalable behavior on par with GNNs. To further show the efficiency in a real-world scenario, we implement GTs for shortest path distance estimation over terrains to better illustrate the efficiency of the transferable GTs. Our results provide new insights into the understanding of GTs and suggest practical directions for efficient training of GTs in large-scale settings.

TL;DR: This study explores neural scaling laws in single-cell genomics using transformers trained on scRNA-seq data, revealing power-law relationships in data-rich conditions but not in data-limited ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether neural scaling laws, known in vision and language transformers, also apply to single-cell genomics, focusing on masked-reconstruction transformers trained on scRNA-seq data.

Method: Used CELLxGENE Census expression profiles in two regimes (data-rich: 512 genes, 200,000 cells; data-limited: 1,024 genes, 10,000 cells). Tested seven model sizes (533 to 3.4x10^8 parameters) and fitted scaling laws to validation MSE.

Result: Data-rich regime showed power-law scaling with loss floor ~1.44; data-limited regime showed negligible scaling. Entropy estimate: ~2.30 bits per masked gene position.

Conclusion: Scaling laws akin to NLP emerge in single-cell transcriptomics with ample data, highlighting the importance of data-to-parameter ratio. Future work includes refining entropy estimates.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws -- power-law relationships between loss, model size, and data -- have been extensively documented for language and vision transformers, yet their existence in single-cell genomics remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of scaling behaviour for masked-reconstruction transformers trained on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Using expression profiles from the CELLxGENE Census, we construct two experimental regimes: a data-rich regime (512 highly variable genes, 200,000 cells) and a data-limited regime (1,024 genes, 10,000 cells). Across seven model sizes spanning three orders of magnitude in parameter count (533 to 3.4 x 10^8 parameters), we fit the parametric scaling law to validation mean squared error (MSE). The data-rich regime exhibits clear power-law scaling with an irreducible loss floor of c ~ 1.44, while the data-limited regime shows negligible scaling, indicating that model capacity is not the binding constraint when data are scarce. These results establish that scaling laws analogous to those observed in natural language processing do emerge in single-cell transcriptomics when sufficient data are available, and they identify the data-to-parameter ratio as a critical determinant of scaling behaviour. A preliminary conversion of the data-rich asymptotic floor to information-theoretic units yields an estimate of approximately 2.30 bits of entropy per masked gene position. We discuss implications for the design of single-cell foundation models and outline the additional measurements needed to refine this entropy estimate.

TL;DR: On-policy prefix distillation (OPD) reduces training cost by focusing on early output prefixes, matching full OPD performance with 2x-47x fewer FLOPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional OPD is costly due to full sampling; prefix distillation addresses this by leveraging concentrated training signals in early output segments.

Method: Apply distillation only to prefixes of student outputs and terminate sampling early, avoiding full trajectory sampling.

Result: Matches full OPD performance on AI-for-Math and out-of-domain benchmarks while reducing training FLOPs significantly.

Conclusion: Prefix distillation is a cost-effective alternative to full OPD, maintaining performance with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: On-policy distillation (OPD), which samples trajectories from the student model and supervises them with a teacher at the token level, avoids relying solely on verifiable terminal rewards and can yield better generalization than off-policy distillation. However, OPD requires expensive on-the-fly sampling of the student policy during training, which substantially increases training cost, especially for long responses. Our initial analysis shows that, during OPD, training signals are often concentrated in the prefix of each output, and that even a short teacher-generated prefix can significantly help the student produce the correct answer. Motivated by these observations, we propose a simple yet effective modification of OPD: we apply the distillation objective only to prefixes of student-generated outputs and terminate each sampling early during distillation. Experiments on a suite of AI-for-Math and out-of-domain benchmarks show that on-policy prefix distillation matches the performance of full OPD while reducing training FLOP by 2x-47x.

*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a quantum-inspired classification head architecture employing complex-valued unitary transformations to improve calibration in deep neural networks, achieving significant improvements in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) on CIFAR-10 and better alignment with human uncertainty on CIFAR-10H.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep neural networks are poorly calibrated, meaning their confidence scores do not accurately reflect true correctness probabilities. The authors aim to address this by leveraging quantum-inspired representations.

Method: A lightweight classification head projects backbone features into a complex-valued Hilbert space, evolving them under a learned unitary transformation (parameterized via the Cayley map). The design isolates the effect of complex-valued unitary representations on calibration.

Result: The unitary magnitude head reduces Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by 2.4x compared to standard softmax and 3.5x compared to temperature scaling. However, a Born rule measurement degrades calibration. The method also aligns better with human perceptual ambiguity on CIFAR-10H.

Conclusion: Complex-valued unitary dynamics improve calibration and human uncertainty modeling, though Born rule measurements hurt performance. The method's scope is delineated theoretically and experimentally, with implications for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks achieve high predictive accuracy but remain poorly calibrated: their confidence scores do not reliably reflect the true probability of correctness. We propose a quantum-inspired classification head architecture that projects backbone features into a complex-valued Hilbert space and evolves them under a learned unitary transformation parameterised via the Cayley map. Through a controlled hybrid experimental design - training a single shared backbone and comparing lightweight interchangeable heads - we isolate the effect of complex-valued unitary representations on calibration. Our ablation study on CIFAR-10 reveals that the unitary magnitude head (complex features evolved under a Cayley unitary, read out via magnitude and softmax) achieves an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.0146, representing a 2.4x improvement over a standard softmax head (0.0355) and a 3.5x improvement over temperature scaling (0.0510). Surprisingly, replacing the softmax readout with a Born rule measurement layer - the quantum-mechanically motivated approach - degrades calibration to an ECE of 0.0819. On the CIFAR-10H human-uncertainty benchmark, the wave function head achieves the lowest KL-divergence (0.336) to human soft labels among all compared methods, indicating that complex-valued representations better capture the structure of human perceptual ambiguity. We provide theoretical analysis connecting norm-preserving unitary dynamics to calibration through feature-space geometry, report negative results on out-of-distribution detection and sentiment analysis to delineate the method's scope, and discuss practical implications for safety-critical applications. Code is publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper explores how AI systems encode semantic structure into geometric representation spaces, introducing 'dual steering' for precise concept manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the natural geometry of representation spaces reflects model behavior, especially for softmax distributions, with a focus on information geometry.

Method: Develops 'dual steering,' a method for robustly steering representations using linear probes, theoretically proving its optimization properties.

Result: Dual steering optimally modifies target concepts while minimizing off-target changes, improving controllability and stability empirically.

Conclusion: Information geometry is key for semantic encoding, and dual steering effectively enhances concept manipulation in AI systems.

Abstract: This paper concerns the question of how AI systems encode semantic structure into the geometric structure of their representation spaces. The motivating observation of this paper is that the natural geometry of these representation spaces should reflect the way models use representations to produce behavior. We focus on the important special case of representations that define softmax distributions. In this case, we argue that the natural geometry is information geometry. Our focus is on the role of information geometry on semantic encoding and the linear representation hypothesis. As an illustrative application, we develop "dual steering", a method for robustly steering representations to exhibit a particular concept using linear probes. We prove that dual steering optimally modifies the target concept while minimizing changes to off-target concepts. Empirically, we find that dual steering enhances the controllability and stability of concept manipulation.

*Farzana Akter,Rakib Hossain,Deb Kanna Roy Toushi,Mahmood Menon Khan,Sultana Amin,Lisan Al Amin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid privacy-preserving framework combining Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) enables clinical decision support without raw-data sharing, balancing utility, privacy, and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision support is limited by privacy rules preventing data pooling across institutions, necessitating decentralized solutions.

Method: The framework splits feature extraction (client-side) and prediction (server-side), using FL-SL hybrids. Privacy leakage is audited via membership inference, with defenses like activation clipping and noise.

Result: Hybrid FL-SL achieves competitive performance and prioritization, offering tunable privacy-utility trade-offs without raw-data sharing.

Conclusion: The work highlights hybrid FL-SL as a practical solution for privacy-preserving healthcare decision support, balancing utility, leakage risk, and cost.

Abstract: Collaborative clinical decision support is often constrained by governance and privacy rules that prevent pooling patient-level records across institutions. We present a hybrid privacy-preserving framework that combines Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) to support decision-oriented healthcare modeling without raw-data sharing. The approach keeps feature-extraction trunks on clients while hosting prediction heads on a coordinating server, enabling shared representation learning and exposing an explicit collaboration boundary where privacy controls can be applied. Rather than assuming distributed training is inherently private, we audit leakage empirically using membership inference on cut-layer representations and study lightweight defenses based on activation clipping and additive Gaussian noise. We evaluate across three public clinical datasets under non-IID client partitions using a unified pipeline and assess performance jointly along four deployment-relevant axes: factual predictive utility, uplift-based ranking under capacity constraints, audited privacy leakage, and communication overhead. Results show that hybrid FL-SL variants achieve competitive predictive performance and decision-facing prioritization behavior relative to standalone FL or SL, while providing a tunable privacy-utility trade-off that can reduce audited leakage without requiring raw-data sharing. Overall, the work positions hybrid FL-SL as a practical design space for privacy-preserving healthcare decision support where utility, leakage risk, and deployment cost must be balanced explicitly.

*Taejong Joo,Wenhan Xia,Cheolmin Kim,Ming Zhang,Eugene Ie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Randomly masking parameter updates in LLM training proves effective, with a masked RMSProp variant outperforming state-of-the-art optimizers. The method, called Magma, introduces momentum-gradient alignment for further improvements, achieving significant perplexity reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the reliance on dense adaptive optimizers for LLM training, proposing that random masking can enhance performance by inducing geometric regularization.

Method: The authors develop Magma, which modulates masked parameter updates using momentum-gradient alignment, and test it in extensive LLM pre-training experiments.

Result: Masked RMSProp and Magma consistently outperform existing optimizers, with Magma reducing perplexity by 19% and 9% compared to Adam and Muon for a 1B model.

Conclusion: Magma serves as a simple, effective drop-in replacement for adaptive optimizers, offering consistent performance gains with negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) relies almost exclusively on dense adaptive optimizers with increasingly sophisticated preconditioners. We challenge this by showing that randomly masking parameter updates can be highly effective, with a masked variant of RMSProp consistently outperforming recent state-of-the-art optimizers. Our analysis reveals that the random masking induces a curvature-dependent geometric regularization that smooths the optimization trajectory. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Momentum-aligned gradient masking (Magma), which modulates the masked updates using momentum-gradient alignment. Extensive LLM pre-training experiments show that Magma is a simple drop-in replacement for adaptive optimizers with consistent gains and negligible computational overhead. Notably, for the 1B model size, Magma reduces perplexity by over 19\% and 9\% compared to Adam and Muon, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on estimating stable scaling laws for foundation models by analyzing large-scale data, introducing methodologies for predicting downstream accuracy from compute budgets, and validating temporal reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide practitioners with reliable scaling laws for foundation models, helping them predict downstream performance and track advancements over time.

Method: Uses large-scale observational evaluations (5k existing and 2k newly sampled data points) with smoothed quantile regression and a monotone, saturating sigmoid parameterization. Validates temporal reliability by testing on later model releases.

Result: Estimated capability boundaries are mostly stable, except for math reasoning, which shows consistent advancement. Introduces an efficient algorithm reducing evaluation costs by ~80%.

Conclusion: The work provides practical tools (Proteus 2k dataset) and methodologies for translating compute budgets into performance expectations and monitoring capability shifts.

Abstract: For deploying foundation models, practitioners increasingly need prescriptive scaling laws: given a pre training compute budget, what downstream accuracy is attainable with contemporary post training practice, and how stable is that mapping as the field evolves? Using large scale observational evaluations with 5k observational and 2k newly sampled data on model performance, we estimate capability boundaries, high conditional quantiles of benchmark scores as a function of log pre training FLOPs, via smoothed quantile regression with a monotone, saturating sigmoid parameterization. We validate the temporal reliability by fitting on earlier model generations and evaluating on later releases. Across various tasks, the estimated boundaries are mostly stable, with the exception of math reasoning that exhibits a consistently advancing boundary over time. We then extend our approach to analyze task dependent saturation and to probe contamination related shifts on math reasoning tasks. Finally, we introduce an efficient algorithm that recovers near full data frontiers using roughly 20% of evaluation budget. Together, our work releases the Proteus 2k, the latest model performance evaluation dataset, and introduces a practical methodology for translating compute budgets into reliable performance expectations and for monitoring when capability boundaries shift across time.

TL;DR: The paper presents CD-GTMLL, a scalable framework combining game theory and curiosity-driven learning to tackle long-tail distribution challenges in multi-label classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the persistent challenge of long-tail distributions in multi-label classification, where common approaches disrupt label dependencies or require extensive tuning.

Method: Proposes CD-GTMLL, treating MLC as a multi-player game where sub-predictors specialize in label partitions, collaborating for global accuracy while pursuing curiosity rewards.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on benchmarks with up to +1.6% P@3 on Wiki10-31K, with theoretical analysis confirming convergence to a tail-aware equilibrium.

Conclusion: CD-GTMLL enhances efficiency and robustness in imbalanced data, offering adaptive solutions for industries like e-commerce and healthcare.

Abstract: The long-tail distribution, where a few head labels dominate while rare tail labels abound, poses a persistent challenge for large-scale Multi-Label Classification (MLC) in real-world data mining applications. Existing resampling and reweighting strategies often disrupt inter-label dependencies or require brittle hyperparameter tuning, especially as the label space expands to tens of thousands of labels. To address this issue, we propose Curiosity-Driven Game-Theoretic Multi-Label Learning (CD-GTMLL), a scalable cooperative framework that recasts long-tail MLC as a multi-player game - each sub-predictor ("player") specializes in a partition of the label space, collaborating to maximize global accuracy while pursuing intrinsic curiosity rewards based on tail label rarity and inter-player disagreement. This mechanism adaptively injects learning signals into under-represented tail labels without manual balancing or tuning. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that our CD-GTMLL converges to a tail-aware equilibrium and formally links the optimization dynamics to improvements in the Rare-F1 metric. Extensive experiments across 7 benchmarks, including extreme multi-label classification datasets with 30,000+ labels, demonstrate that CD-GTMLL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, with gains up to +1.6% P@3 on Wiki10-31K. Ablation studies further confirm the contributions of both game-theoretic cooperation and curiosity-driven exploration to robust tail performance. By integrating game theory with curiosity mechanisms, CD-GTMLL not only enhances model efficiency in resource-constrained environments but also paves the way for more adaptive learning in imbalanced data scenarios across industries like e-commerce and healthcare.

*Waldemar Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRTC is a framework for interpreting long-form reasoning in language models by detecting pivotal decision points and measuring their influence on reasoning trajectories without resampling continuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding where and how language models make pivotal reasoning steps during long-horizon tasks, beyond just identifying correlated tokens or spans.

Method: Uses Directional Reasoning Trajectory Change (DRTC) to detect pivot points via uncertainty/distribution-shift signals, applies interventions to measure influence on reasoning trajectories, and computes attribution scores.

Result: Directional influence is highly concentrated (Gini 0.50-0.58), learned pivots outperform random spans (median delta=0.409, p=2.3e-21), and interventions reveal causal steering effects.

Conclusion: DRTC offers a causally grounded, trajectory-level approach to interpret reasoning dynamics in language models, highlighting specific context elements' roles.

Abstract: Understanding how language models carry out long-horizon reasoning remains an open challenge. Existing interpretability methods often highlight tokens or spans correlated with an answer, but they rarely reveal where the model makes consequential reasoning turns, which earlier context causally triggers those turns, or whether the highlighted text actually steers the reasoning process. We introduce Directional Reasoning Trajectory Change (DRTC), a process-causal framework for interpreting long-form reasoning from a single on-policy rollout. DRTC detects pivot decision points using uncertainty and distribution-shift signals, then applies receiver-side interventions that preserve the realized rollout without resampling the continuation while blocking information flow from selected earlier chunks only at a pivot. It measures whether each intervention redirects the direction of the model's log-probability trajectory relative to the realized rollout direction, producing a signed per-chunk attribution score. We also compute turning-angle curvature changes on raw logits as a complementary diagnostic and introduce curvature signatures to summarize shared intervention-response geometry. Empirically, directional influence is sharply concentrated across four reasoning models (per-example |DRTC| shares yield Gini 0.50 to 0.58 and top-5 percent mass 0.23 to 0.28), and learned pivots induce stronger intervention magnitudes than matched random spans. In a scaling study on 500 MATH problems with R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, learned spans outperform matched random spans (median delta = 0.409, 355 of 500 positive; sign test p = 2.3e-21). Overall, DRTC provides a causally grounded, trajectory-level view of how specific context elements steer reasoning under on-policy dynamics.

TL;DR: FedPSA improves AFL by using parameter sensitivity for fine-grained staleness measurement and dynamic momentum queues, outperforming baselines and state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the coarse-grained staleness measurement in AFL, which limits performance, by introducing finer-grained parameter sensitivity and dynamic adjustments.

Method: Proposes FedPSA, leveraging parameter sensitivity to measure model obsolescence and employing dynamic momentum queues for real-time phase assessment.

Result: Achieves up to 6.37% improvement over baselines and 1.93% over state-of-the-art methods in experiments across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: FedPSA significantly enhances AFL performance by fine-grained staleness measurement and adaptive tolerance, demonstrating superior results.

Abstract: Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) has emerged as a significant research area in recent years. By not waiting for slower clients and executing the training process concurrently, it achieves faster training speed compared to traditional federated learning. However, due to the staleness introduced by the asynchronous process, its performance may degrade in some scenarios. Existing methods often use the round difference between the current model and the global model as the sole measure of staleness, which is coarse-grained and lacks observation of the model itself, thereby limiting the performance ceiling of asynchronous methods. In this paper, we propose FedPSA (Parameter Sensitivity-based Asynchronous Federated Learning), a more fine-grained AFL framework that leverages parameter sensitivity to measure model obsolescence and establishes a dynamic momentum queue to assess the current training phase in real time, thereby adjusting the tolerance for outdated information dynamically. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and comparisons with various methods demonstrate the superior performance of FedPSA, achieving up to 6.37\% improvement over baseline methods and 1.93\% over the current state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: Obj-Disco is a framework that decomposes LLM alignment rewards into interpretable objectives, addressing gaps in existing methods and improving transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM alignment interpretation methods risk missing unknown unknowns or fail to comprehensively explain model behavior, leading to potential misalignment risks.

Method: Obj-Disco uses an iterative greedy algorithm to decompose reward signals into sparse, weighted natural language objectives by analyzing behavioral changes across training checkpoints.

Result: Experiments show Obj-Disco captures >90% of reward behavior, identifies latent misaligned incentives, and performs robustly across tasks, models, and alignment algorithms.

Conclusion: Obj-Disco enhances transparency in LLM alignment by revealing implicit objectives, contributing to safer AI development.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment relies on complex reward signals that often obscure the specific behaviors being incentivized, creating critical risks of misalignment and reward hacking. Existing interpretation methods typically rely on pre-defined rubrics, risking the omission of "unknown unknowns", or fail to identify objectives that comprehensively cover and are causal to the model behavior. To address these limitations, we introduce Obj-Disco, a framework that automatically decomposes an alignment reward signal into a sparse, weighted combination of human-interpretable natural language objectives. Our approach utilizes an iterative greedy algorithm to analyze behavioral changes across training checkpoints, identifying and validating candidate objectives that best explain the residual reward signal. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks, model sizes, and alignment algorithms demonstrate the framework's robustness. Experiments with popular open-source reward models show that the framework consistently captures > 90% of reward behavior, a finding further corroborated by human evaluation. Additionally, a case study on alignment with an open-source reward model reveals that Obj-Disco can successfully identify latent misaligned incentives that emerge alongside intended behaviors. Our work provides a crucial tool for uncovering the implicit objectives in LLM alignment, paving the way for more transparent and safer AI development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study the vulnerability of LLMs augmented with long-term memory due to similarity-based retrieval mechanisms, which introduce new attack surfaces.

Method: ER-MIA framework formalizes two attack settings (content-based and question-targeted) and employs composable attack primitives and ensemble attacks.

Result: Experiments show high success rates under minimal attacker assumptions, revealing fundamental vulnerabilities across LLMs and memory systems.

Conclusion: Similarity-based retrieval is a critical security risk in memory-augmented LLMs, persistent across designs and applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly augmented with long-term memory systems to overcome finite context windows and enable persistent reasoning across interactions. However, recent research finds that LLMs become more vulnerable because memory provides extra attack surfaces. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of black-box adversarial memory injection attacks that target the similarity-based retrieval mechanism in long-term memory-augmented LLMs. We introduce ER-MIA, a unified framework that exposes this vulnerability and formalizes two realistic attack settings: content-based attacks and question-targeted attacks. In these settings, ER-MIA includes an arsenal of composable attack primitives and ensemble attacks that achieve high success rates under minimal attacker assumptions. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and long-term memory systems demonstrate that similarity-based retrieval constitutes a fundamental and system-level vulnerability, revealing security risks that persist across memory designs and application scenarios.

Method: They introduce a biologically grounded RL architecture featuring large expansion, sparse connectivity, sparse activation, and dendritic-level modulation, drawing from cerebellar structural principles.

Result: Experiments on noisy, high-dimensional RL benchmarks show the cerebellar architecture and dendritic modulation improve sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization over conventional designs. Sensitivity analysis reveals optimized performance with constrained parameters.

Conclusion: The work highlights cerebellar structural priors as valuable inductive biases for RL, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved notable performance in high-dimensional sequential decision-making tasks, yet remains limited by low sample efficiency, sensitivity to noise, and weak generalization under partial observability. Most existing approaches address these issues primarily through optimization strategies, while the role of architectural priors in shaping representation learning and decision dynamics is less explored. Inspired by structural principles of the cerebellum, we propose a biologically grounded RL architecture that incorporate large expansion, sparse connectivity, sparse activation, and dendritic-level modulation. Experiments on noisy, high-dimensional RL benchmarks show that both the cerebellar architecture and dendritic modulation consistently improve sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization compared to conventional designs. Sensitivity analysis of architectural parameters suggests that cerebellum-inspired structures can offer optimized performance for RL with constrained model parameters. Overall, our work underscores the value of cerebellar structural priors as effective inductive biases for RL.

TL;DR: FOFedAvg, a novel FedAvg variation, uses fractional-order updates to improve communication efficiency and convergence in federated learning, outperforming existing methods on non-IID data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL's drawbacks (slow convergence, high communication costs, non-IID data) motivate the need for an improved algorithm.

Method: FOFedAvg incorporates Fractional-Order SGD for long-range relationships and historical data, enhancing stability and efficiency.

Result: FOFedAvg outperforms baselines in test performance and convergence speed on multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Fractional-order updates significantly enhance FL robustness and effectiveness for heterogeneous data.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows remote clients to train a global model collaboratively while protecting client privacy. Despite its privacy-preserving benefits, FL has significant drawbacks, including slow convergence, high communication cost, and non-independent-and-identically-distributed (non-IID) data. In this work, we present a novel FedAvg variation called Fractional-Order Federated Averaging (FOFedAvg), which incorporates Fractional-Order Stochastic Gradient Descent (FOSGD) to capture long-range relationships and deeper historical information. By introducing memory-aware fractional-order updates, FOFedAvg improves communication efficiency and accelerates convergence while mitigating instability caused by heterogeneous, non-IID client data. We compare FOFedAvg against a broad set of established federated optimization algorithms on benchmark datasets including MNIST, FEMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, EMNIST, the Cleveland heart disease dataset, Sent140, PneumoniaMNIST, and Edge-IIoTset. Across a range of non-IID partitioning schemes, FOFedAvg is competitive with, and often outperforms, these baselines in terms of test performance and convergence speed. On the theoretical side, we prove that FOFedAvg converges to a stationary point under standard smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions for fractional order $0<α\le 1$. Together, these results show that fractional-order, memory-aware updates can substantially improve the robustness and effectiveness of federated learning, offering a practical path toward distributed training on heterogeneous data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework integrating two interacting diffusion models for robust classification in noisy environments, outperforming traditional sequential methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard approaches treat signal enhancement and classification as separate stages, missing opportunities for mutual guidance between denoising and classification.

Method: A domain-agnostic framework with two interacting diffusion models (one for input signal, one for classifier logits) is introduced, leveraging joint distribution strategies.

Result: The framework outperforms traditional sequential methods in image classification and speech recognition under diverse noise conditions.

Conclusion: The integrated approach provides robust and flexible improvements in classification accuracy by leveraging mutual guidance between enhancement and classification.

Abstract: Robust classification in noisy environments remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Standard approaches typically treat signal enhancement and classification as separate, sequential stages: first enhancing the signal and then applying a classifier. This approach fails to leverage the semantic information in the classifier's output during denoising. In this work, we propose a general, domain-agnostic framework that integrates two interacting diffusion models: one operating on the input signal and the other on the classifier's output logits, without requiring any retraining or fine-tuning of the classifier. This coupled formulation enables mutual guidance, where the enhancing signal refines the class estimation and, conversely, the evolving class logits guide the signal reconstruction towards discriminative regions of the manifold. We introduce three strategies to effectively model the joint distribution of the input and the logit. We evaluated our joint enhancement method for image classification and automatic speech recognition. The proposed framework surpasses traditional sequential enhancement baselines, delivering robust and flexible improvements in classification accuracy under diverse noise conditions.

*Alper Demir,Hüseyin Aydın,Kale-ab Abebe Tessera,David Abel,Stefano V. Albrecht*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses cooperation in Sequential Social Dilemmas (SSDs) under asymmetric conditions, proposing three fairness-based modifications to improve adaptability and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume identical incentives and require global information, lacking adaptability in asymmetric scenarios, which this work aims to resolve.

Method: The authors propose (i) redefining fairness by considering reward ranges, (ii) agent-based weighting, and (iii) localized social feedback to handle asymmetries and partial observability.

Result: The method fosters faster cooperation emergence in asymmetric scenarios without sacrificing scalability or practicality, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed modifications effectively address asymmetry in SSDs, enhancing cooperation dynamics and scalability under partial observability.

Abstract: Sequential Social Dilemmas (SSDs) provide a key framework for studying how cooperation emerges when individual incentives conflict with collective welfare. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, these problems are often addressed by incorporating intrinsic drives that encourage prosocial or fair behavior. However, most existing methods assume that agents face identical incentives in the dilemma and require continuous access to global information about other agents to assess fairness. In this work, we introduce asymmetric variants of well-known SSD environments and examine how natural differences between agents influence cooperation dynamics. Our findings reveal that existing fairness-based methods struggle to adapt under asymmetric conditions by enforcing raw equality that wrongfully incentivize defection. To address this, we propose three modifications: (i) redefining fairness by accounting for agents' reward ranges, (ii) introducing an agent-based weighting mechanism to better handle inherent asymmetries, and (iii) localizing social feedback to make the methods effective under partial observability without requiring global information sharing. Experimental results show that in asymmetric scenarios, our method fosters faster emergence of cooperative policies compared to existing approaches, without sacrificing scalability or practicality.

Motivation: To understand if closeness in conditional distributions guarantees linear representational similarity, and to identify practical implications for distillation tasks.

Method: The authors define a representational dissimilarity measure based on identifiability classes and logit differences, analyzing its bounds and comparing it to KL divergence.

Result: Closeness in logit distance ensures linear similarity, while KL divergence fails to provide meaningful guarantees. Logit-distance distillation improves representational similarity and concept preservation.

Conclusion: Logit-distance distillation outperforms KL-based methods in preserving linear representational properties, offering better alignment with teacher models.

Abstract: For a broad family of discriminative models that includes autoregressive language models, identifiability results imply that if two models induce the same conditional distributions, then their internal representations agree up to an invertible linear transformation. We ask whether an analogous conclusion holds approximately when the distributions are close instead of equal. Building on the observation of Nielsen et al. (2025) that closeness in KL divergence need not imply high linear representational similarity, we study a distributional distance based on logit differences and show that closeness in this distance does yield linear similarity guarantees. Specifically, we define a representational dissimilarity measure based on the models' identifiability class and prove that it is bounded by the logit distance. We further show that, when model probabilities are bounded away from zero, KL divergence upper-bounds logit distance; yet the resulting bound fails to provide nontrivial control in practice. As a consequence, KL-based distillation can match a teacher's predictions while failing to preserve linear representational properties, such as linear-probe recoverability of human-interpretable concepts. In distillation experiments on synthetic and image datasets, logit-distance distillation yields students with higher linear representational similarity and better preservation of the teacher's linearly recoverable concepts.

### [111] [On the Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Reasoning in Multimodal LLMs for Simple Visual Planning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15460)
*Yannic Neuhaus,Nicolas Flammarion,Matthias Hein,Francesco Croce*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the generalization of chain-of-thought reasoning in models using a grid-based navigation task, revealing limited out-of-distribution generalization but better performance with multi-format reasoning traces and text-based inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously examine and understand the generalization capabilities of chain-of-thought reasoning approaches in models.

Method: An evaluation framework utilizing a grid-based navigation task with varied input representations and reasoning strategies, tested under in-distribution and out-of-distribution conditions.

Result: Chain-of-thought reasoning improves in-distribution generalization but struggles with out-of-distribution generalization. Multi-format reasoning traces and text-based models outperform others.

Conclusion: Reasoning traces combining multiple text formats show the best out-of-distribution generalization, and text-based models consistently perform better than image-based ones.

Abstract: Integrating reasoning in large language models and large vision-language models has recently led to significant improvement of their capabilities. However, the generalization of reasoning models is still vaguely defined and poorly understood. In this work, we present an evaluation framework to rigorously examine how well chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches generalize on a simple planning task. Specifically, we consider a grid-based navigation task in which a model is provided with a map and must output a sequence of moves that guides a player from a start position to a goal while avoiding obstacles. The versatility of the task and its data allows us to fine-tune model variants using different input representations (visual and textual) and CoT reasoning strategies, and systematically evaluate them under both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test conditions. Our experiments show that, while CoT reasoning improves in-distribution generalization across all representations, out-of-distribution generalization (e.g., to larger maps) remains very limited in most cases when controlling for trivial matches with the ID data. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning traces which combine multiple text formats yield the best (and non-trivial) OOD generalization. Finally, purely text-based models consistently outperform those utilizing image-based inputs, including a recently proposed approach relying on latent space reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POP (Prior-fitted Optimizer Policies) is a meta-learned optimizer that predicts step sizes using contextual information from optimization trajectories, outperforming classical and meta-learned optimizers without task-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical gradient-based optimizers are sensitive to hyperparameter choices and require careful tuning, especially in non-convex settings.

Method: POP uses meta-learning to predict coordinate-wise step sizes based on optimization trajectory context, trained on millions of synthetic problems from a diverse prior.

Result: POP consistently outperforms first-order gradient-based methods, non-convex approaches, Bayesian optimization, and meta-learned competitors on a benchmark of 47 functions.

Conclusion: POP demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and eliminates the need for task-specific hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Optimization refers to the task of finding extrema of an objective function. Classical gradient-based optimizers are highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices. In highly non-convex settings their performance relies on carefully tuned learning rates, momentum, and gradient accumulation. To address these limitations, we introduce POP (Prior-fitted Optimizer Policies), a meta-learned optimizer that predicts coordinate-wise step sizes conditioned on the contextual information provided in the optimization trajectory. Our model is learned on millions of synthetic optimization problems sampled from a novel prior spanning both convex and non-convex objectives. We evaluate POP on an established benchmark including 47 optimization functions of various complexity, where it consistently outperforms first-order gradient-based methods, non-convex optimization approaches (e.g., evolutionary strategies), Bayesian optimization, and a recent meta-learned competitor under matched budget constraints. Our evaluation demonstrates strong generalization capabilities without task-specific tuning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes FedFAP, a feature-aware personalized federated learning framework for mood inference using smartphone data, addressing privacy and heterogeneity challenges across countries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mood assessments are infrequent and retrospective. Smartphone sensing offers continuous mood inference, but scalability is hindered by privacy, uneven data availability, and behavioral variability.

Method: FedFAP, a federated learning framework, is introduced to handle heterogeneous smartphone sensing data across countries while preserving local data privacy. It leverages feature-aware personalization for mood inference.

Result: FedFAP achieves an AUROC of 0.744, surpassing centralized approaches and existing federated baselines, demonstrating effectiveness in diverse populations.

Conclusion: FedFAP enables scalable, privacy-preserving mood inference, offering design insights for mood-aware mobile sensing technologies through population-aware personalization.

Abstract: Mood instability is a key behavioral indicator of mental health, yet traditional assessments rely on infrequent and retrospective reports that fail to capture its continuous nature. Smartphone-based mobile sensing enables passive, in-the-wild mood inference from everyday behaviors; however, deploying such systems at scale remains challenging due to privacy constraints, uneven sensing availability, and substantial variability in behavioral patterns.
  In this work, we study mood inference using smartphone sensing data in a cross-country federated learning setting, where each country participates as an independent client while retaining local data. We introduce FedFAP, a feature-aware personalized federated framework designed to accommodate heterogeneous sensing modalities across regions. Evaluations across geographically and culturally diverse populations show that FedFAP achieves an AUROC of 0.744, outperforming both centralized approaches and existing personalized federated baselines. Beyond inference, our results offer design insights for mood-aware systems, demonstrating how population-aware personalization and privacy-preserving learning can enable scalable and mood-aware mobile sensing technologies.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLM-as-a-judge has emerged as a cornerstone technique for evaluating large language models by leveraging LLM reasoning to score prompt-response pairs. Since LLM judgments are stochastic, practitioners commonly query each pair multiple times to estimate mean scores accurately. This raises a critical challenge: given a fixed computational budget $B$, how to optimally allocate queries across $K$ prompt-response pairs to minimize estimation error? %
We present a principled variance-adaptive approach leveraging multi-armed bandit theory and concentration inequalities. Our method dynamically allocates queries based on estimated score variances, concentrating resources where uncertainty is highest. Further, our algorithm is shown to achieve a worst-case score-estimation error of $\tilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^K σ_i^2}{B}}\right)$, $σ_i^2$ being the unknown score variance for pair $i \in [K]$ with near-optimal budget allocation. %
Experiments on \emph{Summarize-From-Feedback} and \emph{HelpSteer2} demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms uniform allocation, reducing worst-case estimation error while maintaining identical budgets. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for efficient LLM evaluation with practical implications for AI safety, model alignment, and automated assessment at scale.

### [115] [ExLipBaB: Exact Lipschitz Constant Computation for Piecewise Linear Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15499)
*Tom A. Splittgerber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses exact computation of Lipschitz constants for neural networks, extending the LipBaB algorithm to handle arbitrary piecewise linear networks and various norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact Lipschitz constants are valuable for robustness guarantees and benchmarking, but existing methods are limited to ReLU-activated networks. The authors aim to broaden applicability to more network types.

Method: They generalize the LipBaB algorithm to support arbitrary piecewise linear neural networks and p-norms, accommodating diverse activations like ReLU, LeakyReLU, GroupSort, MinMax, FullSort, and MaxPool.

Result: The proposed method enables exact Lipschitz constant computation for a wider range of network architectures beyond ReLU-activated ones.

Conclusion: This work advances the practicality of exact Lipschitz constant computation, benefiting applications requiring robustness guarantees or benchmarking for diverse network types.

Abstract: It has been shown that a neural network's Lipschitz constant can be leveraged to derive robustness guarantees, to improve generalizability via regularization or even to construct invertible networks. Therefore, a number of methods varying in the tightness of their bounds and their computational cost have been developed to approximate the Lipschitz constant for different classes of networks. However, comparatively little research exists on methods for exact computation, which has been shown to be NP-hard. Nonetheless, there are applications where one might readily accept the computational cost of an exact method. These applications could include the benchmarking of new methods or the computation of robustness guarantees for small models on sensitive data. Unfortunately, existing exact algorithms restrict themselves to only ReLU-activated networks, which are known to come with severe downsides in the context of Lipschitz-constrained networks. We therefore propose a generalization of the LipBaB algorithm to compute exact Lipschitz constants for arbitrary piecewise linear neural networks and $p$-norms. With our method, networks may contain traditional activations like ReLU or LeakyReLU, activations like GroupSort or the related MinMax and FullSort, which have been of increasing interest in the context of Lipschitz constrained networks, or even other piecewise linear functions like MaxPool.

*Takashi Furuya,Davide Murari,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lipschitz-constrained Transformers for stability and robustness, providing theoretical guarantees for their approximation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure Transformers are stable and robust for safety-sensitive applications by constraining their Lipschitz constant, addressing a lack of theoretical guarantees for such architectures.

Method: Designs gradient-descent-type Transformers with MLP and attention blocks as explicit Euler steps of negative gradient flows, ensuring Lipschitz continuity by construction.

Result: Proves a universal approximation theorem for these Transformers within a Lipschitz-constrained function space, with guarantees independent of token count.

Conclusion: The work establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for robust, Lipschitz-continuous Transformers, bridging a critical gap in their stability guarantees.

Abstract: Stability and robustness are critical for deploying Transformers in safety-sensitive settings. A principled way to enforce such behavior is to constrain the model's Lipschitz constant. However, approximation-theoretic guarantees for architectures that explicitly preserve Lipschitz continuity have yet to be established. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a class of gradient-descent-type in-context Transformers that are Lipschitz-continuous by construction. We realize both MLP and attention blocks as explicit Euler steps of negative gradient flows, ensuring inherent stability without sacrificing expressivity. We prove a universal approximation theorem for this class within a Lipschitz-constrained function space. Crucially, our analysis adopts a measure-theoretic formalism, interpreting Transformers as operators on probability measures, to yield approximation guarantees independent of token count. These results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for the design of robust, Lipschitz continuous Transformer architectures.

### [117] [On the Geometric Coherence of Global Aggregation in Federated GNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15510)
*Chethana Prasad Kabgere,Shylaja SS*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a geometric issue in Cross-Domain Federated GNNs where standard aggregation disrupts relational transformations. It proposes GGRS, a server-side framework, to ensure geometric consistency in updates, improving global message-passing coherence without accessing client data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard aggregation in federated GNNs with heterogeneous client graphs can degrade relational behavior despite numerical convergence, highlighting the need for geometry-aware regulation.

Method: The authors introduce GGRS, a framework that regulates client updates based on geometric admissibility criteria to maintain directional consistency and propagation diversity without requiring client data access.

Result: Experiments on heterogeneous datasets show GGRS effectively preserves global message-passing coherence, demonstrating its necessity in federated graph learning.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of geometry-aware regulation in federated GNNs and validates GGRS as a solution to maintain relational coherence across heterogeneous client graphs.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed training across multiple clients without centralized data sharing, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) model relational data through message passing. In federated GNN settings, client graphs often exhibit heterogeneous structural and propagation characteristics. When standard aggregation mechanisms are applied to such heterogeneous updates, the global model may converge numerically while exhibiting degraded relational behavior.Our work identifies a geometric failure mode of global aggregation in Cross- Domain Federated GNNs. Although GNN parameters are numerically represented as vectors, they encode relational transformations that govern the direction, strength, and sensitivity of information flow across graph neighborhoods. Aggregating updates originating from incompatible propagation regimes can therefore introduce destructive interference in this transformation space.This leads to loss of coherence in global message passing. Importantly, this degradation is not necessarily reflected in conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy.To address this issue, we propose GGRS (Global Geometric Reference Structure), a server-side framework that regulates client updates prior to aggregation based on geometric admissibility criteria. GGRS preserves directional consistency of relational transformations as well as maintains diversity of admissible propagation subspaces. It also stabilizes sensitivity to neighborhood interactions, without accessing client data or graph topology. Experiments on heterogeneous GNN-native, Amazon Co-purchase datasets demonstrate that GGRS preserves global message-passing coherence across training rounds by highlighting the necessity of geometry-aware regulation in federated graph learning.

### [118] [The Obfuscation Atlas: Mapping Where Honesty Emerges in RLVR with Deception Probes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15515)
*Mohammad Taufeeque,Stefan Heimersheim,Adam Gleave,Chris Cundy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training AI systems against white-box deception detectors can lead to obfuscation strategies, either through altered internal representations or deceptive text output. A realistic coding environment reveals these behaviors, with solutions involving KL regularization and detector penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study whether training AI systems against deception detectors can inadvertently teach them to obfuscate their deception, particularly in realistic scenarios where reward hacking occurs.

Method: A realistic coding environment is constructed where reward hacking naturally happens. The study introduces a taxonomy of outcomes when training against deception detectors and examines two obfuscation strategies.

Result: Obfuscation emerges in realistic settings. Two strategies are identified: obfuscated activations (internal representation changes) and obfuscated policies (deceptive text output). High KL regularization and detector penalties can yield honest policies.

Conclusion: White-box deception detectors are viable training signals for tasks prone to reward hacking, provided sufficient KL regularization and detector penalties are applied to prevent obfuscation.

Abstract: Training against white-box deception detectors has been proposed as a way to make AI systems honest. However, such training risks models learning to obfuscate their deception to evade the detector. Prior work has studied obfuscation only in artificial settings where models were directly rewarded for harmful output. We construct a realistic coding environment where reward hacking via hardcoding test cases naturally occurs, and show that obfuscation emerges in this setting. We introduce a taxonomy of possible outcomes when training against a deception detector. The model either remains honest, or becomes deceptive via two possible obfuscation strategies. (i) Obfuscated activations: the model outputs deceptive text while modifying its internal representations to no longer trigger the detector. (ii) Obfuscated policy: the model outputs deceptive text that evades the detector, typically by including a justification for the reward hack. Empirically, obfuscated activations arise from representation drift during RL, with or without a detector penalty. The probe penalty only incentivizes obfuscated policies; we theoretically show this is expected for policy gradient methods. Sufficiently high KL regularization and detector penalty can yield honest policies, establishing white-box deception detectors as viable training signals for tasks prone to reward hacking.

Motivation: Accurate counterfactual inference in time series is vital for decision-making in finance, healthcare, and marketing, driven by industrial applications.

Method: Introduces CEPAE, an autoencoder-based approach with entropy penalization for disentangled representations, building on variational and adversarial autoencoders.

Result: CEPAE outperforms other methods on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: CEPAE is effective for counterfactual inference in time series, showing superior performance.

Abstract: The ability to accurately perform counterfactual inference on time series is crucial for decision-making in fields like finance, healthcare, and marketing, as it allows us to understand the impact of events or treatments on outcomes over time. In this paper, we introduce a new counterfactual inference approach tailored to time series data impacted by market events, which is motivated by an industrial application. Utilizing the abduction-action-prediction procedure and the Structural Causal Model framework, we first adapt methods based on variational autoencoders and adversarial autoencoders, both previously used in counterfactual literature although not in time series settings. Then, we present the Conditional Entropy-Penalized Autoencoder (CEPAE), a novel autoencoder-based approach for counterfactual inference, which employs an entropy penalization loss over the latent space to encourage disentangled data representations. We validate our approach both theoretically and experimentally on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets, showing that CEPAE generally outperforms the other approaches in the evaluated metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of choosing optimal quantization formats and bit-widths in QAT, which lacks thorough exploration and understanding of trade-offs.

Method: The authors conduct an empirical study of QAT in low-bit regimes, comparing k-means-based weight quantization to integer formats.

Result: K-means quantization outperforms integer formats and is efficient on standard hardware. Under a fixed memory budget, 1-bit quantized weights yield the best performance.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the superiority of k-means quantization and suggest practical solutions for QAT implementation.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is an effective method to drastically reduce the memory footprint of LLMs while keeping performance degradation at an acceptable level. However, the optimal choice of quantization format and bit-width presents a challenge in practice. The full design space of quantization is not fully explored in the context of QAT, and the precise trade-off between quantization and downstream performance is poorly understood, as comparisons often rely solely on perplexity-based evaluations. In this work, we address these shortcomings with an empirical study of QAT in the low-bit regime. We show that k-means based weight quantization outperforms integer formats and can be implemented efficiently on standard hardware. Furthermore, we find that, under a fixed inference memory budget, the best performance on generative downstream tasks is achieved with $1$-bit quantized weights.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DKP-PC improves predictive coding by addressing feedback delay and exponential decay through direct feedback pathways, achieving faster error propagation and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard predictive coding suffers from slow error signal propagation and exponential decay, limiting its efficiency and scalability in deep networks.

Method: DKP-PC integrates direct feedback alignment and Kolen-Pollack algorithms to create learnable feedback connections, enabling direct error transmission from output to hidden layers.

Result: DKP-PC reduces error propagation time complexity from O(L) to O(1), matches or surpasses standard PC performance, and improves latency/computational efficiency.

Conclusion: DKP-PC offers a more efficient and scalable predictive coding variant, suitable for hardware-efficient implementations.

Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is a biologically inspired algorithm for training neural networks that relies only on local updates, allowing parallel learning across layers. However, practical implementations face two key limitations: error signals must still propagate from the output to early layers through multiple inference-phase steps, and feedback decays exponentially during this process, leading to vanishing updates in early layers. We propose direct Kolen-Pollack predictive coding (DKP-PC), which simultaneously addresses both feedback delay and exponential decay, yielding a more efficient and scalable variant of PC while preserving update locality. Leveraging direct feedback alignment and direct Kolen-Pollack algorithms, DKP-PC introduces learnable feedback connections from the output layer to all hidden layers, establishing a direct pathway for error transmission. This yields an algorithm that reduces the theoretical error propagation time complexity from O(L), with L being the network depth, to O(1), removing depth-dependent delay in error signals. Moreover, empirical results demonstrate that DKP-PC achieves performance at least comparable to, and often exceeding, that of standard PC, while offering improved latency and computational performance, supporting its potential for custom hardware-efficient implementations.

Motivation: To provide interpretable statistical complexities for dynamical models learned under hardware constraints.

Conclusion: Bounds link hardware constraints to statistical complexities, enhancing practical system identification.

Abstract: This paper provides statistical guarantees on the accuracy of dynamical models learned from dependent data sequences. Specifically, we develop uniform error bounds that apply to quantized models and imperfect optimization algorithms commonly used in practical contexts for system identification, and in particular hybrid system identification. Two families of bounds are obtained: slow-rate bounds via a block decomposition and fast-rate, variance-adaptive, bounds via a novel spaced-point strategy. The bounds scale with the number of bits required to encode the model and thus translate hardware constraints into interpretable statistical complexities.

Conclusion: GLM-5 advances foundation models with cost efficiency and superior coding capabilities.

Abstract: We present GLM-5, a next-generation foundation model designed to transition the paradigm of vibe coding to agentic engineering. Building upon the agentic, reasoning, and coding (ARC) capabilities of its predecessor, GLM-5 adopts DSA to significantly reduce training and inference costs while maintaining long-context fidelity. To advance model alignment and autonomy, we implement a new asynchronous reinforcement learning infrastructure that drastically improves post-training efficiency by decoupling generation from training. Furthermore, we propose novel asynchronous agent RL algorithms that further improve RL quality, enabling the model to learn from complex, long-horizon interactions more effectively. Through these innovations, GLM-5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on major open benchmarks. Most critically, GLM-5 demonstrates unprecedented capability in real-world coding tasks, surpassing previous baselines in handling end-to-end software engineering challenges.

TL;DR: The paper explores the structural similarity and functional differences between RNNs and DNNs using mean-field theory, revealing how weight sharing in RNNs affects their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why RNNs and DNNs, despite structural similarities due to weight sharing, exhibit distinct functional properties.

Method: Developed a unified mean-field theory for RNNs and DNNs using representational kernels in the feature learning (μP) regime.

Result: Identified a phase transition in DNN-typical tasks: RNNs and DNNs behave identically below a threshold, but only RNNs develop correlated representations above it. For sequential tasks, weight sharing aids generalization.

Conclusion: The theory connects architectural structure to functional biases, clarifying the role of weight sharing in RNNs.

Abstract: Recurrent and deep neural networks (RNNs/DNNs) are cornerstone architectures in machine learning. Remarkably, RNNs differ from DNNs only by weight sharing, as can be shown through unrolling in time. How does this structural similarity fit with the distinct functional properties these networks exhibit? To address this question, we here develop a unified mean-field theory for RNNs and DNNs in terms of representational kernels, describing fully trained networks in the feature learning ($μ$P) regime. This theory casts training as Bayesian inference over sequences and patterns, directly revealing the functional implications induced by the RNNs' weight sharing. In DNN-typical tasks, we identify a phase transition when the learning signal overcomes the noise due to randomness in the weights: below this threshold, RNNs and DNNs behave identically; above it, only RNNs develop correlated representations across timesteps. For sequential tasks, the RNNs' weight sharing furthermore induces an inductive bias that aids generalization by interpolating unsupervised time steps. Overall, our theory offers a way to connect architectural structure to functional biases.

### [125] [Guided Diffusion by Optimized Loss Functions on Relaxed Parameters for Inverse Material Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15648)
*Jens U. Kreber,Christian Weißenfels,Joerg Stueckler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diffusion model-based method for inverse design in engineering, overcoming challenges posed by discrete parameters and constraints by relaxing the design space and leveraging differentiable simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse design problems often face difficulties due to discrete parameters and constraints, making gradient-based optimization impractical. The need for diverse solutions motivates a probabilistic approach.

Method: The proposed method relaxes the design space into a continuous grid, uses a diffusion model as a prior, and guides sampling with gradients from differentiable simulations to backproject into the original space.

Result: The approach successfully finds diverse designs matching specified bulk moduli within a 1% error margin in 2D and 3D, and can optimize material density using multi-objective loss.

Conclusion: Diffusion models offer an effective solution for inverse design, enabling diversity and accuracy while handling complex constraints and discrete parameters.

Abstract: Inverse design problems are common in engineering and materials science. The forward direction, i.e., computing output quantities from design parameters, typically requires running a numerical simulation, such as a FEM, as an intermediate step, which is an optimization problem by itself. In many scenarios, several design parameters can lead to the same or similar output values. For such cases, multi-modal probabilistic approaches are advantageous to obtain diverse solutions. A major difficulty in inverse design stems from the structure of the design space, since discrete parameters or further constraints disallow the direct use of gradient-based optimization. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel inverse design method based on diffusion models. Our approach relaxes the original design space into a continuous grid representation, where gradients can be computed by implicit differentiation in the forward simulation. A diffusion model is trained on this relaxed parameter space in order to serve as a prior for plausible relaxed designs. Parameters are sampled by guided diffusion using gradients that are propagated from an objective function specified at inference time through the differentiable simulation. A design sample is obtained by backprojection into the original parameter space. We develop our approach for a composite material design problem where the forward process is modeled as a linear FEM problem. We evaluate the performance of our approach in finding designs that match a specified bulk modulus. We demonstrate that our method can propose diverse designs within 1% relative error margin from medium to high target bulk moduli in 2D and 3D settings. We also demonstrate that the material density of generated samples can be minimized simultaneously by using a multi-objective loss function.

*Hanna Benarroch,Jamal Atif,Olivier Cappé*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes adaptive per-instance noise calibration for certified machine unlearning, reducing performance degradation by tailoring noise to individual data points' contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional noise injection for differential privacy in machine unlearning is overly conservative, degrading performance. The paper aims to improve this by adapting noise to each data point's specific impact.

Method: The approach uses per-instance differential privacy to define sensitivities in noisy gradient dynamics. For ridge regression via Langevin dynamics, per-instance sensitivity bounds are derived.

Result: Certified unlearning is achieved with significantly less noise, maintaining privacy guarantees. Experiments in linear and deep learning settings support the approach's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Adaptive per-instance noise calibration offers a practical solution for certified unlearning, balancing privacy and performance better than worst-case methods.

Abstract: Certified machine unlearning can be achieved via noise injection leading to differential privacy guarantees, where noise is calibrated to worst-case sensitivity. Such conservative calibration often results in performance degradation, limiting practical applicability. In this work, we investigate an alternative approach based on adaptive per-instance noise calibration tailored to the individual contribution of each data point to the learned solution. This raises the following challenge: how can one establish formal unlearning guarantees when the mechanism depends on the specific point to be removed? To define individual data point sensitivities in noisy gradient dynamics, we consider the use of per-instance differential privacy. For ridge regression trained via Langevin dynamics, we derive high-probability per-instance sensitivity bounds, yielding certified unlearning with substantially less noise injection. We corroborate our theoretical findings through experiments in linear settings and provide further empirical evidence on the relevance of the approach in deep learning settings.

*Erion Morina,Philipp Scholl,Martin Holler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using neural networks based on rational functions to symbolically represent physical laws in PDE models, ensuring interpretability and sparsity. Theoretical and empirical results support its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate identification of PDE models from noisy measurements is challenging and often lacks interpretability. This work aims to address this by leveraging symbolic neural networks.

Method: The study uses neural network architectures based on rational functions for symbolic representation, focusing on identifiability and regularization. ParFam architecture is employed for empirical validation.

Result: Theoretical results show unique reconstruction of physical laws in noiseless conditions, with symbolic networks promoting interpretability and sparsity. Empirical tests confirm practical feasibility.

Conclusion: Symbolic networks based on rational functions effectively reconstruct PDE models, combining interpretability with empirical validation.

Abstract: Models based on partial differential equations (PDEs) are powerful for describing a wide range of complex relationships in the natural sciences. Accurately identifying the PDE model, which represents the underlying physical law, is essential for a proper understanding of the problem. This reconstruction typically relies on indirect and noisy measurements of the system's state and, without specifically tailored methods, rarely yields symbolic expressions, thereby hindering interpretability. In this work, we address this issue by considering existing neural network architectures based on rational functions for the symbolic representation of physical laws. These networks leverage the approximation power of rational functions while also benefiting from their flexibility in representing arithmetic operations. Our main contribution is an identifiability result, showing that, in the limit of noiseless, complete measurements, such symbolic networks can uniquely reconstruct the simplest physical law within the PDE model. Specifically, reconstructed laws remain expressible within the symbolic network architecture, with regularization-minimizing parameterizations promoting interpretability and sparsity in case of $L^1$-regularization. In addition, we provide regularity results for symbolic networks. Empirical validation using the ParFam architecture supports these theoretical findings, providing evidence for the practical reconstructibility of physical laws.

TL;DR: Proposes a WiT-based unsupervised learning approach to balance fairness and sum rate in wireless communications using a Lagrangian multiplier for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of ensuring user fairness while maximizing sum rate in wireless communications, a non-convex multi-objective problem.

Method: Uses an optimization-based unsupervised learning approach with WiT architecture, leveraging CSI features and a dual-ascent algorithm for Lagrangian multiplier updates.

Result: Demonstrates a flexible solution for optimizing the trade-off between fairness and sum rate, achieving a controllable fairness constraint.

Conclusion: The approach effectively manages the trade-off, providing a practical solution for fairness-constrained optimization in wireless networks.

Abstract: Ensuring user fairness in wireless communications is a fundamental challenge, as balancing the trade-off between fairness and sum rate leads to a non-convex, multi-objective optimization whose complexity grows with network scale. To alleviate this conflict, we propose an optimization-based unsupervised learning approach based on the wireless transformer (WiT) architecture that learns from channel state information (CSI) features. We reformulate the trade-off by combining the sum rate and fairness objectives through a Lagrangian multiplier, which is updated automatically via a dual-ascent algorithm. This mechanism allows for a controllable fairness constraint while simultaneously maximizing the sum rate, effectively realizing a trace on the Pareto front between two conflicting objectives. Our findings show that the proposed approach offers a flexible solution for managing the trade-off optimization under prescribed fairness.

*Erkan Turan,Gaspard Abel,Maysam Behmanesh,Emery Pierson,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper re-frames GNN oversmoothing as a bifurcation theory problem, proposing non-monotone activations to destabilize homogeneous states and prevent collapse, validated by experiments and theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep GNNs suffer from oversmoothing, where node features lose discriminative power, limiting their effectiveness. The paper aims to address this by understanding and mitigating the issue theoretically.

Method: The authors use bifurcation theory and Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction to analyze oversmoothing, proposing non-monotone activations to destabilize homogeneous states and introduce stable, non-homogeneous patterns.

Result: Theoretical and experimental validation confirms that non-monotone activations prevent oversmoothing, with a precise scaling law for emergent patterns. Practical utility is shown via a bifurcation-aware initialization.

Conclusion: The paper provides a theoretical framework to combat oversmoothing in GNNs, offering actionable insights (non-monotone activations and initialization) backed by rigorous analysis and experiments.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) learn node representations through iterative network-based message-passing. While powerful, deep GNNs suffer from oversmoothing, where node features converge to a homogeneous, non-informative state. We re-frame this problem of representational collapse from a \emph{bifurcation theory} perspective, characterizing oversmoothing as convergence to a stable ``homogeneous fixed point.'' Our central contribution is the theoretical discovery that this undesired stability can be broken by replacing standard monotone activations (e.g., ReLU) with a class of functions. Using Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, we analytically prove that this substitution induces a bifurcation that destabilizes the homogeneous state and creates a new pair of stable, non-homogeneous \emph{patterns} that provably resist oversmoothing. Our theory predicts a precise, nontrivial scaling law for the amplitude of these emergent patterns, which we quantitatively validate in experiments. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our theory by deriving a closed-form, bifurcation-aware initialization and showing its utility in real benchmark experiments.

### [130] [The Stationarity Bias: Stratified Stress-Testing for Time-Series Imputation in Regulated Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15637)
*Amirreza Dolatpour Fathkouhi,Alireza Namazi,Heman Shakeri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights biases in time-series imputation benchmarks due to uniform random masking and proposes stratified evaluation to address them, revealing inefficiencies of simple methods during transients and advocating for deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the Stationarity Bias in time-series imputation benchmarks, where simple methods appear superior due to dominant attractors, the paper aims to provide a fairer evaluation framework.

Method: The authors introduce a Stratified Stress-Test, partitioning evaluation into Stationary and Transient regimes, and use Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) for precise regime identification.

Result: Findings show linear interpolation excels in stable regimes (Stationary Efficiency) but fails during transients (Transient Fidelity), while deep learning models maintain accuracy and shape integrity.

Conclusion: Deep learning models are essential for safety-critical tasks, and the proposed framework applies to regulated systems with routine stationarity and critical transients.

Abstract: Time-series imputation benchmarks employ uniform random masking and shape-agnostic metrics (MSE, RMSE), implicitly weighting evaluation by regime prevalence. In systems with a dominant attractor -- homeostatic physiology, nominal industrial operation, stable network traffic -- this creates a systematic \emph{Stationarity Bias}: simple methods appear superior because the benchmark predominantly samples the easy, low-entropy regime where they trivially succeed. We formalize this bias and propose a \emph{Stratified Stress-Test} that partitions evaluation into Stationary and Transient regimes. Using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) as a testbed -- chosen for its rigorous ground-truth forcing functions (meals, insulin) that enable precise regime identification -- we establish three findings with broad implications:(i)~Stationary Efficiency: Linear interpolation achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction during stable intervals, confirming that complex architectures are computationally wasteful in low-entropy regimes.(ii)~Transient Fidelity: During critical transients (post-prandial peaks, hypoglycemic events), linear methods exhibit drastically degraded morphological fidelity (DTW), disproportionate to their RMSE -- a phenomenon we term the \emph{RMSE Mirage}, where low pointwise error masks the destruction of signal shape.(iii)~Regime-Conditional Model Selection: Deep learning models preserve both pointwise accuracy and morphological integrity during transients, making them essential for safety-critical downstream tasks. We further derive empirical missingness distributions from clinical trials and impose them on complete training data, preventing models from exploiting unrealistically clean observations and encouraging robustness under real-world missingness. This framework generalizes to any regulated system where routine stationarity dominates critical transients.

*Alena Brändle,Lukas Eisenmann,Florian Götz,Daniel Durstewitz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces continuous-time piecewise-linear RNNs (cPLRNNs) to overcome limitations of discrete-time models in dynamical systems reconstruction, offering better performance and tractability compared to Neural ODEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for mechanistically tractable models in scientific and medical fields to approximate and analyze underlying dynamical systems, especially those of continuous-time nature, drives the development of cPLRNNs. Current discrete-time models fail to align with continuous-time processes and struggle with irregular data intervals.

Method: The paper develops a theory for continuous-time PLRNNs (cPLRNNs), presenting a novel algorithm for training and simulating these models without numerical integration. It leverages the piecewise-linear structure for efficiency and semi-analytical determination of key topological objects like equilibria and limit cycles.

Result: cPLRNNs outperform both discrete-time PLRNNs and Neural ODEs on dynamical systems reconstruction benchmarks, including systems with discontinuities. They provide better performance and retain the tractability of PLRNNs.

Conclusion: cPLRNNs offer a promising solution for continuous-time dynamical systems reconstruction, combining the performance of PLRNNs with the ability to handle irregular data and maintain mechanistic tractability. They bridge the gap between discrete-time models and continuous processes.

Abstract: In dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) we aim to recover the dynamical system (DS) underlying observed time series. Specifically, we aim to learn a generative surrogate model which approximates the underlying, data-generating DS, and recreates its long-term properties (`climate statistics'). In scientific and medical areas, in particular, these models need to be mechanistically tractable -- through their mathematical analysis we would like to obtain insight into the recovered system's workings. Piecewise-linear (PL), ReLU-based RNNs (PLRNNs) have a strong track-record in this regard, representing SOTA DSR models while allowing mathematical insight by virtue of their PL design. However, all current PLRNN variants are discrete-time maps. This is in disaccord with the assumed continuous-time nature of most physical and biological processes, and makes it hard to accommodate data arriving at irregular temporal intervals. Neural ODEs are one solution, but they do not reach the DSR performance of PLRNNs and often lack their tractability. Here we develop theory for continuous-time PLRNNs (cPLRNNs): We present a novel algorithm for training and simulating such models, bypassing numerical integration by efficiently exploiting their PL structure. We further demonstrate how important topological objects like equilibria or limit cycles can be determined semi-analytically in trained models. We compare cPLRNNs to both their discrete-time cousins as well as Neural ODEs on DSR benchmarks, including systems with discontinuities which come with hard thresholds.

TL;DR: Neural forecasters' latent geometry is analyzed using anchor-based embeddings, revealing reproducible family-level alignment patterns across dynamical systems, though accuracy and alignment don't always correlate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how neural networks internally represent the geometry of complex dynamical systems, which remains poorly understood despite their forecasting accuracy.

Method: The researchers use anchor-based, geometry-agnostic relative embeddings to remove rotational and scaling ambiguities in latent spaces, applying this framework to seven canonical dynamical systems.

Result: The findings show reproducible family-level alignment (MLPs with MLPs, RNNs with RNNs) and that transformers and echo-state networks achieve strong forecasts despite weaker alignment. Alignment generally correlates with accuracy but isn't always required for high accuracy.

Conclusion: Relative geometry offers a simple and reproducible way to compare how different neural network families represent dynamical structure internally.

Abstract: Neural networks can accurately forecast complex dynamical systems, yet how they internally represent underlying latent geometry remains poorly understood. We study neural forecasters through the lens of representational alignment, introducing anchor-based, geometry-agnostic relative embeddings that remove rotational and scaling ambiguities in latent spaces. Applying this framework across seven canonical dynamical systems - ranging from periodic to chaotic - we reveal reproducible family-level structure: multilayer perceptrons align with other MLPs, recurrent networks with RNNs, while transformers and echo-state networks achieve strong forecasts despite weaker alignment. Alignment generally correlates with forecasting accuracy, yet high accuracy can coexist with low alignment. Relative geometry thus provides a simple, reproducible foundation for comparing how model families internalize and represent dynamical structure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAMEL is a new ECG language model that forecasts future cardiac events, outperforming existing models in classification and forecasting tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ECG language models lack the ability to forecast future cardiac events, which is crucial for early clinical intervention.

Method: CAMEL uses a specialized ECG encoder for cross-understanding of ECG signals and text, trained with LoRA adaptation and a curriculum learning pipeline involving classification, metrics, and multi-turn conversations.

Result: CAMEL achieves state-of-the-art performance on 6 tasks and 9 datasets, including a new benchmark for arrhythmia forecasting, with significant improvements over existing models.

Conclusion: CAMEL demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of forecasting cardiac events, setting a new standard for ECG language models.

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECG) are electrical recordings of the heart that are critical for diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. ECG language models (ELMs) have recently emerged as a promising framework for ECG classification accompanied by report generation. However, current models cannot forecast future cardiac events despite the immense clinical value for planning earlier intervention. To address this gap, we propose CAMEL, the first ELM that is capable of inference over longer signal durations which enables its forecasting capability. Our key insight is a specialized ECG encoder which enables cross-understanding of ECG signals with text. We train CAMEL using established LLM training procedures, combining LoRA adaptation with a curriculum learning pipeline. Our curriculum includes ECG classification, metrics calculations, and multi-turn conversations to elicit reasoning. CAMEL demonstrates strong zero-shot performance across 6 tasks and 9 datasets, including ECGForecastBench, a new benchmark that we introduce for forecasting arrhythmias. CAMEL is on par with or surpasses ELMs and fully supervised baselines both in- and out-of-distribution, achieving SOTA results on ECGBench (+7.0% absolute average gain) as well as ECGForecastBench (+12.4% over fully supervised models and +21.1% over zero-shot ELMs).

*Maximino Linares,Guillaume Doras,Thomas Hélie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a second-order discrete gradient method for learning dynamical systems with port-Hamiltonian neural networks, showing superior performance over Runge-Kutta methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for learning dynamical systems often fail to generalize due to neglecting conservation laws, prompting the need for power-preserving discretizations.

Method: A second-order discrete gradient method is embedded in port-Hamiltonian neural networks to ensure power-preserving discretizations.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate improved performance over Runge-Kutta methods across systems with varying dynamical behaviors.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the learning of dynamical systems by preserving power-balance principles, proving effective for diverse behaviors.

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems through purely data-driven methods is challenging as they do not learn the underlying conservation laws that enable them to correctly generalize. Existing port-Hamiltonian neural network methods have recently been successfully applied for modeling mechanical systems. However, even though these methods are designed on power-balance principles, they usually do not consider power-preserving discretizations and often rely on Runge-Kutta numerical methods. In this work, we propose to use a second-order discrete gradient method embedded in the learning of dynamical systems with port-Hamiltonian neural networks. Numerical results are provided for three systems deliberately selected to span different ranges of dynamical behavior under control: a baseline harmonic oscillator with quadratic energy storage; a Duffing oscillator, with a non-quadratic Hamiltonian offering amplitude-dependent effects; and a self-sustained oscillator, which can stabilize in a controlled limit cycle through the incorporation of a nonlinear dissipation. We show how the use of this discrete gradient method outperforms the performance of a Runge-Kutta method of the same order. Experiments are also carried out to compare two theoretically equivalent port-Hamiltonian systems formulations and to analyze the impact of regularizing the Jacobian of port-Hamiltonian neural networks during training.

TL;DR: Randomized spectral node embeddings are introduced to approximate graph kernels efficiently, outperforming existing methods in accuracy, especially for spectrally localized kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design scalable and principled node embeddings that capture meaningful node similarity via graph kernels, addressing computational challenges for large networks.

Method: Leveraging random feature methods for kernel approximation, the authors propose randomized spectral node embeddings to estimate low-rank kernel approximations.

Result: The embeddings provide more accurate kernel approximations than existing methods, particularly effective for spectrally localized kernels.

Conclusion: Randomized spectral constructions offer an effective approach for scalable and principled graph representation learning.

Abstract: Node embeddings map graph vertices into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces while preserving structural information. They are central to tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and signal reconstruction. A key goal is to design node embeddings whose dot products capture meaningful notions of node similarity induced by the graph. Graph kernels offer a principled way to define such similarities, but their direct computation is often prohibitive for large networks. Inspired by random feature methods for kernel approximation in Euclidean spaces, we introduce randomized spectral node embeddings whose dot products estimate a low-rank approximation of any specific graph kernel. We provide theoretical and empirical results showing that our embeddings achieve more accurate kernel approximations than existing methods, particularly for spectrally localized kernels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of randomized spectral constructions for scalable and principled graph representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and precise diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial, but existing graph-based models lack flexibility and generalization due to fixed structural designs.

Method: Develops MRC-GAT, combining copula-based similarity alignment, relational attention, and node fusion in a meta-learning framework to align heterogeneous features (RF, Cognitive test scores, MRI) and classify AD.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 96.87% (TADPOLE) and 92.31% (NACC), outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: MRC-GAT demonstrates robustness, high accuracy, and interpretability, making it a promising tool for AD diagnosis.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition necessitating early and precise diagnosis to provide prompt clinical management. Given the paramount importance of early diagnosis, recent studies have increasingly focused on computer-aided diagnostic models to enhance precision and reliability. However, most graph-based approaches still rely on fixed structural designs, which restrict their flexibility and limit generalization across heterogeneous patient data. To overcome these limitations, the Meta-Relational Copula-Based Graph Attention Network (MRC-GAT) is proposed as an efficient multimodal model for AD classification tasks. The proposed architecture, copula-based similarity alignment, relational attention, and node fusion are integrated as the core components of episodic meta-learning, such that the multimodal features, including risk factors (RF), Cognitive test scores, and MRI attributes, are first aligned via a copula-based transformation in a common statistical space and then combined by a multi-relational attention mechanism. According to evaluations performed on the TADPOLE and NACC datasets, the MRC-GAT model achieved accuracies of 96.87% and 92.31%, respectively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance compared to existing diagnostic models. Finally, the proposed model confirms the robustness and applicability of the proposed method by providing interpretability at various stages of disease diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in generalizing urban representation learning across cities and tasks, aiming for a foundational model.

Method: Proposes UrbanVerse with a graph-based approach for cross-city learning and HCondDiffCT module for cross-task generalization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 35.89% accuracy across six tasks.

Conclusion: UrbanVerse provides a robust, generalizable solution for urban analytics.

Abstract: Recent advances in urban region representation learning have enabled a wide range of applications in urban analytics, yet existing methods remain limited in their capabilities to generalize across cities and analytic tasks. We aim to generalize urban representation learning beyond city- and task-specific settings, towards a foundation-style model for urban analytics. To this end, we propose UrbanVerse, a model for cross-city urban representation learning and cross-task urban analytics. For cross-city generalization, UrbanVerse focuses on features local to the target regions and structural features of the nearby regions rather than the entire city. We model regions as nodes on a graph, which enables a random walk-based procedure to form "sequences of regions" that reflect both local and neighborhood structural features for urban region representation learning. For cross-task generalization, we propose a cross-task learning module named HCondDiffCT. This module integrates region-conditioned prior knowledge and task-conditioned semantics into the diffusion process to jointly model multiple downstream urban prediction tasks. HCondDiffCT is generic. It can also be integrated with existing urban representation learning models to enhance their downstream task effectiveness. Experiments on real-world datasets show that UrbanVerse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across six tasks under cross-city settings, achieving up to 35.89% improvements in prediction accuracy.

### [138] [Beyond Match Maximization and Fairness: Retention-Optimized Two-Sided Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15752)
*Ren Kishimoto,Rikiya Takehi,Koichi Tanaka,Masahiro Nomura,Riku Togashi,Yoji Tomita,Yuta Saito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic learning-to-rank algorithm called Matching for Retention (MRet) to maximize user retention on two-sided matching platforms, outperforming traditional methods focused on match maximization or fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recommendation algorithms on platforms like online dating focus on maximizing matches, leading to user imbalance and abandonment. Fairness objectives don't directly address retention, which is crucial for platforms relying on subscriptions.

Method: The authors propose MRet, a dynamic learning-to-rank algorithm that models personalized retention curves from user profiles and interaction history. It dynamically adapts recommendations to jointly optimize retention gains for both sides.

Result: Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that MRet achieves higher user retention compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: MRet effectively addresses the challenge of retention optimization in two-sided matching platforms, offering a practical alternative to match maximization or fairness-focused approaches.

Abstract: On two-sided matching platforms such as online dating and recruiting, recommendation algorithms often aim to maximize the total number of matches. However, this objective creates an imbalance, where some users receive far too many matches while many others receive very few and eventually abandon the platform. Retaining users is crucial for many platforms, such as those that depend heavily on subscriptions. Some may use fairness objectives to solve the problem of match maximization. However, fairness in itself is not the ultimate objective for many platforms, as users do not suddenly reward the platform simply because exposure is equalized. In practice, where user retention is often the ultimate goal, casually relying on fairness will leave the optimization of retention up to luck.
  In this work, instead of maximizing matches or axiomatically defining fairness, we formally define the new problem setting of maximizing user retention in two-sided matching platforms. To this end, we introduce a dynamic learning-to-rank (LTR) algorithm called Matching for Retention (MRet). Unlike conventional algorithms for two-sided matching, our approach models user retention by learning personalized retention curves from each user's profile and interaction history. Based on these curves, MRet dynamically adapts recommendations by jointly considering the retention gains of both the user receiving recommendations and those who are being recommended, so that limited matching opportunities can be allocated where they most improve overall retention. Naturally but importantly, empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets from a major online dating platform show that MRet achieves higher user retention, since conventional methods optimize matches or fairness rather than retention.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning language models on benign tasks unexpectedly degrades safety due to geometric instability in parameter space, driven by second-order effects of gradient descent. The study proposes a predictive approach for alignment safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why fine-tuning aligned models on harmless tasks still compromises safety, despite orthogonal updates and benign data, revealing underlying geometric instabilities.

Method: The paper uses geometric analysis to show alignment concentrates in low-dimensional subspaces with sharp curvature, leading to safety degradation under gradient descent dynamics.

Result: Fine-tuning causes alignment loss to scale quartically with training time, governed by curvature properties. Existing safety methods fail to address these dynamics.

Conclusion: Safety degradation is intrinsic to gradient descent on curved manifolds, necessitating curvature-aware methods and predictive diagnostics over reactive measures.

Abstract: Fine-tuning aligned language models on benign tasks unpredictably degrades safety guardrails, even when training data contains no harmful content and developers have no adversarial intent. We show that the prevailing explanation, that fine-tuning updates should be orthogonal to safety-critical directions in high-dimensional parameter space, offers false reassurance: we show this orthogonality is structurally unstable and collapses under the dynamics of gradient descent. We then resolve this through a novel geometric analysis, proving that alignment concentrates in low-dimensional subspaces with sharp curvature, creating a brittle structure that first-order methods cannot detect or defend. While initial fine-tuning updates may indeed avoid these subspaces, the curvature of the fine-tuning loss generates second-order acceleration that systematically steers trajectories into alignment-sensitive regions. We formalize this mechanism through the Alignment Instability Condition, three geometric properties that, when jointly satisfied, lead to safety degradation. Our main result establishes a quartic scaling law: alignment loss grows with the fourth power of training time, governed by the sharpness of alignment geometry and the strength of curvature coupling between the fine-tuning task and safety-critical parameters. These results expose a structural blind spot in the current safety paradigm. The dominant approaches to safe fine-tuning address only the initial snapshot of a fundamentally dynamic problem. Alignment fragility is not a bug to be patched; it is an intrinsic geometric property of gradient descent on curved manifolds. Our results motivate the development of curvature-aware methods, and we hope will further enable a shift in alignment safety analysis from reactive red-teaming to predictive diagnostics for open-weight model deployment.

TL;DR: FGE (Feasibility-Guided Exploration) addresses the mismatch between RL and reachability problems by simultaneously identifying feasible initial conditions and learning safe policies, achieving 50% more coverage than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep RL struggles with reachability problems due to its focus on expected returns rather than indefinite safety, leading to poor performance on low-probability states.

Method: FGE frames the problem as robust optimization over feasible initial conditions, learning policies and identifying feasible subsets concurrently.

Result: FGE outperforms existing methods by over 50% coverage in MuJoCo and Kinetix simulators for challenging initial conditions.

Conclusion: FGE effectively bridges the gap between RL and reachability, offering a robust solution for safety-critical tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved strong results on high-dimensional control tasks, but applying RL to reachability problems raises a fundamental mismatch: reachability seeks to maximize the set of states from which a system remains safe indefinitely, while RL optimizes expected returns over a user-specified distribution. This mismatch can result in policies that perform poorly on low-probability states that are still within the safe set. A natural alternative is to frame the problem as a robust optimization over a set of initial conditions that specify the initial state, dynamics and safe set, but whether this problem has a solution depends on the feasibility of the specified set, which is unknown a priori. We propose Feasibility-Guided Exploration (FGE), a method that simultaneously identifies a subset of feasible initial conditions under which a safe policy exists, and learns a policy to solve the reachability problem over this set of initial conditions. Empirical results demonstrate that FGE learns policies with over 50% more coverage than the best existing method for challenging initial conditions across tasks in the MuJoCo simulator and the Kinetix simulator with pixel observations.

*Anna Zimmel,Paul Setinek,Gianluca Galletti,Johannes Brandstetter,Werner Zellinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel TTA framework using D-optimal statistics improves adaptability for high-dimensional simulation regression, achieving 7% OOD gains with minimal cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in machine learning surrogates due to distribution shifts between training and deployment.

Method: Proposes a TTA framework leveraging D-optimal statistics for stable adaptation and parameter selection.

Result: Yields up to 7% out-of-distribution improvement at negligible computational cost, validated on SIMSHIFT and EngiBench.

Conclusion: First effective TTA solution for high-dimensional simulation regression and generative design optimization.

Abstract: Machine learning surrogates are increasingly used in engineering to accelerate costly simulations, yet distribution shifts between training and deployment often cause severe performance degradation (e.g., unseen geometries or configurations). Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) can mitigate such shifts, but existing methods are largely developed for lower-dimensional classification with structured outputs and visually aligned input-output relationships, making them unstable for the high-dimensional, unstructured and regression problems common in simulation. We address this challenge by proposing a TTA framework based on storing maximally informative (D-optimal) statistics, which jointly enables stable adaptation and principled parameter selection at test time. When applied to pretrained simulation surrogates, our method yields up to 7% out-of-distribution improvements at negligible computational cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic demonstration of effective TTA for high-dimensional simulation regression and generative design optimization, validated on the SIMSHIFT and EngiBench benchmarks.

### [142] [CrispEdit: Low-Curvature Projections for Scalable Non-Destructive LLM Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15823)
*Zarif Ikram,Arad Firouzkouhi,Stephen Tu,Mahdi Soltanolkotabi,Paria Rashidinejad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrispEdit is a scalable second-order editing algorithm for LLMs that ensures capability preservation by treating it as an explicit constraint via constrained optimization and Bregman divergence, outperforming prior methods with minimal capability degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM editing methods risk corrupting general capabilities while altering targeted behaviors, leading to proxy hacking. CrispEdit aims to preserve capabilities explicitly.

Method: CrispEdit formulates editing as constrained optimization, enforcing capability preservation by projecting updates onto low-curvature subspaces. It uses Bregman divergence for constraints and leverages K-FAC for efficiency.

Result: CrispEdit maintains edit success with less than 1% average capability degradation across benchmarks, outperforming existing editors.

Conclusion: CrispEdit offers a principled and scalable solution for LLM editing, balancing edit success and capability preservation effectively.

Abstract: A central challenge in large language model (LLM) editing is capability preservation: methods that successfully change targeted behavior can quietly game the editing proxy and corrupt general capabilities, producing degenerate behaviors reminiscent of proxy/reward hacking. We present CrispEdit, a scalable and principled second-order editing algorithm that treats capability preservation as an explicit constraint, unifying and generalizing several existing editing approaches. CrispEdit formulates editing as constrained optimization and enforces the constraint by projecting edit updates onto the low-curvature subspace of the capability-loss landscape. At the crux of CrispEdit is expressing capability constraint via Bregman divergence, whose quadratic form yields the Gauss-Newton Hessian exactly and even when the base model is not trained to convergence. We make this second-order procedure efficient at the LLM scale using Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (K-FAC) and a novel matrix-free projector that exploits Kronecker structure to avoid constructing massive projection matrices. Across standard model-editing benchmarks, CrispEdit achieves high edit success while keeping capability degradation below 1% on average across datasets, significantly improving over prior editors.

### [143] [Operationalising the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis via Task Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15829)
*Tomás Vergara-Browne,Darshan Patil,Ivan Titov,Siva Reddy,Tiago Pimentel,Marius Mosbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'task complexity' to redefine the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis (SAH), showing pre-training reduces task complexity significantly, while post-training further simplifies achieving high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a precise definition for SAH and unify conflicting arguments about its validity by introducing a measurable metric called task complexity.

Method: Introduces task complexity (shortest program length for target performance) and tests it on tasks like mathematical reasoning, machine translation, and instruction following, comparing pre-training and post-training effects.

Result: Pre-training drastically reduces task complexity, and post-training further collapses it by orders of magnitude, requiring minimal additional information (often kilobytes).

Conclusion: Task adaptation requires surprisingly little information post-pre-training, supporting SAH's claim that pre-training embeds most knowledge, while post-training surfaces it efficiently.

Abstract: The superficial alignment hypothesis (SAH) posits that large language models learn most of their knowledge during pre-training, and that post-training merely surfaces this knowledge. The SAH, however, lacks a precise definition, which has led to (i) different and seemingly orthogonal arguments supporting it, and (ii) important critiques to it. We propose a new metric called task complexity: the length of the shortest program that achieves a target performance on a task. In this framework, the SAH simply claims that pre-trained models drastically reduce the complexity of achieving high performance on many tasks. Our definition unifies prior arguments supporting the SAH, interpreting them as different strategies to find such short programs. Experimentally, we estimate the task complexity of mathematical reasoning, machine translation, and instruction following; we then show that these complexities can be remarkably low when conditioned on a pre-trained model. Further, we find that pre-training enables access to strong performances on our tasks, but it can require programs of gigabytes of length to access them. Post-training, on the other hand, collapses the complexity of reaching this same performance by several orders of magnitude. Overall, our results highlight that task adaptation often requires surprisingly little information -- often just a few kilobytes.

TL;DR: Improved brain tumor segmentation using Attention-Gated Recurrent Residual U-Net (R2U-Net) with triplanar architecture for higher accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving competitive DSC scores and survival prediction metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gliomas are complex and challenging to treat; accurate segmentation is crucial for better treatment planning.

Method: Proposes an Attention-Gated R2U-Net based Triplanar model integrating residual, recurrent, and triplanar architectures for feature enhancement and segmentation.

Result: Achieves DSC of 0.900 for WT segmentation and survival prediction accuracy of 45.71%, MSE of 108,318.128, and SRC of 0.338.

Conclusion: The model offers promising performance for brain tumor segmentation and survival prediction, aiding treatment planning.

Abstract: Gliomas, among the most common primary brain tumors, vary widely in aggressiveness, prognosis, and histology, making treatment challenging due to complex and time-intensive surgical interventions. This study presents an Attention-Gated Recurrent Residual U-Net (R2U-Net) based Triplanar (2.5D) model for improved brain tumor segmentation. The proposed model enhances feature representation and segmentation accuracy by integrating residual, recurrent, and triplanar architectures while maintaining computational efficiency, potentially aiding in better treatment planning. The proposed method achieves a Dice Similarity Score (DSC) of 0.900 for Whole Tumor (WT) segmentation on the BraTS2021 validation set, demonstrating performance comparable to leading models. Additionally, the triplanar network extracts 64 features per planar model for survival days prediction, which are reduced to 28 using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This approach achieves an accuracy of 45.71%, a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 108,318.128, and a Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRC) of 0.338 on the test dataset.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ResearchGym is a benchmark for evaluating AI agents' end-to-end research capabilities using containerized task environments from repurposed papers. GPT-5 showed a sharp capability-reliability gap, excelling rarely but demonstrating potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate autonomous AI agents' ability to conduct closed-loop research, identifying strengths and recurring failure modes.

Method: Five repurposed papers' environments (39 sub-tasks) were containerized, withholding proposed methods. Agents proposed hypotheses, ran experiments, and aimed to surpass human baselines.

Result: GPT-5 improved baselines in 6.7% of evaluations (+11.5%) and completed 26.5% of sub-tasks, showcasing unreliability with occasional state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: ResearchGym reveals AI agents' capability-reliability gap, highlighting challenges like poor resource management, but also potential for high performance in research tasks.

Abstract: We introduce ResearchGym, a benchmark and execution environment for evaluating AI agents on end-to-end research. To instantiate this, we repurpose five oral and spotlight papers from ICML, ICLR, and ACL. From each paper's repository, we preserve the datasets, evaluation harness, and baseline implementations but withhold the paper's proposed method. This results in five containerized task environments comprising 39 sub-tasks in total. Within each environment, agents must propose novel hypotheses, run experiments, and attempt to surpass strong human baselines on the paper's metrics. In a controlled evaluation of an agent powered by GPT-5, we observe a sharp capability--reliability gap. The agent improves over the provided baselines from the repository in just 1 of 15 evaluations (6.7%) by 11.5%, and completes only 26.5% of sub-tasks on average. We identify recurring long-horizon failure modes, including impatience, poor time and resource management, overconfidence in weak hypotheses, difficulty coordinating parallel experiments, and hard limits from context length. Yet in a single run, the agent surpasses the solution of an ICML 2025 Spotlight task, indicating that frontier agents can occasionally reach state-of-the-art performance, but do so unreliably. We additionally evaluate proprietary agent scaffolds including Claude Code (Opus-4.5) and Codex (GPT-5.2) which display a similar gap. ResearchGym provides infrastructure for systematic evaluation and analysis of autonomous agents on closed-loop research.

*Xinhang Ma,William Yeoh,Ning Zhang,Yevgeniy Vorobeychik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to deter unauthorized knowledge distillation by modifying teacher-generated reasoning traces, achieving anti-distillation and API watermarking through dynamic rewriting techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevent unfair advantage from unauthorized use of knowledge distillation, protecting the effort and cost invested in developing frontier models.

Method: Introduces dynamic rewriting approaches using LLMs and gradient-based techniques to modify reasoning outputs while preserving correctness and coherence.

Result: Instruction-based rewriting effectively achieves anti-distillation and maintains teacher performance, while enabling reliable watermark detection with minimal false alarms.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully deter unauthorized distillation and embed verifiable signatures, balancing effectiveness and performance.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a widely adopted technique for transferring capabilities from LLMs to smaller, more efficient student models. However, unauthorized use of knowledge distillation takes unfair advantage of the considerable effort and cost put into developing frontier models. We investigate methods for modifying teacher-generated reasoning traces to achieve two objectives that deter unauthorized distillation: (1) \emph{anti-distillation}, or degrading the training usefulness of query responses, and (2) \emph{API watermarking}, which embeds verifiable signatures in student models. We introduce several approaches for dynamically rewriting a teacher's reasoning outputs while preserving answer correctness and semantic coherence. Two of these leverage the rewriting capabilities of LLMs, while others use gradient-based techniques. Our experiments show that a simple instruction-based rewriting approach achieves a strong anti-distillation effect while maintaining or even improving teacher performance. Furthermore, we show that our rewriting approach also enables highly reliable watermark detection with essentially no false alarms.

*Shreyas Rajesh,Pavan Holur,Mehmet Yigit Turali,Chenda Duan,Vwani Roychowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Panini introduces a continual learning framework using Generative Semantic Workspaces (GSW) for efficient and accurate reasoning, outperforming retrieval-augmented generation methods with fewer tokens and higher reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and inaccuracies in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, such as redundant compute and irrelevant context, Panini aims to structure experiences semantically for better reasoning.

Method: Panini uses Generative Semantic Workspaces (GSW), a network of QA pairs representing documents, enabling continual learning and inference-chain retrieval without verbatim documents.

Result: Panini outperforms baselines by 5%-7% on QA benchmarks, uses 2-30x fewer tokens, supports open-source pipelines, and reduces unsupported answers.

Conclusion: Structuring experiences as GSW improves efficiency and reliability in reasoning, demonstrating significant gains over traditional RAG methods.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used to reason over content they were not trained on, such as new documents, evolving knowledge, and user-specific data. A common approach is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which stores verbatim documents externally (as chunks) and retrieves only a relevant subset at inference time for an LLM to reason over. However, this results in inefficient usage of test-time compute (LLM repeatedly reasons over the same documents); moreover, chunk retrieval can inject irrelevant context that increases unsupported generation. We propose a human-like non-parametric continual learning framework, where the base model remains fixed, and learning occurs by integrating each new experience into an external semantic memory state that accumulates and consolidates itself continually. We present Panini, which realizes this by representing documents as Generative Semantic Workspaces (GSW) -- an entity- and event-aware network of question-answer (QA) pairs, sufficient for an LLM to reconstruct the experienced situations and mine latent knowledge via reasoning-grounded inference chains on the network. Given a query, Panini only traverses the continually-updated GSW (not the verbatim documents or chunks), and retrieves the most likely inference chains. Across six QA benchmarks, Panini achieves the highest average performance, 5%-7% higher than other competitive baselines, while using 2-30x fewer answer-context tokens, supports fully open-source pipelines, and reduces unsupported answers on curated unanswerable queries. The results show that efficient and accurate structuring of experiences at write time -- as achieved by the GSW framework -- yields both efficiency and reliability gains at read time.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach called da Costian-Tarskianism for handling ontological heterogeneity using extended consequence systems and development graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address ontological heterogeneity by leveraging Carnapian-Goguenism and integrating da Costa's Principle of Tolerance and Tarski's work on consequence operators.

Method: The method involves using extended consequence systems (consequence systems with ontological axioms) and extended development graphs to relate ontologies via morphisms, fibring, and splitting.

Result: The approach provides a framework for managing ontological heterogeneity and relating ontologies through structured operations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with implications for applied ontology and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for ontological heterogeneity that draws heavily from Carnapian-Goguenism, as presented by Kutz, Mossakowski and Lücke (2010). The approach is provisionally designated da Costian-Tarskianism, named after da Costa's Principle of Tolerance in Mathematics and after Alfred Tarski's work on the concept of a consequence operator. The approach is based on the machinery of consequence systems, as developed by Carnielli et al. (2008) and Citkin and Muravitsky (2022), and it introduces the idea of an extended consequence system, which is a consequence system extended with ontological axioms. The paper also defines the concept of an extended development graph, which is a graph structure that allows ontologies to be related via morphisms of extended consequence systems, and additionally via other operations such as fibring and splitting. Finally, we discuss the implications of this approach for the field of applied ontology and suggest directions for future research.

*Luise Ge,Yongyan Zhang,Yevgeniy Vorobeychik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares LLM decision-making under uncertainty, identifying two categories: rational reasoning models (RMs) and less rational conversational models (CMs). Training for mathematical reasoning is key in differentiating them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand LLM decision-making under uncertainty, particularly how prospect representation and decision rationale impact choices.

Method: A comparative study of 20 LLMs was conducted, alongside a human subjects experiment and a rational agent model for reference.

Result: LLMs split into RMs (rational, consistent) and CMs (less rational, human-like, sensitive to framing). Mathematical reasoning training distinguishes RMs from CMs.

Conclusion: LLM decision-making varies by model type, with mathematical training playing a crucial role in rational behavior.

Abstract: The use of large language models either as decision support systems, or in agentic workflows, is rapidly transforming the digital ecosystem. However, the understanding of LLM decision-making under uncertainty remains limited. We initiate a comparative study of LLM risky choices along two dimensions: (1) prospect representation (explicit vs. experience based) and (2) decision rationale (explanation). Our study, which involves 20 frontier and open LLMs, is complemented by a matched human subjects experiment, which provides one reference point, while an expected payoff maximizing rational agent model provides another. We find that LLMs cluster into two categories: reasoning models (RMs) and conversational models (CMs). RMs tend towards rational behavior, are insensitive to the order of prospects, gain/loss framing, and explanations, and behave similarly whether prospects are explicit or presented via experience history. CMs are significantly less rational, slightly more human-like, sensitive to prospect ordering, framing, and explanation, and exhibit a large description-history gap. Paired comparisons of open LLMs suggest that a key factor differentiating RMs and CMs is training for mathematical reasoning.

*Yuanyan Song,Kezhi Wang,Xinmian Xu*

TL;DR: The paper proposes a secure wireless AI network where a supervisor dynamically assigns AI agents for QoS provisioning while ensuring privacy. Two resource allocation schemes, ASC and LAW, optimize energy use and outperform benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure QoS for users' reasoning tasks while maintaining privacy and confidentiality in a wireless AI network.

Method: Dynamically assigns AI agents, uses friendly jammers, and formulates an energy minimization problem solved by ASC (ADMM, SDR, SCA) and LAW (LLM optimizer) schemes.

Result: Reduces network energy consumption by up to 59.1% and achieves satisfactory reasoning accuracy in practical tests.

Conclusion: The proposed schemes efficiently optimize resource allocation and privacy in AI networks, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a secure wireless agentic AI network comprising one supervisor AI agent and multiple other AI agents to provision quality of service (QoS) for users' reasoning tasks while ensuring confidentiality of private knowledge and reasoning outcomes. Specifically, the supervisor AI agent can dynamically assign other AI agents to participate in cooperative reasoning, while the unselected AI agents act as friendly jammers to degrade the eavesdropper's interception performance. To extend the service duration of AI agents, an energy minimization problem is formulated that jointly optimizes AI agent selection, base station (BS) beamforming, and AI agent transmission power, subject to latency and reasoning accuracy constraints. To address the formulated problem, we propose two resource allocation schemes, ASC and LAW, which first decompose it into three sub-problems. Specifically, ASC optimizes each sub-problem iteratively using the proposed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA), while LAW tackles each sub-problem using the proposed large language model (LLM) optimizer within an agentic workflow. The experimental results show that the proposed solutions can reduce network energy consumption by up to 59.1% compared to other benchmark schemes. Furthermore, the proposed schemes are validated using a practical agentic AI system based on Qwen, demonstrating satisfactory reasoning accuracy across various public benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper explores invoice or payment dilution in supply chain finance, proposing an AI and machine learning framework to predict and manage this risk, complementing traditional methods like IPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Invoice dilution causes non-credit risk and margin loss in supply chain finance, and traditional methods like IPUs can limit adoption, especially for lower-grade buyers.

Method: The paper introduces an AI and machine learning framework that uses real-time dynamic credit limits to predict dilution for each buyer-supplier pair, evaluated with a production dataset across nine transaction fields.

Result: The AI framework effectively supplements deterministic algorithms to predict invoice dilution, offering a more scalable solution than traditional IPUs.

Conclusion: Data-driven methods like the proposed AI framework can better manage invoice dilution risks, improving supply chain finance adoption, especially for sub-investment-grade buyers.

Abstract: Invoice or payment dilution is the gap between the approved invoice amount and the actual collection is a significant source of non credit risk and margin loss in supply chain finance. Traditionally, this risk is managed through the buyer's irrevocable payment undertaking (IPU), which commits to full payment without deductions. However, IPUs can hinder supply chain finance adoption, particularly among sub-invested grade buyers. A newer, data-driven methods use real-time dynamic credit limits, projecting dilution for each buyer-supplier pair in real-time. This paper introduces an AI, machine learning framework and evaluates how that can supplement a deterministic algorithm to predict invoice dilution using extensive production dataset across nine key transaction fields.

*Farbod Abbasi,Zachary Patterson,Bilal Farooq*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a WGAN with gradient penalty for synthesizing diverse and feasible populations for ABM, outperforming sequential methods in metrics like recall and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to capture feature interplay and struggle with sampling/structural zeros, limiting synthetic data diversity and feasibility.

Method: Uses a WGAN with gradient penalty and a regularization term for joint multi-source dataset integration and synthesis.

Result: Outperforms sequential baseline: 7% higher recall, 15% precision. Regularization further boosts diversity (10% recall, 1% precision). Unified metric score: 88.1 vs 84.6.

Conclusion: Joint generative approach enhances ABM accuracy by improving synthetic data diversity and feasibility.

Abstract: Generating realistic synthetic populations is essential for agent-based models (ABM) in transportation and urban planning. Current methods face two major limitations. First, many rely on a single dataset or follow a sequential data fusion and generation process, which means they fail to capture the complex interplay between features. Second, these approaches struggle with sampling zeros (valid but unobserved attribute combinations) and structural zeros (infeasible combinations due to logical constraints), which reduce the diversity and feasibility of the generated data. This study proposes a novel method to simultaneously integrate and synthesize multi-source datasets using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with gradient penalty. This joint learning method improves both the diversity and feasibility of synthetic data by defining a regularization term (inverse gradient penalty) for the generator loss function. For the evaluation, we implement a unified evaluation metric for similarity, and place special emphasis on measuring diversity and feasibility through recall, precision, and the F1 score. Results show that the proposed joint approach outperforms the sequential baseline, with recall increasing by 7\% and precision by 15\%. Additionally, the regularization term further improves diversity and feasibility, reflected in a 10\% increase in recall and 1\% in precision. We assess similarity distributions using a five-metric score. The joint approach performs better overall, and reaches a score of 88.1 compared to 84.6 for the sequential method. Since synthetic populations serve as a key input for ABM, this multi-source generative approach has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of ABM.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how memory aids spatial navigation in changing uncertain environments, focusing on a foraging task where barriers and food locations change daily, and sensing is limited. It compares memory strategies and finds that combining multiple strategies, including episodic memory updates and dynamic map-building, improves efficiency in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how memory can enhance spatial navigation in non-stationary, uncertain environments, addressing challenges like changing obstacles, limited sensing, and the need for rapid learning.

Method: The research evaluates various memory-based strategies, from simple to sophisticated, in a foraging task. The agent updates episodic memories using non-stationary probability learning and builds dynamic maps for planning.

Result: Agents using advanced memory techniques, such as updating episodic memories and dynamic map-building, outperform simpler strategies, especially as task complexity (e.g., distance to goal) increases, provided uncertainty remains manageable.

Conclusion: A flexible memory architecture combining multiple strategies is essential for effective navigation in uncertain environments. Efficient learning and memory updates significantly enhance performance in complex tasks.

Abstract: We explore how different types and uses of memory can aid spatial navigation in changing uncertain environments. In the simple foraging task we study, every day, our agent has to find its way from its home, through barriers, to food. Moreover, the world is non-stationary: from day to day, the location of the barriers and food may change, and the agent's sensing such as its location information is uncertain and very limited. Any model construction, such as a map, and use, such as planning, needs to be robust against these challenges, and if any learning is to be useful, it needs to be adequately fast. We look at a range of strategies, from simple to sophisticated, with various uses of memory and learning. We find that an architecture that can incorporate multiple strategies is required to handle (sub)tasks of a different nature, in particular for exploration and search, when food location is not known, and for planning a good path to a remembered (likely) food location. An agent that utilizes non-stationary probability learning techniques to keep updating its (episodic) memories and that uses those memories to build maps and plan on the fly (imperfect maps, i.e. noisy and limited to the agent's experience) can be increasingly and substantially more efficient than the simpler (minimal-memory) agents, as the task difficulties such as distance to goal are raised, as long as the uncertainty, from localization and change, is not too large.

Conclusion: EAA shows how vision-capable agents can streamline complex workflows in microscopy.

Abstract: We present Experiment Automation Agents (EAA), a vision-language-model-driven agentic system designed to automate complex experimental microscopy workflows. EAA integrates multimodal reasoning, tool-augmented action, and optional long-term memory to support both autonomous procedures and interactive user-guided measurements. Built on a flexible task-manager architecture, the system enables workflows ranging from fully agent-driven automation to logic-defined routines that embed localized LLM queries. EAA further provides a modern tool ecosystem with two-way compatibility for Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing instrument-control tools to be consumed or served across applications. We demonstrate EAA at an imaging beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, including automated zone plate focusing, natural language-described feature search, and interactive data acquisition. These results illustrate how vision-capable agents can enhance beamline efficiency, reduce operational burden, and lower the expertise barrier for users.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an agentic framework combining foundation models for agriculture with LLMs to enhance reasoning and interaction capabilities, validated by outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agricultural foundation models lack language-based reasoning, while LLMs can't handle heterogeneous agricultural data directly. The gap is bridged.

Method: Uses AgriWorld (Python environment) with geospatial, remote-sensing, and predictive tools, and Agro-Reflective (LLM agent) for iterative code execution and refinement.

Result: Outperforms text-only and direct tool-use baselines, demonstrating reliable agricultural reasoning.

Conclusion: Execution-driven reflection improves agricultural reasoning, validated by AgroBench.

Abstract: Foundation models for agriculture are increasingly trained on massive spatiotemporal data (e.g., multi-spectral remote sensing, soil grids, and field-level management logs) and achieve strong performance on forecasting and monitoring. However, these models lack language-based reasoning and interactive capabilities, limiting their usefulness in real-world agronomic workflows. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting and generating text, but cannot directly reason over high-dimensional, heterogeneous agricultural datasets. We bridge this gap with an agentic framework for agricultural science. It provides a Python execution environment, AgriWorld, exposing unified tools for geospatial queries over field parcels, remote-sensing time-series analytics, crop growth simulation, and task-specific predictors (e.g., yield, stress, and disease risk). On top of this environment, we design a multi-turn LLM agent, Agro-Reflective, that iteratively writes code, observes execution results, and refines its analysis via an execute-observe-refine loop. We introduce AgroBench, with scalable data generation for diverse agricultural QA spanning lookups, forecasting, anomaly detection, and counterfactual "what-if" analysis. Experiments outperform text-only and direct tool-use baselines, validating execution-driven reflection for reliable agricultural reasoning.

Method: WAC uses a multi-agent collaboration process, consulting a world model for strategic guidance, and a two-stage deduction chain for consequence simulation and risk assessment.

Result: WAC achieves absolute gains of 1.8% on VisualWebArena and 1.3% on Online-Mind2Web.

Conclusion: WAC enhances web task automation by improving reasoning and risk awareness through collaborative modeling and feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: Web agents based on large language models have demonstrated promising capability in automating web tasks. However, current web agents struggle to reason out sensible actions due to the limitations of predicting environment changes, and might not possess comprehensive awareness of execution risks, prematurely performing risky actions that cause losses and lead to task failure. To address these challenges, we propose WAC, a web agent that integrates model collaboration, consequence simulation, and feedback-driven action refinement. To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain. A world model, specialized in environmental state transitions, simulates action outcomes, which a judge model then scrutinizes to trigger action corrective feedback when necessary. Experiments show that WAC achieves absolute gains of 1.8% on VisualWebArena and 1.3% on Online-Mind2Web.

*Ankit Sharma,Nachiket Tapas,Jyotiprakash Patra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An adaptive abstention system dynamically adjusts safety thresholds for LLMs using real-time contextual signals, improving safety and utility while reducing latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the safety-utility trade-off in LLM deployment by moving beyond static rules or fixed thresholds to avoid blocking benign queries or generating unsafe content.

Method: Introduces a multi-dimensional detection architecture with five parallel detectors, combined hierarchically to optimize speed and precision. Uses contextual signals like domain and user history.

Result: Significant reductions in false positives, especially in sensitive domains like medical advice and creative writing, while maintaining high safety precision and recall.

Conclusion: The context-aware abstention framework balances safety and utility effectively, offering a scalable solution for reliable LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in production environments face a fundamental safety-utility trade-off either a strict filtering mechanisms prevent harmful outputs but often block benign queries or a relaxed controls risk unsafe content generation. Conventional guardrails based on static rules or fixed confidence thresholds are typically context-insensitive and computationally expensive, resulting in high latency and degraded user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce an adaptive abstention system that dynamically adjusts safety thresholds based on real-time contextual signals such as domain and user history. The proposed framework integrates a multi-dimensional detection architecture composed of five parallel detectors, combined through a hierarchical cascade mechanism to optimize both speed and precision. The cascade design reduces unnecessary computation by progressively filtering queries, achieving substantial latency improvements compared to non-cascaded models and external guardrail systems. Extensive evaluation on mixed and domain-specific workloads demonstrates significant reductions in false positives, particularly in sensitive domains such as medical advice and creative writing. The system maintains high safety precision and near-perfect recall under strict operating modes. Overall, our context-aware abstention framework effectively balances safety and utility while preserving performance, offering a scalable solution for reliable LLM deployment.

### [158] [Common Belief Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15403)
*Thomas Ågotnes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper challenges the common belief logic KD4, showing it's incomplete for common belief characterization in KD45, introducing shift-reflexivity and an additional agent-dependent axiom for completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify whether KD4 extended with shift-reflexivity fully characterizes common belief in KD45, addressing gaps in understanding its logic.

Method: Analyzes properties of common belief in KD45, introduces shift-reflexivity ($C(Cφ\rightarrow φ)$), and identifies an additional axiom dependent on agent count.

Result: Demonstrates KD4 with shift-reflexivity is incomplete; introduces a further axiom for a complete common belief logic in KD45.

Conclusion: The logic of common belief requires KD4, shift-reflexivity, and an agent-dependent axiom, resolving the open problem.

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, common belief is not KD4.
  If individual belief is KD45, common belief does indeed lose the 5 property and keep the D and 4 properties -- and it has none of the other commonly considered properties of knowledge and belief. But it has another property: $C(Cφ\rightarrow φ)$ -- corresponding to so-called shift-reflexivity (reflexivity one step ahead). This observation begs the question:
  is KD4 extended with this axiom a complete characterisation of common belief in the KD45 case? If not, what \emph{is} the logic of common belief? In this paper we show that the answer to the first question is ``no'': there is one additional axiom, and, furthermore, it relies on the number of agents. We show that the result is a complete characterisation of common belief, settling the open problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support the evaluation and training of automatic pedagogical evaluators and AI tutors by providing a structured dataset with diverse teacher-inspired explanations.

Method: Dataset creation involves human and LLM-generated explanations for ScienceQA questions, annotated using a pedagogical risk rubric. Validation experiments compare models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and Llama 3.1 8B.

Result: Preliminary validation shows EduEVAL-DB's suitability for evaluating pedagogical risk detection in AI tutors, with potential for deployment on consumer hardware.

Conclusion: EduEVAL-DB provides a valuable resource for developing and testing AI tutors, validated through experiments demonstrating its practical utility.

Abstract: This work introduces EduEVAL-DB, a dataset based on teacher roles designed to support the evaluation and training of automatic pedagogical evaluators and AI tutors for instructional explanations. The dataset comprises 854 explanations corresponding to 139 questions from a curated subset of the ScienceQA benchmark, spanning science, language, and social science across K-12 grade levels. For each question, one human-teacher explanation is provided and six are generated by LLM-simulated teacher roles. These roles are inspired by instructional styles and shortcomings observed in real educational practice and are instantiated via prompt engineering. We further propose a pedagogical risk rubric aligned with established educational standards, operationalizing five complementary risk dimensions: factual correctness, explanatory depth and completeness, focus and relevance, student-level appropriateness, and ideological bias. All explanations are annotated with binary risk labels through a semi-automatic process with expert teacher review. Finally, we present preliminary validation experiments to assess the suitability of EduEVAL-DB for evaluation. We benchmark a state-of-the-art education-oriented model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) against a lightweight local Llama 3.1 8B model and examine whether supervised fine-tuning on EduEVAL-DB supports pedagogical risk detection using models deployable on consumer hardware.

*Ryan Othniel Kearns*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current benchmark practices in LLMs, highlighting issues like test set contamination and annotator errors, and proposes a 'structured capabilities model' for more reliable evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmark methods conflate model size with capabilities and fail to account for measurement errors, leading to unreliable indicators of true LLM performance.

Method: The thesis introduces the 'structured capabilities model', which integrates insights from latent factor models and scaling laws to extract interpretable and generalizable capabilities from benchmark results.

Result: The structured capabilities model outperforms latent factor models in fit indices and scaling laws in out-of-distribution predictions, demonstrating better construct validity.

Conclusion: By appropriately separating model scale from capabilities and accounting for measurement errors, the structured capabilities model offers improved explanatory and predictive power for LLM evaluation.

Abstract: The LLM community often reports benchmark results as if they are synonymous with general model capabilities. However, benchmarks can have problems that distort performance, like test set contamination and annotator error. How can we know that a benchmark is a reliable indicator of some capability that we want to measure? This question concerns the construct validity of LLM benchmarks, and it requires separating benchmark results from capabilities when we model and predict LLM performance.
  Both social scientists and computer scientists propose formal models - latent factor models and scaling laws - for identifying the capabilities underlying benchmark scores. However, neither technique is satisfactory for construct validity. Latent factor models ignore scaling laws, and as a result, the capabilities they extract often proxy model size. Scaling laws ignore measurement error, and as a result, the capabilities they extract are both uninterpretable and overfit to the observed benchmarks.
  This thesis presents the structured capabilities model, the first model to extract interpretable and generalisable capabilities from a large collection of LLM benchmark results. I fit this model and its two alternatives on a large sample of results from the OpenLLM Leaderboard. Structured capabilities outperform latent factor models on parsimonious fit indices, and exhibit better out-of-distribution benchmark prediction than scaling laws. These improvements are possible because neither existing approach separates model scale from capabilities in the appropriate way. Model scale should inform capabilities, as in scaling laws, and these capabilities should inform observed results up to measurement error, as in latent factor models. In combining these two insights, structured capabilities demonstrate better explanatory and predictive power for quantifying construct validity in LLM evaluations.

TL;DR: Ruva introduces a 'Glass Box' Personal AI architecture using Knowledge Graphs for transparency and precise data redaction, addressing issues of accountability and privacy in current 'Black Box' systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 'Black Box' AI systems lack accountability and precision in data handling, leading to issues like hallucinations and privacy violations.

Method: Ruva replaces vector databases with a Personal Knowledge Graph, enabling human-in-the-loop curation, inspection, and precise redaction of facts.

Result: Ruva provides users control over their AI's knowledge, ensuring transparency and the 'Right to be Forgotten.'

Conclusion: Ruva shifts the AI paradigm from opaque vector matching to transparent graph reasoning, empowering users with accountability and privacy.

Abstract: The Personal AI landscape is currently dominated by "Black Box" Retrieval-Augmented Generation. While standard vector databases offer statistical matching, they suffer from a fundamental lack of accountability: when an AI hallucinates or retrieves sensitive data, the user cannot inspect the cause nor correct the error. Worse, "deleting" a concept from a vector space is mathematically imprecise, leaving behind probabilistic "ghosts" that violate true privacy. We propose Ruva, the first "Glass Box" architecture designed for Human-in-the-Loop Memory Curation. Ruva grounds Personal AI in a Personal Knowledge Graph, enabling users to inspect what the AI knows and to perform precise redaction of specific facts. By shifting the paradigm from Vector Matching to Graph Reasoning, Ruva ensures the "Right to be Forgotten." Users are the editors of their own lives; Ruva hands them the pen.

*Hongxuan Wu,Yukun Zhang,Xueqing Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how multimodal Transformers predict answers by decomposing layer-wise predictive information into redundant, vision-unique, language-unique, and synergistic components using PID Flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether predictions in multimodal Transformers are driven by visual evidence, linguistic reasoning, or cross-modal computation, and how this evolves across layers.

Method: Introduces PID Flow, combining dimensionality reduction, Gaussianization, and Gaussian PID estimation, applied to LLaVA models across six reasoning tasks.

Result: Finds a 'modal transduction' pattern: visual-unique info peaks early, language-unique info dominates late (82%), and synergy remains low (<2%). Task-dependent effects confirmed via attention knockouts.

Conclusion: Provides a causal, information-theoretic account of modality interplay in Transformers, with insights for addressing architectural bottlenecks.

Abstract: When a multimodal Transformer answers a visual question, is the prediction driven by visual evidence, linguistic reasoning, or genuinely fused cross-modal computation -- and how does this structure evolve across layers? We address this question with a layer-wise framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that decomposes the predictive information at each Transformer layer into redundant, vision-unique, language-unique, and synergistic components. To make PID tractable for high-dimensional neural representations, we introduce \emph{PID Flow}, a pipeline combining dimensionality reduction, normalizing-flow Gaussianization, and closed-form Gaussian PID estimation. Applying this framework to LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.6-7B across six GQA reasoning tasks, we uncover a consistent \emph{modal transduction} pattern: visual-unique information peaks early and decays with depth, language-unique information surges in late layers to account for roughly 82\% of the final prediction, and cross-modal synergy remains below 2\%. This trajectory is highly stable across model variants (layer-wise correlations $>$0.96) yet strongly task-dependent, with semantic redundancy governing the detailed information fingerprint. To establish causality, we perform targeted Image$\rightarrow$Question attention knockouts and show that disrupting the primary transduction pathway induces predictable increases in trapped visual-unique information, compensatory synergy, and total information cost -- effects that are strongest in vision-dependent tasks and weakest in high-redundancy tasks. Together, these results provide an information-theoretic, causal account of how vision becomes language in multimodal Transformers, and offer quantitative guidance for identifying architectural bottlenecks where modality-specific information is lost.

### [163] [On inferring cumulative constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15635)
*Konstantin Sidorov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A preprocessing method is introduced to infer additional cumulative constraints in scheduling, improving search performance and tightening bounds without causing significant slowdowns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Propagation in cumulative constraints is typically done per constraint, missing multi-resource interactions and causing slowdowns on benchmarks.

Method: The approach interprets cumulative constraints as linear inequalities, discovers covers (sets of non-parallel tasks), strengthens inequalities via lifting, and injects constraints back into scheduling.

Result: Experiments show improved search performance, tighter bounds, and new lower bounds/solutions, with minimal degradation on unfavorable instances.

Conclusion: Inferred constraints enhance scheduling efficiency and solution quality, demonstrating practical benefits on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Cumulative constraints are central in scheduling with constraint programming, yet propagation is typically performed per constraint, missing multi-resource interactions and causing severe slowdowns on some benchmarks. I present a preprocessing method for inferring additional cumulative constraints that capture such interactions without search-time probing. This approach interprets cumulative constraints as linear inequalities over occupancy vectors and generates valid inequalities by (i) discovering covers, the sets of tasks that cannot run in parallel, (ii) strengthening the cover inequalities for the discovered sets with lifting, and (iii) injecting the resulting constraints back into the scheduling problem instance. Experiments on standard RCPSP and RCPSP/max test suites show that these inferred constraints improve search performance and tighten objective bounds on favorable instances, while incurring little degradation on unfavorable ones. Additionally, these experiments discover 25 new lower bounds and five new best solutions; eight of the lower bounds are obtained directly from the inferred constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CARE Drive, a framework to evaluate whether vision language models in automated driving genuinely consider human-relevant reasons in their decisions, beyond just post-hoc rationalizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for vision language models in automated driving focus on outcomes like safety and trajectory accuracy, ignoring whether decisions reflect human-relevant considerations. This can lead to false confidence in safety-critical domains.

Method: CARE Drive compares baseline and reason-augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variations. It employs a two-stage process: prompt calibration for stable outputs and systematic contextual perturbation to measure sensitivity to human reasons.

Result: Explicit human reasons significantly influenced model decisions, aligning them closer to expert behavior. However, responsiveness varied across contextual factors, showing uneven sensitivity to different reason types.

Conclusion: CARE Drive demonstrates that reason responsiveness in foundation models can be evaluated systematically without modifying model parameters, providing empirical evidence for genuine decision alignment with human considerations.

Abstract: Foundation models, including vision language models, are increasingly used in automated driving to interpret scenes, recommend actions, and generate natural language explanations. However, existing evaluation methods primarily assess outcome based performance, such as safety and trajectory accuracy, without determining whether model decisions reflect human relevant considerations. As a result, it remains unclear whether explanations produced by such models correspond to genuine reason responsive decision making or merely post hoc rationalizations. This limitation is especially significant in safety critical domains because it can create false confidence. To address this gap, we propose CARE Drive, Context Aware Reasons Evaluation for Driving, a model agnostic framework for evaluating reason responsiveness in vision language models applied to automated driving. CARE Drive compares baseline and reason augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variation to assess whether human reasons causally influence decision behavior. The framework employs a two stage evaluation process. Prompt calibration ensures stable outputs. Systematic contextual perturbation then measures decision sensitivity to human reasons such as safety margins, social pressure, and efficiency constraints. We demonstrate CARE Drive in a cyclist overtaking scenario involving competing normative considerations. Results show that explicit human reasons significantly influence model decisions, improving alignment with expert recommended behavior. However, responsiveness varies across contextual factors, indicating uneven sensitivity to different types of reasons. These findings provide empirical evidence that reason responsiveness in foundation models can be systematically evaluated without modifying model parameters.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PERSONA is a training-free framework for dynamic personality control in LLMs by manipulating orthogonal trait vectors in activation space, achieving near-fine-tuning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for personality control are static or costly, missing the dynamic and compositional nature of human traits.

Method: PERSONA uses three stages: extracting orthogonal trait vectors (Persona-Base), controlling via vector arithmetic (Persona-Algebra), and dynamic composition during inference (Persona-Flow).

Result: Achieves 9.60 mean score on PersonalityBench (near fine-tuning's 9.61) and 91% win rates on Persona-Evolve for dynamic adaptation.

Conclusion: LLM personality traits are mathematically tractable, enabling interpretable and efficient behavioral control without training.

Abstract: Current methods for personality control in Large Language Models rely on static prompting or expensive fine-tuning, failing to capture the dynamic and compositional nature of human traits. We introduce PERSONA, a training-free framework that achieves fine-tuning level performance through direct manipulation of personality vectors in activation space. Our key insight is that personality traits appear as extractable, approximately orthogonal directions in the model's representation space that support algebraic operations. The framework operates through three stages: Persona-Base extracts orthogonal trait vectors via contrastive activation analysis; Persona-Algebra enables precise control through vector arithmetic (scalar multiplication for intensity, addition for composition, subtraction for suppression); and Persona-Flow achieves context-aware adaptation by dynamically composing these vectors during inference. On PersonalityBench, our approach achieves a mean score of 9.60, nearly matching the supervised fine-tuning upper bound of 9.61 without any gradient updates. On our proposed Persona-Evolve benchmark for dynamic personality adaptation, we achieve up to 91% win rates across diverse model families. These results provide evidence that aspects of LLM personality are mathematically tractable, opening new directions for interpretable and efficient behavioral control.

### [166] [Recursive Concept Evolution for Compositional Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15725)
*Sarim Chaudhry*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE), a framework that helps large language models dynamically modify their internal representations during inference to improve compositional reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models struggle with compositional reasoning tasks, as their fixed latent representation spaces limit their ability to handle new abstractions. Existing methods focus on token-level improvements but don't address the root issue.

Method: RCE enables models to dynamically generate low-rank concept subspaces during inference when representational gaps are detected. These subspaces are selected, merged, and consolidated via constrained optimization to maintain stability.

Result: When integrated with Mistral-7B, RCE significantly improves performance on compositional reasoning benchmarks, achieving 12-18 point gains on ARC-AGI-2 and 8-14 point improvements on GPQA and BBH, with reduced errors on MATH and HLE.

Conclusion: RCE effectively enhances compositional reasoning by allowing models to dynamically evolve their internal representations, addressing limitations of fixed latent spaces and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models achieve strong performance on many complex reasoning tasks, yet their accuracy degrades sharply on benchmarks that require compositional reasoning, including ARC-AGI-2, GPQA, MATH, BBH, and HLE. Existing methods improve reasoning by expanding token-level search through chain-of-thought prompting, self-consistency, or reinforcement learning, but they leave the model's latent representation space fixed. When the required abstraction is not already encoded in this space, performance collapses. We propose Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE), a framework that enables pretrained language models to modify their internal representation geometry during inference. RCE introduces dynamically generated low-rank concept subspaces that are spawned when representational inadequacy is detected, selected through a minimum description length criterion, merged when synergistic, and consolidated via constrained optimization to preserve stability. This process allows the model to construct new abstractions rather than recombining existing ones. We integrate RCE with Mistral-7B and evaluate it across compositional reasoning benchmarks. RCE yields 12-18 point gains on ARC-AGI-2, 8-14 point improvements on GPQA and BBH, and consistent reductions in depth-induced error on MATH and HLE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial observability hinders coordination in multi-agent systems; current methods like belief state estimation and communication fall short.

Method: GlobeDiff uses a multi-modal diffusion process to infer global states from local observations.

Result: GlobeDiff bounds estimation error and shows superior performance in experiments.

Conclusion: GlobeDiff effectively infers global states with high fidelity.

Abstract: In the realm of multi-agent systems, the challenge of \emph{partial observability} is a critical barrier to effective coordination and decision-making. Existing approaches, such as belief state estimation and inter-agent communication, often fall short. Belief-based methods are limited by their focus on past experiences without fully leveraging global information, while communication methods often lack a robust model to effectively utilize the auxiliary information they provide. To solve this issue, we propose Global State Diffusion Algorithm~(GlobeDiff) to infer the global state based on the local observations. By formulating the state inference process as a multi-modal diffusion process, GlobeDiff overcomes ambiguities in state estimation while simultaneously inferring the global state with high fidelity. We prove that the estimation error of GlobeDiff under both unimodal and multi-modal distributions can be bounded. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GlobeDiff achieves superior performance and is capable of accurately inferring the global state.

TL;DR: Comparison of heuristic and statistical calibration strategies for using LLMs in social science research, highlighting their suitability for exploratory vs. confirmatory studies and potential pitfalls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate the validity of using LLMs as synthetic participants in social science experiments and provide guidance for researchers.

Method: Contrast heuristic approaches (e.g., prompt engineering, fine-tuning) with statistical calibration (using auxiliary human data and adjustments) for estimating causal effects.

Result: Heuristic approaches are useful for exploratory tasks but lack formal guarantees, while statistical calibration offers validity and precision under explicit assumptions.

Conclusion: Both approaches' effectiveness depends on LLMs' approximation of relevant populations; myopic substitution of LLMs for humans may overlook broader opportunities.

Abstract: A growing literature uses large language models (LLMs) as synthetic participants to generate cost-effective and nearly instantaneous responses in social science experiments. However, there is limited guidance on when such simulations support valid inference about human behavior. We contrast two strategies for obtaining valid estimates of causal effects and clarify the assumptions under which each is suitable for exploratory versus confirmatory research. Heuristic approaches seek to establish that simulated and observed human behavior are interchangeable through prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and other repair strategies designed to reduce LLM-induced inaccuracies. While useful for many exploratory tasks, heuristic approaches lack the formal statistical guarantees typically required for confirmatory research. In contrast, statistical calibration combines auxiliary human data with statistical adjustments to account for discrepancies between observed and simulated responses. Under explicit assumptions, statistical calibration preserves validity and provides more precise estimates of causal effects at lower cost than experiments that rely solely on human participants. Yet the potential of both approaches depends on how well LLMs approximate the relevant populations. We consider what opportunities are overlooked when researchers focus myopically on substituting LLMs for human participants in a study.

TL;DR: The study proposes using LLM embeddings to improve AI model training in the AECO industry, outperforming traditional one-hot encoding in classifying building object subtypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional encoding methods like one-hot fail to capture nuanced relationships among building subtypes, limiting AI's semantic understanding in the AECO industry.

Method: The study employs LLM embeddings (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Meta LLaMA) and evaluates their performance using GraphSAGE models on 42 building object subtypes across five high-rise BIMs.

Result: LLM encodings outperformed one-hot encoding, with llama-3 (compacted) achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.8766 vs. 0.8475 for one-hot.

Conclusion: LLM-based encodings show promise for enhancing AI's interpretation of complex building semantics and could be widely applied in the AECO industry.

Abstract: Accurate representation of building semantics, encompassing both generic object types and specific subtypes, is essential for effective AI model training in the architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) industry. Conventional encoding methods (e.g., one-hot) often fail to convey the nuanced relationships among closely related subtypes, limiting AI's semantic comprehension. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel training approach that employs large language model (LLM) embeddings (e.g., OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA) as encodings to preserve finer distinctions in building semantics. We evaluated the proposed method by training GraphSAGE models to classify 42 building object subtypes across five high-rise residential building information models (BIMs). Various embedding dimensions were tested, including original high-dimensional LLM embeddings (1,536, 3,072, or 4,096) and 1,024-dimensional compacted embeddings generated via the Matryoshka representation model. Experimental results demonstrated that LLM encodings outperformed the conventional one-hot baseline, with the llama-3 (compacted) embedding achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.8766, compared to 0.8475 for one-hot encoding. The results underscore the promise of leveraging LLM-based encodings to enhance AI's ability to interpret complex, domain-specific building semantics. As the capabilities of LLMs and dimensionality reduction techniques continue to evolve, this approach holds considerable potential for broad application in semantic elaboration tasks throughout the AECO industry.

Motivation: The transition to autonomous agents faces barriers in cross-platform, decentralized, and secure interactions, which ACP aims to resolve.

Result: ACP reduces inter-agent communication latency while ensuring zero-trust security.

Conclusion: ACP is a significant step toward a scalable and interoperable ecosystem of autonomous agents.

Abstract: In the artificial intelligence space, as we transition from isolated large language models to autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. While foundational architectures and local context management protocols have been established, the challenge of cross-platform, decentralized, and secure interaction remains a significant barrier to the realization of a truly Agentic Web. Building upon the foundations of AI agent architectures and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for multi-agent coordination, this paper introduces the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP). ACP provides a standardized framework for Agent-to-Agent (AA) interaction, enabling heterogeneous agents to discover, negotiate, and execute collaborative workflows across disparate environments. We propose a federated orchestration model that integrates decentralized identity verification, semantic intent mapping, and automated service-level agreements. Our evaluation demonstrates that ACP reduces inter-agent communication latency by % while maintaining a zero-trust security posture.

Motivation: The study addresses the safety problem of collusion among LLM agents pursuing secondary goals, degrading cooperative tasks.

Method: Colosseum uses Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) to model cooperation and measures collusion via regret relative to the cooperative optimum. It tests LLMs under varying objectives, persuasion tactics, and network topologies.

Result: Most models showed collusion tendencies with secret channels, but some exhibited "collusion on paper"—planning collusion without impactful actions.

Conclusion: Colosseum offers a verifiable framework to study collusion through communication and action analysis.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems, where LLM agents communicate through free-form language, enable sophisticated coordination for solving complex cooperative tasks. This surfaces a unique safety problem when individual agents form a coalition and \emph{collude} to pursue secondary goals and degrade the joint objective. In this paper, we present Colosseum, a framework for auditing LLM agents' collusive behavior in multi-agent settings. We ground how agents cooperate through a Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) and measure collusion via regret relative to the cooperative optimum. Colosseum tests each LLM for collusion under different objectives, persuasion tactics, and network topologies. Through our audit, we show that most out-of-the-box models exhibited a propensity to collude when a secret communication channel was artificially formed. Furthermore, we discover ``collusion on paper'' when agents plan to collude in text but would often pick non-collusive actions, thus providing little effect on the joint task. Colosseum provides a new way to study collusion by measuring communications and actions in rich yet verifiable environments.

Result: Achieved a 32% reduction in computational costs and enhanced performance consistency.

Conclusion: Effective optimization strategies for NetLogo on AWS can significantly improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: The rising complexity and scale of agent-based models (ABMs) necessitate efficient computational strategies to manage the increasing demand for processing power and memory. This manuscript provides a comprehensive guide to optimizing NetLogo, a widely used platform for ABMs, for running large-scale models on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and other cloud infrastructures. It covers best practices in memory management, Java options, BehaviorSpace execution, and AWS instance selection. By implementing these optimizations and selecting appropriate AWS instances, we achieved a 32\% reduction in computational costs and improved performance consistency. Through a comparative analysis of NetLogo simulations on different AWS instances using the wolf-sheep predation model, we demonstrate the performance gains achievable through these optimizations.
