### [1] [Egocentric Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15892)
*Maijunxian Wang,Yijiang Li,Bingyang Wang,Tianwei Zhao,Ran Ji,Qingying Gao,Emmy Liu,Hokin Deng,Dezhi Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlipSet is a benchmark for Level-2 visual perspective taking (L2 VPT) in vision-language models, revealing egocentric bias and compositional deficits in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and diagnose the ability of vision-language models (VLMs) to perform Level-2 visual perspective taking (L2 VPT), isolating spatial transformation from 3D scene complexity.

Method: Introducing FlipSet, a task simulating 180-degree rotations of 2D character strings from another agent's viewpoint. Evaluated 103 VLMs.

Result: Most VLMs exhibit systematic egocentric bias, performing below chance, with 75% of errors reproducing the camera viewpoint. Models struggle to integrate social awareness with spatial operations.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack mechanisms to bind social awareness to spatial reasoning, highlighting fundamental limitations. FlipSet offers a testbed for diagnosing perspective-taking in multimodal systems.

Abstract: Visual perspective taking--inferring how the world appears from another's viewpoint--is foundational to social cognition. We introduce FlipSet, a diagnostic benchmark for Level-2 visual perspective taking (L2 VPT) in vision-language models. The task requires simulating 180-degree rotations of 2D character strings from another agent's perspective, isolating spatial transformation from 3D scene complexity. Evaluating 103 VLMs reveals systematic egocentric bias: the vast majority perform below chance, with roughly three-quarters of errors reproducing the camera viewpoint. Control experiments expose a compositional deficit--models achieve high theory-of-mind accuracy and above-chance mental rotation in isolation, yet fail catastrophically when integration is required. This dissociation indicates that current VLMs lack the mechanisms needed to bind social awareness to spatial operations, suggesting fundamental limitations in model-based spatial reasoning. FlipSet provides a cognitively grounded testbed for diagnosing perspective-taking capabilities in multimodal systems.

### [2] [Detecting Deepfakes with Multivariate Soft Blending and CLIP-based Image-Text Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15903)
*Jingwei Li,Jiaxin Tong,Pengfei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSBA-CLIP, a framework combining CLIP-guided forgery detection with multivariate blending augmentation for improved deepfake detection accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods struggle with accuracy and generalization due to diverse forgery techniques.

Method: Proposes MSBA-CLIP, leveraging CLIP for forgery trace detection, blending augmentation for generalization, and an intensity estimation module for varied forgery patterns.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 3.32% accuracy and 4.02% AUC improvements in-domain, and a 3.27% AUC gain cross-domain.

Conclusion: MSBA-CLIP advances deepfake detection by improving generalizability, though it incurs higher computational costs.

Abstract: The proliferation of highly realistic facial forgeries necessitates robust detection methods. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited accuracy and poor generalization due to significant distribution shifts among samples generated by diverse forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation with CLIP-guided Forgery Intensity Estimation (MSBA-CLIP) framework. Our method leverages the multimodal alignment capabilities of CLIP to capture subtle forgery traces. We introduce a Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation (MSBA) strategy that synthesizes images by blending forgeries from multiple methods with random weights, forcing the model to learn generalizable patterns. Furthermore, a dedicated Multivariate Forgery Intensity Estimation (MFIE) module is designed to explicitly guide the model in learning features related to varied forgery modes and intensities. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. On in-domain tests, our method improves Accuracy and AUC by 3.32\% and 4.02\%, respectively, over the best baseline. In cross-domain evaluations across five datasets, it achieves an average AUC gain of 3.27\%. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of both proposed components. While the reliance on a large vision-language model entails higher computational cost, our work presents a significant step towards more generalizable and robust deepfake detection.

### [3] [A Comprehensive Survey on Deep Learning-Based LiDAR Super-Resolution for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15904)
*June Moh Goo,Zichao Zeng,Jan Boehm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides the first survey on LiDAR super-resolution methods for autonomous driving, categorizing approaches into CNN-based, deep unrolling, implicit representation, and Transformer/Mamba-based, with insights into current trends and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for high-resolution LiDAR sensors in autonomous driving is unmet due to cost and low-resolution limitations, prompting research into super-resolution techniques to enhance sparse point clouds.

Method: The survey categorizes existing methods into four groups, discusses data representations, problem formulation, datasets, metrics, and highlights trends like range image usage and real-time inference.

Result: Key trends include efficient processing with range images, model compression, and flexible architectures, with recent focus on real-time performance and cross-sensor generalization.

Conclusion: Open challenges remain, and future research should address these gaps to further advance LiDAR super-resolution technology.

Abstract: LiDAR sensors are often considered essential for autonomous driving, but high-resolution sensors remain expensive while affordable low-resolution sensors produce sparse point clouds that miss critical details. LiDAR super-resolution addresses this challenge by using deep learning to enhance sparse point clouds, bridging the gap between different sensor types and enabling cross-sensor compatibility in real-world deployments. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of LiDAR super-resolution methods for autonomous driving. Despite the importance of practical deployment, no systematic review has been conducted until now. We organize existing approaches into four categories: CNN-based architectures, model-based deep unrolling, implicit representation methods, and Transformer and Mamba-based approaches. We establish fundamental concepts including data representations, problem formulation, benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics. Current trends include the adoption of range image representation for efficient processing, extreme model compression and the development of resolution-flexible architectures. Recent research prioritizes real-time inference and cross-sensor generalization for practical deployment. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future research directions for advancing LiDAR super-resolution technology.

### [4] [MaS-VQA: A Mask-and-Select Framework for Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15915)
*Xianwei Mao,Kai Ye,Sheng Zhou,Nan Zhang,Haikuan Huang,Bin Li,Jiajun Bu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaS-VQA improves KB-VQA by filtering noisy external knowledge and aligning it with visual content, enhancing reasoning accuracy through selective pruning and guided activation of internal knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KB-VQA struggles with noisy external knowledge and uncontrolled internal knowledge, limiting reasoning effectiveness and answer accuracy.

Method: Proposes MaS-VQA, which uses a Mask-and-Select mechanism to filter irrelevant image regions and knowledge fragments, then guides internal knowledge activation in a constrained space.

Result: Experiments show performance gains on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek, with noise reduction and better knowledge utilization confirmed via ablations.

Conclusion: MaS-VQA effectively integrates explicit and implicit knowledge for robust VQA by refining knowledge selection and alignment.

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) requires models to answer questions by integrating visual information with external knowledge. However, retrieved knowledge is often noisy, partially irrelevant, or misaligned with the visual content, while internal model knowledge is difficult to control and interpret. Naive aggregation of these sources limits reasoning effectiveness and reduces answer accuracy. To address this, we propose MaS-VQA, a selection-driven framework that tightly couples explicit knowledge filtering with implicit knowledge reasoning. MaS-VQA first retrieves candidate passages and applies a Mask-and-Select mechanism to jointly prune irrelevant image regions and weakly relevant knowledge fragments, producing compact, high-signal multimodal knowledge . This filtered knowledge then guides the activation of internal knowledge in a constrained semantic space, enabling complementary co-modeling of explicit and implicit knowledge for robust answer prediction. Experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate consistent performance gains across multiple MLLM backbones, and ablations verify that the selection mechanism effectively reduces noise and enhances knowledge utilization.

### [5] [EarthSpatialBench: Benchmarking Spatial Reasoning Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs on Earth Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15918)
*Zelin Xu,Yupu Zhang,Saugat Adhikari,Saiful Islam,Tingsong Xiao,Zibo Liu,Shigang Chen,Da Yan,Zhe Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EarthSpatialBench is proposed to evaluate spatial reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for Earth imagery, addressing gaps like distance, direction, and topological relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation of spatial reasoning (e.g., quantitative direction, distance, and complex geometries) in Earth imagery.

Method: Developed EarthSpatialBench with 325K+ question-answer pairs covering distance, direction, topological relations, and object geometries.

Result: Experiments revealed limitations in MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: EarthSpatialBench fills a critical gap in benchmarking spatial reasoning for Earth imagery, highlighting areas for MLLM improvement.

Abstract: Benchmarking spatial reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has attracted growing interest in computer vision due to its importance for embodied AI and other agentic systems that require precise interaction with the physical world. However, spatial reasoning on Earth imagery has lagged behind, as it uniquely involves grounding objects in georeferenced images and quantitatively reasoning about distances, directions, and topological relations using both visual cues and vector geometry coordinates (e.g., 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons). Existing benchmarks for Earth imagery primarily focus on 2D spatial grounding, image captioning, and coarse spatial relations (e.g., simple directional or proximity cues). They lack support for quantitative direction and distance reasoning, systematic topological relations, and complex object geometries beyond bounding boxes. To fill this gap, we propose \textbf{EarthSpatialBench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in MLLMs on Earth imagery. The benchmark contains over 325K question-answer pairs spanning: (1) qualitative and quantitative reasoning about spatial distance and direction; (2) systematic topological relations; (3) single-object queries, object-pair queries, and compositional aggregate group queries; and (4) object references expressed via textual descriptions, visual overlays, and explicit geometry coordinates, including 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons. We conducted extensive experiments on both open-source and proprietary models to identify limitations in the spatial reasoning of MLLMs.

### [7] [Visual Memory Injection Attacks for Multi-Turn Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15927)
*Christian Schlarmann,Matthias Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack targeting LVLMs, which manipulates user interactions in multi-turn conversations via perturbed images, revealing significant security vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the underexplored security risks of LVLMs in multi-turn settings, where attackers could exploit manipulated images to influence users covertly.

Method: The proposed VMI attack involves uploading a manipulated image to the web, which benign users download and input into LVLMs. The attack triggers specific outputs upon certain prompts, remaining undetected otherwise.

Result: The VMI attack successfully manipulates LVLMs in multi-turn conversations, demonstrating feasibility for adversarial marketing or political persuasion.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for improved LVLM robustness against such attacks, emphasizing the potential for large-scale user manipulation.

Abstract: Generative large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance gains, and their user base is growing rapidly. However, the security of LVLMs, in particular in a long-context multi-turn setting, is largely underexplored. In this paper, we consider the realistic scenario in which an attacker uploads a manipulated image to the web/social media. A benign user downloads this image and uses it as input to the LVLM. Our novel stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack is designed such that on normal prompts the LVLM exhibits nominal behavior, but once the user gives a triggering prompt, the LVLM outputs a specific prescribed target message to manipulate the user, e.g. for adversarial marketing or political persuasion. Compared to previous work that focused on single-turn attacks, VMI is effective even after a long multi-turn conversation with the user. We demonstrate our attack on several recent open-weight LVLMs. This article thereby shows that large-scale manipulation of users is feasible with perturbed images in multi-turn conversation settings, calling for better robustness of LVLMs against these attacks.

### [8] [Can Vision-Language Models See Squares? Text-Recognition Mediates Spatial Reasoning Across Three Model Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15950)
*Yuval Levental*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a simple experiment that exposes a fundamental limitation in vision-language models (VLMs): the inability to accurately localize filled cells in binary grids when those cells lack textual identity. We generate fifteen 15x15 grids with varying density (10.7%-41.8% filled cells) and render each as two image types -- text symbols (. and #) and filled squares without gridlines -- then ask three frontier VLMs (Claude Opus, ChatGPT 5.2, and Gemini 3 Thinking) to transcribe them. In the text-symbol condition, Claude and ChatGPT achieve approximately 91% cell accuracy and 84% F1, while Gemini achieves 84% accuracy and 63% F1. In the filled-squares condition, all three models collapse to 60-73% accuracy and 29-39% F1. Critically, all conditions pass through the same visual encoder -- the text symbols are images, not tokenized text. The text-vs-squares F1 gap ranges from 34 to 54 points across models, demonstrating that VLMs behave as if they possess a high-fidelity text-recognition pathway for spatial reasoning that dramatically outperforms their native visual pathway. Each model exhibits a distinct failure mode in the squares condition -- systematic under-counting (Claude), massive over-counting (ChatGPT), and template hallucination (Gemini) -- but all share the same underlying deficit: severely degraded spatial localization for non-textual visual elements.

### [9] [Position-Aware Scene-Appearance Disentanglement for Bidirectional Photoacoustic Microscopy Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15959)
*Yiwen Wang,Jiahao Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPEReg-Net, a novel framework, disentangles domain-invariant features from domain-specific appearance codes using AdaIN and employs a Global Position Encoding module for improved temporal coherence in high-speed OR-PAM imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing registration methods struggle with coupled domain shift and geometric misalignment in bidirectional OR-PAM, limiting alignment quality.

Method: GPEReg-Net uses AdaIN for scene-appearance disentanglement and incorporates a GPE module with cross-frame attention for temporal coherence.

Result: GPEReg-Net achieves superior metrics (NCC 0.953, SSIM 0.932, PSNR 34.49dB) on the OR-PAM-Reg-4K benchmark, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GPEReg-Net significantly improves registration quality and temporal coherence in high-speed OR-PAM, offering a robust solution for coupled domain shifts and misalignments.

Abstract: High-speed optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) with bidirectional raster scanning doubles imaging speed but introduces coupled domain shift and geometric misalignment between forward and backward scan lines. Existing registration methods, constrained by brightness constancy assumptions, achieve limited alignment quality, while recent generative approaches address domain shift through complex architectures that lack temporal awareness across frames. We propose GPEReg-Net, a scene-appearance disentanglement framework that separates domain-invariant scene features from domain-specific appearance codes via Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN), enabling direct image-to-image registration without explicit deformation field estimation. To exploit temporal structure in sequential acquisitions, we introduce a Global Position Encoding (GPE) module that combines learnable position embeddings with sinusoidal encoding and cross-frame attention, allowing the network to leverage context from neighboring frames for improved temporal coherence. On the OR-PAM-Reg-4K benchmark (432 test samples), GPEReg-Net achieves NCC of 0.953, SSIM of 0.932, and PSNR of 34.49dB, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 3.8% in SSIM and 1.99dB in PSNR while maintaining competitive NCC. Code is available at https://github.com/JiahaoQin/GPEReg-Net.

### [10] [Automated Re-Identification of Holstein-Friesian Cattle in Dense Crowds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15962)
*Phoenix Yu,Tilo Burghardt,Andrew W Dowsey,Neill W Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a detect-segment-identify pipeline for Holstein-Friesian detection and Re-ID in crowded scenarios, achieving high accuracy without manual intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail when cows group closely due to outline-breaking coat patterns, prompting a need for a more effective and transferable solution.

Method: Proposes a pipeline combining Open-Vocabulary Weight-free Localisation, Segment Anything models, and Re-ID networks, evaluated on a dairy farm CCTV dataset.

Result: Achieves 98.93% detection accuracy and 94.82% Re-ID accuracy, outperforming baselines significantly.

Conclusion: The pipeline proves practical and reliable for crowded farm settings, with code and dataset shared for reproducibility.

Abstract: Holstein-Friesian detection and re-identification (Re-ID) methods capture individuals well when targets are spatially separate. However, existing approaches, including YOLO-based species detection, break down when cows group closely together. This is particularly prevalent for species which have outline-breaking coat patterns. To boost both effectiveness and transferability in this setting, we propose a new detect-segment-identify pipeline that leverages the Open-Vocabulary Weight-free Localisation and the Segment Anything models as pre-processing stages alongside Re-ID networks. To evaluate our approach, we publish a collection of nine days CCTV data filmed on a working dairy farm. Our methodology overcomes detection breakdown in dense animal groupings, resulting in a 98.93% accuracy. This significantly outperforms current oriented bounding box-driven, as well as SAM species detection baselines with accuracy improvements of 47.52% and 27.13%, respectively. We show that unsupervised contrastive learning can build on this to yield 94.82% Re-ID accuracy on our test data. Our work demonstrates that Re-ID in crowded scenarios is both practical as well as reliable in working farm settings with no manual intervention. Code and dataset are provided for reproducibility.

### [11] [Non-Contact Physiological Monitoring in Pediatric Intensive Care Units via Adaptive Masking and Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15967)
*Mohamed Khalil Ben Salah,Philippe Jouvet,Rita Noumeir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised pretraining framework for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) in PICUs, using VisionMamba and adaptive masking to improve heart rate monitoring accuracy despite motion artifacts and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contact-based sensors in PICUs cause discomfort and skin issues, while rPPG lacks clinical adoption due to challenges like motion artifacts and domain shifts.

Method: The framework uses progressive curriculum pretraining with VisionMamba and adaptive masking. A teacher-student setup leverages public data for guidance, progressing from clean videos to synthetic occlusions and unlabeled clinical data.

Result: The approach reduces mean absolute error by 42% compared to standard methods, achieving a final MAE of 3.2 bpm, and outperforms PhysFormer by 31%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances rPPG accuracy in PICUs, addressing clinical challenges without explicit region-of-interest extraction, and shows robustness under occlusion and noise.

Abstract: Continuous monitoring of vital signs in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) is essential for early detection of clinical deterioration and effective clinical decision-making. However, contact-based sensors such as pulse oximeters may cause skin irritation, increase infection risk, and lead to patient discomfort. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a contactless alternative to monitor heart rate using facial video, but remains underutilized in PICUs due to motion artifacts, occlusions, variable lighting, and domain shifts between laboratory and clinical data.
  We introduce a self-supervised pretraining framework for rPPG estimation in the PICU setting, based on a progressive curriculum strategy. The approach leverages the VisionMamba architecture and integrates an adaptive masking mechanism, where a lightweight Mamba-based controller assigns spatiotemporal importance scores to guide probabilistic patch sampling. This strategy dynamically increases reconstruction difficulty while preserving physiological relevance.
  To address the lack of labeled clinical data, we adopt a teacher-student distillation setup. A supervised expert model, trained on public datasets, provides latent physiological guidance to the student. The curriculum progresses through three stages: clean public videos, synthetic occlusion scenarios, and unlabeled videos from 500 pediatric patients.
  Our framework achieves a 42% reduction in mean absolute error relative to standard masked autoencoders and outperforms PhysFormer by 31%, reaching a final MAE of 3.2 bpm. Without explicit region-of-interest extraction, the model consistently attends to pulse-rich areas and demonstrates robustness under clinical occlusions and noise.

### [12] [LAND: A Longitudinal Analysis of Neuromorphic Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15973)
*Gregory Cohen,Alexandre Marcireau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges in neuromorphic datasets, including accessibility, standardization, and the rise of synthetic data, while proposing meta-datasets as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing need for more and better neuromorphic datasets, highlighting issues like lack of standardization and practical difficulties in using existing datasets.

Method: The paper reviews over 423 neuromorphic datasets, analyzing their tasks, structure, and accessibility, while exploring synthetic datasets and proposing meta-datasets.

Result: Key findings include difficulties due to dataset size, lack of standardization, and the rise of synthetic datasets, which may introduce biases.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by advocating for meta-datasets to reduce data needs and biases, while emphasizing the importance of standardized, accessible datasets.

Abstract: Neuromorphic engineering has a data problem. Despite the meteoric rise in the number of neuromorphic datasets published over the past ten years, the conclusion of a significant portion of neuromorphic research papers still states that there is a need for yet more data and even larger datasets. Whilst this need is driven in part by the sheer volume of data required by modern deep learning approaches, it is also fuelled by the current state of the available neuromorphic datasets and the difficulties in finding them, understanding their purpose, and determining the nature of their underlying task. This is further compounded by practical difficulties in downloading and using these datasets. This review starts by capturing a snapshot of the existing neuromorphic datasets, covering over 423 datasets, and then explores the nature of their tasks and the underlying structure of the presented data. Analysing these datasets shows the difficulties arising from their size, the lack of standardisation, and difficulties in accessing the actual data. This paper also highlights the growth in the size of individual datasets and the complexities involved in working with the data. However, a more important concern is the rise of synthetic datasets, created by either simulation or video-to-events methods. This review explores the benefits of simulated data for testing existing algorithms and applications, highlighting the potential pitfalls for exploring new applications of neuromorphic technologies. This review also introduces the concepts of meta-datasets, created from existing datasets, as a way of both reducing the need for more data, and to remove potential bias arising from defining both the dataset and the task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM 3D Body (3DB) is a state-of-the-art promptable model for 3D human mesh recovery, using a novel Momentum Human Rig (MHR) representation for pose and shape. It supports user-guided inference via prompts and outperforms prior methods in diverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to advance 3D human mesh recovery by addressing generalization and accuracy challenges in diverse real-world scenarios, introducing a promptable model with a new parametric representation.

Method: 3DB employs an encoder-decoder architecture with auxiliary prompts (e.g., 2D keypoints/masks). It uses MHR to decouple pose and shape, and leverages a multi-stage annotation pipeline for high-quality training data.

Result: 3DB achieves superior generalization and outperforms existing methods in qualitative and quantitative evaluations. A new evaluation dataset enables detailed analysis.

Conclusion: The paper introduces SAM 3D Body (3DB) and Momentum Human Rig (MHR), demonstrating significant improvements in 3D human mesh recovery, with open-source availability.

Abstract: We introduce SAM 3D Body (3DB), a promptable model for single-image full-body 3D human mesh recovery (HMR) that demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with strong generalization and consistent accuracy in diverse in-the-wild conditions. 3DB estimates the human pose of the body, feet, and hands. It is the first model to use a new parametric mesh representation, Momentum Human Rig (MHR), which decouples skeletal structure and surface shape. 3DB employs an encoder-decoder architecture and supports auxiliary prompts, including 2D keypoints and masks, enabling user-guided inference similar to the SAM family of models. We derive high-quality annotations from a multi-stage annotation pipeline that uses various combinations of manual keypoint annotation, differentiable optimization, multi-view geometry, and dense keypoint detection. Our data engine efficiently selects and processes data to ensure data diversity, collecting unusual poses and rare imaging conditions. We present a new evaluation dataset organized by pose and appearance categories, enabling nuanced analysis of model behavior. Our experiments demonstrate superior generalization and substantial improvements over prior methods in both qualitative user preference studies and traditional quantitative analysis. Both 3DB and MHR are open-source.

### [14] [MedProbCLIP: Probabilistic Adaptation of Vision-Language Foundation Model for Reliable Radiograph-Report Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16019)
*Ahmad Elallaf,Yu Zhang,Yuktha Priya Masupalli,Jeong Yang,Young Lee,Zechun Cao,Gongbo Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedProbCLIP is a probabilistic vision-language framework for chest X-ray and radiology report representation, improving reliability and trustworthiness in biomedical applications compared to deterministic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic embeddings in vision-language models lack reliability for high-stakes biomedical tasks, necessitating probabilistic approaches to capture uncertainty and improve trustworthiness.

Method: MedProbCLIP uses Gaussian embeddings and a probabilistic contrastive objective, with variational information bottlenecking and multi-view/multi-section encoding during training for fine-grained supervision.

Result: Outperforms baselines like CLIP and PCME++ in retrieval and zero-shot classification on MIMIC-CXR, with superior calibration, robustness, and selective retrieval reliability.

Conclusion: Probabilistic vision-language modeling enhances trustworthiness and safety in radiology image-text retrieval systems, making MedProbCLIP valuable for clinical applications.

Abstract: Vision-language foundation models have emerged as powerful general-purpose representation learners with strong potential for multimodal understanding, but their deterministic embeddings often fail to provide the reliability required for high-stakes biomedical applications. This work introduces MedProbCLIP, a probabilistic vision-language learning framework for chest X-ray and radiology report representation learning and bidirectional retrieval. MedProbCLIP models image and text representations as Gaussian embeddings through a probabilistic contrastive objective that explicitly captures uncertainty and many-to-many correspondences between radiographs and clinical narratives. A variational information bottleneck mitigates overconfident predictions, while MedProbCLIP employs multi-view radiograph encoding and multi-section report encoding during training to provide fine-grained supervision for clinically aligned correspondence, yet requires only a single radiograph and a single report at inference. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, MedProbCLIP outperforms deterministic and probabilistic baselines, including CLIP, CXR-CLIP, and PCME++, in both retrieval and zero-shot classification. Beyond accuracy, MedProbCLIP demonstrates superior calibration, risk-coverage behavior, selective retrieval reliability, and robustness to clinically relevant corruptions, underscoring the value of probabilistic vision-language modeling for improving the trustworthiness and safety of radiology image-text retrieval systems.

### [15] [LGQ: Learning Discretization Geometry for Scalable and Stable Image Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16086)
*Idil Bilge Altun,Mert Onur Cakiroglu,Elham Buxton,Mehmet Dalkilic,Hasan Kurban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Learnable Geometric Quantization (LGQ) introduces a differentiable image tokenizer that optimizes discretization geometry end-to-end, improving efficiency and semantic preservation over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image tokenizers face trade-offs between flexibility and stability, such as biased optimization or inefficient capacity utilization. LGQ aims to address these limitations by learning optimal discretization geometry.

Method: LGQ replaces hard nearest-neighbor lookup with soft assignments controlled by temperature, enabling differentiable training. It uses a token-level peakedness regularizer and a global usage regularizer to balance code utilization without rigid grids.

Result: LGQ outperforms FSQ and SimVQ in rFID scores while using significantly fewer active codes, achieving comparable fidelity with more efficient representation.

Conclusion: LGQ provides a stable and efficient solution for discrete image tokenization, balancing flexible geometry learning with effective capacity utilization.

Abstract: Discrete image tokenization is a key bottleneck for scalable visual generation: a tokenizer must remain compact for efficient latent-space priors while preserving semantic structure and using discrete capacity effectively. Existing quantizers face a trade-off: vector-quantized tokenizers learn flexible geometries but often suffer from biased straight-through optimization, codebook under-utilization, and representation collapse at large vocabularies. Structured scalar or implicit tokenizers ensure stable, near-complete utilization by design, yet rely on fixed discretization geometries that may allocate capacity inefficiently under heterogeneous latent statistics.
  We introduce Learnable Geometric Quantization (LGQ), a discrete image tokenizer that learns discretization geometry end-to-end. LGQ replaces hard nearest-neighbor lookup with temperature-controlled soft assignments, enabling fully differentiable training while recovering hard assignments at inference. The assignments correspond to posterior responsibilities of an isotropic Gaussian mixture and minimize a variational free-energy objective, provably converging to nearest-neighbor quantization in the low-temperature limit. LGQ combines a token-level peakedness regularizer with a global usage regularizer to encourage confident yet balanced code utilization without imposing rigid grids.
  Under a controlled VQGAN-style backbone on ImageNet across multiple vocabulary sizes, LGQ achieves stable optimization and balanced utilization. At 16K codebook size, LGQ improves rFID by 11.88% over FSQ while using 49.96% fewer active codes, and improves rFID by 6.06% over SimVQ with 49.45% lower effective representation rate, achieving comparable fidelity with substantially fewer active entries.

### [16] [OmniCT: Towards a Unified Slice-Volume LVLM for Comprehensive CT Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16110)
*Tianwei Lin,Zhongwei Qiu,Wenqiao Zhang,Jiang Liu,Yihan Xie,Mingjian Gao,Zhenxuan Fan,Zhaocheng Li,Sijing Li,Zhongle Xie,Peng LU,Yueting Zhuang,Yingda Xia,Ling Zhang,Beng Chin Ooi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniCT is a unified slice-volume Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) for CT imaging, addressing fragmentation in slice and volumetric understanding. It introduces spatial and semantic enhancements and a comprehensive evaluation dataset, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs for CT imaging are fragmented: slice-driven models lack spatial consistency, while volume-driven models have coarse granularity and poor compatibility with slice inputs. This fragmentation hinders clinical translation.

Method: OmniCT integrates Spatial Consistency Enhancement (volumetric slice composition, tri-axial positional embedding, and MoE hybrid projection) and Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (segmentation and ROI localization) to unify slice and volumetric understanding.

Result: OmniCT outperforms existing methods significantly across diverse clinical tasks, balancing micro-level detail sensitivity and macro-level spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: OmniCT establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal medical imaging understanding, demonstrating strong clinical applicability and setting a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used and diagnostically information-dense imaging modalities, covering critical organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, and colon. Clinical interpretation relies on both slice-driven local features (e.g., sub-centimeter nodules, lesion boundaries) and volume-driven spatial representations (e.g., tumor infiltration, inter-organ anatomical relations). However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain fragmented in CT slice versus volumetric understanding: slice-driven LVLMs show strong generalization but lack cross-slice spatial consistency, while volume-driven LVLMs explicitly capture volumetric semantics but suffer from coarse granularity and poor compatibility with slice inputs. The absence of a unified modeling paradigm constitutes a major bottleneck for the clinical translation of medical LVLMs. We present OmniCT, a powerful unified slice-volume LVLM for CT scenarios, which makes three contributions: (i) Spatial Consistency Enhancement (SCE): volumetric slice composition combined with tri-axial positional embedding that introduces volumetric consistency, and an MoE hybrid projection enables efficient slice-volume adaptation; (ii) Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (OSE): segmentation and ROI localization explicitly align anatomical regions, emphasizing lesion- and organ-level semantics; (iii) MedEval-CT: the largest slice-volume CT dataset and hybrid benchmark integrates comprehensive metrics for unified evaluation. OmniCT consistently outperforms existing methods with a substantial margin across diverse clinical tasks and satisfies both micro-level detail sensitivity and macro-level spatial reasoning. More importantly, it establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal medical imaging understanding.

*Joel Mathew Cherian,Ashutosh Muralidhara Bharadwaj,Vima Gupta,Anand Padmanabha Iyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHAI introduces Cache Attention to speed up text-to-video diffusion models by reusing cached latents, maintaining quality with fewer steps and achieving up to 3.35x faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for speeding up text-to-video diffusion models either require costly retraining or sacrifice video quality with heuristic-based step skipping. CHAI aims to reduce latency without compromising quality.

Method: CHAI uses cross-inference caching and Cache Attention, a selective attention mechanism, to reuse latents across semantically related prompts, enabling fewer denoising steps (as low as 8) while maintaining quality.

Result: CHAI achieves 1.65x - 3.35x faster inference than OpenSora 1.2 and maintains video quality even with reduced denoising steps.

Conclusion: CHAI successfully balances speed and quality in text-to-video generation by leveraging cached latents and Cache Attention, offering a practical solution for efficient video synthesis.

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models deliver impressive results but remain slow because of the sequential denoising of 3D latents. Existing approaches to speed up inference either require expensive model retraining or use heuristic-based step skipping, which struggles to maintain video quality as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our work, CHAI, aims to use cross-inference caching to reduce latency while maintaining video quality. We introduce Cache Attention as an effective method for attending to shared objects/scenes across cross-inference latents. This selective attention mechanism enables effective reuse of cached latents across semantically related prompts, yielding high cache hit rates. We show that it is possible to generate high-quality videos using Cache Attention with as few as 8 denoising steps. When integrated into the overall system, CHAI is 1.65x - 3.35x faster than baseline OpenSora 1.2 while maintaining video quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRIS uses real-time eye-tracking data to improve ambiguity resolution in open-ended VQA, boosting accuracy from 35.2% to 77.2% for ambiguous questions without affecting unambiguous ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address ambiguity in open-ended VQA tasks by leveraging eye-tracking data, as traditional methods struggle with ambiguous queries.

Method: IRIS employs eye-tracking data collected during verbal question-asking phases, focusing on fixations closest to question onset for disambiguation in VLMs.

Result: The approach significantly improves response accuracy for ambiguous questions (35.2% to 77.2%) without compromising performance on unambiguous ones, validated across VLMs.

Conclusion: IRIS demonstrates the potential of real-time eye-tracking data to enhance VQA systems, providing tools like a benchmark dataset and evaluation suite.

Abstract: We introduce IRIS (Intent Resolution via Inference-time Saccades), a novel training-free approach that uses eye-tracking data in real-time to resolve ambiguity in open-ended VQA. Through a comprehensive user study with 500 unique image-question pairs, we demonstrate that fixations closest to the time participants start verbally asking their questions are the most informative for disambiguation in Large VLMs, more than doubling the accuracy of responses on ambiguous questions (from 35.2% to 77.2%) while maintaining performance on unambiguous queries. We evaluate our approach across state-of-the-art VLMs, showing consistent improvements when gaze data is incorporated in ambiguous image-question pairs, regardless of architectural differences. We release a new benchmark dataset to use eye movement data for disambiguated VQA, a novel real-time interactive protocol, and an evaluation suite.

*Huichan Seo,Minki Hong,Sieun Choi,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines demographic bias in instruction-guided image-to-image (I2I) editing, identifying failures like Soft Erasure and Stereotype Replacement, and proposes solutions to mitigate bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore underexamined demographic-conditioned failures in I2I editing, highlighting systemic disparities in edit outcomes across subject demographics.

Method: The study introduces a controlled benchmark using diagnostic prompts to evaluate I2I editors through VLM scoring and human evaluation, focusing on race, gender, and age.

Result: Findings reveal pervasive and uneven identity preservation failures influenced by implicit social priors, with a proposed prompt-level constraint reducing bias for minority groups.

Conclusion: The study underscores identity preservation as a critical, demographically uneven issue in I2I editing and advocates for demographic-robust systems.

Abstract: Demographic bias in text-to-image (T2I) generation is well studied, yet demographic-conditioned failures in instruction-guided image-to-image (I2I) editing remain underexplored. We examine whether identical edit instructions yield systematically different outcomes across subject demographics in open-weight I2I editors. We formalize two failure modes: Soft Erasure, where edits are silently weakened or ignored in the output image, and Stereotype Replacement, where edits introduce unrequested, stereotype-consistent attributes. We introduce a controlled benchmark that probes demographic-conditioned behavior by generating and editing portraits conditioned on race, gender, and age using a diagnostic prompt set, and evaluate multiple editors with vision-language model (VLM) scoring and human evaluation. Our analysis shows that identity preservation failures are pervasive, demographically uneven, and shaped by implicit social priors, including occupation-driven gender inference. Finally, we demonstrate that a prompt-level identity constraint, without model updates, can substantially reduce demographic change for minority groups while leaving majority-group portraits largely unchanged, revealing asymmetric identity priors in current editors. Together, our findings establish identity preservation as a central and demographically uneven failure mode in I2I editing and motivate demographic-robust editing systems.

*Patrick Poggi,Divake Kumar,Theja Tulabandhula,Amit Ranjan Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UncL-STARK introduces dynamic, uncertainty-aware depth adaptation for transformer-based trackers, reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer-based trackers use fixed-depth inference, leading to unnecessary computational costs in temporally coherent video sequences.

Method: UncL-STARK enables dynamic depth adaptation by fine-tuning the model for intermediate depths using random-depth training and knowledge distillation. It uses lightweight uncertainty estimates from corner localization heatmaps to adjust encoder and decoder depth at runtime.

Result: Achieves up to 12% GFLOPs reduction, 8.9% latency reduction, and 10.8% energy savings while keeping tracking accuracy within 0.2% of the full-depth baseline.

Conclusion: The approach successfully reduces computational overhead without sacrificing accuracy, making it efficient for long-term video sequences.

Abstract: Transformer-based single-object trackers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy but rely on fixed-depth inference, executing the full encoder--decoder stack for every frame regardless of visual complexity, thereby incurring unnecessary computational cost in long video sequences dominated by temporally coherent frames. We propose UncL-STARK, an architecture-preserving approach that enables dynamic, uncertainty-aware depth adaptation in transformer-based trackers without modifying the underlying network or adding auxiliary heads. The model is fine-tuned to retain predictive robustness at multiple intermediate depths using random-depth training with knowledge distillation, thus enabling safe inference-time truncation. At runtime, we derive a lightweight uncertainty estimate directly from the model's corner localization heatmaps and use it in a feedback-driven policy that selects the encoder and decoder depth for the next frame based on the prediction confidence by exploiting temporal coherence in video. Extensive experiments on GOT-10k and LaSOT demonstrate up to 12\% GFLOPs reduction, 8.9\% latency reduction, and 10.8\% energy savings while maintaining tracking accuracy within 0.2\% of the full-depth baseline across both short-term and long-term sequences.

Motivation: Large-scale video datasets are costly and inefficient to transform into task-specific formats.

Result: An interactive web platform for efficient video subset construction and searchable systems over private collections.

Conclusion: DataCube provides a scalable solution for video dataset creation and management.

*Hiroki Nakamura,Hiroto Iino,Masashi Okada,Tadahiro Taniguchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EasyControlEdge adapts an image-generation foundation model for crisp, data-efficient edge detection using edge-oriented objectives and inference guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with producing crisp edge maps efficiently due to limited training samples and underexploited pretrained priors in foundation models.

Method: Introduces an edge-specialized adaptation with an edge-oriented objective and pixel-space loss. Uses guidance scales at inference for edge density control.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on BSDS500, NYUDv2, BIPED, and CubiCasa, especially in crispness and limited-data scenarios.

Conclusion: EasyControlEdge effectively leverages foundation models for superior edge detection without extensive post-processing or data.

Abstract: We propose EasyControlEdge, adapting an image-generation foundation model to edge detection. In real-world edge detection (e.g., floor-plan walls, satellite roads/buildings, and medical organ boundaries), crispness and data efficiency are crucial, yet producing crisp raw edge maps with limited training samples remains challenging. Although image-generation foundation models perform well on many downstream tasks, their pretrained priors for data-efficient transfer and iterative refinement for high-frequency detail preservation remain underexploited for edge detection. To enable crisp and data-efficient edge detection using these capabilities, we introduce an edge-specialized adaptation of image-generation foundation models. To better specialize the foundation model for edge detection, we incorporate an edge-oriented objective with an efficient pixel-space loss. At inference, we introduce guidance based on unconditional dynamics, enabling a single model to control the edge density through a guidance scale. Experiments on BSDS500, NYUDv2, BIPED, and CubiCasa compare against state-of-the-art methods and show consistent gains, particularly under no-post-processing crispness evaluation and with limited training data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyPCA-Net improves multimodal fusion in medical imaging by addressing computational inefficiency and information loss, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fusion methods are computationally expensive and prone to information loss, limiting their generalization in multi-disease analysis.

Method: Proposes HyPCA-Net with two novel blocks: a residual adaptive learning attention block and a dual-view cascaded attention block.

Result: HyPCA-Net achieves up to 5.2% performance improvement and 73.1% computational cost reduction on ten datasets.

Conclusion: HyPCA-Net effectively addresses limitations of current methods, enhancing multimodal fusion for medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion frameworks, which integrate diverse medical imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT), have shown great potential in applications such as skin cancer detection, dementia diagnosis, and brain tumor prediction. However, existing multimodal fusion methods face significant challenges. First, they often rely on computationally expensive models, limiting their applicability in low-resource environments. Second, they often employ cascaded attention modules, which potentially increase risk of information loss during inter-module transitions and hinder their capacity to effectively capture robust shared representations across modalities. This restricts their generalization in multi-disease analysis tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hybrid Parallel-Fusion Cascaded Attention Network (HyPCA-Net), composed of two core novel blocks: (a) a computationally efficient residual adaptive learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific representations, and (b) a dual-view cascaded attention block aimed at learning robust shared representations across diverse modalities. Extensive experiments on ten publicly available datasets exhibit that HyPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing leading methods, with improvements of up to 5.2% in performance and reductions of up to 73.1% in computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFFMAE introduces a hierarchical pretraining framework using adaptive token merging to reduce computational demands while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of high-resolution training requiring server-scale infrastructure and structural limitations of combining MAE with hierarchical architectures.

Method: AFFMAE employs adaptive, off-grid token merging, discards masked tokens, and uses deep supervision to mitigate representation collapse.

Result: Matches ViT-MAE performance with fewer FLOPs (up to 7x reduction), halves memory usage, and enables faster training on a single RTX 5090.

Conclusion: AFFMAE offers a scalable and efficient alternative for hierarchical pretraining in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Self-supervised pretraining has transformed computer vision by enabling data-efficient fine-tuning, yet high-resolution training typically requires server-scale infrastructure, limiting in-domain foundation model development for many research laboratories. Masked Autoencoders (MAE) reduce computation by encoding only visible tokens, but combining MAE with hierarchical downsampling architectures remains structurally challenging due to dense grid priors and mask-aware design compromises. We introduce AFFMAE, a masking-friendly hierarchical pretraining framework built on adaptive, off-grid token merging. By discarding masked tokens and performing dynamic merging exclusively over visible tokens, AFFMAE removes dense-grid assumptions while preserving hierarchical scalability. We developed numerically stable mixed-precision Flash-style cluster attention kernels, and mitigate sparse-stage representation collapse via deep supervision. On high-resolution electron microscopy segmentation, AFFMAE matches ViT-MAE performance at equal parameter count while reducing FLOPs by up to 7x, halving memory usage, and achieving faster training on a single RTX 5090.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mechanical frame tracers are time-consuming and require calibration, leading to inefficiencies in optical workflows. A faster, more accurate solution is needed.

Method: The proposed method uses multi-view images from an InVision system, involving frame segmentation, depth estimation, and integration of RGB and depth data for precise contour measurement.

Result: The algorithm achieves competitive accuracy from still color images, eliminating the need for specialized equipment and simplifying workflows.

Conclusion: The vision-based approach offers an efficient, accurate alternative to traditional mechanical methods, streamlining the eyeframe tracing process.

Abstract: Eyeframe lens tracing is an important process in the optical industry that requires sub-millimeter precision to ensure proper lens fitting and optimal vision correction. Traditional frame tracers rely on mechanical tools that need precise positioning and calibration, which are time-consuming and require additional equipment, creating an inefficient workflow for opticians. This work presents a novel approach based on artificial vision that utilizes multi-view information. The proposed algorithm operates on images captured from an InVision system. The full pipeline includes image acquisition, frame segmentation to isolate the eyeframe from background, depth estimation to obtain 3D spatial information, and multi-view processing that integrates segmented RGB images with depth data for precise frame contour measurement. To this end, different configurations and variants are proposed and analyzed on real data, providing competitive measurements from still color images with respect to other solutions, while eliminating the need for specialized tracing equipment and reducing workflow complexity for optical technicians.

TL;DR: Self-supervised learning improves feature extraction, reducing reliance on labeled data for object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeled data scarcity and high costs in training complex AI models, especially for object detection, drive the need for better feature extractors that require less labeled data.

Method: A self-supervised learning strategy is used to train a model on unlabeled data, enhancing feature extraction for object detection tasks.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art feature extractors pre-trained on ImageNet and improves focus on relevant object aspects, boosting reliability and robustness.

Conclusion: Enhancing feature extractors through self-supervised learning can significantly reduce the need for labeled data while improving model performance in object detection.

Abstract: In the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence, where models are increasingly growing in complexity and size, the availability of labeled data for training deep learning models has become a significant challenge. Addressing complex problems like object detection demands considerable time and resources for data labeling to achieve meaningful results. For companies developing such applications, this entails extensive investment in highly skilled personnel or costly outsourcing. This research work aims to demonstrate that enhancing feature extractors can substantially alleviate this challenge, enabling models to learn more effective representations with less labeled data. Utilizing a self-supervised learning strategy, we present a model trained on unlabeled data that outperforms state-of-the-art feature extractors pre-trained on ImageNet and particularly designed for object detection tasks. Moreover, the results demonstrate that our approach encourages the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of an object, thus achieving better feature representations and, therefore, reinforcing its reliability and robustness.

TL;DR: SCAR is a method for auto-calibrating aerial visual-inertial systems using satellite imagery, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for aerial calibration rely on manual interventions or dedicated maneuvers, which are impractical for long-term deployments.

Method: SCAR aligns aerial images with 2D-3D correspondences from orthophotos and elevation models to estimate intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.

Result: SCAR reduces median reprojection errors significantly and improves visual localization accuracy across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: SCAR offers accurate, robust, and reproducible calibration without manual intervention, suitable for long-term aerial operations.

Abstract: We introduce SCAR, a method for long-term auto-calibration refinement of aerial visual-inertial systems that exploits georeferenced satellite imagery as a persistent global reference. SCAR estimates both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters by aligning aerial images with 2D--3D correspondences derived from publicly available orthophotos and elevation models. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on dedicated calibration maneuvers or manually surveyed ground control points, our method leverages external geospatial data to detect and correct calibration degradation under field deployment conditions. We evaluate our approach on six large-scale aerial campaigns conducted over two years under diverse seasonal and environmental conditions. Across all sequences, SCAR consistently outperforms established baselines (Kalibr, COLMAP, VINS-Mono), reducing median reprojection error by a large margin, and translating these calibration gains into substantially lower visual localization rotation errors and higher pose accuracy. These results demonstrate that SCAR provides accurate, robust, and reproducible calibration over long-term aerial operations without the need for manual intervention.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMAA improves monocular SSC reliability for visually impaired users via adaptive multi-scale feature regulation, outperforming MonoScene with minimal complexity increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular SSC methods lack voxel-feature reliability and cross-scale regulation, causing projection and fusion issues.

Method: AMAA introduces parallel channel-spatial attention and hierarchical adaptive feature-gating for stable feature fusion.

Result: AMAA achieves 27.25% SSC mIoU (+0.31) and 43.10% SC IoU (+0.59) on NYUv2, with stable embedded deployment.

Conclusion: AMAA offers a reliable, deployable SSC framework for indoor assistive perception, enhancing structural stability.

Abstract: In indoor assistive perception for visually impaired users, 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is expected to provide structurally coherent and semantically consistent occupancy under strictly monocular vision for safety-critical scene understanding. However, existing monocular SSC approaches often lack explicit modeling of voxel-feature reliability and regulated cross-scale information propagation during 2D-3D projection and multi-scale fusion, making them vulnerable to projection diffusion and feature entanglement and thus limiting structural stability.To address these challenges, this paper presents an Adaptive Multi-scale Attention Aggregation (AMAA) framework built upon the MonoScene pipeline. Rather than introducing a heavier backbone, AMAA focuses on reliability-oriented feature regulation within a monocular SSC framework. Specifically, lifted voxel features are jointly calibrated in semantic and spatial dimensions through parallel channel-spatial attention aggregation, while multi-scale encoder-decoder fusion is stabilized via a hierarchical adaptive feature-gating strategy that regulates information injection across scales.Experiments on the NYUv2 benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements over MonoScene without significantly increasing system complexity: AMAA achieves 27.25% SSC mIoU (+0.31) and 43.10% SC IoU (+0.59). In addition, system-level deployment on an NVIDIA Jetson platform verifies that the complete AMAA framework can be executed stably on embedded hardware. Overall, AMAA improves monocular SSC quality and provides a reliable and deployable perception framework for indoor assistive systems targeting visually impaired users.

TL;DR: ReMoRa is a video MLLM that processes videos using compressed representations, combining sparse RGB keyframes with denoised motion representations for efficient long-video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form video understanding is challenging for MLLMs due to computational intractability and redundancy in processing full RGB frames.

Method: ReMoRa uses compressed video representations—sparse RGB keyframes for appearance and motion representations for temporal dynamics, with a denoising module for refinement.

Result: ReMoRa outperforms baselines on benchmarks like LongVideoBench, NExT-QA, and MLVU.

Conclusion: ReMoRa effectively addresses computational challenges in long-video understanding by leveraging compressed representations.

Abstract: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, long-form video understanding remains a significant challenge. In this study, we focus on video understanding by MLLMs. This task is challenging because processing a full stream of RGB frames is computationally intractable and highly redundant, as self-attention have quadratic complexity with sequence length. In this paper, we propose ReMoRa, a video MLLM that processes videos by operating directly on their compressed representations. A sparse set of RGB keyframes is retained for appearance, while temporal dynamics are encoded as a motion representation, removing the need for sequential RGB frames. These motion representations act as a compact proxy for optical flow, capturing temporal dynamics without full frame decoding. To refine the noise and low fidelity of block-based motions, we introduce a module to denoise and generate a fine-grained motion representation. Furthermore, our model compresses these features in a way that scales linearly with sequence length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReMoRa through extensive experiments across a comprehensive suite of long-video understanding benchmarks. ReMoRa outperformed baseline methods on multiple challenging benchmarks, including LongVideoBench, NExT-QA, and MLVU.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address linguistic diversity, document heterogeneity, and deployment constraints in OCR systems for India.

Method: Compare multimodal training and fine-tuning strategies using Vision-Language Models.

Result: Fine-tuning outperforms multimodal approach in accuracy-latency trade-offs. Chitrapathak-2 achieves 3-6x speedup and SOTA in Telugu.

Conclusion: Practical guidance for building production-scale OCR pipelines in India, showcasing SOTA performance.

Abstract: Designing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems for India requires balancing linguistic diversity, document heterogeneity, and deployment constraints. In this paper, we study two training strategies for building multilingual OCR systems with Vision-Language Models through the Chitrapathak series. We first follow a popular multimodal approach, pairing a generic vision encoder with a strong multilingual language model and training the system end-to-end for OCR. Alternatively, we explore fine-tuning an existing OCR model, despite not being trained for the target languages. Through extensive evaluation on multilingual Indic OCR benchmarks and deployment-oriented metrics, we find that the second strategy consistently achieves better accuracy-latency trade-offs. Chitrapathak-2 achieves 3-6x speedup over its predecessor with being state-of-the-art (SOTA) in Telugu (6.69 char ANLS) and second best in the rest. In addition, we present Parichay, an independent OCR model series designed specifically for 9 Indian government documents to extract structured key fields, achieving 89.8% Exact Match score with a faster inference. Together, these systems achieve SOTA performance and provide practical guidance for building production-scale OCR pipelines in the Indian context.

Method: Proposes VSR, where models generate pixel-level localizations, visualize them, and self-correct. ChartVSR implements VSR in two stages: Refine (iterative visual feedback) and Decode (parsing with verified anchors).

Result: ChartVSR demonstrates improved accuracy in chart parsing. ChartP-Bench provides a challenging evaluation framework.

Conclusion: VSR is a promising general-purpose visual feedback mechanism for vision-centric tasks, enhancing accuracy through self-correction.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for reasoning and self-correction at the textual level, these strengths provide minimal benefits for complex tasks centered on visual perception, such as Chart Parsing. Existing models often struggle with visually dense charts, leading to errors like data omission, misalignment, and hallucination. Inspired by the human strategy of using a finger as a ``visual anchor'' to ensure accuracy when reading complex charts, we propose a new paradigm named Visual Self-Refine (VSR). The core idea of VSR is to enable a model to generate pixel-level localization outputs, visualize them, and then feed these visualizations back to itself, allowing it to intuitively inspect and correct its own potential visual perception errors. We instantiate the VSR paradigm in the domain of Chart Parsing by proposing ChartVSR. This model decomposes the parsing process into two stages: a Refine Stage, where it iteratively uses visual feedback to ensure the accuracy of all data points' Pixel-level Localizations, and a Decode Stage, where it uses these verified localizations as precise visual anchors to parse the final structured data. To address the limitations of existing benchmarks, we also construct ChartP-Bench, a new and highly challenging benchmark for chart parsing. Our work also highlights VSR as a general-purpose visual feedback mechanism, offering a promising new direction for enhancing accuracy on a wide range of vision-centric tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMA introduces dynamic reliability scoring for memory items in multimodal agents, improving accuracy and reducing errors, while uncovering latent biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the issue of stale, low-credibility, or conflicting memory items in multimodal agents, which can lead to overconfident errors.

Method: Assigns dynamic reliability scores based on source credibility, temporal decay, and conflict-aware network consensus, reweighting evidence and abstaining when support is insufficient. Introduces MMA-Bench for benchmarking.

Result: MMA improves accuracy, reduces variance, and enhances selective utility on benchmarks like FEVER and LoCoMo, while uncovering latent visual biases.

Conclusion: MMA effectively mitigates errors in multimodal agents by dynamically assessing memory reliability, with significant improvements demonstrated across benchmarks.

Abstract: Long-horizon multimodal agents depend on external memory; however, similarity-based retrieval often surfaces stale, low-credibility, or conflicting items, which can trigger overconfident errors. We propose Multimodal Memory Agent (MMA), which assigns each retrieved memory item a dynamic reliability score by combining source credibility, temporal decay, and conflict-aware network consensus, and uses this signal to reweight evidence and abstain when support is insufficient. We also introduce MMA-Bench, a programmatically generated benchmark for belief dynamics with controlled speaker reliability and structured text-vision contradictions. Using this framework, we uncover the "Visual Placebo Effect", revealing how RAG-based agents inherit latent visual biases from foundation models. On FEVER, MMA matches baseline accuracy while reducing variance by 35.2% and improving selective utility; on LoCoMo, a safety-oriented configuration improves actionable accuracy and reduces wrong answers; on MMA-Bench, MMA reaches 41.18% Type-B accuracy in Vision mode, while the baseline collapses to 0.0% under the same protocol.

### [33] [Benchmarking Adversarial Robustness and Adversarial Training Strategies for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16494)
*Alexis Winter,Jean-Vincent Martini,Romaric Audigier,Angelique Loesch,Bertrand Luvison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified benchmark framework for fair comparison of adversarial attacks on object detection models, explores attack transferability across architectures, and identifies the most effective adversarial training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The sensitivity of object detection models to adversarial attacks and the lack of standardized evaluation hinder progress in defending them. This paper aims to address these gaps.

Method: The authors introduce a benchmark framework with specific metrics to evaluate attacks, focusing on digital, non-patch-based attacks. They test attack transferability across architectures and evaluate adversarial training strategies.

Result: Modern attacks show low transferability to transformer-based architectures. The most robust adversarial training uses mixed high-perturbation attacks with diverse objectives.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark enables fair comparison of attacks, highlights the limitations of attack transferability, and identifies effective adversarial training strategies.

Abstract: Object detection models are critical components of automated systems, such as autonomous vehicles and perception-based robots, but their sensitivity to adversarial attacks poses a serious security risk. Progress in defending these models lags behind classification, hindered by a lack of standardized evaluation. It is nearly impossible to thoroughly compare attack or defense methods, as existing work uses different datasets, inconsistent efficiency metrics, and varied measures of perturbation cost. This paper addresses this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) How can we create a fair benchmark to impartially compare attacks? (2) How well do modern attacks transfer across different architectures, especially from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers? (3) What is the most effective adversarial training strategy for robust defense? To answer these, we first propose a unified benchmark framework focused on digital, non-patch-based attacks. This framework introduces specific metrics to disentangle localization and classification errors and evaluates attack cost using multiple perceptual metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art attacks and a wide range of detectors. Our findings reveal two major conclusions: first, modern adversarial attacks against object detection models show a significant lack of transferability to transformer-based architectures. Second, we demonstrate that the most robust adversarial training strategy leverages a dataset composed of a mix of high-perturbation attacks with different objectives (e.g., spatial and semantic), which outperforms training on any single attack.

*Zeng Tao,Ying Jiang,Yunuo Chen,Tianyi Xie,Huamin Wang,Yingnian Wu,Yin Yang,Abishek Sampath Kumar,Kenji Tashiro,Chenfanfu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DressWild, a feed-forward pipeline for generating editable, separable, and simulation-ready 2D sewing patterns and 3D garments from a single in-the-wild image, overcoming limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for garment pattern generation face challenges with diverse poses and computational expense. This work aims to provide a scalable and efficient solution for realistic garment simulation and animation.

Method: DressWild uses vision-language models (VLMs) to normalize pose variations and extract pose-aware, 3D-informed garment features. These features are fused via a transformer-based encoder to predict sewing pattern parameters for direct application in simulation and virtual try-on.

Result: Extensive experiments show DressWild successfully recovers diverse sewing patterns and 3D garments from single images, avoiding the need for multi-view inputs or iterative optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers an efficient, scalable solution for garment modeling, enabling realistic simulation and animation without the computational overhead of traditional approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in garment pattern generation have shown promising progress. However, existing feed-forward methods struggle with diverse poses and viewpoints, while optimization-based approaches are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. This paper focuses on sewing pattern generation for garment modeling and fabrication applications that demand editable, separable, and simulation-ready garments. We propose DressWild, a novel feed-forward pipeline that reconstructs physics-consistent 2D sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from a single in-the-wild image. Given an input image, our method leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to normalize pose variations at the image level, then extract pose-aware, 3D-informed garment features. These features are fused through a transformer-based encoder and subsequently used to predict sewing pattern parameters, which can be directly applied to physical simulation, texture synthesis, and multi-layer virtual try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach robustly recovers diverse sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from in-the-wild images without requiring multi-view inputs or iterative optimization, offering an efficient and scalable solution for realistic garment simulation and animation.

*Kaiting Liu,Hazel Doughty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'category splitting,' a task to refine coarse video classifier labels into finer subcategories without retraining, using zero-shot and low-shot methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video recognition models use rigid taxonomies, which lack granularity and adaptability to evolving definitions or tasks, making retraining expensive.

Method: The proposed method leverages latent compositional structure for zero-shot editing and uses low-shot fine-tuning for improved performance.

Result: The method outperforms vision-language baselines, enhancing accuracy on split categories without compromising overall performance.

Conclusion: Category splitting offers a cost-effective way to adapt classifiers to finer distinctions, combining zero-shot and low-shot approaches.

Abstract: Video recognition models are typically trained on fixed taxonomies which are often too coarse, collapsing distinctions in object, manner or outcome under a single label. As tasks and definitions evolve, such models cannot accommodate emerging distinctions and collecting new annotations and retraining to accommodate such changes is costly. To address these challenges, we introduce category splitting, a new task where an existing classifier is edited to refine a coarse category into finer subcategories, while preserving accuracy elsewhere. We propose a zero-shot editing method that leverages the latent compositional structure of video classifiers to expose fine-grained distinctions without additional data. We further show that low-shot fine-tuning, while simple, is highly effective and benefits from our zero-shot initialization. Experiments on our new video benchmarks for category splitting demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms vision-language baselines, improving accuracy on the newly split categories without sacrificing performance on the rest.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel face morphing technique using Arc2Face achieves comparable attack potential to landmark-based methods, confirming its effectiveness in identity preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the vulnerability in face recognition systems caused by unsupervised passport enrollment procedures.

Method: Utilizes Arc2Face, an identity-conditioned face foundation model, to synthesize photorealistic facial images from compact identity representations.

Result: Achieves morphing attack potential comparable to traditional landmark-based techniques on large-scale datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively preserves identity information, demonstrating its potential as a challenging threat to face recognition systems.

Abstract: Face morphing attacks are widely recognized as one of the most challenging threats to face recognition systems used in electronic identity documents. These attacks exploit a critical vulnerability in passport enrollment procedures adopted by many countries, where the facial image is often acquired without a supervised live capture process. In this paper, we propose a novel face morphing technique based on Arc2Face, an identity-conditioned face foundation model capable of synthesizing photorealistic facial images from compact identity representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing the morphing attack potential metric on two large-scale sequestered face morphing attack detection datasets against several state-of-the-art morphing methods, as well as on two novel morphed face datasets derived from FEI and ONOT. Experimental results show that the proposed deep learning-based approach achieves a morphing attack potential comparable to that of landmark-based techniques, which have traditionally been regarded as the most challenging. These findings confirm the ability of the proposed method to effectively preserve and manage identity information during the morph generation process.

TL;DR: CLIP-MHAdapter enhances CLIP for street-view attribute classification by adding a lightweight MLP with multi-head self-attention, achieving state-of-the-art results efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Street-view image classification is computationally intensive, and existing methods using CLIP embeddings lack fine-grained attribute capture.

Method: Proposes CLIP-MHAdapter, a lightweight adaptation of CLIP with a bottleneck MLP and multi-head self-attention on patch tokens.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy on eight attribute tasks with 1.4M parameters and low computational cost.

Conclusion: CLIP-MHAdapter is effective for fine-grained street-view classification while remaining efficient.

Abstract: Street-view image attribute classification is a vital downstream task of image classification, enabling applications such as autonomous driving, urban analytics, and high-definition map construction. It remains computationally demanding whether training from scratch, initialising from pre-trained weights, or fine-tuning large models. Although pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP offer rich image representations, existing adaptation or fine-tuning methods often rely on their global image embeddings, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained, localised attributes essential in complex, cluttered street scenes. To address this, we propose CLIP-MHAdapter, a variant of the current lightweight CLIP adaptation paradigm that appends a bottleneck MLP equipped with multi-head self-attention operating on patch tokens to model inter-patch dependencies. With approximately 1.4 million trainable parameters, CLIP-MHAdapter achieves superior or competitive accuracy across eight attribute classification tasks on the Global StreetScapes dataset, attaining new state-of-the-art results while maintaining low computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSB integrates semantic priors into diffusion bridge models for unpaired image-to-image translation, improving fidelity and generalization without cross-domain supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial and diffusion-inversion methods have limitations in generalization and translation fidelity, prompting the need for a more robust framework.

Method: SSB leverages self-supervised visual encoders to create a shared latent space conditioned by semantic priors, enabling spatially faithful translation.

Result: SSB outperforms prior methods in medical image synthesis and extends to high-quality text-guided editing.

Conclusion: SSB advances unpaired image-to-image translation by combining semantic priors with diffusion bridges, offering superior performance and versatility.

Abstract: Adversarial diffusion and diffusion-inversion methods have advanced unpaired image-to-image translation, but each faces key limitations. Adversarial approaches require target-domain adversarial loss during training, which can limit generalization to unseen data, while diffusion-inversion methods often produce low-fidelity translations due to imperfect inversion into noise-latent representations. In this work, we propose the Self-Supervised Semantic Bridge (SSB), a versatile framework that integrates external semantic priors into diffusion bridge models to enable spatially faithful translation without cross-domain supervision. Our key idea is to leverage self-supervised visual encoders to learn representations that are invariant to appearance changes but capture geometric structure, forming a shared latent space that conditions the diffusion bridges. Extensive experiments show that SSB outperforms strong prior methods for challenging medical image synthesis in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, and extends easily to high-quality text-guided editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for consistent online HD vectorized map construction tackles temporal issues in autonomous driving by integrating semantic-aware queries, historical memory, and short-term predictions, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing query-based methods for HD maps suffer from temporal inconsistencies and instabilities due to random query initialization and implicit temporal modeling.

Method: Proposes an end-to-end framework with Semantic-Aware Query Generator, History Rasterized Map Memory, History-Map Guidance Module, and Short-Term Future Guidance for tracking and predicting map instances.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets compared to SOTA methods, ensuring temporal consistency and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses temporal challenges in HD map construction, enhancing stability and consistency for autonomous driving.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are crucial to autonomous driving, providing structured representations of road elements to support navigation and planning. However, existing query-based methods often employ random query initialization and depend on implicit temporal modeling, which lead to temporal inconsistencies and instabilities during the construction of a global map. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework for consistent online HD vectorized map construction, which jointly performs map instance tracking and short-term prediction. First, we propose a Semantic-Aware Query Generator that initializes queries with spatially aligned semantic masks to capture scene-level context globally. Next, we design a History Rasterized Map Memory to store fine-grained instance-level maps for each tracked instance, enabling explicit historical priors. A History-Map Guidance Module then integrates rasterized map information into track queries, improving temporal continuity. Finally, we propose a Short-Term Future Guidance module to forecast the immediate motion of map instances based on the stored history trajectories. These predicted future locations serve as hints for tracked instances to further avoid implausible predictions and keep temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with good efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VETime unifies temporal and visual modalities for TSAD, addressing trade-offs in existing models through fine-grained alignment and dynamic fusion, achieving superior performance with lower computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) face a trade-off between fine-grained pointwise localization and global contextual perspective, necessitating a unified approach.

Method: VETime introduces Reversible Image Conversion, Patch-Level Temporal Alignment, Anomaly Window Contrastive Learning, and Task-Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion to align and fuse temporal and visual modalities.

Result: VETime outperforms state-of-the-art models in zero-shot scenarios, offering better localization precision with reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: VETime successfully bridges the gap between temporal and visual modalities in TSAD, providing a robust and efficient solution.

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) requires identifying both immediate Point Anomalies and long-range Context Anomalies. However, existing foundation models face a fundamental trade-off: 1D temporal models provide fine-grained pointwise localization but lack a global contextual perspective, while 2D vision-based models capture global patterns but suffer from information bottlenecks due to a lack of temporal alignment and coarse-grained pointwise detection. To resolve this dilemma, we propose VETime, the first TSAD framework that unifies temporal and visual modalities through fine-grained visual-temporal alignment and dynamic fusion. VETime introduces a Reversible Image Conversion and a Patch-Level Temporal Alignment module to establish a shared visual-temporal timeline, preserving discriminative details while maintaining temporal sensitivity. Furthermore, we design an Anomaly Window Contrastive Learning mechanism and a Task-Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion to adaptively integrate the complementary perceptual strengths of both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VETime significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in zero-shot scenarios, achieving superior localization precision with lower computational overhead than current vision-based approaches.

TL;DR: SAW-Bench introduces a benchmark for egocentric situated awareness using real-world videos, highlighting limitations in current multimodal foundation models (MFMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks focusing on observer-centric relationships (agent's viewpoint, pose, and motion) in MFMs.

Method: Developed SAW-Bench with 786 self-recorded videos and 2,071 annotated QA pairs to evaluate six tasks probing observer-centric understanding.

Result: Reveals a 37.66% human-model performance gap, showing models struggle with coherent camera geometry despite partial geometric cues.

Conclusion: SAW-Bench serves as a benchmark for situated spatial intelligence, emphasizing physically grounded, observer-centric dynamics.

Abstract: A core aspect of human perception is situated awareness, the ability to relate ourselves to the surrounding physical environment and reason over possible actions in context. However, most existing benchmarks for multimodal foundation models (MFMs) emphasize environment-centric spatial relations (relations among objects in a scene), while largely overlooking observer-centric relationships that require reasoning relative to agent's viewpoint, pose, and motion. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAW-Bench (Situated Awareness in the Real World), a novel benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness using real-world videos. SAW-Bench comprises 786 self-recorded videos captured with Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses spanning diverse indoor and outdoor environments, and over 2,071 human-annotated question-answer pairs. It probes a model's observer-centric understanding with six different awareness tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 37.66%, even with the best-performing MFM, Gemini 3 Flash. Beyond this gap, our in-depth analysis uncovers several notable findings; for example, while models can exploit partial geometric cues in egocentric videos, they often fail to infer a coherent camera geometry, leading to systematic spatial reasoning errors. We position SAW-Bench as a benchmark for situated spatial intelligence, moving beyond passive observation to understanding physically grounded, observer-centric dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Object-centric (OC) representations excel in challenging compositional generalization tasks compared to dense encoders, especially when constrained by dataset size, diversity, or compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how object-centric representations support compositional generalization in visually rich settings compared to dense representations.

Method: A Visual Question Answering benchmark across three visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, MOVi-C) testing DINOv2 and SigLIP2 encoders with/without OC biases, controlling factors like data diversity and compute.

Result: OC models outperform dense encoders in harder tasks, are more sample-efficient, and perform better under constraints like limited data or compute.

Conclusion: OC representations are advantageous for compositional generalization when facing constraints, while dense encoders require more resources to match performance.

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to reason about novel combinations of familiar concepts, is fundamental to human cognition and a critical challenge for machine learning. Object-centric (OC) representations, which encode a scene as a set of objects, are often argued to support such generalization, but systematic evidence in visually rich settings is limited. We introduce a Visual Question Answering benchmark across three controlled visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, and MOVi-C) to measure how well vision encoders, with and without object-centric biases, generalize to unseen combinations of object properties. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we carefully account for training data diversity, sample size, representation size, downstream model capacity, and compute. We use DINOv2 and SigLIP2, two widely used vision encoders, as the foundation models and their OC counterparts. Our key findings reveal that (1) OC approaches are superior in harder compositional generalization settings; (2) original dense representations surpass OC only on easier settings and typically require substantially more downstream compute; and (3) OC models are more sample efficient, achieving stronger generalization with fewer images, whereas dense encoders catch up or surpass them only with sufficient data and diversity. Overall, object-centric representations offer stronger compositional generalization when any one of dataset size, training data diversity, or downstream compute is constrained.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Saliency-Aware Principle (SAP) to improve vision-language models (VLMs) by enabling stable control over reasoning and re-consulting visual evidence, reducing object hallucination and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with text-dominated reasoning and noisy visual grounding during inference, leading to error accumulation and instability.

Method: Proposes SAP, which operates on high-level principles, allows re-consulting visuals, and supports multi-route inference without additional training.

Result: SAP reduces object hallucination, improves reasoning stability, and lowers response latency compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: SAP effectively addresses VLM challenges by balancing visual and textual reasoning without requiring extra training or data.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) aim to reason by jointly leveraging visual and textual modalities. While allocating additional inference-time computation has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), achieving similar scaling in VLMs remains challenging. A key obstacle is that visual inputs are typically provided only once at the start of generation, while textual reasoning (e.g., early visual summaries) is generated autoregressively, causing reasoning to become increasingly text-dominated and allowing early visual grounding errors to accumulate. Moreover, vanilla guidance for visual grounding during inference is often coarse and noisy, making it difficult to steer reasoning over long texts. To address these challenges, we propose \emph{Saliency-Aware Principle} (SAP) selection. SAP operates on high-level reasoning principles rather than token-level trajectories, which enable stable control over discrete generation under noisy feedback while allowing later reasoning steps to re-consult visual evidence when renewed grounding is required. In addition, SAP supports multi-route inference, enabling parallel exploration of diverse reasoning behaviors. SAP is model-agnostic and data-free, requiring no additional training. Empirical results show that SAP achieves competitive performance, especially in reducing object hallucination, under comparable token-generation budgets while yielding more stable reasoning and lower response latency than CoT-style long sequential reasoning.

TL;DR: TeCoNeRV improves video compression using INRs with spatial-temporal decomposition, residual storage, and temporal coherence, achieving higher PSNR, lower bitrates, and faster speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Hypernetwork-based INR approaches for video compression face challenges in quality, compressed size, and memory usage at higher resolutions.

Method: The paper introduces (1) spatial-temporal decomposition of weight prediction via patch tubelets, (2) residual storage for smaller bitstreams, and (3) temporal coherence regularization.

Result: TeCoNeRV achieves 2.47dB and 5.35dB PSNR improvements at 480p and 720p with 36% lower bitrates and 1.5-3× faster encoding, while enabling high-resolution results.

Conclusion: TeCoNeRV addresses key limitations in INR-based video compression, offering scalable, efficient, and high-quality solutions for various resolutions.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently demonstrated impressive performance for video compression. However, since a separate INR must be overfit for each video, scaling to high-resolution videos while maintaining encoding efficiency remains a significant challenge. Hypernetwork-based approaches predict INR weights (hyponetworks) for unseen videos at high speeds, but with low quality, large compressed size, and prohibitive memory needs at higher resolutions. We address these fundamental limitations through three key contributions: (1) an approach that decomposes the weight prediction task spatially and temporally, by breaking short video segments into patch tubelets, to reduce the pretraining memory overhead by 20$\times$; (2) a residual-based storage scheme that captures only differences between consecutive segment representations, significantly reducing bitstream size; and (3) a temporal coherence regularization framework that encourages changes in the weight space to be correlated with video content. Our proposed method, TeCoNeRV, achieves substantial improvements of 2.47dB and 5.35dB PSNR over the baseline at 480p and 720p on UVG, with 36% lower bitrates and 1.5-3$\times$ faster encoding speeds. With our low memory usage, we are the first hypernetwork approach to demonstrate results at 480p, 720p and 1080p on UVG, HEVC and MCL-JCV.

*Inwon Kang,Parikshit Ram,Yi Zhou,Horst Samulowitz,Oshani Seneviratne*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs for classifying web tables without specialized models, introducing TaRL, a lightweight method with semantic embeddings and temperature calibration to match state-of-the-art performance in low-data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Web's diverse structured data in tables is hard to unify, and leveraging existing LLMs for classification could avoid specialized models or retraining.

Method: TaRL uses semantic embeddings of table rows, removes common components, and calibrates softmax temperature via a meta-learner for few-shot classification.

Result: TaRL matches state-of-the-art models in low-data regimes (k ≤ 32) for semantically-rich tables.

Conclusion: Existing LLM infrastructure can be efficiently reused for web table understanding, offering a lightweight alternative to specialized models.

Abstract: The Web is a rich source of structured data in the form of tables, from product catalogs and knowledge bases to scientific datasets. However, the heterogeneity of the structure and semantics of these tables makes it challenging to build a unified method that can effectively leverage the information they contain. Meanwhile, Large language models (LLMs) are becoming an increasingly integral component of web infrastructure for tasks like semantic search. This raises a crucial question: can we leverage these already-deployed LLMs to classify structured data in web-native tables (e.g., product catalogs, knowledge base exports, scientific data portals), avoiding the need for specialized models or extensive retraining? This work investigates a lightweight paradigm, $\textbf{Ta}$ble $\textbf{R}$epresentation with $\textbf{L}$anguage Model~($\textbf{TaRL}$), for few-shot tabular classification that directly utilizes semantic embeddings of individual table rows. We first show that naive application of these embeddings underperforms compared to specialized tabular models. We then demonstrate that their potentials can be unlocked with two key techniques: removing the common component from all embeddings and calibrating the softmax temperature. We show that a simple meta-learner, trained on handcrafted features, can learn to predict an appropriate temperature. This approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models in low-data regimes ($k \leq 32$) of semantically-rich tables. Our findings demonstrate the viability of reusing existing LLM infrastructure for efficient semantics-driven pathway to reuse existing LLM infrastructure for Web table understanding.

Result: Key findings include common trends, research gaps, lacks unified evaluation practices, risks like hallucination and bias amplification, and the influence of LLMs on KD4MT.

Conclusion: The survey underscores KD's dual role in MT, identifies challenges, and calls for standardized evaluation practices. It provides resources for future research and practical guidance.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) as a research area has gained a lot of traction in recent years as a compression tool to address challenges related to ever-larger models in NLP. Remarkably, Machine Translation (MT) offers a much more nuanced take on this narrative: in MT, KD also functions as a general-purpose knowledge transfer mechanism that shapes supervision and translation quality as well as efficiency.
  This survey synthesizes KD for MT (KD4MT) across 105 papers (through October 1, 2025). We begin by introducing both MT and KD for non-experts, followed by an overview of the standard KD approaches relevant to MT applications. Subsequently, we categorize advances in the KD4MT literature based on (i) their methodological contributions and (ii) their practical applications. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses identify common trends in the field and highlight key research gaps as well as the absence of unified evaluation practice for KD methods in MT. We further provide practical guidelines for selecting a KD method in concrete settings and highlight potential risks associated with the application of KD to MT such as increased hallucination and bias amplification. Finally, we discuss the role of LLMs in re-shaping the KD4MT field. To support further research, we complement our survey with a publicly available database summarizing the main characteristics of the surveyed KD methods and a glossary of key terms.

### [47] [Gated Tree Cross-attention for Checkpoint-Compatible Syntax Injection in Decoder-Only LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15846)
*Xinyu Gao,Shaonan Wang,Nai Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GTCA, a gated tree cross-attention branch, to enhance syntactic robustness in decoder-only LLMs without disrupting pretrained performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoder-only LLMs struggle with minor grammatical changes, affecting reliability for reasoning tasks. Explicit syntactic injection can harm pretrained abilities.

Method: GTCA integrates precomputed constituency chunks via a token update mask and staged training, preserving the original backbone architecture.

Result: GTCA improves syntactic robustness across benchmarks without degrading QA or commonsense reasoning performance.

Conclusion: GTCA offers a practical, checkpoint-compatible solution to boost syntax robustness in decoder-only LLMs.

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models achieve strong broad performance but are brittle to minor grammatical perturbations, undermining reliability for downstream reasoning. However, directly injecting explicit syntactic structure into an existing checkpoint can interfere with its pretrained competence. We introduce a checkpoint-compatible gated tree cross-attention (GTCA) branch that reads precomputed constituency chunk memory while leaving backbone architecture unchanged. Our design uses a token update mask and staged training to control the scope and timing of structural updates. Across benchmarks and Transformer backbones, GTCA strengthens syntactic robustness beyond continued-training baselines without compromising Multiple-Choice QA performance or commonsense reasoning, providing a practical checkpoint-compatible route to more syntax-robust decoder-only LLMs.

### [48] [Do Personality Traits Interfere? Geometric Limitations of Steering in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15847)
*Pranav Bhandari,Usman Naseem,Mehwish Nasim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether personality traits in LLMs can be independently controlled by analyzing geometric relationships between steering vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that personality traits in LLMs can be independently controlled by examining their geometric dependencies.

Method: Analyzed steering vectors from LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-8B models using geometric conditioning schemes, including unconstrained directions and orthonormalisation.

Result: Found significant geometric dependence between traits; steering one trait affects others, even after removing linear overlap. Hard orthonormalisation enforces independence but reduces steering effectiveness.

Conclusion: Personality traits in LLMs occupy a coupled subspace, making fully independent control challenging.

Abstract: Personality steering in large language models (LLMs) commonly relies on injecting trait-specific steering vectors, implicitly assuming that personality traits can be controlled independently. In this work, we examine whether this assumption holds by analysing the geometric relationships between Big Five personality steering directions. We study steering vectors extracted from two model families (LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-8B) and apply a range of geometric conditioning schemes, from unconstrained directions to soft and hard orthonormalisation. Our results show that personality steering directions exhibit substantial geometric dependence: steering one trait consistently induces changes in others, even when linear overlap is explicitly removed. While hard orthonormalisation enforces geometric independence, it does not eliminate cross-trait behavioural effects and can reduce steering strength. These findings suggest that personality traits in LLMs occupy a slightly coupled subspace, limiting fully independent trait control.

*Andrius Matšenas,Anet Lello,Tõnis Lees,Hans Peep,Kim Lilii Tamm*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are validated as an alternative to questionnaires for personality assessment, showing moderate validity and equal perceived accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs as a dynamic alternative to traditional questionnaire-based personality assessments.

Method: A within-subjects experiment (N=33) compared Big Five scores from LLM conversations with IPIP-50 questionnaire results, measuring user-perceived accuracy.

Result: Moderate convergent validity was found (r=0.38-0.58), with some traits equivalent and others needing calibration. LLM profiles were rated equally accurate.

Conclusion: Conversational AI shows promise as a new approach to psychometrics, though trait-specific adjustments may be needed.

Abstract: This study validates Large Language Models (LLMs) as a dynamic alternative to questionnaire-based personality assessment. Using a within-subjects experiment (N=33), we compared Big Five personality scores derived from guided LLM conversations against the gold-standard IPIP-50 questionnaire, while also measuring user-perceived accuracy. Results indicate moderate convergent validity (r=0.38-0.58), with Conscientiousness, Openness, and Neuroticism scores statistically equivalent between methods. Agreeableness and Extraversion showed significant differences, suggesting trait-specific calibration is needed. Notably, participants rated LLM-generated profiles as equally accurate as traditional questionnaire results. These findings suggest conversational AI offers a promising new approach to traditional psychometrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IntelliReward, a reward model using multi-head transformers over token states, improves question-generation (IntelliAsk) with human-aligned standards, outperforming baselines in reasoning and writing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches generate superficial questions, often relying on a paper's first page, lacking depth and evidence-based grounding.

Method: Develop IntelliReward with frozen autoregressive LLM and trainable multi-head transformers. Use Decoupled Clip and DAPO to train IntelliAsk for better question-generation.

Result: IntelliAsk outperforms Qwen3-32B in reasoning (MuSR: 68.3 vs 64.7 Acc) and writing (WritingBench: 8.31 vs 8.07).

Conclusion: IntelliAsk demonstrates improved question quality and broader LLM capabilities, with released resources aiding automatic evaluation.

Abstract: Peer review relies on substantive, evidence-based questions, yet existing LLM-based approaches often generate surface-level queries, drawing over 50\% of their question tokens from a paper's first page. To bridge this gap, we develop IntelliReward, a novel reward model built from a frozen autoregressive LLM with trainable multi-head transformers over the final 50 token states, which outperforms API-based SFT baselines in predicting expert-level human preferences. By applying Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO) with IntelliReward, we train IntelliAsk, a question-generation model aligned with human standards of effort, evidence, and grounding. We find consistent improvements on reasoning and writing benchmarks, suggesting reviewer-question quality correlates with broader capabilities. Compared to the Qwen3-32B base model, IntelliAsk shows measurable gains across diverse benchmarks, specifically improving performance on reasoning tasks like MuSR (68.3 vs 64.7 Acc) and complex writing evaluations such as WritingBench (8.31 vs 8.07). We release our implementation, expert preference annotations, and the IntelliReward model to provide an automatic evaluation benchmark for grounding, effort, and evidence in LLM-generated review questions.

Result: EZCollegeApp successfully assists students by providing structured answers while ensuring human control, as evidenced by automated and human evaluations.

Conclusion: EZCollegeApp offers a practical solution to simplify college applications, with open-source availability to encourage broader adoption and impact.

Abstract: American college applications require students to navigate fragmented admissions policies, repetitive and conditional forms, and ambiguous questions that often demand cross-referencing multiple sources. We present EZCollegeApp, a large language model (LLM)-powered system that assists high-school students by structuring application forms, grounding suggested answers in authoritative admissions documents, and maintaining full human control over final responses. The system introduces a mapping-first paradigm that separates form understanding from answer generation, enabling consistent reasoning across heterogeneous application portals. EZCollegeApp integrates document ingestion from official admissions websites, retrieval-augmented question answering, and a human-in-the-loop chatbot interface that presents suggestions alongside application fields without automated submission. We describe the system architecture, data pipeline, internal representations, security and privacy measures, and evaluation through automated testing and human quality assessment.

### [52] [Narrative Theory-Driven LLM Methods for Automatic Story Generation and Understanding: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15851)
*David Y. Liu,Aditya Joshi,Paul Dawson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how NLP research integrates narrative theories using LLMs, proposing a taxonomy and identifying trends in datasets, tasks, and methodologies. It emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration and highlights challenges in benchmarking narrative tasks. Future directions focus on theory-based metrics, large-scale analysis, and validating narrative theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge NLP research with narrative studies, leveraging LLMs to enhance automatic story generation and understanding while fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.

Method: The method involves surveying existing research, proposing a taxonomy, and analyzing patterns in narrative datasets, tasks, theories, and NLP methodologies like prompting and fine-tuning.

Result: Results include identified trends in narrative-NLP integration, challenges in unified benchmarks, and opportunities for interdisciplinary work.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by advocating for theory-based metrics, large-scale analysis, and experimental validation to advance narrative research in NLP systematically.

Abstract: Applications of narrative theories using large language models (LLMs) deliver promising use-cases in automatic story generation and understanding tasks. Our survey examines how natural language processing (NLP) research engages with fields of narrative studies, and proposes a taxonomy for ongoing efforts that reflect established distinctions in narratology. We discover patterns in the following: narrative datasets and tasks, narrative theories and NLP pipeline and methodological trends in prompting and fine-tuning. We highlight how LLMs enable easy connections of NLP pipelines with abstract narrative concepts and opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. Challenges remain in attempts to work towards any unified definition or benchmark of narrative related tasks, making model comparison difficult. For future directions, instead of the pursuit of a single, generalised benchmark for 'narrative quality', we believe that progress benefits more from efforts that focus on the following: defining and improving theory-based metrics for individual narrative attributes to incrementally improve model performance; conducting large-scale, theory-driven literary/social/cultural analysis; and creating experiments where outputs can be used to validate or refine narrative theories. This work provides a contextual foundation for more systematic and theoretically informed narrative research in NLP by providing an overview to ongoing research efforts and the broader narrative studies landscape.

*Jeffrey T. H. Wong,Zixi Zhang,Junyi Liu,Yiren Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Team-of-Thoughts is a novel Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture that uses heterogeneous agents and an orchestrator-tool paradigm to improve task performance by leveraging complementary strengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAS rely on static, homogeneous models, limiting their ability to exploit the diverse strengths of differently trained models.

Method: Introduces two mechanisms: (1) orchestrator calibration to identify models with superior coordination, and (2) self-assessment protocols for tool agents to profile their domain expertise.

Result: Outperforms homogeneous baselines on five benchmarks, achieving 96.67% accuracy on AIME24 and 72.53% on LiveCodeBench.

Conclusion: Team-of-Thoughts demonstrates superior performance by dynamically activating the most suitable heterogeneous agents based on their proficiency profiles.

Abstract: Existing Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) typically rely on static, homogeneous model configurations, limiting their ability to exploit the distinct strengths of differently post-trained models. To address this, we introduce Team-of-Thoughts, a novel MAS architecture that leverages the complementary capabilities of heterogeneous agents via an orchestrator-tool paradigm. Our framework introduces two key mechanisms to optimize performance: (1) an orchestrator calibration scheme that identifies models with superior coordination capabilities, and (2) a self-assessment protocol where tool agents profile their own domain expertise to account for variations in post-training skills. During inference, the orchestrator dynamically activates the most suitable tool agents based on these proficiency profiles. Experiments on five reasoning and code generation benchmarks show that Team-of-Thoughts delivers consistently superior task performance. Notably, on AIME24 and LiveCodeBench, our approach achieves accuracies of 96.67% and 72.53%, respectively, substantially outperforming homogeneous role-play baselines, which score 80% and 65.93%.

*Ha Na Cho,Sairam Sutari,Alexander Lopez,Hansen Bow,Kai Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses mitigating temporal and lexical leakage in clinical NLP models for discharge planning, introducing an auditing pipeline to improve safety and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical NLP models are vulnerable to temporal and lexical leakage, which can mislead predictions and pose risks in real-world deployment. Addressing these issues is crucial for safe and reliable use.

Method: The study proposes a lightweight auditing pipeline integrating interpretability to identify and suppress leakage-prone signals before final model training, tested on next-day discharge prediction after elective spine surgery.

Result: Audited models showed more conservative and better-calibrated probability estimates, with reduced dependence on discharge-related lexical cues.

Conclusion: Deployment-ready clinical NLP systems must prioritize temporal validity, calibration, and robustness over high performance metrics.

Abstract: Clinical natural language processing (NLP) models have shown promise for supporting hospital discharge planning by leveraging narrative clinical documentation. However, note-based models are particularly vulnerable to temporal and lexical leakage, where documentation artifacts encode future clinical decisions and inflate apparent predictive performance. Such behavior poses substantial risks for real-world deployment, where overconfident or temporally invalid predictions can disrupt clinical workflows and compromise patient safety. This study focuses on system-level design choices required to build safe and deployable clinical NLP under temporal leakage constraints. We present a lightweight auditing pipeline that integrates interpretability into the model development process to identify and suppress leakage-prone signals prior to final training. Using next-day discharge prediction after elective spine surgery as a case study, we evaluate how auditing affects predictive behavior, calibration, and safety-relevant trade-offs. Results show that audited models exhibit more conservative and better-calibrated probability estimates, with reduced reliance on discharge-related lexical cues. These findings emphasize that deployment-ready clinical NLP systems should prioritize temporal validity, calibration, and behavioral robustness over optimistic performance.

*Md Asiful Islam,Mihai Surdeanu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LEG is a lightweight, explainable method for classifying unsafe prompts using multi-task learning, synthetic data, and a novel loss function, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a smaller model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The method aims to improve the explainability and efficiency of prompt classification systems, addressing confirmation biases in LLMs and reducing model complexity.

Method: LEG employs a multi-task learning architecture for joint prompt and explanation classification, uses synthetic data for explainability, and incorporates a novel loss combining cross-entropy and focal losses with uncertainty-based weighting.

Result: LEG matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prompt classification and explainability, even with a smaller model size, across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed LEG method effectively balances performance and explainability while being lightweight, and the authors plan to release models and datasets publicly.

Abstract: We propose a lightweight explainable guardrail (LEG) method for the classification of unsafe prompts. LEG uses a multi-task learning architecture to jointly learn a prompt classifier and an explanation classifier, where the latter labels prompt words that explain the safe/unsafe overall decision. LEG is trained using synthetic data for explainability, which is generated using a novel strategy that counteracts the confirmation biases of LLMs. Lastly, LEG's training process uses a novel loss that captures global explanation signals and combines cross-entropy and focal losses with uncertainty-based weighting. LEG obtains equivalent or better performance than the state-of-the-art for both prompt classification and explainability, both in-domain and out-of-domain on three datasets, despite the fact that its model size is considerably smaller than current approaches. If accepted, we will release all models and the annotated dataset publicly.

TL;DR: GOPO is a reinforcement learning framework improving task-oriented dialogue systems by decoupling strategy planning and response generation, achieving better performance on benchmarks and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training methods for task-oriented dialogue systems poorly align with long-horizon task success, prompting the need for a more effective approach.

Method: Proposes Goal-Oriented Preference Optimization (GOPO), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with Expert and Customer Service Agents for strategy planning and response generation, respectively.

Result: GOPO improves Task-focused Sequential Engagement (TSE) by 7.7% and 10.3% over baselines on the Mgshop dataset and outperforms large models like GPT-5.2.

Conclusion: GOPO establishes a new paradigm for task-oriented dialogue systems in commercial settings, with significant performance gains and plans for public release of code and datasets.

Abstract: Large language models show potential in task-oriented dialogue systems, yet existing training methods often rely on token-level likelihood or preference optimization, which poorly align with long-horizon task success. To address this, we propose Goal-Oriented Preference Optimization (GOPO), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that decouples strategy planning from response generation via an Expert Agent and a Customer Service Agent. The Expert Agent optimizes multi-turn goal preferences at the dialogue-trajectory level, while the Customer Service Agent generates responses strictly aligned with the selected strategy. We evaluate GOPO on public benchmarks and e-commerce customer service datasets, and introduce Task-focused Sequential Engagement (TSE), a sequence-level metric derived from real e-commerce interaction data. On the Mgshop dataset, GOPO improves TSE by 7.7% and 10.3% over PPO and Memento, with consistent gains in sequence-level reward and generation quality. Furthermore, a 14B model trained with GOPO achieves 2.7% and 1.5% higher TSE than Qwen-235B and GPT-5.2, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the Expert Agent's critical role in long-horizon optimization. GOPO demonstrates consistent improvements across other datasets as well. This work establishes a new paradigm for task-oriented dialogue systems in commercial scenarios, with code and datasets to be made public.

*Yunhao Liu,Zian Jia,Xinyu Gao,Kanjun Xu,Yun Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeleCom introduces a query-conditioned selector for soft compression in RAG, outperforming full-compression methods and matching non-compressed baselines while reducing computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current soft compression methods for RAG underperform due to irrelevant full-compression, which conflicts with LLM generation and dilutes task-relevant information.

Method: SeleCom uses a decoder-only selector trained with a diverse synthetic QA dataset and curriculum learning to compress documents query-conditioned.

Result: SeleCom outperforms existing soft compression methods and matches non-compression baselines, reducing computation by 33.8%~84.6%.

Conclusion: Query-conditioned selection is more effective than full-compression for RAG, improving performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively grounds Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge and is widely applied to Web-related tasks. However, its scalability is hindered by excessive context length and redundant retrievals. Recent research on soft context compression aims to address this by encoding long documents into compact embeddings, yet they often underperform non-compressed RAG due to their reliance on auto-encoder-like full-compression that forces the encoder to compress all document information regardless of relevance to the input query.
  In this work, we conduct an analysis on this paradigm and reveal two fundamental limitations: (I) Infeasibility, full-compression conflicts with the LLM's downstream generation behavior; and (II) Non-necessity: full-compression is unnecessary and dilutes task-relevant information density. Motivated by these insights, we introduce SeleCom, a selector-based soft compression framework for RAG that redefines the encoder's role as query-conditioned information selector. The selector is decoder-only and is trained with a massive, diverse and difficulty-graded synthetic QA dataset with curriculum learning.
  Extensive experiments show that SeleCom significantly outperforms existing soft compression approaches and achieves competitive or superior performance to non-compression baselines, while reducing computation and latency by 33.8%~84.6%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the CRAF framework to analyze public opinion from diverse sources, combining feature-based methods and LLMs for improved semantic alignment, fusion, and multimodal processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in analyzing public opinion from heterogeneous sources due to structural and semantic differences, as well as platform biases.

Method: Proposes the CRAF framework with a collaborative attention module, adaptive fusion, joint optimization, and multimodal extraction for video content.

Result: Achieves better topic clustering (ARI 0.76) and sentiment analysis (F1-score 0.84) with reduced labeled data needs for new platforms.

Conclusion: CRAF effectively integrates diverse methods for superior cross-platform public opinion analysis, demonstrating adaptability and performance gains.

Abstract: The analysis of public opinion from multiple heterogeneous sources presents significant challenges due to structural differences, semantic variations, and platform-specific biases. This paper introduces a novel Collaborative Reasoning and Adaptive Fusion (CRAF) framework that systematically integrates traditional feature-based methods with large language models (LLMs) through a structured multi-stage reasoning mechanism. Our approach features four key innovations: (1) a cross-platform collaborative attention module that aligns semantic representations while preserving source-specific characteristics, (2) a hierarchical adaptive fusion mechanism that dynamically weights features based on both data quality and task requirements, (3) a joint optimization strategy that simultaneously learns topic representations and sentiment distributions through shared latent spaces, and (4) a novel multimodal extraction capability that processes video content from platforms like Douyin and Kuaishou by integrating OCR, ASR, and visual sentiment analysis. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that CRAF achieves a tighter generalization bound with a reduction of O(sqrt(d log K / m)) compared to independent source modeling, where d is feature dimensionality, K is the number of sources, and m is sample size. Comprehensive experiments on three multi-platform datasets (Weibo-12, CrossPlatform-15, NewsForum-8) show that CRAF achieves an average topic clustering ARI of 0.76 (4.1% improvement over best baseline) and sentiment analysis F1-score of 0.84 (3.8% improvement). The framework exhibits strong cross-platform adaptability, reducing the labeled data requirement for new platforms by 75%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an end-to-end framework for building conversational AI assistants from call transcripts, ensuring quality, safety, and robustness, achieving high accuracy and performance in challenging domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in building reliable conversational AI due to noisy data, fragmented knowledge, and real-time information needs drive the need for a structured framework.

Method: Transcripts are graded for quality, structured knowledge is extracted using LLMs, and deployed in a RAG pipeline with modular prompt tuning for safety and consistency.

Result: The assistant handles 30% of calls autonomously, achieves near-perfect factual accuracy, and shows strong robustness against adversarial tests.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges in conversational AI, delivering high performance and reliability in difficult domains.

Abstract: Building reliable conversational AI assistants for customer-facing industries remains challenging due to noisy conversational data, fragmented knowledge, and the requirement for accurate human hand-off - particularly in domains that depend heavily on real-time information. This paper presents an end-to-end framework for constructing and evaluating a conversational AI assistant directly from historical call transcripts. Incoming transcripts are first graded using a simplified adaptation of the PIPA framework, focusing on observation alignment and appropriate response behavior, and are filtered to retain only high-quality interactions exhibiting coherent flow and effective human agent responses. Structured knowledge is then extracted from curated transcripts using large language models (LLMs) and deployed as the sole grounding source in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Assistant behavior is governed through systematic prompt tuning, progressing from monolithic prompts to lean, modular, and governed designs that ensure consistency, safety, and controllable execution. Evaluation is conducted using a transcript-grounded user simulator, enabling quantitative measurement of call coverage, factual accuracy, and human escalation behavior. Additional red teaming assesses robustness against prompt injection, out-of-scope, and out-of-context attacks. Experiments are conducted in the Real Estate and Specialist Recruitment domains, which are intentionally challenging and currently suboptimal for automation due to their reliance on real-time data. Despite these constraints, the assistant autonomously handles approximately 30 percents of calls, achieves near-perfect factual accuracy and rejection behavior, and demonstrates strong robustness under adversarial testing.

*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Maniscope is a geometric reranking method for RAG that uses geodesic distances on k-NN manifolds, offering faster performance and competitive accuracy compared to existing methods like cross-encoders and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural reranking methods for retrieval-augmented generation are computationally expensive and slow. Maniscope addresses this by leveraging geometric reranking for efficiency without significant accuracy loss.

Method: Maniscope computes geodesic distances on k-NN manifolds over retrieved documents, combining global cosine similarity with local manifold geometry to improve semantic understanding.

Result: Maniscope outperforms baselines on challenging datasets (e.g., +7.0% on NFCorpus) and is 3.2x faster than HNSW baselines. It achieves near-cross-encoder accuracy with 10-45x lower latency.

Conclusion: Maniscope is a practical, efficient alternative for real-time RAG deployment, balancing speed and accuracy, and will be released as open-source.

Abstract: Current neural reranking approaches for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) rely on cross-encoders or large language models (LLMs), requiring substantial computational resources and exhibiting latencies of 3-5 seconds per query. We propose Maniscope, a geometric reranking method that computes geodesic distances on k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) manifolds constructed over retrieved document candidates. This approach combines global cosine similarity with local manifold geometry to capture semantic structure that flat Euclidean metrics miss. Evaluating on eight BEIR benchmark datasets (1,233 queries), Maniscope outperforms HNSW graph-based baseline on the three hardest datasets (NFCorpus: +7.0%, TREC-COVID: +1.6%, AorB: +2.8% NDCG@3) while being 3.2x faster (4.7 ms vs 14.8 ms average). Compared to cross-encoder rerankers, Maniscope achieves within 2% accuracy at 10-45x lower latency. On TREC-COVID, LLM-Reranker provides only +0.5% NDCG@3 improvement over Maniscope at 840x higher latency, positioning Maniscope as a practical alternative for real-time RAG deployment. The method requires O(N D + M^2 D + M k log k) complexity where M << N , enabling sub-10 ms latency. We plan to release Maniscope as open-source software.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAST improves LLM output stability for text analysis tasks like summarization and tagging by using algorithmic prompting and stable thinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack output stability for high-standard data analytics tasks.

Method: CAST employs algorithmic prompting and thinking-before-speaking to constrain reasoning paths.

Result: CAST achieves up to 16.2% better stability scores while maintaining output quality.

Conclusion: CAST effectively enhances LLM stability for text analysis without compromising quality.

Abstract: Text analysis of tabular data relies on two core operations: \emph{summarization} for corpus-level theme extraction and \emph{tagging} for row-level labeling. A critical limitation of employing large language models (LLMs) for these tasks is their inability to meet the high standards of output stability demanded by data analytics. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{CAST} (\textbf{C}onsistency via \textbf{A}lgorithmic Prompting and \textbf{S}table \textbf{T}hinking), a framework that enhances output stability by constraining the model's latent reasoning path. CAST combines (i) Algorithmic Prompting to impose a procedural scaffold over valid reasoning transitions and (ii) Thinking-before-Speaking to enforce explicit intermediate commitments before final generation. To measure progress, we introduce \textbf{CAST-S} and \textbf{CAST-T}, stability metrics for bulleted summarization and tagging, and validate their alignment with human judgments. Experiments across publicly available benchmarks on multiple LLM backbones show that CAST consistently achieves the best stability among all baselines, improving Stability Score by up to 16.2\%, while maintaining or improving output quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in MLMMs where recipe outputs often contain semantically incorrect actions or ingredients despite high lexical scores.

Method: Proposes a two-stage pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), supplemented by a Semantic Confidence Scoring and Rectification (SCSR) module.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Recipe1M with improved semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances recipe generation accuracy and semantic correctness.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLMMs) have enabled recipe generation from food images, yet outputs often contain semantically incorrect actions or ingredients despite high lexical scores (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE). To address this gap, we propose a semantically grounded framework that predicts and validates actions and ingredients as internal context for instruction generation. Our two-stage pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT): SFT builds foundational accuracy using an Action-Reasoning dataset and ingredient corpus, while RFT employs frequency-aware rewards to improve long-tail action prediction and ingredient generalization. A Semantic Confidence Scoring and Rectification (SCSR) module further filters and corrects predictions. Experiments on Recipe1M show state-of-the-art performance and markedly improved semantic fidelity.

### [63] [Not the Example, but the Process: How Self-Generated Examples Enhance LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15863)
*Daehoon Gwak,Minseo Jung,Junwoo Park,Minho Park,ChaeHun Park,Junha Hyung,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-generated few-shot examples improve LLM reasoning gains not from the examples but from their creation process, with integrated prompting outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why self-generated few-shot examples enhance LLM reasoning and determine effective prompting strategies.

Method: Evaluated three prompting strategies (Zero-shot, Integrated, Decoupled) across diverse LLM architectures on reasoning tasks.

Result: Integrated prompting consistently outperforms others, while Decoupled offers marginal gains. Attention patterns differ significantly.

Conclusion: The advantage stems from the problem creation process, guiding better prompting strategy design.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve their reasoning performance through self-generated few-shot examples, achieving results comparable to manually curated in-context examples. However, the underlying mechanism behind these gains remains unclear, making it hard to decide when and how to apply the technique effectively. In this work, we argue that the key benefit arises not from the generated examples themselves but from the act of creating them. To validate this, on reasoning-intensive tasks across diverse LLM architectures, we systematically evaluate three prompting strategies for in-context learning: (1) Zero-shot prompting; (2) Integrated prompting, where LLMs create and solve problems within a single, unified prompt; and (3) Decoupled prompting, where self-generated examples are reused as in-context examples, but the context of their creation itself is excluded. We conduct experiments across five widely used model architectures, demonstrating that Integrated prompting consistently outperforms both Zero-shot and Decoupled prompting. In contrast, Decoupled prompting offers only marginal gains over Zero-shot. Further, for a more in-depth analysis, we conduct an attention analysis and observe significant differences in attention patterns between Integrated and Decoupled prompting. These findings suggest that the advantage of self-generation prompting comes from the process of problem creation, not the examples themselves, providing valuable insights for designing more effective prompting strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini in the Zork text-based game, showing poor performance (under 10% completion) and no improvement with detailed instructions or extended thinking. It highlights limitations in metacognition and problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' reasoning and problem-solving abilities in a controlled, dialogue-based environment using Zork, revealing their limitations.

Method: Tested proprietary models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) in Zork under minimal and detailed instructions, measuring progress via scores and analyzing reasoning.

Result: Models averaged under 10% completion (best: Claude Opus 4.5 at ~75/350 points). No improvement with detailed instructions or extended thinking. Qualitative flaws included lack of reflection, inconsistent strategies, and no learning.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show significant metacognitive and problem-solving limitations in text-based games, questioning their reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: In this positioning paper, we evaluate the problem-solving and reasoning capabilities of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) through their performance in Zork, the seminal text-based adventure game first released in 1977. The game's dialogue-based structure provides a controlled environment for assessing how LLM-based chatbots interpret natural language descriptions and generate appropriate action sequences to succeed in the game. We test the performance of leading proprietary models - ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini - under both minimal and detailed instructions, measuring game progress through achieved scores as the primary metric. Our results reveal that all tested models achieve less than 10% completion on average, with even the best-performing model (Claude Opus 4.5) reaching only approximately 75 out of 350 possible points. Notably, providing detailed game instructions offers no improvement, nor does enabling ''extended thinking''. Qualitative analysis of the models' reasoning processes reveals fundamental limitations: repeated unsuccessful actions suggesting an inability to reflect on one's own thinking, inconsistent persistence of strategies, and failure to learn from previous attempts despite access to conversation history. These findings suggest substantial limitations in current LLMs' metacognitive abilities and problem-solving capabilities within the domain of text-based games, raising questions about the nature and extent of their reasoning capabilities.

<details>

Motivation: To understand and localize failure modes in LLMs on seemingly trivial tasks.

Method: Proposes a deterministic multi-tape Turing machine model to represent LLM interaction stages.

Result: Identifies how tokenisation obscures character-level structure and clarifies the role of techniques like chain-of-thought prompting.

Conclusion: Provides a rigorous framework for LLM error analysis, complementing empirical scaling laws.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit failure modes on seemingly trivial tasks. We propose a formalisation of LLM interaction using a deterministic multi-tape Turing machine, where each tape represents a distinct component: input characters, tokens, vocabulary, model parameters, activations, probability distributions, and output text. The model enables precise localisation of failure modes to specific pipeline stages, revealing, e.g., how tokenisation obscures character-level structure needed for counting tasks. The model clarifies why techniques like chain-of-thought prompting help, by externalising computation on the output tape, while also revealing their fundamental limitations. This approach provides a rigorous, falsifiable alternative to geometric metaphors and complements empirical scaling laws with principled error analysis.

TL;DR: Smaller LLMs achieve comparable performance to large LLMs in clinical de-identification, reducing costs and improving generalizability across cultures, languages, and genders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the generalizability of LLMs in clinical de-identification across formats, cultures, and genders, and to address practical deployment challenges.

Method: Systematic evaluation of fine-tuned transformer models and LLMs (varying sizes) on de-identification tasks, including models fine-tuned on multi-language identifiers. Introduced BERT-MultiCulture-DEID models.

Result: Smaller models matched or outperformed larger models, especially when fine-tuned with limited data for multi-cultural contexts. Cost-effective solutions were identified.

Conclusion: Smaller LLMs offer efficient and fair clinical de-identification, balancing performance and cost, with improved robustness in multi-cultural settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on clinical de-identification, the task of identifying sensitive identifiers to protect privacy. However, previous work has not examined their generalizability between formats, cultures, and genders. In this work, we systematically evaluate fine-tuned transformer models (BERT, ClinicalBERT, ModernBERT), small LLMs (Llama 1-8B, Qwen 1.5-7B), and large LLMs (Llama-70B, Qwen-72B) at de-identification. We show that smaller models achieve comparable performance while substantially reducing inference cost, making them more practical for deployment. Moreover, we demonstrate that smaller models can be fine-tuned with limited data to outperform larger models in de-identifying identifiers drawn from Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish, French, Bengali, and regional variations of English, in addition to gendered names. To improve robustness in multi-cultural contexts, we introduce and publicly release BERT-MultiCulture-DEID, a set of de-identification models based on BERT, ClinicalBERT, and ModernBERT, fine-tuned on MIMIC with identifiers from multiple language variants. Our findings provide the first comprehensive quantification of the efficiency-generalizability trade-off in de-identification and establish practical pathways for fair and efficient clinical de-identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive language models are limited by irreversible decoding, prompting the need for a model that allows iterative refinement during multi-step reasoning.

Method: VDLM uses masked diffusion over semantic embeddings for planning, post-trains the planner with trajectory-aware optimization, and employs a Vec2Text renderer with embedding perturbations for robust text decoding.

Result: VDLM shows competitive pre-training performance and significant post-training improvements on long-form generation tasks, outperforming other baselines across nine benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of embedding-space post-training and robust latent-to-text rendering in diffusion language modeling.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models decode left-to-right with irreversible commitments, limiting revision during multi-step reasoning. We propose \textbf{VDLM}, a modular variable diffusion language model that separates semantic planning from text rendering. VDLM applies LLaDA-style masked diffusion over semantic variable embeddings to enable iterative refinement in latent space, then post-trains the planner with trajectory-aware optimization using embedding-space rewards and values, avoiding text decoding inside the RL loop. To convert planned embeddings back to text, we use a \textbf{Vec2Text} renderer and introduce \textbf{embedding perturbations} to robustify decoding under planner noise. Across nine benchmarks spanning general reasoning, math, and code, VDLM is competitive in pre-training and yields substantial post-training improvements on long-form generation tasks, outperforming other baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of embedding-space post-training and robust latent-to-text rendering for diffusion language modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the issue of AI-hallucinated citations in academic papers, which threatens bibliographic integrity.

Method: Uses multi-source validation against CrossRef, Semantic Scholar, and OpenAlex with string similarity algorithms.

Result: Provides instant feedback on citation authenticity, supporting single-reference and batch processing.

Conclusion: Fills a gap in real-time citation validation, offering a free and efficient solution.

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in academic workflows has introduced unprecedented challenges to bibliographic integrity, particularly through reference hallucination -- the generation of plausible but non-existent citations. Recent investigations have documented the presence of AI-hallucinated citations even in papers accepted at premier machine learning conferences such as NeurIPS and ICLR, underscoring the urgency of automated verification mechanisms. This paper presents "CheckIfExist", an open-source web-based tool designed to provide immediate verification of bibliographic references through multi-source validation against CrossRef, Semantic Scholar, and OpenAlex scholarly databases. While existing reference management tools offer bibliographic organization capabilities, they do not provide real-time validation of citation authenticity. Commercial hallucination detection services, though increasingly available, often impose restrictive usage limits on free tiers or require substantial subscription fees. The proposed tool fills this gap by employing a cascading validation architecture with string similarity algorithms to compute multi-dimensional match confidence scores, delivering instant feedback on reference authenticity. The system supports both single-reference verification and batch processing of BibTeX entries through a unified interface, returning validated APA citations and exportable BibTeX records within seconds.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) variants, proposing Prompt-Enhanced Parametric RAG (P-RAG), a hybrid method combining parametric knowledge and retrieved evidence. P-RAG outperforms Standard RAG significantly on biomedical and general QA datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of LLMs relying on static data and improve RAG's dependence on knowledge base quality.

Method: Evaluated three RAG variants: Standard RAG, DA-RAG, and P-RAG (using Chain-of-Thought prompting and LoRA fine-tuning) on PubMedQA and 2WikiMultihopQA.

Result: P-RAG outperforms Standard RAG by 10.47 points in F1 on PubMedQA and nearly doubles scores on 2WikiMultihopQA, with CoT aiding multi-hop reasoning.

Conclusion: P-RAG shows promise for accurate biomedical QA, with contributions including LoRA fine-tuning and state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities but remain limited by their reliance on static training data. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this constraint by retrieving external knowledge during inference, though it still depends heavily on knowledge base quality. To explore potential improvements, we evaluated three RAG variants-Standard RAG, DA-RAG, and our proposed Prompt-Enhanced Parametric RAG (P-RAG), a hybrid architecture that integrates parametric knowledge within the LLM and retrieved evidence, guided by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning-on both general and biomedical datasets. Using LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct fine-tuned via LoRA, we evaluate on PubMedQA and 2WikiMultihopQA. P-RAG outperforms Standard RAG on PubMedQA by 10.47 percentage points in F1 (93.33% vs. 82.86%; 12.64% relative). On 2WikiMultihopQA, P-RAG nearly doubles the overall score vs. Standard RAG (33.44% vs. 17.83%) and achieves 44.03% on the Compare subset (with 42.74% Bridge, 21.84% Inference, 8.60% Compose). CoT prompting substantially improves multi-hop reasoning but yields mixed results for simpler, single-hop queries. These findings underscore P-RAG's potential for accurate, scalable, and contextually adaptive biomedical question answering. Our contributions include: (1) LoRA-based fine-tuning of LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct for biomedical QA, (2) introduction of P-RAG with Chain-of-Thought prompting, and (3) state-of-the-art results on PubMedQA and 2WikiMultihopQA.

TL;DR: QEMPO is proposed to enhance LLM output diversity while maintaining quality, outperforming existing methods like RLHF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alignment methods improve LLM output quality but reduce diversity, necessitating a balanced approach.

Method: QEMPO maximizes output entropy under quality constraints, with online/offline training methods.

Result: Experiments show QEMPO matches or exceeds RLHF performance while increasing diversity.

Conclusion: QEMPO effectively balances quality and diversity in LLM outputs, offering practical improvements.

Abstract: Recent research indicates that while alignment methods significantly improve the quality of large language model(LLM) outputs, they simultaneously reduce the diversity of the models' output. Although some methods have been proposed to enhance LLM output diversity, they often come at the cost of reduced performance. In this work, we first theoretically demonstrate that the alignment task can be decomposed into two distributions: quality and diversity. To enhance the diversity of LLM outputs while ensuring quality, we propose the Quality-constrained Entropy Maximization Policy Optimization (QEMPO). QEMPO aims to maximize the output entropy of the policy while ensuring output quality. By adding different constraints to QEMPO, we obtain different policies. To optimize policies, we propose both online and offline training methods. Experiments validate that QEMPO achieves performance comparable to or even better than RLHF while improving output diversity.

TL;DR: CogitoRAG is a RAG framework that mimics human cognitive memory to enhance semantic integrity and retrieval accuracy, outperforming existing methods in QA and multi-task benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG frameworks suffer from semantic loss and retrieval deviations due to discrete text representations. The paper proposes CogitoRAG to address these issues by simulating human memory processes.

Method: CogitoRAG extracts Semantic Gist, constructs a multi-dimensional knowledge graph, and uses Query Decomposition and Entity Diffusion Modules for retrieval. The CogniRank algorithm reranks results by combining diffusion scores and semantic similarity.

Result: CogitoRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods on five QA benchmarks and multi-task generation tasks, demonstrating superior knowledge integration and reasoning.

Conclusion: CogitoRAG successfully mitigates hallucinations and retrieval deviations in LLMs by leveraging human-like cognitive processes, marking a notable advancement in RAG frameworks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively mitigates hallucinations in LLMs by incorporating external knowledge. However, the inherent discrete representation of text in existing frameworks often results in a loss of semantic integrity, leading to retrieval deviations. Inspired by the human episodic memory mechanism, we propose CogitoRAG, a RAG framework that simulates human cognitive memory processes. The core of this framework lies in the extraction and evolution of the Semantic Gist. During the offline indexing stage, CogitoRAG first deduces unstructured corpora into gist memory corpora, which are then transformed into a multi-dimensional knowledge graph integrating entities, relational facts, and memory nodes. In the online retrieval stage, the framework handles complex queries via Query Decomposition Module that breaks them into comprehensive sub-queries, mimicking the cognitive decomposition humans employ for complex information. Subsequently, Entity Diffusion Module performs associative retrieval across the graph, guided by structural relevance and an entity-frequency reward mechanism. Furthermore, we propose the CogniRank algorithm, which precisely reranks candidate passages by fusing diffusion-derived scores with semantic similarity. The final evidence is delivered to the generator in a passage-memory pairing format, providing high-density information support. Experimental results across five mainstream QA benchmarks and multi-task generation on GraphBench demonstrate that CogitoRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods, showcasing superior capabilities in complex knowledge integration and reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TOFU is a token-based foundation model designed for multi-modal knowledge graph reasoning (MMKGR). It generalizes well across different MMKGs by discretizing structural, visual, and textual info into modality-specific tokens and using a hierarchical fusion architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMKGR models struggle with generalization to new KGs, and foundation models ignore multi-modal signals. TOFU aims to bridge these gaps by leveraging multi-modal data for better transferability.

Method: TOFU discretizes structural, visual, and textual information into tokens and uses a hierarchical fusion architecture with mixture-of-message mechanisms to process these tokens for transferable features.

Result: TOFU outperforms strong baselines on 17 transductive, inductive, and fully-inductive MMKGs, showing strong performance on unseen graphs.

Conclusion: TOFU successfully addresses generalization challenges in MMKGR by effectively utilizing multi-modal signals and achieves superior performance across diverse MMKG settings.

Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graph reasoning (MMKGR) aims to predict the missing links by exploiting both graph structure information and multi-modal entity contents. Most existing works are designed for a transductive setting, which learns dataset-specific embeddings and struggles to generalize to new KGs. Recent knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) improve cross-KG transfer, but they mainly exploit structural patterns and ignore rich multi-modal signals. We address these gaps by proposing a token-based foundation model (TOFU) for MMKGR, which exhibits strong generalization across different MMKGs. TOFU discretizes structural, visual, and textual information into modality-specific tokens. TOFU then employs a hierarchical fusion architecture with mixture-of-message mechanisms, aiming to process these tokens and obtain transferable features for MMKGR. Experimental results on 17 transductive, inductive, and fully-inductive MMKGs show that TOFU consistently outperforms strong KGFM and MMKGR baselines, delivering strong performance on unseen MMKGs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GHOST is a novel defense against gradient inversion attacks by obfuscating tokens while preserving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient perturbation defenses fail due to retained semantic similarities across spaces, leaving models vulnerable to attacks.

Method: GHOST uses token-level obfuscation with shadow tokens, identified via multi-criteria search, to disrupt attack mappings.

Result: GHOST achieves low recovery rates (1%) and high utility (F1=0.92, perplexity=5.45) across models and datasets.

Conclusion: GHOST effectively defends against GIAs by decoupling semantic connections without compromising model performance.

Abstract: Training and fine-tuning large-scale language models largely benefit from collaborative learning, but the approach has been proven vulnerable to gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), which allow adversaries to reconstruct private training data from shared gradients. Existing defenses mainly employ gradient perturbation techniques, e.g., noise injection or gradient pruning, to disrupt GIAs' direct mapping from gradient space to token space. However, these methods often fall short due to the retention of semantics similarity across gradient, embedding, and token spaces. In this work, we propose a novel defense mechanism named GHOST (gradient shield with obfuscated tokens), a token-level obfuscation mechanism that neutralizes GIAs by decoupling the inherent connections across gradient, embedding, and token spaces. GHOST is built upon an important insight: due to the large scale of the token space, there exist semantically distinct yet embedding-proximate tokens that can serve as the shadow substitutes of the original tokens, which enables a semantic disconnection in the token space while preserving the connection in the embedding and gradient spaces. GHOST comprises a searching step, which identifies semantically distinct candidate tokens using a multi-criteria searching process, and a selection step, which selects optimal shadow tokens to ensure minimal disruption to features critical for training by preserving alignment with the internal outputs produced by original tokens. Evaluation across diverse model architectures (from BERT to Llama) and datasets demonstrates the remarkable effectiveness of GHOST in protecting privacy (as low as 1% in recovery rate) and preserving utility (up to 0.92 in classification F1 and 5.45 in perplexity), in both classification and generation tasks against state-of-the-art GIAs and adaptive attack scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods struggle with noisy graphs and single-step retrieval, while training-based approaches face instability and high costs.

Method: Develops MultiCube-RAG, a training-free method using specialized cubes for multi-step reasoning and retrieval.

Result: Improves response accuracy by 8.9% over baselines and shows greater efficiency and explainability.

Conclusion: MultiCube-RAG effectively addresses multi-hop QA limitations with a novel cube-based approach.

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (QA) necessitates multi-step reasoning and retrieval across interconnected subjects, attributes, and relations. Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods struggle to capture these structural semantics accurately, resulting in suboptimal performance. Graph-based RAGs structure such information in graphs, but the resulting graphs are often noisy and computationally expensive. Moreover, most methods rely on single-step retrieval, neglecting the need for multi-hop reasoning processes. Recent training-based approaches attempt to incentivize the large language models (LLMs) for iterative reasoning and retrieval, but their training processes are prone to unstable convergence and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we devise an ontology-based cube structure with multiple and orthogonal dimensions to model structural subjects, attributes, and relations. Built on the cube structure, we propose MultiCube-RAG, a training-free method consisting of multiple cubes for multi-step reasoning and retrieval. Each cube specializes in modeling a class of subjects, so that MultiCube-RAG flexibly selects the most suitable cubes to acquire the relevant knowledge precisely. To enhance the query-based reasoning and retrieval, our method decomposes a complex multi-hop query into a set of simple subqueries along cube dimensions and conquers each of them sequentially. Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that MultiCube-RAG improves response accuracy by 8.9% over the average performance of various baselines. Notably, we also demonstrate that our method performs with greater efficiency and inherent explainability.

TL;DR: D2L is a lightweight hypernetwork that meta-learns to perform approximate context distillation in one forward pass, reducing latency and memory usage for LLMs without re-consuming original context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the impracticality and inefficiency of per-prompt context distillation due to high training costs and latency in LLMs.

Method: Propose Doc-to-LoRA (D2L), which generates LoRA adapters for LLMs in a single forward pass, enabling efficient inference without re-processing context.

Result: Achieves near-perfect accuracy on long-context tasks and outperforms standard CD with lower memory and latency.

Conclusion: D2L enables rapid LLM adaptation, supporting frequent updates and personalized interactions.

Abstract: Long input sequences are central to in-context learning, document understanding, and multi-step reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the quadratic attention cost of Transformers makes inference memory-intensive and slow. While context distillation (CD) can transfer information into model parameters, per-prompt distillation is impractical due to training costs and latency. To address these limitations, we propose Doc-to-LoRA (D2L), a lightweight hypernetwork that meta-learns to perform approximate CD within a single forward pass. Given an unseen prompt, D2L generates a LoRA adapter for a target LLM, enabling subsequent queries to be answered without re-consuming the original context, reducing latency and KV-cache memory consumption during inference of the target LLM. On a long-context needle-in-a-haystack task, D2L successfully learns to map contexts into adapters that store the needle information, achieving near-perfect zero-shot accuracy at sequence lengths exceeding the target LLM's native context window by more than 4x. On real-world QA datasets with limited compute, D2L outperforms standard CD while significantly reducing peak memory consumption and update latency. We envision that D2L can facilitate rapid adaptation of LLMs, opening up the possibility of frequent knowledge updates and personalized chat behavior.

Motivation: Document understanding often involves processing multi-page, heterogeneous packets, but existing methods lack solutions for splitting such packets into individual documents.

Method: The authors formalize the DocSplit task, create a benchmark dataset (DocSplit) with five diverse datasets, and propose novel evaluation metrics.

Result: Experiments show significant performance gaps in current models, underscoring the challenge of complex document splitting tasks.

Conclusion: DocSplit provides a systematic framework to advance document understanding, with datasets released for future research.

Abstract: Document understanding in real-world applications often requires processing heterogeneous, multi-page document packets containing multiple documents stitched together. Despite recent advances in visual document understanding, the fundamental task of document packet splitting, which involves separating a document packet into individual units, remains largely unaddressed. We present the first comprehensive benchmark dataset, DocSplit, along with novel evaluation metrics for assessing the document packet splitting capabilities of large language models. DocSplit comprises five datasets of varying complexity, covering diverse document types, layouts, and multimodal settings. We formalize the DocSplit task, which requires models to identify document boundaries, classify document types, and maintain correct page ordering within a document packet. The benchmark addresses real-world challenges, including out-of-order pages, interleaved documents, and documents lacking clear demarcations. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating multimodal LLMs on our datasets, revealing significant performance gaps in current models' ability to handle complex document splitting tasks. The DocSplit benchmark datasets and proposed novel evaluation metrics provide a systematic framework for advancing document understanding capabilities essential for legal, financial, healthcare, and other document-intensive domains. We release the datasets to facilitate future research in document packet processing.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the underrepresentation of Korean MWEs, specifically postpositional verb-based constructions (PVCs), in cross-lingual annotation frameworks. It analyzes PVCs from Korean Wikipedia, contrasts them with non-MWEs and LVCs, and proposes annotation guidelines for future integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Korean MWEs, especially multiword adpositions, lack systematic analysis and annotated resources in cross-lingual frameworks.

Method: The study surveys and analyzes PVCs from Korean Wikipedia, comparing them with non-MWEs and LVCs.

Result: The analysis highlights differences between PVCs and similar constructions, leading to the development of annotation guidelines.

Conclusion: The proposed guidelines aim to support future research on Korean MWEs and their alignment with multilingual frameworks.

Abstract: Multiword expressions (MWEs) have been widely studied in cross-lingual annotation frameworks such as PARSEME. However, Korean MWEs remain underrepresented in these efforts. In particular, Korean multiword adpositions lack systematic analysis, annotated resources, and integration into existing multilingual frameworks. In this paper, we study a class of Korean functional multiword expressions: postpositional verb-based constructions (PVCs). Using data from Korean Wikipedia, we survey and analyze several PVC expressions and contrast them with non-MWEs and light verb constructions (LVCs) with similar structure. Building on this analysis, we propose annotation guidelines designed to support future work in Korean multiword adpositions and facilitate alignment with cross-lingual frameworks.

### [78] [CLAA: Cross-Layer Attention Aggregation for Accelerating LLM Prefill](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16054)
*Bradley McDanel,Steven Li,Harshit Khaitan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Token-ranking heuristics for LLM inference face issues with unstable token importance estimation across layers. Introducing an Answer-Informed Oracle reveals high variance in existing methods, prompting a solution: Cross-Layer Attention Aggregation (CLAA), which improves token-ranking quality and reduces Time-to-First-Token by up to 39%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The prefill stage in long-context LLM inference is computationally expensive, and existing token-ranking heuristics suffer from unstable token importance estimation across layers.

Method: An Answer-Informed Oracle measures attention from generated answers back to the prompt to define ground-truth token importance. This reveals high variance in existing heuristics, leading to Cross-Layer Attention Aggregation (CLAA) as a solution.

Result: CLAA reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 39% compared to the Full KV Cache baseline and closes the gap to the oracle upper bound.

Conclusion: Aggregating token importance scores across layers improves stability and performance, making CLAA an effective solution for accelerating LLM inference.

Abstract: The prefill stage in long-context LLM inference remains a computational bottleneck. Recent token-ranking heuristics accelerate inference by selectively processing a subset of semantically relevant tokens. However, existing methods suffer from unstable token importance estimation, often varying between layers. Evaluating token-ranking quality independently from heuristic-specific architectures is challenging. To address this, we introduce an Answer-Informed Oracle, which defines ground-truth token importance by measuring attention from generated answers back to the prompt. This oracle reveals that existing heuristics exhibit high variance across layers: rankings can degrade sharply at specific layers, a failure mode invisible to end-to-end benchmarks. The diagnosis suggests a simple fix: aggregate scores across layers rather than relying on any single one. We implement this as Cross-Layer Attention Aggregation (CLAA), which closes the gap to the oracle upper bound and reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 39\% compared to the Full KV Cache baseline.

*Aruna Sankaranarayanan,Amir Zur,Atticus Geiger,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GCM is a method for identifying and controlling specific components in language models to steer long-form responses toward desired behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to find where and how to intervene in language models to control behaviors distributed across long-form responses.

Method: GCM constructs datasets of contrastive inputs/responses, quantifies mediation by model components, and selects strong mediators for steering.

Result: GCM outperforms correlational probes in tasks like refusal, sycophancy, and style transfer, effectively locating and controlling behaviors.

Conclusion: GCM is an effective approach for localizing and steering long-form responses in language models.

Abstract: Where should we intervene in a language model (LM) to control behaviors that are diffused across many tokens of a long-form response? We introduce Generative Causal Mediation (GCM), a procedure for selecting model components, e.g., attention heads, to steer a binary concept (e.g., talk in verse vs. talk in prose) from contrastive long-form responses. In GCM, we first construct a dataset of contrasting inputs and responses. Then, we quantify how individual model components mediate the contrastive concept and select the strongest mediators for steering. We evaluate GCM on three tasks--refusal, sycophancy, and style transfer--across three language models. GCM successfully localizes concepts expressed in long-form responses and consistently outperforms correlational probe-based baselines when steering with a sparse set of attention heads. Together, these results demonstrate that GCM provides an effective approach for localizing and controlling the long-form responses of LMs.

### [80] [Language Statistics and False Belief Reasoning: Evidence from 41 Open-Weight LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16085)
*Sean Trott,Samuel Taylor,Cameron Jones,James A. Michaelov,Pamela D. Rivière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores mental state reasoning in language models (LMs) using 41 open-weight models, finding partial sensitivity to knowledge states and human-like biases. It highlights the value of diverse LMs for cognitive theories and LM evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to test psychological theories (e.g., mental state reasoning emerging from language exposure) and evaluate LM capacities, addressing limitations of prior work that relied on few closed-source LMs.

Method: Researchers replicated and extended false belief task experiments, assessing 41 open-weight LMs for sensitivity to knowledge states and biases in belief attribution.

Result: 34% of LMs showed sensitivity to knowledge states, with larger models exhibiting higher sensitivity and predictive power. A human-like bias emerged in LMs when knowledge states were cued non-factively.

Conclusion: Open-weight LMs are valuable for testing cognitive theories and LM evaluation. Their behavior can generate novel hypotheses about human cognition, though differences remain in primary effects.

Abstract: Research on mental state reasoning in language models (LMs) has the potential to inform theories of human social cognition--such as the theory that mental state reasoning emerges in part from language exposure--and our understanding of LMs themselves. Yet much published work on LMs relies on a relatively small sample of closed-source LMs, limiting our ability to rigorously test psychological theories and evaluate LM capacities. Here, we replicate and extend published work on the false belief task by assessing LM mental state reasoning behavior across 41 open-weight models (from distinct model families). We find sensitivity to implied knowledge states in 34% of the LMs tested; however, consistent with prior work, none fully ``explain away'' the effect in humans. Larger LMs show increased sensitivity and also exhibit higher psychometric predictive power. Finally, we use LM behavior to generate and test a novel hypothesis about human cognition: both humans and LMs show a bias towards attributing false beliefs when knowledge states are cued using a non-factive verb (``John thinks...'') than when cued indirectly (``John looks in the...''). Unlike the primary effect of knowledge states, where human sensitivity exceeds that of LMs, the magnitude of the human knowledge cue effect falls squarely within the distribution of LM effect sizes-suggesting that distributional statistics of language can in principle account for the latter but not the former in humans. These results demonstrate the value of using larger samples of open-weight LMs to test theories of human cognition and evaluate LM capacities.

*Shankar Padmanabhan,Mustafa Omer Gul,Tanya Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiSC introduces a context-distillation approach for continual knowledge adaptation in LLMs, balancing new knowledge acquisition with retention of prior skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to simultaneously adapt LLMs to new knowledge while mitigating forgetting of previously learned capabilities.

Method: DiSC uses split contexts to derive student and teacher distributions, minimizing KL divergence between shared tokens without explicit generation steps.

Result: DiSC outperforms prior methods in balancing new knowledge learning and retention of skills like instruction-following and reasoning across four models and two domains.

Conclusion: DiSC effectively addresses continual adaptation challenges in LLMs, offering a practical solution for maintaining and updating knowledge.

Abstract: Post-training endows pretrained LLMs with a variety of desirable skills, including instruction-following, reasoning, and others. However, these post-trained LLMs only encode knowledge up to a cut-off date, necessitating continual adaptation. Unfortunately, existing solutions cannot simultaneously learn new knowledge from an adaptation document corpora and mitigate the forgetting of earlier learned capabilities. To address this, we introduce Distillation via Split Contexts (DiSC), a simple context-distillation based approach for continual knowledge adaptation. \methodname~derives student and teacher distributions by conditioning on distinct segments of the training example and minimizes the KL divergence between the shared tokens. This allows us to efficiently apply context-distillation without requiring explicit generation steps during training. We run experiments on four post-trained models and two adaptation domains. Compared to prior finetuning and distillation methods for continual adaptation, DiSC consistently reports the best trade-off between learning new knowledge and mitigating forgetting of previously learned skills like instruction-following, reasoning, and factual knowledge.

TL;DR: MBD is a framework for revocable multimodal sentiment analysis, enabling selective deletion of data modalities while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy concerns and user autonomy in multimodal systems by allowing revocation of specific data modalities.

Method: Combines structured representation learning with a certifiable parameter-modification pipeline, using property-aware embeddings and generator-based reconstruction.

Result: Achieves strong predictive performance under incomplete inputs and provides a practical privacy-utility trade-off.

Conclusion: MBD positions surgical unlearning as an efficient alternative to full retraining for privacy-sensitive applications.

Abstract: As multimodal systems increasingly process sensitive personal data, the ability to selectively revoke specific data modalities has become a critical requirement for privacy compliance and user autonomy. We present Missing-by-Design (MBD), a unified framework for revocable multimodal sentiment analysis that combines structured representation learning with a certifiable parameter-modification pipeline. Revocability is critical in privacy-sensitive applications where users or regulators may request removal of modality-specific information. MBD learns property-aware embeddings and employs generator-based reconstruction to recover missing channels while preserving task-relevant signals. For deletion requests, the framework applies saliency-driven candidate selection and a calibrated Gaussian update to produce a machine-verifiable Modality Deletion Certificate. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that MBD achieves strong predictive performance under incomplete inputs and delivers a practical privacy-utility trade-off, positioning surgical unlearning as an efficient alternative to full retraining.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REMUL improves CoT faithfulness in LLMs via multi-party reinforcement learning, balancing interpretability and performance, showing gains in faithfulness measures and accuracy across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the tradeoff between faithfulness/interpretability and task performance in CoT reasoning, as current CoT methods often fail to reflect true LLM computations.

Method: Proposes REMUL: speaker generates reasoning traces; listeners execute them. Speakers are rewarded for clarity, with correctness regularization via masked supervised finetuning.

Result: Improves faithfulness metrics (hint attribution, AOC) and accuracy across benchmarks (BIG-Bench Extra Hard, MuSR, etc.), with robust gains and shorter CoTs.

Conclusion: REMUL effectively enhances CoT faithfulness without sacrificing performance, proving its utility in LLM reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning sometimes fails to faithfully reflect the true computation of a large language model (LLM), hampering its utility in explaining how LLMs arrive at their answers. Moreover, optimizing for faithfulness and interpretability in reasoning often degrades task performance. To address this tradeoff and improve CoT faithfulness, we propose Reasoning Execution by Multiple Listeners (REMUL), a multi-party reinforcement learning approach. REMUL builds on the hypothesis that reasoning traces which other parties can follow will be more faithful. A speaker model generates a reasoning trace, which is truncated and passed to a pool of listener models who "execute" the trace, continuing the trace to an answer. Speakers are rewarded for producing reasoning that is clear to listeners, with additional correctness regularization via masked supervised finetuning to counter the tradeoff between faithfulness and performance. On multiple reasoning benchmarks (BIG-Bench Extra Hard, MuSR, ZebraLogicBench, and FOLIO), REMUL consistently and substantially improves three measures of faithfulness -- hint attribution, early answering area over the curve (AOC), and mistake injection AOC -- while also improving accuracy. Our analysis finds that these gains are robust across training domains, translate to legibility gains, and are associated with shorter and more direct CoTs.

### [84] [LLMs Exhibit Significantly Lower Uncertainty in Creative Writing Than Professional Writers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16162)
*Peiqi Sui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights how LLMs' creative writing suffers due to low uncertainty, contrasting with human writing's higher uncertainty, which is essential for creativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the understudied role of uncertainty in LLMs' creative limitations and its impact on literary quality.

Method: Quantified the 'uncertainty gap' between human and model-generated stories using information-theoretic analysis on 28 LLMs tested on storytelling datasets.

Result: Human writing shows higher uncertainty than model outputs, especially in creative writing, with instruction-tuned models widening this gap. The uncertainty gap correlates with writing quality.

Conclusion: New alignment paradigms are needed to balance uncertainty for creativity while avoiding hallucinations.

Abstract: We argue that uncertainty is a key and understudied limitation of LLMs' performance in creative writing, which is often characterized as trite and cliché-ridden. Literary theory identifies uncertainty as a necessary condition for creative expression, while current alignment strategies steer models away from uncertain outputs to ensure factuality and reduce hallucination. We formalize this tension by quantifying the "uncertainty gap" between human-authored stories and model-generated continuations. Through a controlled information-theoretic analysis of 28 LLMs on high-quality storytelling datasets, we demonstrate that human writing consistently exhibits significantly higher uncertainty than model outputs. We find that instruction-tuned and reasoning models exacerbate this trend compared to their base counterparts; furthermore, the gap is more pronounced in creative writing than in functional domains, and strongly correlates to writing quality. Achieving human-level creativity requires new uncertainty-aware alignment paradigms that can distinguish between destructive hallucinations and the constructive ambiguity required for literary richness.

TL;DR: The paper proposes module transplantation in language models to improve underperforming versions without additional training, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models sometimes underperform earlier versions, and existing solutions are resource-heavy, necessitating efficient alternatives.

Method: Identifies and transplants locally activated modules using activation-based analysis, testing effectiveness across different model conditions.

Result: Module transplantation improves performance up to twice the baseline in cross-generation settings and 2.33 times in instruction-tuned models.

Conclusion: The study confirms task-localized modularity in language models and introduces model transplantation as a promising research area.

Abstract: Despite the continuous research and evolution of language models, they sometimes underperform previous versions. Existing approaches to overcome these challenges are resource-intensive, highlighting the need for alternatives that enable immediate action. We assume that each language model has a local module inside that is suitable for a specific function. First, this work identifies a set of modules showing consistent and local activation changes under an inference workload through activation-based analysis. Subsequently, we transplant an internal module that is properly activated for a specific task into the target model, leading to immediate and measurable functional changes without additional training or fine-tuning. To experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the transplant technique, we quantify the relationship between transplant strength and performance improvement under different conditions for two language models. In the cross-generation setting, we find that transplanting activation-selected modules can substantially improve the underperforming model, reaching up to twice the target baseline and achieving gap-based recovery above 100%. Moreover, in transplant experiments between a base model and its instruction-tuned counterpart, transplantation improves the underperforming model toward the stronger baseline, yielding up to about 2.33 times the target baseline with gap-based recovery reaching up to 100% in the best case. These results show that meaningful capacity transfer can be realized through the implantation of highly localized modules implied by language models. Overall, this work provides empirical evidence for task-localized modularity in language models and presents a new research area: model transplantation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores coreference evaluations' limitations, highlights measurement validity issues, and proposes a new evaluation method for event plausibility inference, revealing NLP models' strengths and weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the reliability of conclusions from coreference evaluations and address issues like contested definitions and lack of convergent validity.

Method: Analyzes standard coreference evaluations for validity issues and introduces a novel evaluation focusing on event plausibility inference.

Result: Shows models perform well on standard benchmarks but struggle with generalization under modified contexts, exposing measurement validity weaknesses.

Conclusion: Highlights current NLP strengths (e.g., improved accuracy) and limitations (e.g., poor generalization), suggesting better evaluation methods and systems.

Abstract: In this thesis, I refine our understanding as to what conclusions we can reach from coreference-based evaluations by expanding existing evaluation practices and considering the extent to which evaluation results are either converging or conflicting. First, I analyze standard coreference evaluations and show that their design often leads to non-generalizable conclusions due to issues of measurement validity - including contestedness (multiple, competing definitions of coreference) and convergent validity (evaluation results that rank models differently across benchmarks). Second, I propose and implement a novel evaluation focused on testing systems' ability to infer the relative plausibility of events, a key aspect of resolving coreference. Through this extended evaluation, I find that contemporary language models demonstrate strong performance on standard benchmarks - improving over earlier baseline systems within certain domains and types of coreference - but remain sensitive to the evaluation conditions: they often fail to generalize in ways one would expect a human to be capable of when evaluation contexts are slightly modified. Taken together, these findings clarify both the strengths, such as improved accuracy over baselines on widely used evaluations, and the limitations of the current NLP paradigm, including weaknesses in measurement validity, and suggest directions for future work in developing better evaluation methods and more genuinely generalizable systems.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes long-tail knowledge in LLMs, introducing a framework to understand its definition, loss, mitigation, and sociotechnical implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address persistent failures in LLMs related to low-frequency, domain-specific, cultural, and temporal knowledge, which remain poorly characterized despite scaling improvements.

Method: Develops a structured taxonomy and framework analyzing long-tail knowledge across four axes: definition, loss mechanisms, mitigation techniques, and sociotechnical implications.

Result: Provides a unified framework for understanding and addressing long-tail knowledge issues in LLMs, highlighting gaps in evaluation and accountability.

Conclusion: Identifies open challenges in privacy, sustainability, and governance, calling for better representation and handling of long-tail knowledge in deployed systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on web-scale corpora that exhibit steep power-law distributions, in which the distribution of knowledge is highly long-tailed, with most appearing infrequently. While scaling has improved average-case performance, persistent failures on low-frequency, domain-specific, cultural, and temporal knowledge remain poorly characterized. This paper develops a structured taxonomy and analysis of long-Tail Knowledge in large language models, synthesizing prior work across technical and sociotechnical perspectives.
  We introduce a structured analytical framework that synthesizes prior work across four complementary axes: how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, the mechanisms by which it is lost or distorted during training and inference, the technical interventions proposed to mitigate these failures, and the implications of these failures for fairness, accountability, transparency, and user trust. We further examine how existing evaluation practices obscure tail behavior and complicate accountability for rare but consequential failures. The paper concludes by identifying open challenges related to privacy, sustainability, and governance that constrain long-Tail Knowledge representation. Taken together, this paper provides a unifying conceptual framework for understanding how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, lost, evaluated, and manifested in deployed language model systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability and potential biases of LLMs in sensitive, low-resource annotation tasks like Bangla hate speech detection.

Method: Systematic benchmarking of 17 LLMs using a unified evaluation framework to analyze their performance as zero-shot annotators.

Result: Found annotator bias and instability in model judgments, with smaller, task-aligned models often outperforming larger ones in consistency.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations for sensitive tasks in low-resource languages, emphasizing the need for thorough evaluation before deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated annotators to scale dataset creation, yet their reliability as unbiased annotators--especially for low-resource and identity-sensitive settings--remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the behavior of LLMs as zero-shot annotators for Bangla hate speech, a task where even human agreement is challenging, and annotator bias can have serious downstream consequences. We conduct a systematic benchmark of 17 LLMs using a unified evaluation framework. Our analysis uncovers annotator bias and substantial instability in model judgments. Surprisingly, increased model scale does not guarantee improved annotation quality--smaller, more task-aligned models frequently exhibit more consistent behavior than their larger counterparts. These results highlight important limitations of current LLMs for sensitive annotation tasks in low-resource languages and underscore the need for careful evaluation before deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic dialects are under-studied in NLP due to non-standardization and variability. LLMs provide a promising solution.

Method: Developed Aladdin-FTI for generating and translating dialectal Arabic (Moroccan, Egyptian, Palestinian, Syrian, Saudi) bidirectionally with MSA and English.

Result: A publicly available system capable of handling multiple Arabic dialects and translations.

Conclusion: Aladdin-FTI successfully leverages LLMs to bridge the gap in Arabic dialect NLP research.

Abstract: Arabic dialects have long been under-represented in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research due to their non-standardization and high variability, which pose challenges for computational modeling. Recent advances in the field, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), offer promising avenues to address this gap by enabling Arabic to be modeled as a pluricentric language rather than a monolithic system. This paper presents Aladdin-FTI, our submission to the AMIYA shared task. The proposed system is designed to both generate and translate dialectal Arabic (DA). Specifically, the model supports text generation in Moroccan, Egyptian, Palestinian, Syrian, and Saudi dialects, as well as bidirectional translation between these dialects, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and English. The code and trained model are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in automated support for detecting check-worthy claims in fact-checking by creating a balanced multilingual dataset and evaluating models' performance.

Method: Developed the MultiCW dataset with 123,722 samples across 16 languages, domains, and styles, and evaluated fine-tuned multilingual transformers and zero-shot LLMs.

Result: Fine-tuned models outperform zero-shot LLMs in claim classification and generalize well across languages, domains, and styles.

Conclusion: MultiCW serves as a valuable resource for automated fact-checking and highlights the effectiveness of fine-tuned models over zero-shot LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are beginning to reshape how media professionals verify information, yet automated support for detecting check-worthy claims a key step in the fact-checking process remains limited. We introduce the Multi-Check-Worthy (MultiCW) dataset, a balanced multilingual benchmark for check-worthy claim detection spanning 16 languages, 7 topical domains, and 2 writing styles. It consists of 123,722 samples, evenly distributed between noisy (informal) and structured (formal) texts, with balanced representation of check-worthy and non-check-worthy classes across all languages. To probe robustness, we also introduce an equally balanced out-of-distribution evaluation set of 27,761 samples in 4 additional languages. To provide baselines, we benchmark 3 common fine-tuned multilingual transformers against a diverse set of 15 commercial and open LLMs under zero-shot settings. Our findings show that fine-tuned models consistently outperform zero-shot LLMs on claim classification and show strong out-of-distribution generalization across languages, domains, and styles. MultiCW provides a rigorous multilingual resource for advancing automated fact-checking and enables systematic comparisons between fine-tuned models and cutting-edge LLMs on the check-worthy claim detection task.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CA-LIG, a framework for interpreting Transformer models by integrating layer-wise attributions with attention gradients, yielding context-aware, hierarchical explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current explainability methods for Transformers lack unification, context-awareness, and fail to track relevance evolution across layers or structural components' impact.

Method: Proposed CA-LIG combines layer-wise Integrated Gradients with class-specific attention gradients to create signed, context-sensitive attribution maps.

Result: CA-LIG outperforms existing methods in faithfulness, sensitivity to context, and clarity of visualizations across diverse tasks and Transformer architectures.

Conclusion: CA-LIG advances Transformer interpretability by providing comprehensive, context-aware explanations, enhancing understanding of deep neural models.

Abstract: Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains and tasks, yet their deeply layered representations make their predictions difficult to interpret. Existing explainability methods rely on final-layer attributions, capture either local token-level attributions or global attention patterns without unification, and lack context-awareness of inter-token dependencies and structural components. They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods. These results indicate that CA-LIG provides a more comprehensive, context-aware, and reliable explanation of Transformer decision-making, advancing both the practical interpretability and conceptual understanding of deep neural models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemoryArena is introduced as a unified benchmark to evaluate how agents use memory across interdependent tasks, highlighting gaps in current evaluations that isolate memorization and action.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate memorization or action separately, missing the interplay between memory and decision-making in realistic multi-session tasks.

Method: MemoryArena is a gym with human-crafted tasks where agents distill experiences into memory and use it to solve interdependent subtasks across domains like web navigation and planning.

Result: Agents excelling in traditional memory benchmarks underperform in MemoryArena, revealing limitations in current evaluation methods.

Conclusion: MemoryArena bridges the gap by testing memory-in-action, emphasizing the need for integrated evaluations in agent memory research.

Abstract: Existing evaluations of agents with memory typically assess memorization and action in isolation. One class of benchmarks evaluates memorization by testing recall of past conversations or text but fails to capture how memory is used to guide future decisions. Another class focuses on agents acting in single-session tasks without the need for long-term memory. However, in realistic settings, memorization and action are tightly coupled: agents acquire memory while interacting with the environment, and subsequently rely on that memory to solve future tasks. To capture this setting, we introduce MemoryArena, a unified evaluation gym for benchmarking agent memory in multi-session Memory-Agent-Environment loops. The benchmark consists of human-crafted agentic tasks with explicitly interdependent subtasks, where agents must learn from earlier actions and feedback by distilling experiences into memory, and subsequently use that memory to guide later actions to solve the overall task. MemoryArena supports evaluation across web navigation, preference-constrained planning, progressive information search, and sequential formal reasoning, and reveals that agents with near-saturated performance on existing long-context memory benchmarks like LoCoMo perform poorly in our agentic setting, exposing a gap in current evaluations for agents with memory.

TL;DR: STING is an automated framework for testing multi-turn illicit task execution by LLM-based agents, outperforming single-turn benchmarks and providing tools for practical misuse evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack comprehensive testing for multi-turn agent misuse, creating a gap in evaluating complex illicit workflows in realistic settings.

Method: STING constructs step-by-step illicit plans grounded in benign personas, probes agents iteratively with adaptive follow-ups, and uses judge agents to track progress.

Result: STING achieves higher illicit-task completion than single-turn methods and chat-oriented baselines, with multilingual evaluations showing varied success.

Conclusion: STING offers a practical, realistic way to assess and mitigate agent misuse in multi-turn and multilingual deployment scenarios.

Abstract: LLM-based agents execute real-world workflows via tools and memory. These affordances enable ill-intended adversaries to also use these agents to carry out complex misuse scenarios. Existing agent misuse benchmarks largely test single-prompt instructions, leaving a gap in measuring how agents end up helping with harmful or illegal tasks over multiple turns. We introduce STING (Sequential Testing of Illicit N-step Goal execution), an automated red-teaming framework that constructs a step-by-step illicit plan grounded in a benign persona and iteratively probes a target agent with adaptive follow-ups, using judge agents to track phase completion. We further introduce an analysis framework that models multi-turn red-teaming as a time-to-first-jailbreak random variable, enabling analysis tools like discovery curves, hazard-ratio attribution by attack language, and a new metric: Restricted Mean Jailbreak Discovery. Across AgentHarm scenarios, STING yields substantially higher illicit-task completion than single-turn prompting and chat-oriented multi-turn baselines adapted to tool-using agents. In multilingual evaluations across six non-English settings, we find that attack success and illicit-task completion do not consistently increase in lower-resource languages, diverging from common chatbot findings. Overall, STING provides a practical way to evaluate and stress-test agent misuse in realistic deployment settings, where interactions are inherently multi-turn and often multilingual.

### [94] [Label-Consistent Data Generation for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Using LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16379)
*Mohammad H. A. Monfared,Lucie Flek,Akbar Karimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an agentic data augmentation method for ABSA, showing it outperforms prompting-based baselines in label preservation and performance gains, especially for less pretrained models like T5-Base.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the quality of synthetic training examples for ABSA tasks by leveraging agentic data augmentation.

Method: Proposes an agentic augmentation method using iterative generation and verification, compared to a prompting-based baseline. Evaluated across ABSA subtasks, datasets, and models.

Result: Agentic augmentation outperforms prompting in label preservation and performance gains, particularly for T5-Base.

Conclusion: Agentic data augmentation is effective for ABSA, enhancing model performance, especially for less pretrained models.

Abstract: We propose an agentic data augmentation method for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) that uses iterative generation and verification to produce high quality synthetic training examples. To isolate the effect of agentic structure, we also develop a closely matched prompting-based baseline using the same model and instructions. Both methods are evaluated across three ABSA subtasks (Aspect Term Extraction (ATE), Aspect Sentiment Classification (ATSC), and Aspect Sentiment Pair Extraction (ASPE)), four SemEval datasets, and two encoder-decoder models: T5-Base and Tk-Instruct. Our results show that the agentic augmentation outperforms raw prompting in label preservation of the augmented data, especially when the tasks require aspect term generation. In addition, when combined with real data, agentic augmentation provides higher gains, consistently outperforming prompting-based generation. These benefits are most pronounced for T5-Base, while the more heavily pretrained Tk-Instruct exhibits smaller improvements. As a result, augmented data helps T5-Base achieve comparable performance with its counterpart.

*Ido Levy,Eilam Shapira,Yinon Goldshtein,Avi Yaeli,Nir Mashkif,Segev Shlomov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TabAgent replaces generative LLM decision components in agentic systems with a compact classifier, reducing latency by 95% and costs by 85-91% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic systems rely on repeated LLM calls for closed-set decisions, making deployments slow and expensive. TabAgent aims to address these inefficiencies.

Method: TabAgent extracts structured features (TabSchema), augments training data synthetically (TabSynth), and uses a lightweight classifier (TabHead) for scoring.

Result: On the AppWorld benchmark, TabAgent eliminates LLM calls during shortlisting, cutting latency by ~95% and inference costs by 85-91% without sacrificing success rates.

Conclusion: TabAgent offers a scalable solution for replacing generative bottlenecks in agentic systems with learned discriminative models, improving efficiency.

Abstract: Agentic systems, AI architectures that autonomously execute multi-step workflows to achieve complex goals, are often built using repeated large language model (LLM) calls for closed-set decision tasks such as routing, shortlisting, gating, and verification. While convenient, this design makes deployments slow and expensive due to cumulative latency and token usage. We propose TabAgent, a framework for replacing generative decision components in closed-set selection tasks with a compact textual-tabular classifier trained on execution traces. TabAgent (i) extracts structured schema, state, and dependency features from trajectories (TabSchema), (ii) augments coverage with schema-aligned synthetic supervision (TabSynth), and (iii) scores candidates with a lightweight classifier (TabHead). On the long-horizon AppWorld benchmark, TabAgent maintains task-level success while eliminating shortlist-time LLM calls, reducing latency by approximately 95% and inference cost by 85-91%. Beyond tool shortlisting, TabAgent generalizes to other agentic decision heads, establishing a paradigm for learned discriminative replacements of generative bottlenecks in production agent architectures.

TL;DR: IndicEval is a benchmarking platform for evaluating LLMs using real-world exam questions in English and Hindi, revealing key insights about reasoning, model disparities, and multilingual challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for evaluation frameworks that reflect real-world academic rigor and multilingual complexity drives the development of IndicEval.

Method: IndicEval uses authentic exam questions, automates assessment with Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and CoT prompting, and supports modular integration of new models and languages.

Result: CoT improves reasoning accuracy, performance disparities persist, and multilingual degradation is evident, especially in Hindi under Zero-Shot conditions.

Conclusion: IndicEval offers a scalable, practice-oriented framework for rigorous LLM evaluation and insights for enhancing reasoning and language adaptability.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) necessitates evaluation frameworks that reflect real-world academic rigor and multilingual complexity. This paper introduces IndicEval, a scalable benchmarking platform designed to assess LLM performance using authentic high-stakes examination questions from UPSC, JEE, and NEET across STEM and humanities domains in both English and Hindi. Unlike synthetic benchmarks, IndicEval grounds evaluation in real examination standards, enabling realistic measurement of reasoning, domain knowledge, and bilingual adaptability. The framework automates assessment using Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies and supports modular integration of new models and languages. Experiments conducted on Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA 3-70B reveal three major findings. First, CoT prompting consistently improves reasoning accuracy, with substantial gains across subjects and languages. Second, significant cross-model performance disparities persist, particularly in high-complexity examinations. Third, multilingual degradation remains a critical challenge, with marked accuracy drops in Hindi compared to English, especially under Zero-Shot conditions. These results highlight persistent gaps in bilingual reasoning and domain transfer. Overall, IndicEval provides a practice-oriented, extensible foundation for rigorous, equitable evaluation of LLMs in multilingual educational settings and offers actionable insights for improving reasoning robustness and language adaptability.

### [97] [Training Models on Dialects of Translationese Shows How Lexical Diversity and Source-Target Syntactic Similarity Shape Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16469)
*Jenny Kunz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Training small English models on machine-translated data reveals that source language properties influence lexical diversity and grammatical performance differently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how translationese from diverse source languages affects model behavior in linguistic acceptability and language modeling.

Method: Train models on English text translated from 24 typologically diverse languages and analyze the impact of source language and corpus properties.

Result: Source language affects model behavior: lexical diversity influences perplexity, while grammatical performance links to typological similarity to English.

Conclusion: The properties of the source language significantly shape how models learn from machine-translated data, impacting both lexical and grammatical aspects.

Abstract: Machine-translated data is widely used in multilingual NLP, particularly when native text is scarce. However, translated text differs systematically from native text. This phenomenon is known as translationese, and it reflects both traces of the source language and characteristic properties of translation itself. In this paper, we study how training on machine-translated data affects small English language models, focusing on how translationese from different source languages shapes linguistic acceptability judgments and language modelling for different domains. We train models on English text translated from 24 typologically and resource-diverse source languages, enabling a systematic analysis of how source language and corpus properties influence what models learn. Our results show that the source language has a clear impact on model behavior: general perplexity is more driven by the lexical diversity of the translated corpus, while grammatical performance is strongly correlated to typological similarity to English, given enough data.

*Ferdinand Kapl,Emmanouil Angelis,Kaitlin Maile,Johannes von Oswald,Stefan Bauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper unifies looping and depth-growing techniques in neural networks, showing their convergent computational signatures and complementary benefits for reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the relationship between looping and depth-growing techniques and understand their shared mechanistic benefits for improving reasoning in neural networks.

Method: The study analyzes depth-wise signatures of looped and depth-grown models, demonstrates their adaptability and composability, and evaluates performance on reasoning tasks.

Result: Looped and depth-grown models show similar computational patterns, and combining them can improve reasoning accuracy by up to 2x. Both techniques adapt well to additional data.

Conclusion: Depth growth and looping are complementary methods for inducing iterative computation, enhancing reasoning performance in neural networks.

Abstract: Looping, reusing a block of layers across depth, and depth growing, training shallow-to-deep models by duplicating middle layers, have both been linked to stronger reasoning, but their relationship remains unclear. We provide a mechanistic unification: looped and depth-grown models exhibit convergent depth-wise signatures, including increased reliance on late layers and recurring patterns aligned with the looped or grown block. These shared signatures support the view that their gains stem from a common form of iterative computation. Building on this connection, we show that the two techniques are adaptable and composable: applying inference-time looping to the middle blocks of a depth-grown model improves accuracy on some reasoning primitives by up to $2\times$, despite the model never being trained to loop. Both approaches also adapt better than the baseline when given more in-context examples or additional supervised fine-tuning data. Additionally, depth-grown models achieve the largest reasoning gains when using higher-quality, math-heavy cooldown mixtures, which can be further boosted by adapting a middle block to loop. Overall, our results position depth growth and looping as complementary, practical methods for inducing and scaling iterative computation to improve reasoning.

*Zhenzhen Huang,Chaoning Zhang,Haoyu Bian,Songbo Zhang,Chi-lok Andy Tai,Jiaquan Zhang,Caiyan Qin,Jingjing Qu,Yalan Ye,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a topological morphological evolution-based method to optimize soft prompt tuning, enhancing interpretability and performance using persistent homology and a novel loss function (TSLoss).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft prompts in large language models lack interpretability due to high-dimensional, implicit representations. This paper aims to address this by leveraging topological data analysis to improve understanding and optimization.

Method: The proposed method uses persistent homology to analyze soft prompt structures and their evolution during training. A topological loss function (TSLoss) is introduced to optimize prompt tuning by focusing on structural stability and compactness.

Result: Quantitative analysis reveals that topologically stable and compact soft prompts perform better. Experiments show TSLoss accelerates convergence and improves tuning performance.

Conclusion: The topological approach provides an interpretable way to understand and optimize soft prompt tuning, enhancing both performance and insight into the tuning process.

Abstract: Soft prompt tuning leverages continuous embeddings to capture task-specific information in large pre-trained language models (LLMs), achieving competitive performance in few-shot settings. However, soft prompts rely on high-dimensional, implicit representations and lack explicit semantics and traceable training behaviors, which limits their interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose a soft prompt tuning optimization method based on topological morphological evolution. Specifically, we employ persistent homology from topological data analysis (TDA) to quantify the structural representations of soft prompts in continuous parameter space and their training process evolution. Quantitative analysis shows that topologically stable and compact soft prompts achieve better downstream performance. Based on this empirical observation, we construct a loss function for optimizing soft prompt tuning, termed Topological Soft Prompt Loss (TSLoss). TSLoss guides the model to learn structurally stable adaptations by quantifying inter-parameter connectivity and redundancy. Extensive experiments show that training with TSLoss accelerates convergence and improves tuning performance, providing an interpretable method to understand and optimize soft prompt tuning from structural and topological perspectives.

*Taja Kuzman Pungeršek,Peter Rupnik,Daniela Širinić,Nikola Ljubešić*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParlaCAP is a dataset for European parliamentary agenda analysis, using a cost-effective teacher-student method to build topic classifiers, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable and domain-specific analysis of parliamentary agendas across Europe.

Method: Uses a teacher-student framework with an LLM for annotations and a multilingual encoder for fine-tuning.

Result: Produces a high-performing classifier with human-level agreement and outperforms existing CAP classifiers.

Conclusion: ParlaCAP facilitates comparative research on political attention and representation with rich metadata.

Abstract: This paper introduces ParlaCAP, a large-scale dataset for analyzing parliamentary agenda setting across Europe, and proposes a cost-effective method for building domain-specific policy topic classifiers. Applying the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) schema to the multilingual ParlaMint corpus of over 8 million speeches from 28 parliaments of European countries and autonomous regions, we follow a teacher-student framework in which a high-performing large language model (LLM) annotates in-domain training data and a multilingual encoder model is fine-tuned on these annotations for scalable data annotation. We show that this approach produces a classifier tailored to the target domain. Agreement between the LLM and human annotators is comparable to inter-annotator agreement among humans, and the resulting model outperforms existing CAP classifiers trained on manually-annotated but out-of-domain data. In addition to the CAP annotations, the ParlaCAP dataset offers rich speaker and party metadata, as well as sentiment predictions coming from the ParlaSent multilingual transformer model, enabling comparative research on political attention and representation across countries. We illustrate the analytical potential of the dataset with three use cases, examining the distribution of parliamentary attention across policy topics, sentiment patterns in parliamentary speech, and gender differences in policy attention.

### [101] [Utility-Preserving De-Identification for Math Tutoring: Investigating Numeric Ambiguity in the MathEd-PII Benchmark Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16571)
*Zhuqian Zhou,Kirk Vanacore,Bakhtawar Ahtisham,Jinsook Lee,Doug Pietrzak,Daryl Hedley,Jorge Dias,Chris Shaw,Ruth Schäfer,René F. Kizilcec*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of de-identifying math tutoring transcripts without losing educational utility, introducing MathEd-PII as a benchmark dataset and showing math-aware prompting improves PII detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale sharing of dialogue-based tutoring data is hindered by PII detection systems over-redacting math content, reducing dataset utility. The paper aims to solve this 'numeric ambiguity' problem.

Method: The authors created MathEd-PII, a benchmark dataset of 1,000 tutoring sessions with validated PII annotations, using a human-in-the-loop LLM workflow. They tested four detection strategies, including Presidio and LLM-based approaches with varying prompts.

Result: Math-aware prompting outperformed the baseline (F1: 0.821 vs. 0.379) and reduced numeric false positives, proving domain context is crucial for utility-preserving de-identification.

Conclusion: Domain-aware modeling is essential for effective PII detection in math tutoring data, as demonstrated by the improved performance of math-aware prompting and the creation of the MathEd-PII benchmark.

Abstract: Large-scale sharing of dialogue-based data is instrumental for advancing the science of teaching and learning, yet rigorous de-identification remains a major barrier. In mathematics tutoring transcripts, numeric expressions frequently resemble structured identifiers (e.g., dates or IDs), leading generic Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection systems to over-redact core instructional content and reduce dataset utility. This work asks how PII can be detected in math tutoring transcripts while preserving their educational utility. To address this challenge, we investigate the "numeric ambiguity" problem and introduce MathEd-PII, the first benchmark dataset for PII detection in math tutoring dialogues, created through a human-in-the-loop LLM workflow that audits upstream redactions and generates privacy-preserving surrogates. The dataset contains 1,000 tutoring sessions (115,620 messages; 769,628 tokens) with validated PII annotations. Using a density-based segmentation method, we show that false PII redactions are disproportionately concentrated in math-dense regions, confirming numeric ambiguity as a key failure mode. We then compare four detection strategies: a Presidio baseline and LLM-based approaches with basic, math-aware, and segment-aware prompting. Math-aware prompting substantially improves performance over the baseline (F1: 0.821 vs. 0.379) while reducing numeric false positives, demonstrating that de-identification must incorporate domain context to preserve analytic utility. This work provides both a new benchmark and evidence that utility-preserving de-identification for tutoring data requires domain-aware modeling.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CitiLink-Summ, a corpus of European Portuguese municipal meeting minutes with manually written summaries, to advance automatic summarization research for administrative texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Municipal meeting minutes are dense and hard to navigate, especially in low-resource languages. A lack of high-quality datasets limits summarization model development.

Method: The paper presents CitiLink-Summ, a dataset of 100 documents and 2,322 summaries, and evaluates baseline summarization using models like BART, PRIMERA, and LLMs.

Result: Baseline results are established using lexical (ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR) and semantic (BERTScore) metrics.

Conclusion: CitiLink-Summ is the first benchmark for municipal-domain summarization in European Portuguese, aiding NLP research on administrative texts.

Abstract: Municipal meeting minutes are formal records documenting the discussions and decisions of local government, yet their content is often lengthy, dense, and difficult for citizens to navigate. Automatic summarization can help address this challenge by producing concise summaries for each discussion subject. Despite its potential, research on summarizing discussion subjects in municipal meeting minutes remains largely unexplored, especially in low-resource languages, where the inherent complexity of these documents adds further challenges. A major bottleneck is the scarcity of datasets containing high-quality, manually crafted summaries, which limits the development and evaluation of effective summarization models for this domain. In this paper, we present CitiLink-Summ, a new corpus of European Portuguese municipal meeting minutes, comprising 100 documents and 2,322 manually hand-written summaries, each corresponding to a distinct discussion subject. Leveraging this dataset, we establish baseline results for automatic summarization in this domain, employing state-of-the-art generative models (e.g., BART, PRIMERA) as well as large language models (LLMs), evaluated with both lexical and semantic metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore. CitiLink-Summ provides the first benchmark for municipal-domain summarization in European Portuguese, offering a valuable resource for advancing NLP research on complex administrative texts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pre-training multi-vector models like ColBERT-Zero outperforms single-vector models and achieves state-of-the-art results, highlighting the importance of full pre-training and fine-tuning alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to demonstrate the superiority of large-scale multi-vector pre-training over knowledge distillation from single-vector models.

Method: ColBERT-Zero is fully pre-trained on public data and evaluated against models like GTE-ModernColBERT, with comparisons made between KD and supervised pre-training steps.

Result: ColBERT-Zero outperforms models trained on closed data and achieves state-of-the-art performance for its size.

Conclusion: Full pre-training of multi-vector models is crucial for optimal performance, and fine-tuning alignment enhances results while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art multi-vector models are obtained through a small Knowledge Distillation (KD) training step on top of strong single-vector models, leveraging the large-scale pre-training of these models. In this paper, we study the pre-training of multi-vector models and show that large-scale multi-vector pre-training yields much stronger multi-vector models. Notably, a fully ColBERT-pre-trained model, ColBERT-Zero, trained only on public data, outperforms GTE-ModernColBERT as well as its base model, GTE-ModernBERT, which leverages closed and much stronger data, setting new state-of-the-art for model this size. We also find that, although performing only a small KD step is not enough to achieve results close to full pre-training, adding a supervised step beforehand allows to achieve much closer performance while skipping the most costly unsupervised phase. Finally, we find that aligning the fine-tuning and pre-training setups is crucial when repurposing existing models. To enable exploration of our results, we release various checkpoints as well as code used to train them.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AREG benchmarks LLMs' social intelligence via adversarial negotiation, revealing weak correlation between persuasion and resistance skills, with resistance generally outperforming persuasion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' social intelligence dynamically by evaluating both persuasion and resistance in adversarial interactions.

Method: Developed AREG, a multi-turn zero-sum negotiation game, and conducted a round-robin tournament with frontier models.

Result: Found weak correlation (ρ=0.33) between persuasion and resistance; resistance scores exceeded persuasion across models.

Conclusion: Social influence in LLMs is multifaceted; evaluation frameworks must account for asymmetric vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Evaluating the social intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly requires moving beyond static text generation toward dynamic, adversarial interaction. We introduce the Adversarial Resource Extraction Game (AREG), a benchmark that operationalizes persuasion and resistance as a multi-turn, zero-sum negotiation over financial resources. Using a round-robin tournament across frontier models, AREG enables joint evaluation of offensive (persuasion) and defensive (resistance) capabilities within a single interactional framework. Our analysis provides evidence that these capabilities are weakly correlated ($ρ= 0.33$) and empirically dissociated: strong persuasive performance does not reliably predict strong resistance, and vice versa. Across all evaluated models, resistance scores exceed persuasion scores, indicating a systematic defensive advantage in adversarial dialogue settings. Further linguistic analysis suggests that interaction structure plays a central role in these outcomes. Incremental commitment-seeking strategies are associated with higher extraction success, while verification-seeking responses are more prevalent in successful defenses than explicit refusal. Together, these findings indicate that social influence in LLMs is not a monolithic capability and that evaluation frameworks focusing on persuasion alone may overlook asymmetric behavioral vulnerabilities.

*Subrit Dikshit*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Quecto-V1 is a compact, domain-specific language model for Indian legal tasks, achieving high accuracy while being resource-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Democratize access to legal intelligence in resource-constrained environments and address data sovereignty risks.

Method: Built on GPT-2 (124M parameters), trained on Indian legal texts, and quantized to under 150MB.

Result: Outperforms general-purpose SLMs in legal tasks and runs efficiently on CPUs.

Conclusion: Domain-specific models with quantization offer privacy-preserving, viable alternatives to cloud-based LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) but has simultaneously created a "resource divide." State-of-the-art legal intelligence systems typically rely on massive parameter counts (7B+) and cloud-based inference, rendering them inaccessible to practitioners in resource-constrained environments and posing significant data sovereignty risks. This paper introduces Quecto-V1, a domain-specific Small Language Model (SLM) engineered to democratize access to Indian legal intelligence. Built upon a custom configuration of the GPT-2 architecture (124 million parameters), Quecto-V1 was trained from scratch exclusively on a corpus of Indian statutes, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and the Constitution of India. Unlike generalist models, which prioritize broad world knowledge, our approach maximizes "lexical density" within the legal domain. Furthermore, we address the deployment bottleneck by applying post-training 8-bit quantization (GGUF format), compressing the model to a memory footprint of under 150 MB. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that Quecto-V1 achieves high fidelity in retrieving statutory definitions and penal provisions, outperforming general-purpose SLMs in domain-specific exact match tasks while running entirely offline on consumer-grade CPUs. We further present an ablation study showing that 8-bit quantization yields a 74% reduction in model size with less than 3.5% degradation in retrieval accuracy compared to full-precision baselines. These findings suggest that for specialized, high-stakes domains like law, domain-specific training coupled with aggressive quantization offers a viable, privacy-preserving alternative to monolithic cloud models.

*Yuyan Bu,Xiaohao Liu,ZhaoXing Ren,Yaodong Yang,Juntao Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a resource-efficient method for multilingual safety alignment in LLMs, using a plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency loss to improve alignment across languages without needing additional supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable multilingual safety alignment in LLMs without requiring extensive resources.

Method: A plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency loss integrated into existing monolingual alignment pipelines to enhance multilingual semantic consistency.

Result: Improved multilingual safety alignment and cross-lingual generalization with minimal impact on model utility.

Conclusion: The proposed MLC loss offers a practical solution for multilingual consistency alignment under limited supervision.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) across linguistic communities necessitates reliable multilingual safety alignment. However, recent efforts to extend alignment to other languages often require substantial resources, either through large-scale, high-quality supervision in the target language or through pairwise alignment with high-resource languages, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient method for improving multilingual safety alignment. We introduce a plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency (MLC) loss that can be integrated into existing monolingual alignment pipelines. By improving collinearity between multilingual representation vectors, our method encourages directional consistency at the multilingual semantic level in a single update. This allows simultaneous alignment across multiple languages using only multilingual prompt variants without requiring additional response-level supervision in low-resource languages. We validate the proposed method across different model architectures and alignment paradigms, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing multilingual safety with limited impact on general model utility. Further evaluation across languages and tasks indicates improved cross-lingual generalization, suggesting the proposed approach as a practical solution for multilingual consistency alignment under limited supervision.

*Wenxuan Ding,Nicholas Tomlin,Greg Durrett*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can improve decision-making by explicitly reasoning about cost-uncertainty tradeoffs using the Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA) framework, leading to more optimal exploration in tasks like information retrieval and coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often need to interact with environments to solve complex problems, requiring them to balance the costs of exploration (e.g., testing code) against potential errors. Current approaches lack explicit reasoning about these tradeoffs.

Method: The paper introduces the Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA) framework, which provides LLMs with additional context (a prior) about the latent state of the environment, enabling them to reason about cost-uncertainty tradeoffs and act more optimally.

Result: CTA improves decision-making in LLMs, as demonstrated in information-seeking QA and a simplified coding task. The framework helps agents discover more optimal strategies, even under reinforcement learning training.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling cost-benefit tradeoffs via CTA enhances LLMs' ability to explore environments and make decisions, offering a promising direction for improving LLM performance in interactive tasks.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly being used for complex problems which are not necessarily resolved in a single response, but require interacting with an environment to acquire information. In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on a programming task, an LLM should test a generated code snippet if it is uncertain about the correctness of that code; the cost of writing a test is nonzero, but typically lower than the cost of making a mistake. In this work, we show that we can induce LLMs to explicitly reason about balancing these cost-uncertainty tradeoffs, then perform more optimal environment exploration. We formalize multiple tasks, including information retrieval and coding, as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Each problem has latent environment state that can be reasoned about via a prior which is passed to the LLM agent. We introduce a framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), where we feed the LLM this additional context to enable it to act more optimally. This improvement is preserved even under RL training of both the baseline and CTA. Our results on information-seeking QA and on a simplified coding task show that making cost-benefit tradeoffs explicit with CTA can help agents discover more optimal decision-making strategies.

*Hee Seung Hwang,Xindi Wu,Sanghyuk Chun,Olga Russakovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REFINE is a reinforcement learning framework that enhances fast weight models by optimizing for next-sequence prediction (NSP) instead of next-token prediction (NTP), improving long-context modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of next-token prediction (NTP) in fast weight architectures hinder their ability to capture long-range dependencies and semantic coherence. REFINE addresses this by introducing a reinforcement learning approach.

Method: REFINE uses next-sequence prediction (NSP), selects token positions based on entropy, generates multi-token rollouts, assigns sequence-level rewards, and optimizes with group relative policy optimization (GRPO).

Result: Experiments show REFINE outperforms supervised fine-tuning with NTP on tasks like needle-in-a-haystack retrieval and long-context question answering.

Conclusion: REFINE offers a versatile and effective framework for improving long-context modeling in fast weight architectures.

Abstract: Fast weight architectures offer a promising alternative to attention-based transformers for long-context modeling by maintaining constant memory overhead regardless of context length. However, their potential is limited by the next-token prediction (NTP) training paradigm. NTP optimizes single-token predictions and ignores semantic coherence across multiple tokens following a prefix. Consequently, fast weight models, which dynamically update their parameters to store contextual information, learn suboptimal representations that fail to capture long-range dependencies. We introduce REFINE (Reinforced Fast weIghts with Next sEquence prediction), a reinforcement learning framework that trains fast weight models under the next-sequence prediction (NSP) objective. REFINE selects informative token positions based on prediction entropy, generates multi-token rollouts, assigns self-supervised sequence-level rewards, and optimizes the model with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). REFINE is applicable throughout the training lifecycle of pre-trained language models: mid-training, post-training, and test-time training. Our experiments on LaCT-760M and DeltaNet-1.3B demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning with NTP across needle-in-a-haystack retrieval, long-context question answering, and diverse tasks in LongBench. REFINE provides an effective and versatile framework for improving long-context modeling in fast weight architectures.

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that combines nonlinear dynamics, perceptual psychophysics and high frequency haptic rendering to enhance realism in surgical simulation. The interaction of the surgical device with soft tissue is elevated to an augmented state space with a Koopman operator formulation, allowing linear prediction and control of the dynamics that are nonlinear by nature. To make the rendered forces consistent with human perceptual limits, we put forward a Bayesian calibration module based on WeberFechner and Stevens scaling laws, which progressively shape force signals relative to each individual's discrimination thresholds. For various simulated surgical tasks such as palpation, incision, and bone milling, the proposed system attains an average rendering latency of 4.3 ms, a force error of less than 2.8% and a 20% improvement in perceptual discrimination. Multivariate statistical analyses (MANOVA and regression) reveal that the system's performance is significantly better than that of conventional spring-damper and energy, based rendering methods. We end by discussing the potential impact on surgical training and VR, based medical education, as well as sketching future work toward closed, loop neural feedback in haptic interfaces.

### [110] [Memes-as-Replies: Can Models Select Humorous Manga Panel Responses?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15842)
*Ryosuke Kohita,Seiichiro Yoshioka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Meme Reply Selection task and the MaMe-Re benchmark, analyzing how memes are used in conversations and revealing gaps in LLMs' ability to understand contextual humor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the dynamic and contextual use of memes in creating humor, an understudied area in computational research.

Method: Introduces the Meme Reply Selection task and the MaMe-Re benchmark, consisting of 100,000 human-annotated pairs of manga panels and social media posts.

Result: LLMs show potential in capturing social cues like exaggeration but struggle with contextual humor and subtle wit differences. Visual information does not aid performance.

Conclusion: Selecting contextually humorous replies remains a challenge for current models, highlighting the gap in understanding and applying humor dynamically.

Abstract: Memes are a popular element of modern web communication, used not only as static artifacts but also as interactive replies within conversations. While computational research has focused on analyzing the intrinsic properties of memes, the dynamic and contextual use of memes to create humor remains an understudied area of web science. To address this gap, we introduce the Meme Reply Selection task and present MaMe-Re (Manga Meme Reply Benchmark), a benchmark of 100,000 human-annotated pairs (500,000 total annotations from 2,325 unique annotators) consisting of openly licensed Japanese manga panels and social media posts. Our analysis reveals three key insights: (1) large language models (LLMs) show preliminary evidence of capturing complex social cues such as exaggeration, moving beyond surface-level semantic matching; (2) the inclusion of visual information does not improve performance, revealing a gap between understanding visual content and effectively using it for contextual humor; (3) while LLMs can match human judgments in controlled settings, they struggle to distinguish subtle differences in wit among semantically similar candidates. These findings suggest that selecting contextually humorous replies remains an open challenge for current models.

### [111] [Kalman-Inspired Runtime Stability and Recovery in Hybrid Reasoning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15855)
*Barak Or*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores runtime stability in hybrid reasoning systems, focusing on detectability, bounded divergence, and recoverability under partial observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the gradual divergence of internal reasoning dynamics in hybrid systems, which often leads to failures under partial observability and evidence mismatch.

Method: Models reasoning as a stochastic inference process with cognitive drift, introducing a framework to monitor innovation statistics, detect instability, and trigger recovery mechanisms.

Result: Experiments show reliable instability detection before task failure and successful recovery to bounded behavior.

Conclusion: Runtime stability is crucial for reliable reasoning in uncertain environments, emphasizing system-level monitoring and control.

Abstract: Hybrid reasoning systems that combine learned components with model-based inference are increasingly deployed in tool-augmented decision loops, yet their runtime behavior under partial observability and sustained evidence mismatch remains poorly understood. In practice, failures often arise as gradual divergence of internal reasoning dynamics rather than as isolated prediction errors. This work studies runtime stability in hybrid reasoning systems from a Kalman-inspired perspective. We model reasoning as a stochastic inference process driven by an internal innovation signal and introduce cognitive drift as a measurable runtime phenomenon. Stability is defined in terms of detectability, bounded divergence, and recoverability rather than task-level correctness. We propose a runtime stability framework that monitors innovation statistics, detects emerging instability, and triggers recovery-aware control mechanisms. Experiments on multi-step, tool-augmented reasoning tasks demonstrate reliable instability detection prior to task failure and show that recovery, when feasible, re-establishes bounded internal behavior within finite time. These results emphasize runtime stability as a system-level requirement for reliable reasoning under uncertainty.

TL;DR: Automated optimization of GAMs using NSGA-II improves accuracy and interpretability, outperforming manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual configuration of GAMs is challenging; NSGA-II automates this to balance accuracy and interpretability.

Method: NSGA-II jointly optimizes prediction error (RMSE) and a Complexity Penalty for sparsity, smoothness, and uncertainty.

Result: NSGA-II improves GAMs, achieving better accuracy or matching it with lower complexity, enhancing interpretability.

Conclusion: This approach automates the creation of high-performing, interpretable GAMs, validated on real-world data.

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) balance predictive accuracy and interpretability, but manually configuring their structure is challenging. We propose using the multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-II to automatically optimize GAMs, jointly minimizing prediction error (RMSE) and a Complexity Penalty that captures sparsity, smoothness, and uncertainty. Experiments on the California Housing dataset show that NSGA-II discovers GAMs that outperform baseline LinearGAMs in accuracy or match performance with substantially lower complexity. The resulting models are simpler, smoother, and exhibit narrower confidence intervals, enhancing interpretability. This framework provides a general approach for automated optimization of transparent, high-performing models. The code can be found at https://github.com/KaaustaaubShankar/GeneticAdditiveModels.

*Mingchun Sun,Rongqiang Zhao,Zhennan Huang,Songyu Ding,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces IT-OSE, an information-theoretic method for estimating optimal sample size (OSS) in data augmentation, along with ICD score for evaluation, showing improved accuracy and reduced costs compared to empirical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lack of theoretical research and reliable metrics for OSS in data augmentation limits its effectiveness in industrial scenarios.

Method: Proposes IT-OSE for OSS estimation and ICD score for evaluation, theoretically analyzing OSS's relationship with dominant factors.

Result: IT-OSE improves classification accuracy by 4.38%, reduces regression MAPE by 18.80%, and cuts computational/data costs by ~84% and ~93% respectively.

Conclusion: IT-OSE offers a reliable, cost-effective solution for OSS estimation in industrial data augmentation, enhancing model performance and interpretability.

Abstract: In industrial scenarios, data augmentation is an effective approach to improve model performance. However, its benefits are not unidirectionally beneficial. There is no theoretical research or established estimation for the optimal sample size (OSS) in augmentation, nor is there an established metric to evaluate the accuracy of OSS or its deviation from the ground truth. To address these issues, we propose an information-theoretic optimal sample size estimation (IT-OSE) to provide reliable OSS estimation for industrial data augmentation. An interval coverage and deviation (ICD) score is proposed to evaluate the estimated OSS intuitively. The relationship between OSS and dominant factors is theoretically analyzed and formulated, thereby enhancing the interpretability. Experiments show that, compared to empirical estimation, the IT-OSE increases accuracy in classification tasks across baseline models by an average of 4.38%, and reduces MAPE in regression tasks across baseline models by an average of 18.80%. The improvements in downstream model performance are more stable. ICDdev in the ICD score is also reduced by an average of 49.30%. The determinism of OSS is enhanced. Compared to exhaustive search, the IT-OSE achieves the same OSS while reducing computational and data costs by an average of 83.97% and 93.46%. Furthermore, practicality experiments demonstrate that the IT-OSE exhibits generality across representative sensor-based industrial scenarios.

*Qing Yang,Yuhao Jiang,Rui Wang,Jipeng Guo,Yejiang Wang,Xinghe Cheng,Zezheng Wu,Jiapu Wang,Jingwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BamaER is a novel exercise recommendation framework that captures rich student interactions and long-term dependencies to improve personalized exercise selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook student behavioral interactions and fail to model long-term dependencies, leading to biased learning progress estimates.

Method: BamaER uses three modules: learning progress prediction (tri-directional encoding), memory-augmented knowledge tracing (dynamic memory matrix), and diversity-aware exercise filtering (Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm).

Result: BamaER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on five real-world datasets across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: BamaER effectively addresses limitations in current methods by integrating behavior-aware modeling and robust long-term dependency capture.

Abstract: Exercise recommendation focuses on personalized exercise selection conditioned on students' learning history, personal interests, and other individualized characteristics. Despite notable progress, most existing methods represent student learning solely as exercise sequences, overlooking rich behavioral interaction information. This limited representation often leads to biased and unreliable estimates of learning progress. Moreover, fixed-length sequence segmentation limits the incorporation of early learning experiences, thereby hindering the modeling of long-term dependencies and the accurate estimation of knowledge mastery. To address these limitations, we propose BamaER, a Behavior-aware memory-augmented Exercise Recommendation framework that comprises three core modules: (i) the learning progress prediction module that captures heterogeneous student interaction behaviors via a tri-directional hybrid encoding scheme; (ii) the memory-augmented knowledge tracing module that maintains a dynamic memory matrix to jointly model historical and current knowledge states for robust mastery estimation; and (iii) the exercise filtering module that formulates candidate selection as a diversity-aware optimization problem, solved via the Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm to reduce redundancy and improve recommendation coverage. Experiments on five real-world educational datasets show that BamaER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a range of evaluation metrics.

*Emile Anand,Richard Hoffmann,Sarah Liaw,Adam Wierman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GMFS introduces a Graphon Mean-Field Subsampling framework for scalable MARL with heterogeneous interactions, reducing complexity and maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of scaling MARL with heterogeneous agent interactions while avoiding computational bottlenecks.

Method: Subsampling κ agents based on interaction strength to approximate graphon-weighted mean-field policies.

Result: Achieves near-optimal performance with sample complexity poly(κ) and optimality gap O(1/√κ).

Conclusion: GMFS effectively balances scalability and performance in heterogeneous MARL.

Abstract: Coordinating large populations of interacting agents is a central challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the size of the joint state-action space scales exponentially with the number of agents. Mean-field methods alleviate this burden by aggregating agent interactions, but these approaches assume homogeneous interactions. Recent graphon-based frameworks capture heterogeneity, but are computationally expensive as the number of agents grows. Therefore, we introduce $\texttt{GMFS}$, a $\textbf{G}$raphon $\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield $\textbf{S}$ubsampling framework for scalable cooperative MARL with heterogeneous agent interactions. By subsampling $κ$ agents according to interaction strength, we approximate the graphon-weighted mean-field and learn a policy with sample complexity $\mathrm{poly}(κ)$ and optimality gap $O(1/\sqrtκ)$. We verify our theory with numerical simulations in robotic coordination, showing that $\texttt{GMFS}$ achieves near-optimal performance.

*Yixiao Qian,Jiaxu Liu,Zewei Xia,Song Chen,Chao Xu,Shengze Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a distributed PINNs framework for efficient flow reconstruction using spatiotemporal domain decomposition, addressing pressure indeterminacy and computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling PINNs to large domains faces computational bottlenecks and optimization instabilities, necessitating a robust distributed solution.

Method: A distributed PINNs framework with reference anchor normalization and decoupled asymmetric weighting ensures pressure uniqueness. High-performance training pipelines using CUDA graphs and JIT compilation reduce computational overhead.

Result: The method achieves near-linear strong scaling and high-fidelity reconstruction on complex flow benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable and physically rigorous approach for flow reconstruction and understanding complex hydrodynamics.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a powerful paradigm for flow reconstruction, seamlessly integrating sparse velocity measurements with the governing Navier-Stokes equations to recover complete velocity and latent pressure fields. However, scaling such models to large spatiotemporal domains is hindered by computational bottlenecks and optimization instabilities. In this work, we propose a robust distributed PINNs framework designed for efficient flow reconstruction via spatiotemporal domain decomposition. A critical challenge in such distributed solvers is pressure indeterminacy, where independent sub-networks drift into inconsistent local pressure baselines. We address this issue through a reference anchor normalization strategy coupled with decoupled asymmetric weighting. By enforcing a unidirectional information flow from designated master ranks where the anchor point lies to neighboring ranks, our approach eliminates gauge freedom and guarantees global pressure uniqueness while preserving temporal continuity. Furthermore, to mitigate the Python interpreter overhead associated with computing high-order physics residuals, we implement a high-performance training pipeline accelerated by CUDA graphs and JIT compilation. Extensive validation on complex flow benchmarks demonstrates that our method achieves near-linear strong scaling and high-fidelity reconstruction, establishing a scalable and physically rigorous pathway for flow reconstruction and understanding of complex hydrodynamics.

*Shumeng Chen,Jane E. Huggins,Tianwen Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semi-supervised learning framework for P300-based BCI spellers, reducing calibration time and improving efficiency compared to conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional BCI spellers require lengthy calibration, reducing efficiency. The study aims to minimize calibration effort while maintaining or improving performance.

Method: The proposed adaptive semi-supervised EM-GMM algorithm updates the binary classifier using minimal labeled calibration data.

Result: 9 out of 15 participants met accuracy thresholds, with 7 showing better performance using the adaptive method. ITR and BCI utility were evaluated.

Conclusion: The semi-supervised framework enhances spelling efficiency in real-time BCI systems, especially with limited labeled data.

Abstract: A P300 ERP-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) speller is an assistive communication tool. It searches for the P300 event-related potential (ERP) elicited by target stimuli, distinguishing it from the neural responses to non-target stimuli embedded in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Conventional methods require a lengthy calibration procedure to construct the binary classifier, which reduced overall efficiency. Thus, we proposed a unified framework with minimum calibration effort such that, given a small amount of labeled calibration data, we employed an adaptive semi-supervised EM-GMM algorithm to update the binary classifier. We evaluated our method based on character-level prediction accuracy, information transfer rate (ITR), and BCI utility. We applied calibration on training data and reported results on testing data. Our results indicate that, out of 15 participants, 9 participants exceed the minimum character-level accuracy of 0.7 using either on our adaptive method or the benchmark, and 7 out of these 9 participants showed that our adaptive method performed better than the benchmark. The proposed semi-supervised learning framework provides a practical and efficient alternative to improve the overall spelling efficiency in the real-time BCI speller system, particularly in contexts with limited labeled data.

*Zhi Sheng,Yuan Yuan,Guozhen Zhang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces R$^2$Energy, a benchmark for renewable energy forecasting using NWP data, highlighting the need for robustness in extreme weather and revealing a trade-off between model reliability and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing reliance on renewable energy and the challenges posed by extreme weather events necessitate robust forecasting models for grid stability.

Method: R$^2$Energy is a large-scale benchmark with 10.7M hourly records from 902 wind/solar stations in China, using a standardized NWP-assisted forecasting paradigm for fair comparisons.

Result: The study identifies a 'robustness gap' under extreme conditions, showing reliability depends on meteorological integration, not model complexity.

Conclusion: R$^2$Energy offers a structured approach to evaluate and improve forecasting models for critical power system applications.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of renewable energy, particularly wind and solar power, has made reliable forecasting critical for power system operations. While recent deep learning models have achieved strong average accuracy, the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven extreme weather events pose severe threats to grid stability and operational security. Consequently, developing robust forecasting models that can withstand volatile conditions has become a paramount challenge. In this paper, we present R$^2$Energy, a large-scale benchmark for NWP-assisted renewable energy forecasting. It comprises over 10.7 million high-fidelity hourly records from 902 wind and solar stations across four provinces in China, providing the diverse meteorological conditions necessary to capture the wide-ranging variability of renewable generation. We further establish a standardized, leakage-free forecasting paradigm that grants all models identical access to future Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) signals, enabling fair and reproducible comparison across state-of-the-art representative forecasting architectures. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we incorporate regime-wise evaluation with expert-aligned extreme weather annotations, uncovering a critical ``robustness gap'' typically obscured by average metrics. This gap reveals a stark robustness-complexity trade-off: under extreme conditions, a model's reliability is driven by its meteorological integration strategy rather than its architectural complexity. R$^2$Energy provides a principled foundation for evaluating and developing forecasting models for safety-critical power system applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces B-DENSE, a framework improving diffusion model efficiency by aligning multi-branch trajectories to reduce discretization errors and enhance image generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high inference latency and loss of structural information in diffusion models due to sparse supervision in distillation techniques.

Method: Proposes B-DENSE, a novel framework using multi-branch trajectory alignment, where student model branches map to teacher's intermediate steps for dense supervision.

Result: B-DENSE achieves superior image generation quality by learning to navigate the solution space early in training, outperforming baseline distillation methods.

Conclusion: B-DENSE effectively mitigates discretization errors and preserves structural information, advancing diffusion model performance in generative tasks.

Abstract: Inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics, diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling. However, their iterative sampling nature results in high inference latency. While recent distillation techniques accelerate sampling, they discard intermediate trajectory steps. This sparse supervision leads to a loss of structural information and introduces significant discretization errors. To mitigate this, we propose B-DENSE, a novel framework that leverages multi-branch trajectory alignment. We modify the student architecture to output $K$-fold expanded channels, where each subset corresponds to a specific branch representing a discrete intermediate step in the teacher's trajectory. By training these branches to simultaneously map to the entire sequence of the teacher's target timesteps, we enforce dense intermediate trajectory alignment. Consequently, the student model learns to navigate the solution space from the earliest stages of training, demonstrating superior image generation quality compared to baseline distillation frameworks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Thompson Sampling algorithms (TSCG and UTSCG) for clustered Gaussian Multi-Armed Bandit problems, showing improved regret bounds compared to standard TSG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address real-world problems like mmWave communications and portfolio management using clustered Gaussian rewards.

Method: Proposes TSCG for 2-level hierarchical structures and UTSCG for unimodal rewards, building on TSG.

Result: Achieves lower regret bounds than TSG, supported by theoretical proofs and numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms outperform TSG in clustered settings, offering practical benefits.

Abstract: We study a type of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems in which arms with a Gaussian reward feedback are clustered. Such an arm setting finds applications in many real-world problems, for example, mmWave communications and portfolio management with risky assets, as a result of the universality of the Gaussian distribution. Based on the Thompson Sampling algorithm with Gaussian prior (TSG) algorithm for the selection of the optimal arm, we propose our Thompson Sampling with Clustered arms under Gaussian prior (TSCG) specific to the 2-level hierarchical structure. We prove that by utilizing the 2-level structure, we can achieve a lower regret bound than we do with ordinary TSG. In addition, when the reward is Unimodal, we can reach an even lower bound on the regret by our Unimodal Thompson Sampling algorithm with Clustered Arms under Gaussian prior (UTSCG). Each of our proposed algorithms are accompanied by theoretical evaluation of the upper regret bound, and our numerical experiments confirm the advantage of our proposed algorithms.

*Riccardo De Santi,Kimon Protopapas,Ya-Ping Hsieh,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Flow Expander (FE), a method to adapt pre-trained flow models using verifiers to expand their sampling beyond limited data distributions while ensuring validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained flow models often generate samples from narrow data regions, limiting their usefulness for scientific discovery where broader valid designs are needed.

Method: FE uses verifier-constrained entropy maximization via mirror descent to globally and locally expand flow models.

Result: FE provably expands flow models, increasing diversity while preserving validity, supported by theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Conclusion: FE effectively addresses the limitation of narrow sampling in flow models, enhancing their applicability in scientific discovery tasks like molecular design.

Abstract: Flow and diffusion models are typically pre-trained on limited available data (e.g., molecular samples), covering only a fraction of the valid design space (e.g., the full molecular space). As a consequence, they tend to generate samples from only a narrow portion of the feasible domain. This is a fundamental limitation for scientific discovery applications, where one typically aims to sample valid designs beyond the available data distribution. To this end, we address the challenge of leveraging access to a verifier (e.g., an atomic bonds checker), to adapt a pre-trained flow model so that its induced density expands beyond regions of high data availability, while preserving samples validity. We introduce formal notions of strong and weak verifiers and propose algorithmic frameworks for global and local flow expansion via probability-space optimization. Then, we present Flow Expander (FE), a scalable mirror descent scheme that provably tackles both problems by verifier-constrained entropy maximization over the flow process noised state space. Next, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed method, and state convergence guarantees under both idealized and general assumptions. Ultimately, we empirically evaluate our method on both illustrative, yet visually interpretable settings, and on a molecular design task showcasing the ability of FE to expand a pre-trained flow model increasing conformer diversity while preserving validity.

TL;DR: The paper studies the emergence of capabilities in neural networks during training, focusing on geometric measures, scale invariance, and task-specific patterns, while highlighting prediction limitations and the role of pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanistic opacity of capability emergence during neural network training by analyzing geometric measures across model scales, tasks, and language models.

Method: Tracked five geometric measures across five model scales (405K-85M parameters), 120+ emergence events in eight algorithmic tasks, and three Pythia language models (160M-2.8B). Analyzed collapse patterns, representation geometry, and prediction limits.

Result: Found universal representation collapse to task-specific floors, top-down propagation contradicting bottom-up intuition, and a geometric hierarchy where representation geometry leads emergence. Prediction limits were identified, and Pythia showed replicated global patterns but no per-task precursor signals.

Conclusion: The paper provides a geometric anatomy of emergence and its boundary conditions, emphasizing understanding over prediction, and notes the misalignment of precursor signals in naturalistic pre-training.

Abstract: Capability emergence during neural network training remains mechanistically opaque. We track five geometric measures across five model scales (405K-85M parameters), 120+ emergence events in eight algorithmic tasks, and three Pythia language models (160M-2.8B). We find: (1) training begins with a universal representation collapse to task-specific floors that are scale-invariant across a 210X parameter range (e.g., modular arithmetic collapses to RANKME ~ 2.0 regardless of model size); (2) collapse propagates top-down through layers (32/32 task X model consistency), contradicting bottom-up feature-building intuition; (3) a geometric hierarchy in which representation geometry leads emergence (75-100% precursor rate for hard tasks), while the local learning coefficient is synchronous (0/24 precursor) and Hessian measures lag. We also delineate prediction limits: geometric measures encode coarse task difficulty but not fine-grained timing (within-class concordance 27%; when task ordering reverses across scales, prediction fails at 26%). On Pythia, global geometric patterns replicate but per-task precursor signals do not -- the precursor relationship requires task-training alignment that naturalistic pre-training does not provide. Our contribution is the geometric anatomy of emergence and its boundary conditions, not a prediction tool.

TL;DR: The paper introduces adaptive geodesic conformal prediction for Riemannian manifolds, improving coverage uniformity and reducing conditional coverage variability compared to Euclidean-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conformal prediction methods assume Euclidean output spaces and perform poorly on Riemannian manifolds, leading to poorly calibrated prediction regions.

Method: The proposed method replaces Euclidean residuals with geodesic nonconformity scores and normalizes them using a cross-validated difficulty estimator to handle heteroscedastic noise.

Result: Prediction regions are geodesic caps on spheres with position-independent area, adapting to local difficulty. Tests on synthetic and real-world data show improved coverage uniformity.

Conclusion: The adaptive method outperforms non-adaptive alternatives, reducing conditional coverage variability and improving worst-case coverage.

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides distribution-free coverage guaranties for regression; yet existing methods assume Euclidean output spaces and produce prediction regions that are poorly calibrated when responses lie on Riemannian manifolds. We propose \emph{adaptive geodesic conformal prediction}, a framework that replaces Euclidean residuals with geodesic nonconformity scores and normalizes them by a cross-validated difficulty estimator to handle heteroscedastic noise. The resulting prediction regions, geodesic caps on the sphere, have position-independent area and adapt their size to local prediction difficulty, yielding substantially more uniform conditional coverage than non-adaptive alternatives. In a synthetic sphere experiment with strong heteroscedasticity and a real-world geomagnetic field forecasting task derived from IGRF-14 satellite data, the adaptive method markedly reduces conditional coverage variability and raises worst-case coverage much closer to the nominal level, while coordinate-based baselines waste a large fraction of coverage area due to chart distortion.

Result: Benchmarked favorably against state-of-the-art generative models and rule-based methods, with integration of machine learning potential for accelerated predictions.

Conclusion: MolCrystalFlow advances data-driven generative discovery of molecular crystals, demonstrating effective prediction capabilities.

Abstract: Molecular crystal structure prediction represents a grand challenge in computational chemistry due to large sizes of constituent molecules and complex intra- and intermolecular interactions. While generative modeling has revolutionized structure discovery for molecules, inorganic solids, and metal-organic frameworks, extending such approaches to fully periodic molecular crystals is still elusive. Here, we present MolCrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model for molecular crystal structure prediction. The framework disentangles intramolecular complexity from intermolecular packing by embedding molecules as rigid bodies and jointly learning the lattice matrix, molecular orientations, and centroid positions. Centroids and orientations are represented on their native Riemannian manifolds, allowing geodesic flow construction and graph neural network operations that respects geometric symmetries. We benchmark our model against state-of-the-art generative models for large-size periodic crystals and rule-based structure generation methods on two open-source molecular crystal datasets. We demonstrate an integration of MolCrystalFlow model with universal machine learning potential to accelerate molecular crystal structure prediction, paving the way for data-driven generative discovery of molecular crystals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML benchmarks ignore environmental impacts like energy and carbon emissions, misaligning with real-world deployment needs.

Method: Proposes AI-CARE for reporting energy and carbon costs, and introduces a carbon-performance tradeoff curve.

Result: Demonstrates that carbon-aware benchmarking alters model rankings, promoting accuracy and environmental responsibility.

Conclusion: AI-CARE aims to shift ML evaluation toward transparency and sustainability.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) continues its rapid expansion, the environmental cost of model training and inference has become a critical societal concern. Existing benchmarks overwhelmingly focus on standard performance metrics such as accuracy, BLEU, or mAP, while largely ignoring energy consumption and carbon emissions. This single-objective evaluation paradigm is increasingly misaligned with the practical requirements of large-scale deployment, particularly in energy-constrained environments such as mobile devices, developing regions, and climate-aware enterprises. In this paper, we propose AI-CARE, an evaluation tool for reporting energy consumption, and carbon emissions of ML models. In addition, we introduce the carbon-performance tradeoff curve, an interpretable tool that visualizes the Pareto frontier between performance and carbon cost. We demonstrate, through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on representative ML workloads, that carbon-aware benchmarking changes the relative ranking of models and encourages architectures that are simultaneously accurate and environmentally responsible. Our proposal aims to shift the research community toward transparent, multi-objective evaluation and align ML progress with global sustainability goals.

Motivation: Traditional speculative decoding struggles with MoE models due to high memory pressure from activating many experts, reducing speed gains.

Method: MoE-Spec enforces a fixed expert capacity limit per layer, prioritizing high-impact experts and dropping rarely used ones to reduce memory overhead.

Result: MoE-Spec achieves 10-30% higher throughput than baseline methods (e.g., EAGLE-3) while maintaining comparable quality, with adjustable accuracy-latency trade-offs.

Conclusion: MoE-Spec effectively addresses MoE-specific bottlenecks in speculative decoding, offering scalable performance improvements.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by verifying multiple drafted tokens in parallel. However, for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, this parallelism introduces a severe bottleneck: large draft trees activate many unique experts, significantly increasing memory pressure and diminishing speedups from speculative decoding relative to autoregressive decoding. Prior methods reduce speculation depth when MoE verification becomes expensive. We propose MoE-Spec, a training-free verification-time expert budgeting method that decouples speculation depth from memory cost by enforcing a fixed expert capacity limit at each layer, loading only the experts that contribute most to verification and dropping the long tail of rarely used experts that drive bandwidth overhead. Experiments across multiple model scales and datasets show that this method yields 10--30\% higher throughput than state-of-the-art speculative decoding baselines (EAGLE-3) at comparable quality, with flexibility to trade accuracy for further latency reductions through tighter budgets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-objective alignment framework (MODPO) for AI mental health therapy, balancing patient preferences and clinical safety. It outperforms single-objective approaches and general communication principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing workforce shortages and cost constraints in mental health care, the study explores AI's therapeutic potential by aligning patient preferences with clinical safety.

Method: Surveying 335 individuals with mental health experience, the authors develop MODPO using direct preference optimization, training reward models for six therapeutic criteria.

Result: MODPO achieves better balance (77.6% empathy, 62.6% safety) than single-objective optimization (93.6% empathy, 47.8% safety) and outperforms general principles by 17.2%. Clinicians prefer MODPO consistently.

Conclusion: MODPO effectively balances therapeutic criteria, offering a promising AI solution for mental health care.

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect over 1 billion people worldwide, yet access to care remains limited by workforce shortages and cost constraints. While AI systems show therapeutic promise, current alignment approaches optimize objectives independently, failing to balance patient preferences with clinical safety. We survey 335 individuals with lived mental health experience to collect preference rankings across therapeutic dimensions, then develop a multi-objective alignment framework using direct preference optimization. We train reward models for six criteria -- empathy, safety, active listening, self-motivated change, trust/rapport, and patient autonomy -- and systematically compare multi-objective approaches against single-objective optimization, supervised fine-tuning, and parameter merging. Multi-objective DPO (MODPO) achieves superior balance (77.6% empathy, 62.6% safety) compared to single-objective optimization (93.6% empathy, 47.8% safety), and therapeutic criteria outperform general communication principles by 17.2%. Blinded clinician evaluation confirms MODPO is consistently preferred, with LLM-evaluator agreement comparable to inter-clinician reliability.

*Dawon Ahn,Het Patel,Aemal Khattak,Jia Chen,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-view tensor decomposition framework is proposed to analyze driver behavior at railway crossings across three temporal phases, revealing location as a key determinant of behavior patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods analyze railway crossings individually, missing shared behavioral patterns. The study aims to identify these patterns across multiple locations and temporal phases to improve safety interventions.

Method: The framework uses TimeSformer embeddings from railway crossing videos to represent three phases (Approach, Waiting, Clearance). Phase-specific similarity matrices are constructed, and non-negative symmetric CP decomposition is applied to discover latent behavioral components.

Result: Results show that crossing location is a stronger determinant of behavior than time of day, with approach-phase behavior being particularly discriminative. Visualization confirms location-based clustering of crossings.

Conclusion: The automated framework enables scalable pattern discovery across crossings, aiding in grouping locations by behavioral similarity for targeted safety measures.

Abstract: Railway crossings present complex safety challenges where driver behavior varies by location, time, and conditions. Traditional approaches analyze crossings individually, limiting the ability to identify shared behavioral patterns across locations. We propose a multi-view tensor decomposition framework that captures behavioral similarities across three temporal phases: Approach (warning activation to gate lowering), Waiting (gates down to train passage), and Clearance (train passage to gate raising). We analyze railway crossing videos from multiple locations using TimeSformer embeddings to represent each phase. By constructing phase-specific similarity matrices and applying non-negative symmetric CP decomposition, we discover latent behavioral components with distinct temporal signatures. Our tensor analysis reveals that crossing location appears to be a stronger determinant of behavior patterns than time of day, and that approach-phase behavior provides particularly discriminative signatures. Visualization of the learned component space confirms location-based clustering, with certain crossings forming distinct behavioral clusters. This automated framework enables scalable pattern discovery across multiple crossings, providing a foundation for grouping locations by behavioral similarity to inform targeted safety interventions.

*Kevin Wang,Hongqian Niu,Didong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines recursive training of generative AI models using mixed human and AI-generated data, showing convergence despite data contamination, unlike prior simplified models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of recursive training with AI-generated data contamination on model performance, addressing gaps in existing theoretical work that oversimplifies data distributions.

Method: Studied recursive training in a general framework with minimal assumptions on real data distribution, allowing generative models to be universal approximators. Analyzed convergence rates and extended to settings with sampling bias.

Result: Contaminated recursive training converges, with rate equal to the minimum of the baseline model's convergence rate and the fraction of real data used per iteration. Empirical studies support findings.

Conclusion: The study provides the first positive theoretical result on recursive training without restrictive data assumptions, offering insights for real-world applications.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as large language models (LLMs), has become a transformative force across science, industry, and society. As these systems grow in popularity, web data becomes increasingly interwoven with this AI-generated material and it is increasingly difficult to separate them from naturally generated content. As generative models are updated regularly, later models will inevitably be trained on mixtures of human-generated data and AI-generated data from earlier versions, creating a recursive training process with data contamination. Existing theoretical work has examined only highly simplified settings, where both the real data and the generative model are discrete or Gaussian, where it has been shown that such recursive training leads to model collapse. However, real data distributions are far more complex, and modern generative models are far more flexible than Gaussian and linear mechanisms. To fill this gap, we study recursive training in a general framework with minimal assumptions on the real data distribution and allow the underlying generative model to be a general universal approximator. In this framework, we show that contaminated recursive training still converges, with a convergence rate equal to the minimum of the baseline model's convergence rate and the fraction of real data used in each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first (positive) theoretical result on recursive training without distributional assumptions on the data. We further extend the analysis to settings where sampling bias is present in data collection and support all theoretical results with empirical studies.

TL;DR: Omni-iEEG is a large-scale, standardized iEEG dataset addressing challenges in epilepsy research, offering harmonized metadata, expert-validated annotations, and clinically relevant benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of inconsistent datasets and lack of standardization in epilepsy research, enabling reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable studies.

Method: Developed Omni-iEEG by reconciling heterogeneous iEEG formats and metadata from publicly available sources, including harmonized clinical metadata and expert-validated annotations.

Result: Created a dataset with 302 patients and 178 hours of recordings, featuring 36K expert-validated annotations and standardized benchmarks for clinical relevance.

Conclusion: Omni-iEEG bridges machine learning and epilepsy research, supporting robust biomarker studies and reproducible, clinically meaningful evaluations.

Abstract: Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, and one-third of patients suffer drug-resistant seizures where surgery offers the best chance of seizure freedom. Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains. Together, these contributions establish Omni-iEEG as a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research.

*Patrick Pynadath,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AO-ARMs use two-stream attention for efficiency, but its success may stem from balancing semantic and structural tradeoffs in generation, not just position-content separation. Decoupled RoPE, a modified position embedding, supports this view.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying role of two-stream attention in AO-ARMs beyond the common assumption of decoupling token content from position.

Method: Proposed Decoupled RoPE, a modified rotary position embedding, to test whether the semantic-structural tradeoff in any-order generation explains the effectiveness of two-stream attention.

Result: Decoupled RoPE performs well at short sequence lengths but degrades with longer sequences, suggesting two-stream attention addresses deeper tradeoffs.

Conclusion: Two-stream attention's success lies in navigating the structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation, not just separating position from content.

Abstract: Any-order autoregressive models (AO-ARMs) offer a promising path toward efficient masked diffusion by enabling native key-value caching, but competitive performance has so far required two-stream attention, typically motivated as a means of decoupling token content from position. In this work, we argue that two-stream attention may be serving a more subtle role. We identify a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation: the hidden representation at each step must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization, objectives that compete for attention capacity in a single stream but can specialize across two streams. To isolate this tradeoff from position-content separation, we propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths--where semantic and structural proximity coincide--but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. These results suggest that the success of two-stream attention stems not merely from separating position from content, but from circumventing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reliable and cost-effective maintenance is essential for railway safety, particularly at the wheel-rail interface, which is prone to wear and failure. Predictive maintenance frameworks increasingly leverage sensor-generated time-series data, yet traditional methods require manual feature engineering, and deep learning models often degrade in online settings with evolving operational patterns. This work presents a semantic-aware, label-efficient continual learning framework for railway fault diagnostics. Accelerometer signals are encoded via a Variational AutoEncoder into latent representations capturing the normal operational structure in a fully unsupervised manner. Importantly, semantic metadata, including axle counts, wheel indexes, and strain-based deformations, is extracted via AI-driven peak detection on fiber Bragg grating sensors (resistant to electromagnetic interference) and fused with the VAE embeddings, enhancing anomaly detection under unknown operational conditions. A lightweight gradient boosting supervised classifier stabilizes anomaly scoring with minimal labels, while a replay-based continual learning strategy enables adaptation to evolving domains without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show the model detects minor imperfections due to flats and polygonization, while adapting to evolving operational conditions, such as changes in train type, speed, load, and track profiles, captured using a single accelerometer and strain gauge in wayside monitoring.

TL;DR: A computational pipeline for analyzing shape graph datasets is introduced, focusing on both connectivity and geometric differences using curated features for tasks like group comparison and clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To statistically analyze shape graph datasets by capturing both connectivity and geometric variations, addressing limitations of traditional abstract graph methods.

Method: Extracts topological, geometric, and directional features with key invariance properties for tasks like group comparison, clustering, and classification.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on real-world datasets (urban networks, neuronal traces, astrocyte imaging) and outperformed alternative methods.

Conclusion: The proposed feature-based approach effectively analyzes shape graphs, outperforming existing methods in capturing geometric and topological variations.

Abstract: This paper introduces and demonstrates a computational pipeline for the statistical analysis of shape graph datasets, namely geometric networks embedded in 2D or 3D spaces. Unlike traditional abstract graphs, our purpose is not only to retrieve and distinguish variations in the connectivity structure of the data but also geometric differences of the network branches. Our proposed approach relies on the extraction of a specifically curated and explicit set of topological, geometric and directional features, designed to satisfy key invariance properties. We leverage the resulting feature representation for tasks such as group comparison, clustering and classification on cohorts of shape graphs. The effectiveness of this representation is evaluated on several real-world datasets including urban road/street networks, neuronal traces and astrocyte imaging. These results are benchmarked against several alternative methods, both feature-based and not.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the importance of selecting relevant data sources for joint learning to achieve optimal subspace estimation, even by discarding less useful data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of low-relevance or poor-quality data sources hindering representation learning, the study focuses on identifying and using only the most informative subsets.

Method: The research adopts a linear setting where sources share a low-dimensional subspace, develops algorithms for source screening, and validates through theory and experiments.

Result: Training on carefully selected subsets of sources achieves minimax optimality, demonstrating effectiveness in synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Source screening is crucial for optimal subspace estimation, and selective training can outperform using all available data.

Abstract: Learning with shared representation is widely recognized as an effective way to separate commonalities from heterogeneity across various heterogeneous sources. Most existing work includes all related data sources via simultaneously training a common feature extractor and source-specific heads. It is well understood that data sources with low relevance or poor quality may hinder representation learning. In this paper, we further dive into the question of which data sources should be learned jointly by focusing on the traditionally deemed ``good'' collection of sources, in which individual sources have similar relevance and qualities with respect to the true underlying common structure. Towards tractability, we focus on the linear setting where sources share a low-dimensional subspace. We find that source screening can play a central role in statistically optimal subspace estimation. We show that, for a broad class of problem instances, training on a carefully selected subset of sources suffices to achieve minimax optimality, even when a substantial portion of data is discarded. We formalize the notion of an informative subpopulation, develop algorithms and practical heuristics for identifying such subsets, and validate their effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets.

*Mohammed Zain Ali Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to generate random graphs with correlated node features, challenging previous studies that overlooked such correlations and underestimated GNN expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on GNN convergence often ignore node feature correlations, which are common in real-life graphs, leading to inaccurate conclusions about GNN limitations.

Method: A novel method to generate random graphs with correlated node features, inspired by real-life graph properties, particularly the Barabási-Albert model.

Result: Theoretical and empirical evidence shows that convergence can be avoided in some cases, suggesting GNNs are more expressive than previously thought.

Conclusion: The findings highlight that GNNs may have greater expressive power on realistic graphs, contrary to earlier studies that overlooked feature correlations.

Abstract: There are a number of existing studies analysing the convergence behaviour of graph neural networks on large random graphs. Unfortunately, the majority of these studies do not model correlations between node features, which would naturally exist in a variety of real-life networks. Consequently, the derived limitations of GNNs, resulting from such convergence behaviour, is not truly reflective of the expressive power of GNNs when applied to realistic graphs. In this paper, we will introduce a novel method to generate random graphs that have correlated node features. The node features will be sampled in such a manner to ensure correlation between neighbouring nodes. As motivation for our choice of sampling scheme, we will appeal to properties exhibited by real-life graphs, particularly properties that are captured by the Barabási-Albert model. A theoretical analysis will strongly indicate that convergence can be avoided in some cases, which we will empirically validate on large random graphs generated using our novel method. The observed divergent behaviour provides evidence that GNNs may be more expressive than initial studies would suggest, especially on realistic graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of cross-subject generalization in EEG-based BCIs by leveraging spectral features' stability compared to temporal waveforms.

Method: Introduces ASPEN, a hybrid architecture that fuses spectral and temporal features via multiplicative interaction to ensure cross-modal agreement.

Result: ASPEN achieves top unseen-subject accuracy on 3/6 datasets and competitive results elsewhere, optimizing spectral-temporal balance per paradigm.

Conclusion: Multiplicative multimodal fusion in ASPEN effectively enables cross-subject generalization in EEG-based BCIs.

Abstract: Cross-subject generalization in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains challenging due to individual variability in neural signals. We investigate whether spectral representations offer more stable features for cross-subject transfer than temporal waveforms. Through correlation analyses across three EEG paradigms (SSVEP, P300, and Motor Imagery), we find that spectral features exhibit consistently higher cross-subject similarity than temporal signals. Motivated by this observation, we introduce ASPEN, a hybrid architecture that combines spectral and temporal feature streams via multiplicative fusion, requiring cross-modal agreement for features to propagate. Experiments across six benchmark datasets reveal that ASPEN is able to dynamically achieve the optimal spectral-temporal balance depending on the paradigm. ASPEN achieves the best unseen-subject accuracy on three of six datasets and competitive performance on others, demonstrating that multiplicative multimodal fusion enables effective cross-subject generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gap in Differential Privacy (DP) applied to Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) by introducing novel methods DP Double-Spider and DP Recursive-Spider, achieving improved utility bounds under non-convex loss and ψ-divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ERM struggles with distribution shifts, imbalances, and adversarial perturbations. DRO offers robustness, but DP-DRO remains understudied due to its complex minimax structure.

Method: The paper reformulates DRO with ψ-divergence as minimization, proposes DP Double-Spider, and improves utility for specific divergences (e.g., KL-divergence) using DP Recursive-Spider.

Result: Achieves utility bounds like O(1/√n + (√d log(1/δ)/nε)^(2/3)) for gradient norm, matching non-convex DP-ERM rates for KL-divergence. Experimental results show superiority over existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DP-DRO methods effectively bridge the gap, offering robust and privacy-preserving solutions with competitive utility bounds.

Abstract: Real-world deployments routinely face distribution shifts, group imbalances, and adversarial perturbations, under which the traditional Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework can degrade severely.
  Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this issue by optimizing the worst-case expected loss over an uncertainty set of distributions, offering a principled approach to robustness.
  Meanwhile, as training data in DRO always involves sensitive information, safeguarding it against leakage under Differential Privacy (DP) is essential.
  In contrast to classical DP-ERM, DP-DRO has received much less attention due to its minimax optimization structure with uncertainty constraint.
  To bridge the gap, we provide a comprehensive study of DP-(finite-sum)-DRO with $ψ$-divergence and non-convex loss.
  First, we study DRO with general $ψ$-divergence by reformulating it as a minimization problem, and develop a novel $(\varepsilon, δ)$-DP optimization method, called DP Double-Spider, tailored to this structure.
  Under mild assumptions, we show that it achieves a utility bound of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+ (\frac{\sqrt{d \log (1/δ)}}{n \varepsilon})^{2/3})$ in terms of the gradient norm, where $n$ denotes the data size and $d$ denotes the model dimension.
  We further improve the utility rate for specific divergences.
  In particular, for DP-DRO with KL-divergence, by transforming the problem into a compositional finite-sum optimization problem, we develop a DP Recursive-Spider method and show that it achieves a utility bound of $\mathcal{O}((\frac{\sqrt{d \log(1/δ)}}{n\varepsilon})^{2/3} )$, matching the best-known result for non-convex DP-ERM.
  Experimentally, we demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform existing approaches for DP minimax optimization.

TL;DR: HiPER is a hierarchical RL framework for training LLMs in multi-turn decision-making, improving performance in sparse-reward settings by separating planning and execution roles and using hierarchical advantage estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in training LLMs for long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, where flat policies struggle with credit assignment and stability.

Method: HiPER introduces a hierarchical approach with a planner proposing subgoals and an executor carrying them out, enhanced by hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE) for efficient credit assignment.

Result: HiPER achieved state-of-the-art results: 97.4% success on ALFWorld and 83.3% on WebShop, outperforming previous methods by 6.6% and 8.3%.

Conclusion: Explicit hierarchical decomposition is crucial for scalable RL training of multi-turn LLM agents, as demonstrated by HiPER's superior performance.

Abstract: Training LLMs as interactive agents for multi-turn decision-making remains challenging, particularly in long-horizon tasks with sparse and delayed rewards, where agents must execute extended sequences of actions before receiving meaningful feedback. Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment.
  We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation.
  Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\% and +8.3\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks. These results highlight the importance of explicit hierarchical decomposition for scalable RL training of multi-turn LLM agents.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpecMuon, a spectral-aware optimizer, improves physics-informed learning by combining Muon's orthogonalized updates with adaptive step size regulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ill-conditioned gradients and stiffness in physics-informed neural networks and neural operators.

Method: Integrates Muon's orthogonalized updates with a mode-wise relaxed scalar auxiliary variable (RSAV) mechanism.

Result: Faster convergence and improved stability compared to Adam, AdamW, and Muon.

Conclusion: SpecMuon offers rigorous theoretical guarantees and outperforms existing optimizers in physics-informed learning tasks.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks and neural operators often suffer from severe optimization difficulties caused by ill-conditioned gradients, multi-scale spectral behavior, and stiffness induced by physical constraints. Recently, the Muon optimizer has shown promise by performing orthogonalized updates in the singular-vector basis of the gradient, thereby improving geometric conditioning. However, its unit-singular-value updates may lead to overly aggressive steps and lack explicit stability guarantees when applied to physics-informed learning. In this work, we propose SpecMuon, a spectral-aware optimizer that integrates Muon's orthogonalized geometry with a mode-wise relaxed scalar auxiliary variable (RSAV) mechanism. By decomposing matrix-valued gradients into singular modes and applying RSAV updates individually along dominant spectral directions, SpecMuon adaptively regulates step sizes according to the global loss energy while preserving Muon's scale-balancing properties. This formulation interprets optimization as a multi-mode gradient flow and enables principled control of stiff spectral components. We establish rigorous theoretical properties of SpecMuon, including a modified energy dissipation law, positivity and boundedness of auxiliary variables, and global convergence with a linear rate under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Numerical experiments on physics-informed neural networks, DeepONets, and fractional PINN-DeepONets demonstrate that SpecMuon achieves faster convergence and improved stability compared with Adam, AdamW, and the original Muon optimizer on benchmark problems such as the one-dimensional Burgers equation and fractional partial differential equations.

TL;DR: DSL improves MDLM/ReMDM efficiency by training a single SNR-invariant denoiser, achieving better quality with fewer steps and matching autoregressive performance at high budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address error accumulation and distribution shift in iterative refinement for NAR generation, particularly in masked diffusion language models.

Method: Proposes DSL, which trains a single SNR-invariant denoiser across various corruption levels, integrating draft noise and mask-style corruption in one Diffusion Transformer.

Result: DSL fine-tuning achieves significant MAUVE gains with ∼4× fewer denoiser evaluations and matches autoregressive quality at high step budgets.

Conclusion: DSL enhances compute efficiency in remasking, improving self-correction and uncertainty calibration in MDLM/ReMDM sampling.

Abstract: Non-autoregressive (NAR) generation reduces decoding latency by predicting many tokens in parallel, but iterative refinement often suffers from error accumulation and distribution shift under self-generated drafts. Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) and their remasking samplers (e.g., ReMDM) can be viewed as modern NAR iterative refinement, where generation repeatedly revises a partially observed draft. In this work we show that \emph{training alone} can substantially improve the step-efficiency of MDLM/ReMDM sampling. We propose \textsc{DSL} (Discrete Stochastic Localization), which trains a single SNR-invariant denoiser across a continuum of corruption levels, bridging intermediate draft noise and mask-style endpoint corruption within one Diffusion Transformer. On OpenWebText, \textsc{DSL} fine-tuning yields large MAUVE gains at low step budgets, surpassing the MDLM+ReMDM baseline with \(\sim\)4$\times$ fewer denoiser evaluations, and matches autoregressive quality at high budgets. Analyses show improved self-correction and uncertainty calibration, making remasking markedly more compute-efficient.

TL;DR: A federated learning framework for energy theft detection using lightweight MLP and differential privacy, balancing performance and privacy in smart grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy theft undermines smart grids, and traditional centralized methods risk privacy and face computational limits in resource-constrained smart meters.

Method: Lightweight MLP model with federated learning and differential privacy (Gaussian noise in updates) for privacy-preserving theft detection.

Result: Competitive accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores on real-world data (IID and non-IID), ensuring privacy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is practical and scalable for secure energy theft detection in smart grids.

Abstract: Energy theft poses a significant threat to the stability and efficiency of smart grids, leading to substantial economic losses and operational challenges. Traditional centralized machine learning approaches for theft detection require aggregating user data, raising serious concerns about privacy and data security. These issues are further exacerbated in smart meter environments, where devices are often resource-constrained and lack the capacity to run heavy models. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection that addresses both privacy and computational constraints. Our approach leverages a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, suitable for deployment on low-power smart meters, and integrates basic differential privacy (DP) by injecting Gaussian noise into local model updates before aggregation. This ensures formal privacy guarantees without compromising learning performance. We evaluate our framework on a real-world smart meter dataset under both IID and non-IID data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores while maintaining privacy and efficiency. This makes the proposed solution practical and scalable for secure energy theft detection in next-generation smart grid infrastructures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TPC introduces Temporal-Prior Conditioning to treat time as a first-class modality, improving temporal reasoning in LLM-for-time series models by conditioning at multiple depths, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-for-time series methods treat time shallowly, limiting temporal reasoning as temporal information degrades through layers.

Method: TPC attaches learnable time series tokens to the patch stream, cross-attending to temporal embeddings at selected layers, and feeds temporal context back via self-attention.

Result: TPC outperforms full fine-tuning and shallow conditioning strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting.

Conclusion: TPC effectively disentangles time series signal and temporal information while maintaining low parameter costs, proving superior performance.

Abstract: LLM-for-time series (TS) methods typically treat time shallowly, injecting positional or prompt-based cues once at the input of a largely frozen decoder, which limits temporal reasoning as this information degrades through the layers. We introduce Temporal-Prior Conditioning (TPC), which elevates time to a first-class modality that conditions the model at multiple depths. TPC attaches a small set of learnable time series tokens to the patch stream; at selected layers these tokens cross-attend to temporal embeddings derived from compact, human-readable temporal descriptors encoded by the same frozen LLM, then feed temporal context back via self-attention. This disentangles time series signal and temporal information while maintaining a low parameter budget. We show that by training only the cross-attention modules and explicitly disentangling time series signal and temporal information, TPC consistently outperforms both full fine-tuning and shallow conditioning strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: GC-PINN introduces geometric compactification mappings to improve convergence and accuracy in solving multi-scale PDEs with PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PINNs struggle with gradient stiffness and ill-conditioning due to fixed coordinate systems misaligned with PDE structures.

Method: GC-PINN uses differentiable geometric mappings (periodic boundaries, far-field expansion, localized singularities) without altering PINN architecture.

Result: The approach achieves uniform residual distributions, higher accuracy, and better training stability on 1D and 2D PDEs.

Conclusion: GC-PINN enhances PINN performance by aligning geometric structures with PDE spectral properties.

Abstract: Several complex physical systems are governed by multi-scale partial differential equations (PDEs) that exhibit both smooth low-frequency components and localized high-frequency structures. Existing physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods typically train with fixed coordinate system inputs, where geometric misalignment with these structures induces gradient stiffness and ill-conditioning that hinder convergence. To address this issue, we introduce a mapping paradigm that reshapes the input coordinates through differentiable geometric compactification mappings and couples the geometric structure of PDEs with the spectral properties of residual operators. Based on this paradigm, we propose Geometric Compactification (GC)-PINN, a framework that introduces three mapping strategies for periodic boundaries, far-field scale expansion, and localized singular structures in the input domain without modifying the underlying PINN architecture. Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that this approach yields more uniform residual distributions and higher solution accuracy on representative 1D and 2D PDEs, while improving training stability and convergence speed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ModalImmune is a training framework that improves multimodal systems' resilience to modality loss by intentionally collapsing selected modalities during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal systems often suffer from unreliable performance due to partial or complete loss of input channels in real-world settings.

Method: The framework includes a collapse regularizer, information-gain controller, gradient masking, and a hyper-gradient procedure for meta-parameter adaptation.

Result: Empirical tests show ModalImmune enhances resilience to modality removal/corruption while maintaining stability and reconstruction capacity.

Conclusion: ModalImmune effectively addresses modality loss issues in multimodal systems through robust training techniques.

Abstract: Multimodal systems are vulnerable to partial or complete loss of input channels at deployment, which undermines reliability in real-world settings. This paper presents ModalImmune, a training framework that enforces modality immunity by intentionally and controllably collapsing selected modality information during training so the model learns joint representations that are robust to destructive modality influence. The framework combines a spectrum-adaptive collapse regularizer, an information-gain guided controller for targeted interventions, curvature-aware gradient masking to stabilize destructive updates, and a certified Neumann-truncated hyper-gradient procedure for automatic meta-parameter adaptation. Empirical evaluation on standard multimodal benchmarks demonstrates that ModalImmune improves resilience to modality removal and corruption while retaining convergence stability and reconstruction capacity.

*Qijie Zhu,Zeqi Ye,Han Liu,Zhaoran Wang,Minshuo Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DOIT is a training-free, efficient adaptation method for diffusion models using Doob's h-transform, suitable for non-differentiable rewards, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptation methods for diffusion models suffer from computational overhead or rely on restrictive reward assumptions, lacking theoretical justification.

Method: DOIT employs a measure transport framework using Doob's h-transform to dynamically correct diffusion sampling without modifying the pre-trained model.

Result: The method shows high-probability convergence to target distributions and outperforms baselines on D4RL benchmarks.

Conclusion: DOIT offers a theoretically grounded, efficient solution for adapting diffusion models to diverse rewards, validated empirically.

Abstract: Adaptation methods have been a workhorse for unlocking the transformative power of pre-trained diffusion models in diverse applications. Existing approaches often abstract adaptation objectives as a reward function and steer diffusion models to generate high-reward samples. However, these approaches can incur high computational overhead due to additional training, or rely on stringent assumptions on the reward such as differentiability. Moreover, despite their empirical success, theoretical justification and guarantees are seldom established. In this paper, we propose DOIT (Doob-Oriented Inference-time Transformation), a training-free and computationally efficient adaptation method that applies to generic, non-differentiable rewards. The key framework underlying our method is a measure transport formulation that seeks to transport the pre-trained generative distribution to a high-reward target distribution. We leverage Doob's $h$-transform to realize this transport, which induces a dynamic correction to the diffusion sampling process and enables efficient simulation-based computation without modifying the pre-trained model. Theoretically, we establish a high probability convergence guarantee to the target high-reward distribution via characterizing the approximation error in the dynamic Doob's correction. Empirically, on D4RL offline RL benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while preserving sampling efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NL excels with small datasets and low compute but hasn't been tested on linked data. This paper extends NL to knowledge graphs.

Method: Node aggregation on knowledge graphs is integrated into NL's ChaosNet architecture.

Result: NL performs better on homophilic graphs compared to heterophilic ones.

Conclusion: The study highlights NL's potential for linked data but calls for future work to improve heterophilic graph handling.

Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) has shown promise in recent times over traditional deep learning due to its two key features: ability to learn from small sized training samples, and low compute requirements. In prior work, NL has been implemented and extensively tested on separable and time series data, and demonstrated its superior performance on both classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we investigate the next step in NL, viz., applying NL to linked data, in particular, data that is represented in the form of knowledge graphs. We integrate linked data into NL by implementing node aggregation on knowledge graphs, and then feeding the aggregated node features to the simplest NL architecture: ChaosNet. We demonstrate the results of our implementation on homophilic graph datasets as well as heterophilic graph datasets of verying heterophily. We show better efficacy of our approach on homophilic graphs than on heterophilic graphs. While doing so, we also present our analysis of the results, as well as suggestions for future work.

TL;DR: MCL introduces Lie group constraints to neural operators, enhancing stability and reducing prediction errors by 30-50% with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operators lack geometric constraints, leading to instability in multi-layer iteration and long-horizon predictions.

Method: MCL uses low-rank Lie algebra parameterization to enforce group action updates on latent representations.

Result: MCL reduces relative prediction error by 30-50% across various PDEs, requiring only a 2.26% parameter increase.

Conclusion: MCL provides a scalable, geometrically constrained solution for improving neural operator predictions.

Abstract: Neural operators offer an effective framework for learning solutions of partial differential equations for many physical systems in a resolution-invariant and data-driven manner. Existing neural operators, however, often suffer from instability in multi-layer iteration and long-horizon rollout, which stems from the unconstrained Euclidean latent space updates that violate the geometric and conservation laws. To address this challenge, we propose to constrain manifolds with low-rank Lie algebra parameterization that performs group action updates on the latent representation. Our method, termed Manifold Constraining based on Lie group (MCL), acts as an efficient \emph{plug-and-play} module that enforces geometric inductive bias to existing neural operators. Extensive experiments on various partial differential equations, such as 1-D Burgers and 2-D Navier-Stokes, over a wide range of parameters and steps demonstrate that our method effectively lowers the relative prediction error by 30-50\% at the cost of 2.26\% of parameter increase. The results show that our approach provides a scalable solution for improving long-term prediction fidelity by addressing the principled geometric constraints absent in the neural operator updates.

Result: Outperforms baselines (98.58% accuracy on MIT-BIH, 99.14% on PTB); provides better uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: UCTECG-Net offers reliable uncertainty-aware predictions, enhancing risk-aware ECG decision support.

Abstract: Deep learning has improved automated electrocardiogram (ECG) classification, but limited insight into prediction reliability hinders its use in safety-critical settings. This paper proposes UCTECG-Net, an uncertainty-aware hybrid architecture that combines one-dimensional convolutions and Transformer encoders to process raw ECG signals and their spectrograms jointly. Evaluated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and PTB Diagnostic datasets, UCTECG-Net outperforms LSTM, CNN1D, and Transformer baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, achieving up to 98.58% accuracy on MIT-BIH and 99.14% on PTB. To assess predictive reliability, we integrate three uncertainty quantification methods (Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensembles, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout) into all models and analyze their behavior using an uncertainty-aware confusion matrix and derived metrics. The results show that UCTECG-Net, particularly with Ensemble or EMCD, provides more reliable and better-aligned uncertainty estimates than competing architectures, offering a stronger basis for risk-aware ECG decision support.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack guarantees for topological correctness and no holes in multi-class implicit representations.

Method: A 2D boundary extraction algorithm is developed for multi-class cases, focusing on topological consistency and water-tightness with detail control.

Result: The algorithm demonstrates adaptiveness and handles complex topology effectively in geological modelling.

Abstract: Surface extraction from implicit neural representations modelling a single class surface is a well-known task. However, there exist no surface extraction methods from an implicit representation of multiple classes that guarantee topological correctness and no holes. In this work, we lay the groundwork by introducing a 2D boundary extraction algorithm for the multi-class case focusing on topological consistency and water-tightness, which also allows for setting minimum detail restraint on the approximation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm using geological modelling data, showcasing its adaptiveness and ability to honour complex topology.

Result: The survey offers insights into Bayesian quadrature's practical applications and limitations, supported by an exhaustive bibliography.

Conclusion: Bayesian quadrature is systematically analyzed, revealing its potential and challenges, with a comprehensive reference base for future research.

Abstract: Bayesian quadrature is a probabilistic, model-based approach to numerical integration, the estimation of intractable integrals, or expectations.

TL;DR: SEMixer is a lightweight multiscale model for long-term time series forecasting, featuring RAM and MPMC to address redundancy, noise, and semantic gaps in multiscale patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like redundancy, noise, and semantic gaps hinder efficient multiscale modeling in time series forecasting.

Method: SEMixer uses Random Attention Mechanism (RAM) and Multiscale Progressive Mixing Chain (MPMC) to enhance patch-level semantics and temporal mixing.

Result: Validated on 10 datasets and ranked third in the 2025 CCF AlOps Challenge using real-world data.

Conclusion: SEMixer effectively addresses multiscale modeling challenges and improves forecasting performance.

Abstract: Modeling multiscale patterns is crucial for long-term time series forecasting (TSF). However, redundancy and noise in time series, together with semantic gaps between non-adjacent scales, make the efficient alignment and integration of multi-scale temporal dependencies challenging. To address this, we propose SEMixer, a lightweight multiscale model designed for long-term TSF. SEMixer features two key components: a Random Attention Mechanism (RAM) and a Multiscale Progressive Mixing Chain (MPMC). RAM captures diverse time-patch interactions during training and aggregates them via dropout ensemble at inference, enhancing patch-level semantics and enabling MLP-Mixer to better model multi-scale dependencies. MPMC further stacks RAM and MLP-Mixer in a memory-efficient manner, achieving more effective temporal mixing. It addresses semantic gaps across scales and facilitates better multiscale modeling and forecasting performance. We not only validate the effectiveness of SEMixer on 10 public datasets, but also on the \textit{2025 CCF AlOps Challenge} based on 21GB real wireless network data, where SEMixer achieves third place.

TL;DR: APTF introduces a framework to handle low-predictability samples in time series tasks via dynamic loss adjustment and error mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-predictability samples in time series data can degrade model performance, yet few methods address this issue directly.

Method: APTF uses Hierarchical Predictability-aware Loss (HPL) for dynamic sample identification and penalty, plus an amortization model to reduce estimation errors.

Result: APTF improves training stability and performance for time series forecasting and classification tasks.

Conclusion: APTF effectively mitigates adverse effects of low-predictability samples, enhancing model robustness.

Abstract: Time series data are prone to noise in various domains, and training samples may contain low-predictability patterns that deviate from the normal data distribution, leading to training instability or convergence to poor local minima. Therefore, mitigating the adverse effects of low-predictability samples is crucial for time series analysis tasks such as time series forecasting (TSF) and time series classification (TSC). While many deep learning models have achieved promising performance, few consider how to identify and penalize low-predictability samples to improve model performance from the training perspective. To fill this gap, we propose a general Amortized Predictability-aware Training Framework (APTF) for both TSF and TSC. APTF introduces two key designs that enable the model to focus on high-predictability samples while still learning appropriately from low-predictability ones: (i) a Hierarchical Predictability-aware Loss (HPL) that dynamically identifies low-predictability samples and progressively expands their loss penalty as training evolves, and (ii) an amortization model that mitigates predictability estimation errors caused by model bias, further enhancing HPL's effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/Meteor-Stars/APTF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monolithic models struggle in complex environments with multiple entities acting simultaneously, prompting the need for a more efficient approach.

Method: FLAM decomposes scenes into independent factors, each with its own latent action and next-step prediction, enhancing modeling accuracy.

Result: FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy, representation quality, and downstream policy learning.

Conclusion: Factorized latent action models like FLAM offer significant benefits over monolithic models in complex multi-entity settings.

Abstract: Learning latent actions from action-free video has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling up controllable world model learning. Latent actions provide a natural interface for users to iteratively generate and manipulate videos. However, most existing approaches rely on monolithic inverse and forward dynamics models that learn a single latent action to control the entire scene, and therefore struggle in complex environments where multiple entities act simultaneously. This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models. Based on experiments on both simulation and real-world multi-entity datasets, we find that FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy and representation quality, and facilitates downstream policy learning, demonstrating the benefits of factorized latent action models.

TL;DR: The paper revisits universal prediction of stochastic sequences, proposing high-probability vanishing regret bounds that complement existing expectation bounds, and provides an impossibility result for improving the exponent of δ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the gap between high-probability and expectation-based regret bounds in universal prediction, ensuring robustness in finite-time horizon scenarios.

Method: The authors derive high-probability regret bounds for universal prediction over a countable alphabet, achieving a convergence rate of O(T^{-1/2} δ^{-1/2}) with probability at least 1-δ.

Result: The proposed bounds match the form of prior expectation bounds and include an impossibility result showing the exponent of δ cannot be improved without additional assumptions.

Conclusion: The work successfully extends regret bounds to high-probability settings, providing theoretical limits on their improvement, thus enhancing the understanding of universal prediction.

Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of universal prediction of stochastic sequences with a finite time horizon $T$ known to the learner. The question we investigate is whether it is possible to derive vanishing regret bounds that hold with high probability, complementing existing bounds from the literature that hold in expectation. We propose such high-probability bounds which have a very similar form as the prior expectation bounds. For the case of universal prediction of a stochastic process over a countable alphabet, our bound states a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2} δ^{-1/2})$ with probability as least $1-δ$ compared to prior known in-expectation bounds of the order $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2})$. We also propose an impossibility result which proves that it is not possible to improve the exponent of $δ$ in a bound of the same form without making additional assumptions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to improve solar flare prediction accuracy by integrating class-dependent rewards and comparing deep learning models with traditional approaches.

Method: Multiple datasets with knowledge-informed features and magnetograms are used. Three deep learning models (CNN, CNN-BiLSTM, Transformer) and their CDR counterparts are applied. Feature importance and model interpretability are analyzed.

Result: CDR-Transformer performs best, especially with combined LOS and vector magnetic field data. CDR models are not overly sensitive to reward choices, and SHAP analysis reveals varying feature importance.

Conclusion: The CDR-Transformer framework outperforms other models and NASA/CCMC, demonstrating its potential for accurate flare prediction.

Abstract: In this work, we develop, for the first time, a supervised classification framework with class-dependent rewards (CDR) to predict $\geq$MM flares within 24 hr. We construct multiple datasets, covering knowledge-informed features and line-of sight (LOS) magnetograms. We also apply three deep learning models (CNN, CNN-BiLSTM, and Transformer) and three CDR counterparts (CDR-CNN, CDR-CNN-BiLSTM, and CDR-Transformer). First, we analyze the importance of LOS magnetic field parameters with the Transformer, then compare its performance using LOS-only, vector-only, and combined magnetic field parameters. Second, we compare flare prediction performance based on CDR models versus deep learning counterparts. Third, we perform sensitivity analysis on reward engineering for CDR models. Fourth, we use the SHAP method for model interpretability. Finally, we conduct performance comparison between our models and NASA/CCMC. The main findings are: (1)Among LOS feature combinations, R_VALUE and AREA_ACR consistently yield the best results. (2)Transformer achieves better performance with combined LOS and vector magnetic field data than with either alone. (3)Models using knowledge-informed features outperform those using magnetograms. (4)While CNN and CNN-BiLSTM outperform their CDR counterparts on magnetograms, CDR-Transformer is slightly superior to its deep learning counterpart when using knowledge-informed features. Among all models, CDR-Transformer achieves the best performance. (5)The predictive performance of the CDR models is not overly sensitive to the reward choices.(6)Through SHAP analysis, the CDR model tends to regard TOTUSJH as more important, while the Transformer tends to prioritize R_VALUE more.(7)Under identical prediction time and active region (AR) number, the CDR-Transformer shows superior predictive capabilities compared to NASA/CCMC.

Motivation: To address limitations in classical Q-learning, particularly its dependence on the suboptimality gap of the MDP, and provide gap9

Method: Analyzes Boltzmann Q-learning with decaying temperature and introduces Smoothed εn-Greedy exploration, combining εn-greedy and Boltzmann methods.

Result: Achieves sublinear regret for large gaps and a gap-robust bound of near-Õ(N^{9/10}) for Smoothed εn-Greedy.

Conclusion: The developed theory and algorithms offer improved regret bounds and high-probability concentration results, applicable beyond Q-learning.

Abstract: We present the first high-probability regret bound for classical online Q-learning in infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision processes, without relying on optimism or bonus terms. We first analyze Boltzmann Q-learning with decaying temperature and show that its regret depends critically on the suboptimality gap of the MDP: for sufficiently large gaps, the regret is sublinear, while for small gaps it deteriorates and can approach linear growth. To address this limitation, we study a Smoothed $ε_n$-Greedy exploration scheme that combines $ε_n$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration, for which we prove a gap-robust regret bound of near-$\tilde{O}(N^{9/10})$. To analyze these algorithms, we develop a high-probability concentration bound for contractive Markovian stochastic approximation with iterate- and time-dependent transition dynamics. This bound may be of independent interest as the contraction factor in our bound is governed by the mixing time and is allowed to converge to one asymptotically.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Attention Matching for fast context compaction in latent space, improving KV cache efficiency without significant quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling language models for long contexts is limited by KV cache size, and current summarization methods are lossy and harm performance.

Method: Proposes Attention Matching to construct compact keys and values, preserving attention outputs and mass per-KV-head, with efficient subproblem solutions.

Result: Achieves up to 50x compaction in seconds with minimal quality loss, advancing the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality.

Conclusion: Attention Matching offers a rapid, high-quality solution for context compaction, outperforming traditional summarization methods.

Abstract: Scaling language models to long contexts is often bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache. In deployed settings, long contexts are typically managed through compaction in token space via summarization. However, summarization can be highly lossy, substantially harming downstream performance. Recent work on Cartridges has shown that it is possible to train highly compact KV caches in latent space that closely match full-context performance, but at the cost of slow and expensive end-to-end optimization. This work describes an approach for fast context compaction in latent space through Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at a per-KV-head level. We show that this formulation naturally decomposes into simple subproblems, some of which admit efficient closed-form solutions. Within this framework, we develop a family of methods that significantly push the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality, achieving up to 50x compaction in seconds on some datasets with little quality loss.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces WS-KAN, the first weight-space architecture for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), leveraging their permutation symmetries and outperforming naive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work lacks tailored architectures for KANs despite their permutation symmetries, creating a gap in weight-space learning for these networks.

Method: The authors propose KAN-graph, a graph representation of KAN computation, and develop WS-KAN to learn from KANs while respecting their symmetry.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows WS-KAN consistently outperforms structure-agnostic baselines across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: WS-KAN is an effective weight-space architecture for KANs, advancing the field by addressing their unique symmetries.

Abstract: Weight-space models learn directly from the parameters of neural networks, enabling tasks such as predicting their accuracy on new datasets. Naive methods -- like applying MLPs to flattened parameters -- perform poorly, making the design of better weight-space architectures a central challenge. While prior work leveraged permutation symmetries in standard networks to guide such designs, no analogous analysis or tailored architecture yet exists for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). In this work, we show that KANs share the same permutation symmetries as MLPs, and propose the KAN-graph, a graph representation of their computation. Building on this, we develop WS-KAN, the first weight-space architecture that learns on KANs, which naturally accounts for their symmetry. We analyze WS-KAN's expressive power, showing it can replicate an input KAN's forward pass - a standard approach for assessing expressiveness in weight-space architectures. We construct a comprehensive ``zoo'' of trained KANs spanning diverse tasks, which we use as benchmarks to empirically evaluate WS-KAN. Across all tasks, WS-KAN consistently outperforms structure-agnostic baselines, often by a substantial margin. Our code is available at https://github.com/BarSGuy/KAN-Graph-Metanetwork.

Conclusion: HAWX provides a scalable and efficient solution for hardware-aware DNN optimization, demonstrating significant speedups and adaptability across various DNN benchmarks.

Abstract: This work presents HAWX, a hardware-aware scalable exploration framework that employs multi-level sensitivity scoring at different DNN abstraction levels (operator, filter, layer, and model) to guide selective integration of heterogeneous AxC blocks. Supported by predictive models for accuracy, power, and area, HAWX accelerates the evaluation of candidate configurations, achieving over 23* speedup in a layer-level search with two candidate approximate blocks and more than (3*106)* speedup at the filter-level search only for LeNet-5, while maintaining accuracy comparable to exhaustive search. Experiments across state-of-the-art DNN benchmarks such as VGG-11, ResNet-18, and EfficientNetLite demonstrate that the efficiency benefits of HAWX scale exponentially with network size. The HAWX hardware-aware search algorithm supports both spatial and temporal accelerator architectures, leveraging either off-the-shelf approximate components or customized designs.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the implicit bias of momentum-based optimizers in homogeneous models, extending existing theories and showing they approximate steepest descent trajectories, favoring KKT points of margin maximization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the implicit bias of momentum-based optimizers (like Muon, MomentumGD, Signum, and Adam) in homogeneous models and their behavior under varying norms.

Method: Extends steepest descent results to normalized steepest descent with learning rate schedules, analyzes momentum algorithms as approximate steepest descent trajectories, and compares margin maximization under different optimizers.

Result: Momentum-based optimizers exhibit bias towards KKT points of margin maximization, and the norm (spectral, ℓ₂, ℓ∞) depends on the optimizer choice. Experiments support the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The study expands understanding of steepest descent in homogeneous models and momentum-based optimizers, demonstrating their implicit bias towards specific margin maximization problems.

Abstract: We study the implicit bias of momentum-based optimizers on homogeneous models. We first extend existing results on the implicit bias of steepest descent in homogeneous models to normalized steepest descent with an optional learning rate schedule. We then show that for smooth homogeneous models, momentum steepest descent algorithms like Muon (spectral norm), MomentumGD ($\ell_2$ norm), and Signum ($\ell_\infty$ norm) are approximate steepest descent trajectories under a decaying learning rate schedule, proving that these algorithms too have a bias towards KKT points of the corresponding margin maximization problem. We extend the analysis to Adam (without the stability constant), which maximizes the $\ell_\infty$ margin, and to Muon-Signum and Muon-Adam, which maximize a hybrid norm. Our experiments corroborate the theory and show that the identity of the margin maximized depends on the choice of optimizer. Overall, our results extend earlier lines of work on steepest descent in homogeneous models and momentum-based optimizers in linear models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and explain fault diagnosis decisions in a non-linear chemical process using XAI methods.

Method: Applied LSTM classifier for fault detection in TEP, compared IG and SHAP for interpretability.

Result: Both methods identified key features, with SHAP often providing clearer root-cause insights.

Conclusion: The approach is model-agnostic, making it applicable to similar fault diagnosis problems.

Abstract: In this work, we apply and compare two state-of-the-art eXplainability Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, the Integrated Gradients (IG) and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), that explain the fault diagnosis decisions of a highly accurate Long Short-Time Memory (LSTM) classifier. The classifier is trained to detect faults in a benchmark non-linear chemical process, the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). It is highlighted how XAI methods can help identify the subsystem of the process where the fault occurred. Using our knowledge of the process, we note that in most cases the same features are indicated as the most important for the decision, while insome cases the SHAP method seems to be more informative and closer to the root cause of the fault. Finally, since the used XAI methods are model-agnostic, the proposed approach is not limited to the specific process and can also be used in similar problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate chromophore concentration estimation in spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) images is challenging due to nonlinearities and ill-posedness, which SPOI-AE aims to solve.

Method: SPOI-AE was trained and tested on in vivo mouse lymph node sPA images without known ground truths and validated using simulated phantom data.

Result: SPOI-AE outperforms conventional algorithms in reconstructing sPA pixels and provides biologically coherent estimates for optical parameters and chromophore concentrations.

Conclusion: SPOI-AE is effective for sPA optical inversion and spectral unmixing, offering improved accuracy and coherence in chromophore concentration estimation.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of the relative concentrations of chromophores in a spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) image can reveal immense structural, functional, and molecular information about physiological processes. However, due to nonlinearities and ill-posedness inherent to sPA imaging, concentration estimation is intractable. The Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Optical Inversion Autoencoder (SPOI-AE) aims to address the sPA optical inversion and spectral unmixing problems without assuming linearity. Herein, SPOI-AE was trained and tested on \textit{in vivo} mouse lymph node sPA images with unknown ground truth chromophore concentrations. SPOI-AE better reconstructs input sPA pixels than conventional algorithms while providing biologically coherent estimates for optical parameters, chromophore concentrations, and the percent oxygen saturation of tissue. SPOI-AE's unmixing accuracy was validated using a simulated mouse lymph node phantom ground truth.

TL;DR: The paper studies reward-free and reward-agnostic exploration in MDPs, proposing a novel algorithm that relaxes accuracy requirements and closes theoretical gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to explore unknown MDP environments without observing rewards, achieving optimal policies for any rewards revealed later or drawn from a small class.

Method: The authors design an online learning procedure with crafted rewards to create an exploration policy. This policy gathers data for accurate dynamics estimation and computes optimal policies post-reward revelation.

Result: The algorithm significantly relaxes accuracy constraints and achieves minimax sample complexity for reward-agnostic settings. A tight lower bound for reward-free exploration is also established.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm advances exploration techniques in MDPs, offering technical novelty and closing theoretical gaps in reward-free and reward-agnostic settings.

Abstract: We study reward-free and reward-agnostic exploration in episodic finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs), where an agent explores an unknown environment without observing external rewards. Reward-free exploration aims to enable $ε$-optimal policies for any reward revealed after exploration, while reward-agnostic exploration targets $ε$-optimality for rewards drawn from a small finite class. In the reward-agnostic setting, Li, Yan, Chen, and Fan achieve minimax sample complexity, but only for restrictively small accuracy parameter $ε$. We propose a new algorithm that significantly relaxes the requirement on $ε$. Our approach is novel and of technical interest by itself. Our algorithm employs an online learning procedure with carefully designed rewards to construct an exploration policy, which is used to gather data sufficient for accurate dynamics estimation and subsequent computation of an $ε$-optimal policy once the reward is revealed. Finally, we establish a tight lower bound for reward-free exploration, closing the gap between known upper and lower bounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bias introduced by noise in noninteractive LDP data, ensuring unbiased estimates for nonlinear functions and accurate classification tasks.

Method: Uses the Weierstrass transform for bias characterization and correction, then develops IWP-SGD, a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, for unbiased optimization.

Result: IWP-SGD converges to the true population risk minimizer at a rate of O(1/n) and performs well on synthetic and real-world binary classification tasks.

Conclusion: The method effectively corrects bias in LDP data and improves accuracy in classification tasks, demonstrating practical utility.

Abstract: Releasing data once and for all under noninteractive Local Differential Privacy (LDP) enables complete data reusability, but the resulting noise may create bias in subsequent analyses. In this work, we leverage the Weierstrass transform to characterize this bias in binary classification. We prove that inverting this transform leads to a bias-correction method to compute unbiased estimates of nonlinear functions on examples released under LDP. We then build a novel stochastic gradient descent algorithm called Inverse Weierstrass Private SGD (IWP-SGD). It converges to the true population risk minimizer at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$, with $n$ the number of examples. We empirically validate IWP-SGD on binary classification tasks using synthetic and real-world datasets.

*Eva Paraschou,Line Harder Clemmensen,Sneha Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines bias spillover in LLM fairness alignment, showing that improving fairness in one attribute can worsen others, especially in ambiguous contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitation of current LLM fairness alignment focusing on single attributes, ignoring multidimensional fairness and potential bias spillover effects.

Method: The researchers used Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark to evaluate fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B) under ambiguous and unambiguous contexts.

Result: Findings show noticeable bias spillover, with significant fairness degradations in ambiguous contexts for attributes like physical appearance, sexual orientation, and disability status.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks to prevent unintended disparities.

Abstract: Conventional large language model (LLM) fairness alignment largely focuses on mitigating bias along single sensitive attributes, overlooking fairness as an inherently multidimensional and context-specific value. This approach risks creating systems that achieve narrow fairness metrics while exacerbating disparities along untargeted attributes, a phenomenon known as bias spillover. While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks.

Conclusion: The architecture sets a strong benchmark for energy-efficient event-driven processing.

Abstract: As the volume of data recorded by embedded edge sensors increases, particularly from neuromorphic devices producing discrete event streams, there is a growing need for hardware-aware neural architectures that enable efficient, low-latency, and energy-conscious local processing. We present an FPGA implementation of event-graph neural networks for audio processing. We utilise an artificial cochlea that converts time-series signals into sparse event data, reducing memory and computation costs. Our architecture was implemented on a SoC FPGA and evaluated on two open-source datasets. For classification task, our baseline floating-point model achieves 92.7% accuracy on SHD dataset - only 2.4% below the state of the art - while requiring over 10x and 67x fewer parameters. On SSC, our models achieve 66.9-71.0% accuracy. Compared to FPGA-based spiking neural networks, our quantised model reaches 92.3% accuracy, outperforming them by up to 19.3% while reducing resource usage and latency. For SSC, we report the first hardware-accelerated evaluation. We further demonstrate the first end-to-end FPGA implementation of event-audio keyword spotting, combining graph convolutional layers with recurrent sequence modelling. The system achieves up to 95% word-end detection accuracy, with only 10.53 microsecond latency and 1.18 W power consumption, establishing a strong benchmark for energy-efficient event-driven KWS.

Motivation: Hubness in high-dimensional embedding spaces distorts nearest neighbor relationships and biases distance-based metrics in generative model evaluation.

Method: Proposes Generative ICDM (GICDM), an extension of Iterative Contextual Dissimilarity Measure (ICDM), with a multi-scale enhancement to correct neighborhood estimation.

Result: GICDM resolves hubness-induced failures, restores reliable metric behavior, and aligns better with human judgment.

Conclusion: GICDM effectively addresses hubness distortions in generative model evaluation, enhancing metric accuracy and consistency.

Abstract: Generative model evaluation commonly relies on high-dimensional embedding spaces to compute distances between samples. We show that dataset representations in these spaces are affected by the hubness phenomenon, which distorts nearest neighbor relationships and biases distance-based metrics. Building on the classical Iterative Contextual Dissimilarity Measure (ICDM), we introduce Generative ICDM (GICDM), a method to correct neighborhood estimation for both real and generated data. We introduce a multi-scale extension to improve empirical behavior. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real benchmarks demonstrate that GICDM resolves hubness-induced failures, restores reliable metric behavior, and improves alignment with human judgment.

Motivation: Address the inefficiency gap between full-step training with low-rank projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning for large models.

Method: Proposes LoRSum, a memory-efficient subroutine using proximal sub-problems solved with alternating least squares, and introduces a scaled variant for preconditioned gradient descent with structured metrics.

Result: Matches or improves LoRA baselines on synthetic tasks, CIFAR-100, and language-model fine-tuning (GLUE, SQuAD v2, WikiText-103) with modest compute overhead.

Conclusion: LoRSum retains LoRA's parameter efficiency while avoiding full-matrix SVD, offering a practical solution for efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes large models by learning low-rank updates on top of frozen weights, dramatically reducing trainable parameters and memory. In this work, we address the gap between training with full steps with low-rank projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning. We propose LoRSum, a memory-efficient subroutine that closes this gap for gradient descent by casting LoRA optimization as a proximal sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates, which we prove to be an implicit block power method. We recover several recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as special cases, and show that LoRSum can also be used for updating a low-rank momentum. In order to address full steps with preconditioned gradient descent, we propose a scaled variant of LoRSum that uses structured metrics such as K-FAC and Shampoo, and we show that storing the diagonal of these metrics still allows them to perform well while remaining memory-efficient. Experiments on a synthetic task, CIFAR-100, and language-model fine-tuning on GLUE, SQuAD v2, and WikiText-103, show that our method can match or improve LoRA baselines given modest compute overhead, while avoiding full-matrix SVD projections and retaining LoRA-style parameter efficiency.

TL;DR: HPMixer decouples and models periodic patterns and residuals in multivariate time series forecasting, achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capturing both periodic patterns and residual dynamics is crucial for accurate long-term multivariate time series forecasting.

Method: HPMixer uses a learnable cycle module for periodicity and LSWT for residuals, coupled with hierarchical patching and channel-mixing encoders.

Result: HPMixer shows competitive or state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: HPMixer effectively integrates decoupled periodicity modeling with multi-scale residual learning for improved forecasting.

Abstract: In long-term multivariate time series forecasting, effectively capturing both periodic patterns and residual dynamics is essential. To address this within standard deep learning benchmark settings, we propose the Hierarchical Patching Mixer (HPMixer), which models periodicity and residuals in a decoupled yet complementary manner. The periodic component utilizes a learnable cycle module [7] enhanced with a nonlinear channel-wise MLP for greater expressiveness. The residual component is processed through a Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) to extract stable, shift-invariant frequency-domain representations. Subsequently, a channel-mixing encoder models explicit inter-channel dependencies, while a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism captures coarse- and fine-scale residual variations. By integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning, HPMixer provides an effective framework. Extensive experiments on standard multivariate benchmarks demonstrate that HPMixer achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent baselines.

TL;DR: GoldDiff introduces a training-free framework to reduce the computational burden of analytical diffusion models by dynamically identifying a 'Golden Subset' for inference, achieving 71x speedup without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard analytical diffusion models require full-dataset scans at every timestep, making them computationally prohibitive for large datasets. The authors aim to address this scalability bottleneck.

Method: The paper proposes Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), which dynamically identifies a 'Golden Subset' of data for inference using a coarse-to-fine mechanism, reducing the need for full-dataset scans.

Result: GoldDiff achieves a 71x speedup on AFHQ and successfully scales to ImageNet-1K, matching or outperforming full-scan baselines.

Conclusion: GoldDiff unlocks a scalable, training-free paradigm for large-scale generative modeling, addressing the computational limitations of traditional analytical diffusion models.

Abstract: Analytical diffusion models offer a mathematically transparent path to generative modeling by formulating the denoising score as an empirical-Bayes posterior mean. However, this interpretability comes at a prohibitive cost: the standard formulation necessitates a full-dataset scan at every timestep, scaling linearly with dataset size. In this work, we present the first systematic study addressing this scalability bottleneck. We challenge the prevailing assumption that the entire training data is necessary, uncovering the phenomenon of Posterior Progressive Concentration: the effective golden support of the denoising score is not static but shrinks asymptotically from the global manifold to a local neighborhood as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Capitalizing on this, we propose Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), a training-free framework that decouples inference complexity from dataset size. Instead of static retrieval, GoldDiff uses a coarse-to-fine mechanism to dynamically pinpoint the ''Golden Subset'' for inference. Theoretically, we derive rigorous bounds guaranteeing that our sparse approximation converges to the exact score. Empirically, GoldDiff achieves a $\bf 71 \times$ speedup on AFHQ while matching or achieving even better performance than full-scan baselines. Most notably, we demonstrate the first successful scaling of analytical diffusion to ImageNet-1K, unlocking a scalable, training-free paradigm for large-scale generative modeling.

TL;DR: CALMs balance interpretability and accuracy by allowing multiple univariate shape functions per feature, active in different input regions, outperforming GAMs and matching GA$^2$Ms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between interpretability (GAMs) and accuracy (GA$^2$Ms) by introducing locally additive models.

Method: CALMs use multiple univariate shape functions per feature, defined by logical conditions on interacting features, trained via distillation-based pipeline.

Result: CALMs outperform GAMs and achieve accuracy comparable to GA$^2$Ms across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: CALMs provide an effective balance between interpretability and predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Generalized additive models (GAMs) offer interpretability through independent univariate feature effects but underfit when interactions are present in data. GA$^2$Ms add selected pairwise interactions which improves accuracy, but sacrifices interpretability and limits model auditing. We propose \emph{Conditionally Additive Local Models} (CALMs), a new model class, that balances the interpretability of GAMs with the accuracy of GA$^2$Ms. CALMs allow multiple univariate shape functions per feature, each active in different regions of the input space. These regions are defined independently for each feature as simple logical conditions (thresholds) on the features it interacts with. As a result, effects remain locally additive while varying across subregions to capture interactions. We further propose a principled distillation-based training pipeline that identifies homogeneous regions with limited interactions and fits interpretable shape functions via region-aware backfitting. Experiments on diverse classification and regression tasks show that CALMs consistently outperform GAMs and achieve accuracy comparable with GA$^2$Ms. Overall, CALMs offer a compelling trade-off between predictive accuracy and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational analysis of LC-MS/MS data faces challenges in identifying compounds from spectra, with deep learning methods increasingly used to predict molecular fingerprints. However, the effect of loss functions on model performance is unclear.

Method: The study investigates common loss functions, deriving regret bounds to analyze Bayes-optimal decisions, and examines the trade-off between fingerprint similarity and molecular retrieval.

Result: Results show optimizing for accurate fingerprint predictions worsens retrieval outcomes, and vice versa, with the trade-off influenced by candidate set similarity.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into selecting loss functions and fingerprints by analyzing their impact on model performance and the inherent trade-offs.

Abstract: One of the central challenges in the computational analysis of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data is to identify the compounds underlying the output spectra. In recent years, this problem is increasingly tackled using deep learning methods. A common strategy involves predicting a molecular fingerprint vector from an input mass spectrum, which is then used to search for matches in a chemical compound database. While various loss functions are employed in training these predictive models, their impact on model performance remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate commonly used loss functions, deriving novel regret bounds that characterize when Bayes-optimal decisions for these objectives must diverge. Our results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the two objectives of (1) fingerprint similarity and (2) molecular retrieval. Optimizing for more accurate fingerprint predictions typically worsens retrieval results, and vice versa. Our theoretical analysis shows this trade-off depends on the similarity structure of candidate sets, providing guidance for loss function and fingerprint selection.

*Gerhard Stenzel,Isabella Debelic,Michael Kölle,Tobias Rohe,Leo Sünkel,Julian Hager,Claudia Linnhoff-Popien*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends DQCS with reinforcement learning to include continuous single-qubit rotations, comparing one-stage and two-stage training regimes. PPO outperforms A2C, achieving high success rates for certain states but scalability issues arise beyond λ≈3-4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance DQCS by incorporating continuous rotations and evaluate reinforcement learning methods for parameterized quantum state preparation.

Method: Two training regimes (one-stage and two-stage) using PPO and A2C, tested on systems with 2–10 qubits and targets of varying complexity.

Result: PPO succeeds with stable hyperparameters, achieving high success rates for basis and Bell states, but scalability declines beyond λ≈3-4. Two-stage offers minimal accuracy gains but higher runtime.

Conclusion: The one-stage PPO policy is recommended for practicality under fixed compute budgets, with potential avenues for improved scalability.

Abstract: We extend directed quantum circuit synthesis (DQCS) with reinforcement learning from purely discrete gate selection to parameterized quantum state preparation with continuous single-qubit rotations \(R_x\), \(R_y\), and \(R_z\). We compare two training regimes: a one-stage agent that jointly selects the gate type, the affected qubit(s), and the rotation angle; and a two-stage variant that first proposes a discrete circuit and subsequently optimizes the rotation angles with Adam using parameter-shift gradients. Using Gymnasium and PennyLane, we evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor--Critic (A2C) on systems comprising two to ten qubits and on targets of increasing complexity with \(λ\) ranging from one to five. Whereas A2C does not learn effective policies in this setting, PPO succeeds under stable hyperparameters (one-stage: learning rate approximately \(5\times10^{-4}\) with a self-fidelity-error threshold of 0.01; two-stage: learning rate approximately \(10^{-4}\)). Both approaches reliably reconstruct computational basis states (between 83\% and 99\% success) and Bell states (between 61\% and 77\% success). However, scalability saturates for \(λ\) of approximately three to four and does not extend to ten-qubit targets even at \(λ=2\). The two-stage method offers only marginal accuracy gains while requiring around three times the runtime. For practicality under a fixed compute budget, we therefore recommend the one-stage PPO policy, provide explicit synthesized circuits, and contrast with a classical variational baseline to outline avenues for improved scalability.

*Shafagh Abband Pashaki,Sepehr Maleki,Amir Badiee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A capacity-constrained incentive-based demand response approach for residential smart grids uses deep reinforcement learning to optimize real-time incentive rates, reducing peak demand and smoothing load profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to maintain grid capacity limits and prevent congestion by financially incentivizing end users to adjust energy consumption. It balances the financial interests of both service providers and users.

Method: The framework employs a hierarchical architecture and deep reinforcement learning to set hourly incentive rates based on wholesale prices and aggregated load. User preferences are modeled via appliance-level energy management and dissatisfaction costs.

Result: Simulations using real-world data show a 22.82% reduction in peak-to-average ratio compared to no-demand-response scenarios, effectively smoothing the load profile.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully reduces peak demand and improves grid stability while considering user satisfaction and financial interests.

Abstract: This paper presents a capacity-constrained incentive-based demand response approach for residential smart grids. It aims to maintain electricity grid capacity limits and prevent congestion by financially incentivising end users to reduce or shift their energy consumption. The proposed framework adopts a hierarchical architecture in which a service provider adjusts hourly incentive rates based on wholesale electricity prices and aggregated residential load. The financial interests of both the service provider and end users are explicitly considered. A deep reinforcement learning approach is employed to learn optimal real-time incentive rates under explicit capacity constraints. Heterogeneous user preferences are modelled through appliance-level home energy management systems and dissatisfaction costs. Using real-world residential electricity consumption and price data from three households, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces peak demand and smooths the aggregated load profile. This leads to an approximately 22.82% reduction in the peak-to-average ratio compared to the no-demand-response case.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Feature-Enriched Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FEKAN), an improved variant of KANs that enhances computational efficiency and predictive accuracy through feature enrichment without increasing trainable parameters, outperforming existing KAN architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KAN architectures are limited by high computational costs and slow convergence, hindering scalability and practical use. FEKAN aims to address these issues while retaining interpretability.

Method: FEKAN incorporates additional features to enrich the network's representation, improving efficiency and accuracy without adding trainable parameters. It is evaluated on function approximation, PDEs, and neural operator tasks.

Result: FEKAN achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy than baseline KAN variants (FastKAN, WavKAN, etc.) across all tested benchmarks, with theoretical support for its enhanced representation capacity.

Conclusion: FEKAN offers a scalable and efficient solution for KAN architectures, balancing interpretability with improved performance, making it suitable for diverse applications.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to multilayer perceptrons, offering enhanced interpretability via functional decomposition. However, existing KAN architectures, including spline-, wavelet-, radial-basis variants, etc., suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence, limiting scalability and practical applicability. Here, we introduce Feature-Enriched Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FEKAN), a simple yet effective extension that preserves all the advantages of KAN while improving computational efficiency and predictive accuracy through feature enrichment, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. By incorporating these additional features, FEKAN accelerates convergence, increases representation capacity, and substantially mitigates the computational overhead characteristic of state-of-the-art KAN architectures. We investigate FEKAN across a comprehensive set of benchmarks, including function-approximation tasks, physics-informed formulations for diverse partial differential equations (PDEs), and neural operator settings that map between input and output function spaces. For function approximation, we systematically compare FEKAN against a broad family of KAN variants, FastKAN, WavKAN, ReLUKAN, HRKAN, ChebyshevKAN, RBFKAN, and the original SplineKAN. Across all tasks, FEKAN demonstrates substantially faster convergence and consistently higher approximation accuracy than the underlying baseline architectures. We also establish the theoretical foundations for FEKAN, showing its superior representation capacity compared to KAN, which contributes to improved accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates transfer learning for linear regression using overparameterized pretrained models, analyzing test error and proposing debiasing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multiple pretrained models can improve transfer learning and address overparameterization bias.

Method: Formulates target learning as optimization with a penalty on model deviation from pretrained models, analytically derives test error, and proposes a debiasing correction.

Result: Shows that using many pretrained models aids transfer learning but may suffer from overparameterization bias; debiasing helps mitigate this issue.

Conclusion: Debiasing can enhance transfer learning by reducing bias and leveraging more pretrained models.

Abstract: We study transfer learning for a linear regression task using several least-squares pretrained models that can be overparameterized.
  We formulate the target learning task as optimization that minimizes squared errors on the target dataset with penalty on the distance of the learned model from the pretrained models. We analytically formulate the test error of the learned target model and provide the corresponding empirical evaluations.
  Our results elucidate when using more pretrained models can improve transfer learning. Specifically, if the pretrained models are overparameterized, using sufficiently many of them is important for beneficial transfer learning. However, the learning may be compromised by overparameterization bias of pretrained models, i.e., the minimum $\ell_2$-norm solution's restriction to a small subspace spanned by the training examples in the high-dimensional parameter space. We propose a simple debiasing via multiplicative correction factor that can reduce the overparameterization bias and leverage more pretrained models to learn a target predictor.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for adversarial attacks on Safe RL policies, addressing vulnerabilities without needing direct gradient access or ground-truth safety constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Safe RL methods assume benign environments and rely on impractical gradient access for adversarial attacks, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Uses expert demonstrations and black-box interactions to learn a constraint model and surrogate policy, enabling gradient-based attacks without victim policy gradients.

Result: Theoretical analysis confirms feasibility, and experiments on benchmarks show effectiveness under limited access.

Conclusion: The framework successfully exposes Safe RL policy vulnerabilities without requiring impractical access, enhancing robustness evaluation.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (Safe RL) aims to ensure policy performance while satisfying safety constraints. However, most existing Safe RL methods assume benign environments, making them vulnerable to adversarial perturbations commonly encountered in real-world settings. In addition, existing gradient-based adversarial attacks typically require access to the policy's gradient information, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarial attack framework to reveal vulnerabilities of Safe RL policies. Using expert demonstrations and black-box environment interaction, our framework learns a constraint model and a surrogate (learner) policy, enabling gradient-based attack optimization without requiring the victim policy's internal gradients or the ground-truth safety constraints. We further provide theoretical analysis establishing feasibility and deriving perturbation bounds. Experiments on multiple Safe RL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under limited privileged access.

### [181] [RIDER: 3D RNA Inverse Design with Reinforcement Learning-Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16548)
*Tianmeng Hu,Yongzheng Cui,Biao Luo,Ke Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RIDER is an RNA inverse design framework using reinforcement learning to optimize 3D structural similarity, outperforming current methods in sequence recovery and structural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for RNA 3D structure design rely on native sequence recovery, which is inadequate for ensuring structural fidelity, necessitating a direct optimization approach for 3D similarity.

Method: RIDER combines a GNN-based generative diffusion model pre-trained for sequence recovery and fine-tuned with policy gradient reinforcement learning, using four 3D self-consistency metrics as rewards.

Result: RIDER improves structural similarity by over 100% across metrics and designs sequences distinct from native ones.

Conclusion: RIDER successfully addresses the limitations of sequence recovery-based methods by directly optimizing for 3D structural fidelity, advancing RNA design for synthetic biology and therapeutics.

Abstract: The inverse design of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures is crucial for engineering functional RNAs in synthetic biology and therapeutics. While recent deep learning approaches have advanced this field, they are typically optimized and evaluated using native sequence recovery, which is a limited surrogate for structural fidelity, since different sequences can fold into similar 3D structures and high recovery does not necessarily indicate correct folding. To address this limitation, we propose RIDER, an RNA Inverse DEsign framework with Reinforcement learning that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over state-of-the-art methods. Then, we fine-tune the model with an improved policy gradient algorithm using four task-specific reward functions based on 3D self-consistency metrics. Experimental results show that RIDER improves structural similarity by over 100% across all metrics and discovers designs that are distinct from native sequences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how parameter sharing in VQCs affects optimization landscapes by creating deceptive gradients, leading to degraded convergence with traditional optimizers. It introduces a detection algorithm and quantitative framework, revealing trade-offs between expressivity and deceptiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the overlooked trade-off introduced by parameter sharing in VQCs, particularly how deceptive gradients mislead optimizers despite reducing parameter dimensionality.

Method: Systematic experimental analysis and introduction of a gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm and quantitative framework to measure optimization difficulty in quantum circuits.

Result: Increased parameter sharing leads to more complex solution landscapes with heightened gradient magnitudes and deceptiveness ratios, degrading convergence of traditional optimizers.

Conclusion: Parameter sharing improves circuit expressivity but significantly increases landscape deceptiveness, highlighting a mismatch between classical optimization strategies and quantum parameter landscapes.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for quantum machine learning in the NISQ era. While parameter sharing in VQCs can reduce the parameter space dimensionality and potentially mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon, it introduces a complex trade-off that has been largely overlooked. This paper investigates how parameter sharing, despite creating better global optima with fewer parameters, fundamentally alters the optimization landscape through deceptive gradients -- regions where gradient information exists but systematically misleads optimizers away from global optima. Through systematic experimental analysis, we demonstrate that increasing degrees of parameter sharing generate more complex solution landscapes with heightened gradient magnitudes and measurably higher deceptiveness ratios. Our findings reveal that traditional gradient-based optimizers (Adam, SGD) show progressively degraded convergence as parameter sharing increases, with performance heavily dependent on hyperparameter selection. We introduce a novel gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm and a quantitative framework for measuring optimization difficulty in quantum circuits, establishing that while parameter sharing can improve circuit expressivity by orders of magnitude, this comes at the cost of significantly increased landscape deceptiveness. These insights provide important considerations for quantum circuit design in practical applications, highlighting the fundamental mismatch between classical optimization strategies and quantum parameter landscapes shaped by parameter sharing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning in large cyber-network environments by reducing redundant computations and maintaining decision quality.

Method: Uses a learned partition-aware filtering layer and Q-value caching, employing compact state projections and LRU caching with conservative k-hop invalidation.

Result: Achieves higher player payoffs than SOTA baselines on large networks without significant memory or training time scaling issues.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, efficient hierarchical policy learning solution for large-scale networked decision problems.

Abstract: We introduce MetaDOAR, a lightweight meta-controller that augments the Double Oracle / PSRO paradigm with a learned, partition-aware filtering layer and Q-value caching to enable scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning on very large cyber-network environments. MetaDOAR learns a compact state projection from per node structural embeddings to rapidly score and select a small subset of devices (a top-k partition) on which a conventional low-level actor performs focused beam search utilizing a critic agent. Selected candidate actions are evaluated with batched critic forwards and stored in an LRU cache keyed by a quantized state projection and local action identifiers, dramatically reducing redundant critic computation while preserving decision quality via conservative k-hop cache invalidation. Empirically, MetaDOAR attains higher player payoffs than SOTA baselines on large network topologies, without significant scaling issues in terms of memory usage or training time. This contribution provide a practical, theoretically motivated path to efficient hierarchical policy learning for large-scale networked decision problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the computational tractability of sampling from reward-tilted diffusion models, focusing on quadratic rewards. It identifies efficient sampling for linear rewards and low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts, while proving intractability for negative-definite tilts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand when inference-time algorithms can efficiently improve heuristics currently used in practice, addressing gaps in the literature.

Method: The authors use a fine-grained analysis, leveraging linear-reward tilts and the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform for efficient sampling in specific cases.

Result: Results show efficient sampling for linear rewards and low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts, but intractability for negative-definite tilts.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a clear demarcation of tractable and intractable cases for sampling, providing theoretical insights for practical applications.

Abstract: Inference-time algorithms are an emerging paradigm in which pre-trained models are used as subroutines to solve downstream tasks. Such algorithms have been proposed for tasks ranging from inverse problems and guided image generation to reasoning. However, the methods currently deployed in practice are heuristics with a variety of failure modes -- and we have very little understanding of when these heuristics can be efficiently improved.
  In this paper, we consider the task of sampling from a reward-tilted diffusion model -- that is, sampling from $p^{\star}(x) \propto p(x) \exp(r(x))$ -- given a reward function $r$ and pre-trained diffusion oracle for $p$. We provide a fine-grained analysis of the computational tractability of this task for quadratic rewards $r(x) = x^\top A x + b^\top x$. We show that linear-reward tilts are always efficiently sampleable -- a simple result that seems to have gone unnoticed in the literature. We use this as a building block, along with a conceptually new ingredient -- the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform -- to provide an efficient algorithm for sampling from low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts, i.e. $r(x) = x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite and of rank $O(1)$. For negative-definite tilts, i.e. $r(x) = - x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite, we prove that the problem is intractable even if $A$ is of rank 1 (albeit with exponentially-large entries).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban demand forecasting is essential for optimizing transportation systems, especially for shared micro-mobility services like e-scooters and e-bikes.

Method: Two gradient boosting models (classification and regression) are developed to forecast demand over varying time horizons (5 minutes to 1 hour).

Result: The models outperform state-of-the-art methods and a Generative AI-based model, demonstrating effectiveness in urban mobility complexity.

Conclusion: The approach provides insights for sustainable urban micro-mobility management, addressing challenges of rapid urbanization.

Abstract: Urban demand forecasting plays a critical role in optimizing routing, dispatching, and congestion management within Intelligent Transportation Systems. By leveraging data fusion and analytics techniques, traffic demand forecasting serves as a key intermediate measure for identifying emerging spatial and temporal demand patterns. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing two gradient boosting model variations, one for classiffication and one for regression, both capable of generating demand forecasts at various temporal horizons, from 5 minutes up to one hour. Our overall approach effectively integrates temporal and contextual features, enabling accurate predictions that are essential for improving the efficiency of shared (micro-) mobility services. To evaluate its effectiveness, we utilize open shared mobility data derived from e-scooter and e-bike networks in five metropolitan areas. These real-world datasets allow us to compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods as well as a Generative AI-based model, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of modern urban mobility. Ultimately, our methodology offers novel insights on urban micro-mobility management, helping to tackle the challenges arising from rapid urbanization and thus, contributing to more sustainable, efficient, and livable cities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AIFL, a deterministic LSTM-based model, is introduced for global daily streamflow forecasting. It uses a two-stage training strategy on reanalysis and operational forecast data to bridge performance gaps. The model achieves high predictive skill and reliability, outperforming state-of-the-art systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable global streamflow forecasting for flood preparedness and water resource management, addressing the performance gap in data-driven models when transitioning from historical reanalysis to operational forecasts.

Method: AIFL employs a two-stage training strategy: pre-training on ERA5-Land reanalysis (1980-2019) for hydrological processes and fine-tuning on IFS control forecasts (2016-2019) to adapt to operational biases. The model is trained on 18,588 basins from the CARAVAN dataset.

Result: AIFL achieves high predictive skill with median KGE' of 0.66 and NSE of 0.53 on an independent test set (2021-2024). It competes with state-of-the-art global systems and excels in extreme-event detection.

Conclusion: AIFL provides a robust, transparent, and reproducible baseline for global streamflow forecasting, particularly reliable for extreme events, and is competitive with existing systems.

Abstract: Reliable global streamflow forecasting is essential for flood preparedness and water resource management, yet data-driven models often suffer from a performance gap when transitioning from historical reanalysis to operational forecast products. This paper introduces AIFL (Artificial Intelligence for Floods), a deterministic LSTM-based model designed for global daily streamflow forecasting. Trained on 18,588 basins curated from the CARAVAN dataset, AIFL utilises a novel two-stage training strategy to bridge the reanalysis-to-forecast domain shift. The model is first pre-trained on 40 years of ERA5-Land reanalysis (1980-2019) to capture robust hydrological processes, then fine-tuned on operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) control forecasts (2016-2019) to adapt to the specific error structures and biases of operational numerical weather prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first global model trained end-to-end within the CARAVAN ecosystem. On an independent temporal test set (2021-2024), AIFL achieves high predictive skill with a median modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE') of 0.66 and a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.53. Benchmarking results show that AIFL is highly competitive with current state-of-the-art global systems, achieving comparable accuracy while maintaining a transparent and reproducible forcing pipeline. The model demonstrates exceptional reliability in extreme-event detection, providing a streamlined and operationally robust baseline for the global hydrological community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SeMI* is an optimal Membership Inference attack leveraging model updates for stronger privacy audits, outperforming static model attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous analysis for MI attacks on dynamically updated models, SeMI* is developed to exploit model sequences for tighter privacy audits.

Method: SeMI* uses sequences of model updates to detect target insertions, deriving optimal power for finite-sample settings, including privacy-preserving scenarios.

Result: SeMI* avoids MI signal dilution seen in static attacks and enables tuning insertion time and canary for tighter audits, validated across models and DP-SGD training.

Conclusion: SeMI* provides superior privacy audits compared to baselines, demonstrating practical advantages for dynamic AI models.

Abstract: Modern AI models are not static. They go through multiple updates in their lifecycles. Thus, exploiting the model dynamics to create stronger Membership Inference (MI) attacks and tighter privacy audits are timely questions. Though the literature empirically shows that using a sequence of model updates can increase the power of MI attacks, rigorous analysis of the `optimal' MI attacks is limited to static models with infinite samples. Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates. Furthermore, an adversary can use SeMI* to tune both the insertion time and the canary to yield tighter privacy audits. Finally, we conduct experiments across data distributions and models trained or fine-tuned with DP-SGD demonstrating that practical variants of SeMI* lead to tighter privacy audits than the baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using classical machine learning and graph neural networks to predict the cop number of graphs, identifying key structural properties influencing predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational difficulty of determining the cop number of graphs, the study aims to leverage machine learning for scalable approximations.

Method: Classical tree-based machine learning models and graph neural networks are employed to predict cop numbers, analyzing structural properties like connectivity and clustering.

Result: Tree-based models show high accuracy despite class imbalance, while graph neural networks perform comparably without feature engineering. Key predictive features align with theoretical insights.

Conclusion: Machine learning methods can complement traditional algorithms by providing scalable cop number predictions when exact computation is impractical.

Abstract: Cops and Robbers is a pursuit evasion game played on a graph, first introduced independently by Quilliot \cite{quilliot1978jeux} and Nowakowski and Winkler \cite{NOWAKOWSKI1983235} over four decades ago. A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates tokenization strategies for neuroimaging data in transformer-based models, comparing learnable and non-learnable methods. Findings suggest both achieve similar performance, favoring simpler fixed tokenization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of tokenization strategies on neural time series data processing in large neuroimaging models.

Method: Systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies using transformer-based models on MEG data, including a novel learnable autoencoder tokenizer.

Result: Both learnable and non-learnable tokenizers achieve high reconstruction accuracy and comparable performance across evaluation criteria.

Conclusion: Simple fixed tokenization strategies are sufficient for neural foundation models.

Abstract: Recent success in natural language processing has motivated growing interest in large-scale foundation models for neuroimaging data. Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves differential TD learning for average reward RL by proving convergence without impractical local clock learning rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing convergence guarantees for differential TD learning in average reward RL rely on impractical local clock learning rates, limiting their practical use.

Method: The authors prove almost sure convergence for on-policy $n$-step differential TD with standard learning rates and derive off-policy convergence conditions.

Result: Convergence is achieved without local clocks, making the method more practical for implementations.

Conclusion: The study enhances the theoretical and practical applicability of differential TD learning in average reward RL.

Abstract: The average reward is a fundamental performance metric in reinforcement learning (RL) focusing on the long-run performance of an agent. Differential temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms are a major advance for average reward RL as they provide an efficient online method to learn the value functions associated with the average reward in both on-policy and off-policy settings. However, existing convergence guarantees require a local clock in learning rates tied to state visit counts, which practitioners do not use and does not extend beyond tabular settings. We address this limitation by proving the almost sure convergence of on-policy $n$-step differential TD for any $n$ using standard diminishing learning rates without a local clock. We then derive three sufficient conditions under which off-policy $n$-step differential TD also converges without a local clock. These results strengthen the theoretical foundations of differential TD and bring its convergence analysis closer to practical implementations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that Neural Collapse (NC) is universal across optimizers, showing optimizer choice is critical. It introduces NC0 as a diagnostic metric and proves NC cannot emerge under decoupled weight decay in adaptive optimizers like AdamW. Momentum in SGD accelerates NC, verified via extensive experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analyses of Neural Collapse (NC) largely ignore the optimizer's role, assuming universality. This work aims to demonstrate the optimizer's critical role in NC emergence.

Method: Introduces NC0, a novel metric for tracking NC. Theoretically analyzes NC dynamics under different optimizers (SGD, SignGD, AdamW) and explores momentum's effect in SGD. Validates with 3,900 training runs.

Result: Proves NC cannot emerge under decoupled weight decay (e.g., AdamW). Shows momentum in SGD accelerates NC. Empirical results confirm theoretical findings.

Conclusion: First work to theoretically explain optimizer-dependent NC emergence, emphasizing weight-decay coupling's role in optimizer biases.

Abstract: Neural Collapse (NC) refers to the emergence of highly symmetric geometric structures in the representations of deep neural networks during the terminal phase of training. Despite its prevalence, the theoretical understanding of NC remains limited. Existing analyses largely ignore the role of the optimizer, thereby suggesting that NC is universal across optimization methods. In this work, we challenge this assumption and demonstrate that the choice of optimizer plays a critical role in the emergence of NC. The phenomenon is typically quantified through NC metrics, which, however, are difficult to track and analyze theoretically. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel diagnostic metric, NC0, whose convergence to zero is a necessary condition for NC. Using NC0, we provide theoretical evidence that NC cannot emerge under decoupled weight decay in adaptive optimizers, as implemented in AdamW. Concretely, we prove that SGD, SignGD with coupled weight decay (a special case of Adam), and SignGD with decoupled weight decay (a special case of AdamW) exhibit qualitatively different NC0 dynamics. Also, we show the accelerating effect of momentum on NC (beyond convergence of train loss) when trained with SGD, being the first result concerning momentum in the context of NC. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical experiments consisting of 3,900 training runs across various datasets, architectures, optimizers, and hyperparameters, confirming our theoretical results. This work provides the first theoretical explanation for optimizer-dependent emergence of NC and highlights the overlooked role of weight-decay coupling in shaping the implicit biases of optimizers.

### [192] [Factorization Machine with Quadratic-Optimization Annealing for RNA Inverse Folding and Evaluation of Binary-Integer Encoding and Nucleotide Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16643)
*Shuta Kikuchi,Shu Tanaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA) for RNA inverse folding, analyzing nucleotide assignments and encoding methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for RNA inverse folding require many sequence evaluations, limiting their practicality. FMQA offers a solution with fewer evaluations.

Method: FMQA is applied by converting nucleotides to binary variables, testing 24 nucleotide assignments and four encoding methods.

Result: One-hot and domain-wall encodings perform best, with domain-wall favoring guanine and cytosine in boundary positions for stable structures.

Conclusion: FMQA is effective for RNA inverse folding, with encoding choices impacting solution quality and thermodynamic stability.

Abstract: The RNA inverse folding problem aims to identify nucleotide sequences that preferentially adopt a given target secondary structure. While various heuristic and machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, many require a large number of sequence evaluations, which limits their applicability when experimental validation is costly. We propose a method to solve the problem using a factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA). FMQA is a discrete black-box optimization method reported to obtain high-quality solutions with a limited number of evaluations. Applying FMQA to the problem requires converting nucleotides into binary variables. However, the influence of integer-to-nucleotide assignments and binary-integer encoding on the performance of FMQA has not been thoroughly investigated, even though such choices determine the structure of the surrogate model and the search landscape, and thus can directly affect solution quality. Therefore, this study aims both to establish a novel FMQA framework for RNA inverse folding and to analyze the effects of these assignments and encoding methods. We evaluated all 24 possible assignments of the four nucleotides to the ordered integers (0-3), in combination with four binary-integer encoding methods. Our results demonstrated that one-hot and domain-wall encodings outperform binary and unary encodings in terms of the normalized ensemble defect value. In domain-wall encoding, nucleotides assigned to the boundary integers (0 and 3) appeared with higher frequency. In the RNA inverse folding problem, assigning guanine and cytosine to these boundary integers promoted their enrichment in stem regions, which led to more thermodynamically stable secondary structures than those obtained with one-hot encoding.

*Bo Pan,Peter Zhiping Zhang,Hao-Wei Pang,Alex Zhu,Xiang Yu,Liying Zhang,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a foundation model for generating diverse molecular analogs using Matched Molecular Pairs (MMPs), with improved controllability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML methods for molecular analog generation lack edit controllability or are limited by small models and restricted settings. This work aims to address these limitations.

Method: A variable-to-variable formulation trains a foundation model on large-scale MMP transformations (MMPTs). Prompting mechanisms and MMPT-RAG (retrieval-augmented framework) are introduced for controllability and contextual guidance.

Result: Experiments show improved diversity, novelty, and controllability, with realistic analog recovery in practical scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively generates diverse and controllable molecular analogs, advancing practical drug discovery.

Abstract: Matched molecular pairs (MMPs) capture the local chemical edits that medicinal chemists routinely use to design analogs, but existing ML approaches either operate at the whole-molecule level with limited edit controllability or learn MMP-style edits from restricted settings and small models. We propose a variable-to-variable formulation of analog generation and train a foundation model on large-scale MMP transformations (MMPTs) to generate diverse variables conditioned on an input variable. To enable practical control, we develop prompting mechanisms that let the users specify preferred transformation patterns during generation. We further introduce MMPT-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that uses external reference analogs as contextual guidance to steer generation and generalize from project-specific series. Experiments on general chemical corpora and patent-specific datasets demonstrate improved diversity, novelty, and controllability, and show that our method recovers realistic analog structures in practical discovery scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine unlearning's 'perfect retraining' poses privacy risks for undeleted data, enabling reconstruction attacks. Existing definitions are either vulnerable or overly restrictive. A new security definition safeguards undeleted data while supporting key functionalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses privacy risks in machine unlearning, particularly how 'perfect retraining' can expose undeleted data to reconstruction attacks.

Method: The authors analyze existing definitions, present a reconstruction attack, and propose a new security definition to protect undeleted data.

Result: They show existing definitions are flawed and demonstrate their new definition supports essential functionalities like summation and statistical learning.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a secure framework for machine unlearning that balances privacy and functionality.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific data points from a trained model, often striving to emulate "perfect retraining", i.e., producing the model that would have been obtained had the deleted data never been included. We demonstrate that this approach, and security definitions that enable it, carry significant privacy risks for the remaining (undeleted) data points. We present a reconstruction attack showing that for certain tasks, which can be computed securely without deletions, a mechanism adhering to perfect retraining allows an adversary controlling merely $ω(1)$ data points to reconstruct almost the entire dataset merely by issuing deletion requests. We survey existing definitions for machine unlearning, showing they are either susceptible to such attacks or too restrictive to support basic functionalities like exact summation. To address this problem, we propose a new security definition that specifically safeguards undeleted data against leakage caused by the deletion of other points. We show that our definition permits several essential functionalities, such as bulletin boards, summations, and statistical learning.

### [195] [Causality is Key for Interpretability Claims to Generalise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16698)
*Shruti Joshi,Aaron Mueller,David Klindt,Wieland Brendel,Patrik Reizinger,Dhanya Sridhar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses how causal inference frameworks, particularly Pearl's hierarchy, can improve the rigor and generalizability of interpretability studies in LLMs by clarifying what claims can be supported by different types of evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address pitfalls in LLM interpretability research, such as non-generalizable findings and overreaching causal interpretations, by leveraging causal inference principles.

Method: Applies Pearl's causal hierarchy to classify interpretability claims (associations, interventions, counterfactuals) and introduces causal representation learning (CRL) to specify recoverable variables from model activations.

Result: Demonstrates how CRL operationalizes the hierarchy, enabling practitioners to match methods and evaluations to evidence for generalizable findings.

Conclusion: Causal inference provides a structured framework to enhance the validity and robustness of interpretability studies in LLMs.

Abstract: Interpretability research on large language models (LLMs) has yielded important insights into model behaviour, yet recurring pitfalls persist: findings that do not generalise, and causal interpretations that outrun the evidence. Our position is that causal inference specifies what constitutes a valid mapping from model activations to invariant high-level structures, the data or assumptions needed to achieve it, and the inferences it can support. Specifically, Pearl's causal hierarchy clarifies what an interpretability study can justify. Observations establish associations between model behaviour and internal components. Interventions (e.g., ablations or activation patching) support claims how these edits affect a behavioural metric (\eg, average change in token probabilities) over a set of prompts. However, counterfactual claims -- i.e., asking what the model output would have been for the same prompt under an unobserved intervention -- remain largely unverifiable without controlled supervision. We show how causal representation learning (CRL) operationalises this hierarchy, specifying which variables are recoverable from activations and under what assumptions. Together, these motivate a diagnostic framework that helps practitioners select methods and evaluations matching claims to evidence such that findings generalise.

### [196] [Knowledge-Embedded Latent Projection for Robust Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16709)
*Weijing Tang,Ming Yuan,Zongqi Xia,Tianxi Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a knowledge-embedded latent projection model leveraging external semantic embeddings to address imbalanced data challenges in EHRs. It combines scalable estimation with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced data dimensions (e.g., limited patients vs. large feature space) in EHRs complicate latent space model estimation. External semantic embeddings offer regularization potential.

Method: A two-step procedure: semantically guided subspace construction via kernel PCA, followed by scalable projected gradient descent. Column embeddings are smooth functions of semantic embeddings.

Result: Estimation error bounds and local convergence guarantees are provided. Simulations and EHR application confirm effectiveness.

Conclusion: The method successfully leverages semantic embeddings to improve latent space modeling in imbalanced regimes, supported by theory and practical validation.

Abstract: Latent space models are widely used for analyzing high-dimensional discrete data matrices, such as patient-feature matrices in electronic health records (EHRs), by capturing complex dependence structures through low-dimensional embeddings. However, estimation becomes challenging in the imbalanced regime, where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other. In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system. Motivated by the increasing availability of external semantic embeddings, such as pre-trained embeddings of clinical concepts in EHRs, we propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning. Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and a real-world EHR application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Richard Willis,Jianing Zhao,Yali Du,Joel Z. Leibo*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A framework evaluates LLM-powered autonomous agents' collective behavior in social dilemmas, revealing newer models may worsen societal outcomes when prioritizing individual gain, with risks of poor equilibria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding collective behavior of LLM-powered agents in social dilemmas is crucial as they are increasingly deployed in society.

Method: An evaluation framework enables inspection of LLM-generated strategies encoded as algorithms, scaling to hundreds of agents.

Result: Newer models tend to worsen societal outcomes when prioritizing individual gain, with convergence risks to poor equilibria.

Conclusion: The study warns of risks in deploying LLM agents without evaluating collective behavior and releases an evaluation suite.

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by LLM are increasingly deployed in society, understanding their collective behaviour in social dilemmas becomes critical. We introduce an evaluation framework where LLMs generate strategies encoded as algorithms, enabling inspection prior to deployment and scaling to populations of hundreds of agents -- substantially larger than in previous work. We find that more recent models tend to produce worse societal outcomes compared to older models when agents prioritise individual gain over collective benefits. Using cultural evolution to model user selection of agents, our simulations reveal a significant risk of convergence to poor societal equilibria, particularly when the relative benefit of cooperation diminishes and population sizes increase. We release our code as an evaluation suite for developers to assess the emergent collective behaviour of their models.

### [198] [Consensus Based Task Allocation for Angles-Only Local Catalog Maintenance of Satellite Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16678)
*Harrison Perone,Christopher W. Hays*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A decentralized task allocation algorithm improves relative state estimation for satellites using angles-only measurements, outperforming current methods in fuel usage and catalog uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate relative state estimation for satellites and debris is challenging with ground-based tracking, necessitating space-based solutions for better coordination and efficiency.

Method: A decentralized task allocation algorithm is proposed to schedule and coordinate observations among satellites using angles-only limited FOV measurements.

Result: Numerical simulations show the new method significantly reduces fuel usage and catalog uncertainty compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The decentralized algorithm effectively addresses the challenge of coordinating satellite observations, improving both fuel efficiency and state estimation accuracy.

Abstract: In order for close proximity satellites to safely perform their missions, the relative states of all satellites and pieces of debris must be well understood. This presents a problem for ground based tracking and orbit determination since it may not be practical to achieve the required accuracy. Using space-based sensors allows for more accurate relative state estimates, especially if multiple satellites are allowed to communicate. Of interest to this work is the case where several communicating satellites each need to maintain a local catalog of communicating and non-communicating objects using angles-only limited field of view (FOV) measurements. However, this introduces the problem of efficiently scheduling and coordinating observations among the agents. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation algorithm to address this problem and quantifies its performance in terms of fuel usage and overall catalog uncertainty via numerical simulation. It was found that the new method significantly outperforms the uncertainty-fuel Pareto frontier formed by current approaches.

*J. Martin Smit,Fernando P. Santos*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper explores how biased rating systems in digital platforms can perpetuate discrimination and proposes evolutionary game theory to design fairer systems while maintaining service quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how digital platforms can reduce discrimination caused by biased rating systems without compromising service quality incentives.

Method: Uses an evolutionary game theoretical model to study platform decisions on promoting high-reputation or protected-group service providers.

Result: Identifies a trade-off between user experience and fairness, showing that adjusting search result demographics effectively reduces unfairness with minimal user impact.

Conclusion: Proactive anti-discrimination design in rating-based systems can enhance fairness while preserving cooperative behavior incentives.

Abstract: The digital services economy consists of online platforms that facilitate interactions between service providers and consumers. This ecosystem is characterized by short-term, often one-off, transactions between parties that have no prior familiarity. To establish trust among users, platforms employ rating systems which allow users to report on the quality of their previous interactions. However, while arguably crucial for these platforms to function, rating systems can perpetuate negative biases against marginalised groups. This paper investigates how to design platforms around biased reputation systems, reducing discrimination while maintaining incentives for all service providers to offer high quality service for users. We introduce an evolutionary game theoretical model to study how digital platforms can perpetuate or counteract rating-based discrimination. We focus on the platforms' decisions to promote service providers who have high reputations or who belong to a specific protected group. Our results demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between user experience and fairness: promoting highly-rated providers benefits users, but lowers the demand for marginalised providers against which the ratings are biased. Our results also provide evidence that intervening by tuning the demographics of the search results is a highly effective way of reducing unfairness while minimally impacting users. Furthermore, we show that even when precise measurements on the level of rating bias affecting marginalised service providers is unavailable, there is still potential to improve upon a recommender system which ignores protected characteristics. Altogether, our model highlights the benefits of proactive anti-discrimination design in systems where ratings are used to promote cooperative behaviour.

*Jieyi Bi,Zhiguang Cao,Jianan Zhou,Wen Song,Yaoxin Wu,Jie Zhang,Yining Ma,Cathy Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CaR is a novel Constraint-and-Refine framework for neural routing solvers, improving efficiency and feasibility handling via joint training and shared representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural solvers struggle with hard constraints, lacking efficient or applicable constraint-handling methods.

Method: CaR introduces a joint training framework with construction-improvement-shared representation, enabling lightweight refinement (e.g., 10 steps vs. 5k).

Result: CaR outperforms classical and neural solvers in feasibility, quality, and efficiency for hard routing constraints.

Conclusion: CaR provides a general, efficient solution for neural routing solvers to handle complex constraints effectively.

Abstract: Neural solvers have achieved impressive progress in addressing simple routing problems, particularly excelling in computational efficiency. However, their advantages under complex constraints remain nascent, for which current constraint-handling schemes via feasibility masking or implicit feasibility awareness can be inefficient or inapplicable for hard constraints. In this paper, we present Construct-and-Refine (CaR), the first general and efficient constraint-handling framework for neural routing solvers based on explicit learning-based feasibility refinement. Unlike prior construction-search hybrids that target reducing optimality gaps through heavy improvements yet still struggle with hard constraints, CaR achieves efficient constraint handling by designing a joint training framework that guides the construction module to generate diverse and high-quality solutions well-suited for a lightweight improvement process, e.g., 10 steps versus 5k steps in prior work. Moreover, CaR presents the first use of construction-improvement-shared representation, enabling potential knowledge sharing across paradigms by unifying the encoder, especially in more complex constrained scenarios. We evaluate CaR on typical hard routing constraints to showcase its broader applicability. Results demonstrate that CaR achieves superior feasibility, solution quality, and efficiency compared to both classical and neural state-of-the-art solvers.

*Cameron Cagan,Pedram Fard,Jiazi Tian,Jingya Cheng,Shawn N. Murphy,Hossein Estiri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autonomous agentic workflows can degrade performance over iterations, especially for low-prevalence tasks. A retrospective selector agent effectively prevents catastrophic failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate the failure modes of autonomous AI systems, particularly the paradoxical degradation of performance during iterative improvement, such as in low-prevalence clinical symptom detection.

Method: Used the Pythia framework for automated prompt optimization on three clinical symptoms with varying prevalence (23%, 12%, 3%). Evaluated interventions like a guiding agent and a selector agent to stabilize performance.

Result: Validation sensitivity oscillated severely for low-prevalence symptoms (e.g., 3% prevalence). The selector agent successfully prevented catastrophic failure, outperforming expert-curated lexicons (331% F1 improvement for brain fog, 7% for chest pain).

Conclusion: Retrospective selection is more effective than active intervention for stabilizing autonomous AI systems in low-prevalence classification tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous agentic workflows that iteratively refine their own behavior hold considerable promise, yet their failure modes remain poorly characterized. We investigate optimization instability, a phenomenon in which continued autonomous improvement paradoxically degrades classifier performance, using Pythia, an open-source framework for automated prompt optimization. Evaluating three clinical symptoms with varying prevalence (shortness of breath at 23%, chest pain at 12%, and Long COVID brain fog at 3%), we observed that validation sensitivity oscillated between 1.0 and 0.0 across iterations, with severity inversely proportional to class prevalence. At 3% prevalence, the system achieved 95% accuracy while detecting zero positive cases, a failure mode obscured by standard evaluation metrics. We evaluated two interventions: a guiding agent that actively redirected optimization, amplifying overfitting rather than correcting it, and a selector agent that retrospectively identified the best-performing iteration successfully prevented catastrophic failure. With selector agent oversight, the system outperformed expert-curated lexicons on brain fog detection by 331% (F1) and chest pain by 7%, despite requiring only a single natural language term as input. These findings characterize a critical failure mode of autonomous AI systems and demonstrate that retrospective selection outperforms active intervention for stabilization in low-prevalence classification tasks.

TL;DR: The paper examines uncertainty quantification methods in LLM-based automatic assessment to improve reliability in educational grading, benchmarking various approaches across datasets and model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs offer adaptability in educational assessment but introduce uncertainty due to their probabilistic nature, which can disrupt learning if not properly calibrated.

Method: Benchmarks diverse uncertainty quantification methods across multiple assessment datasets, LLM families, and generation control settings.

Result: Characterizes uncertainty patterns in LLM grading, evaluates strengths/limitations of metrics, and analyzes factors like model families and tasks.

Conclusion: Provides insights for developing reliable uncertainty-aware grading systems in LLM-based educational assessment.

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) is reshaping the landscape of automatic assessment in education. While these systems demonstrate substantial advantages in adaptability to diverse question types and flexibility in output formats, they also introduce new challenges related to output uncertainty, stemming from the inherently probabilistic nature of LLMs. Output uncertainty is an inescapable challenge in automatic assessment, as assessment results often play a critical role in informing subsequent pedagogical actions, such as providing feedback to students or guiding instructional decisions. Unreliable or poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates can lead to unstable downstream interventions, potentially disrupting students' learning processes and resulting in unintended negative consequences. To systematically understand this challenge and inform future research, we benchmark a broad range of uncertainty quantification methods in the context of LLM-based automatic assessment. Although the effectiveness of these methods has been demonstrated in many tasks across other domains, their applicability and reliability in educational settings, particularly for automatic grading, remain underexplored. Through comprehensive analyses of uncertainty behaviors across multiple assessment datasets, LLM families, and generation control settings, we characterize the uncertainty patterns exhibited by LLMs in grading scenarios. Based on these findings, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of different uncertainty metrics and analyze the influence of key factors, including model families, assessment tasks, and decoding strategies, on uncertainty estimates. Our study provides actionable insights into the characteristics of uncertainty in LLM-based automatic assessment and lays the groundwork for developing more reliable and effective uncertainty-aware grading systems in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subspecialty clinical reasoning is challenging due to evolving guidelines and nuanced evidence; Mirror aims to address this with structured, evidence-linked outputs.

Method: Mirror integrates a curated evidence corpus with structured reasoning, tested against LLMs with web access on a 120-question endocrinology exam.

Result: Mirror achieved 87.5% accuracy, surpassing humans (62.3%) and LLMs (74.6%, 74.0%, 69.8%), with strong evidence traceability (74.2% citations verified).

Conclusion: Curated evidence with provenance outperforms unconstrained web retrieval for subspecialty reasoning and ensures auditability for clinical use.

Abstract: Background: Large language models have demonstrated strong performance on general medical examinations, but subspecialty clinical reasoning remains challenging due to rapidly evolving guidelines and nuanced evidence hierarchies. Methods: We evaluated January Mirror, an evidence-grounded clinical reasoning system, against frontier LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Pro) on a 120-question endocrinology board-style examination. Mirror integrates a curated endocrinology and cardiometabolic evidence corpus with a structured reasoning architecture to generate evidence-linked outputs. Mirror operated under a closed-evidence constraint without external retrieval. Comparator LLMs had real-time web access to guidelines and primary literature. Results: Mirror achieved 87.5% accuracy (105/120; 95% CI: 80.4-92.3%), exceeding a human reference of 62.3% and frontier LLMs including GPT-5.2 (74.6%), GPT-5 (74.0%), and Gemini-3-Pro (69.8%). On the 30 most difficult questions (human accuracy less than 50%), Mirror achieved 76.7% accuracy. Top-2 accuracy was 92.5% for Mirror versus 85.25% for GPT-5.2. Conclusions: Mirror provided evidence traceability: 74.2% of outputs cited at least one guideline-tier source, with 100% citation accuracy on manual verification. Curated evidence with explicit provenance can outperform unconstrained web retrieval for subspecialty clinical reasoning and supports auditability for clinical deployment.

*Martin Klissarov,Jonathan Cook,Diego Antognini,Hao Sun,Jingling Li,Natasha Jaques,Claudiu Musat,Edward Grefenstette*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to train large language models in interactive learning from feedback, showing significant improvements in dynamic adaptation and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models lack interactive feedback loops, which are crucial for dynamic adaptation in collaborative learning.

Method: The authors transform single-turn tasks into multi-turn interactions using information asymmetry and train models to learn from feedback.

Result: Smaller models trained with the method nearly match larger models' performance and show strong generalization across domains.

Conclusion: The approach enhances in-context plasticity and enables self-correction, offering a unified path for model self-improvement.

Abstract: Adapting one's thought process based on corrective feedback is an essential ability in human learning, particularly in collaborative settings. In contrast, the current large language model training paradigm relies heavily on modeling vast, static corpora. While effective for knowledge acquisition, it overlooks the interactive feedback loops essential for models to adapt dynamically to their context. In this work, we propose a framework that treats this interactive in-context learning ability not as an emergent property, but as a distinct, trainable skill. We introduce a scalable method that transforms single-turn verifiable tasks into multi-turn didactic interactions driven by information asymmetry. We first show that current flagship models struggle to integrate corrective feedback on hard reasoning tasks. We then demonstrate that models trained with our approach dramatically improve the ability to interactively learn from language feedback. More specifically, the multi-turn performance of a smaller model nearly reaches that of a model an order of magnitude larger. We also observe robust out-of-distribution generalization: interactive training on math problems transfers to diverse domains like coding, puzzles and maze navigation. Our qualitative analysis suggests that this improvement is due to an enhanced in-context plasticity. Finally, we show that this paradigm offers a unified path to self-improvement. By training the model to predict the teacher's critiques, effectively modeling the feedback environment, we convert this external signal into an internal capability, allowing the model to self-correct even without a teacher.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' ability to reason about GPS coordinates and real-world geography is underexplored despite their deployment in physical-world applications.

Method: Introduces GPSBench, a dataset of 57,800 samples across 17 tasks, evaluating 14 state-of-the-art LLMs on geospatial reasoning without relying on tools.

Result: LLMs perform better at real-world geographic reasoning than geometric computations, with hierarchical degradation in geographic knowledge. Coordinate augmentation improves downstream tasks.

Conclusion: GPS reasoning remains challenging for LLMs, with finetuning introducing trade-offs between geometric computation and world knowledge degradation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in applications that interact with the physical world, such as navigation, robotics, or mapping, making robust geospatial reasoning a critical capability. Despite that, LLMs' ability to reason about GPS coordinates and real-world geography remains underexplored. We introduce GPSBench, a dataset of 57,800 samples across 17 tasks for evaluating geospatial reasoning in LLMs, spanning geometric coordinate operations (e.g., distance and bearing computation) and reasoning that integrates coordinates with world knowledge. Focusing on intrinsic model capabilities rather than tool use, we evaluate 14 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that GPS reasoning remains challenging, with substantial variation across tasks: models are generally more reliable at real-world geographic reasoning than at geometric computations. Geographic knowledge degrades hierarchically, with strong country-level performance but weak city-level localization, while robustness to coordinate noise suggests genuine coordinate understanding rather than memorization. We further show that GPS-coordinate augmentation can improve in downstream geospatial tasks, and that finetuning induces trade-offs between gains in geometric computation and degradation in world knowledge.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI agents often fail to align with dynamic user preferences due to reliance on static datasets, necessitating a solution for continual personalization.

Result: PAHF learns faster and outperforms baselines, reducing personalization error and adapting quickly to preference shifts.

Conclusion: Explicit memory and dual feedback channels are crucial for effective continual personalization in AI agents.

Abstract: Modern AI agents are powerful but often fail to align with the idiosyncratic, evolving preferences of individual users. Prior approaches typically rely on static datasets, either training implicit preference models on interaction history or encoding user profiles in external memory. However, these approaches struggle with new users and with preferences that change over time. We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms both no-memory and single-channel baselines, reducing initial personalization error and enabling rapid adaptation to preference shifts.

*Philipp Schoenegger,Matt Carlson,Chris Schneider,Chris Daly*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a certification protocol to ensure consistent communication in multiagent AI systems by verifying shared understanding of terms, reducing disagreement significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of methods to verify shared understanding of terms in multiagent AI systems, balancing interpretability and efficiency.

Method: Proposes a certification protocol using the stimulus-meaning model, testing agents on shared events and certifying terms if empirical disagreement is below a threshold. Includes core-guarded reasoning, recertification, and renegotiation.

Result: Core-guarding reduces disagreement by 72-96% in simulations and by 51% in language model validations.

Conclusion: The framework is a first step toward verifiable agent-to-agent communication, effectively mitigating semantic drift.

Abstract: Multiagent AI systems require consistent communication, but we lack methods to verify that agents share the same understanding of the terms used. Natural language is interpretable but vulnerable to semantic drift, while learned protocols are efficient but opaque. We propose a certification protocol based on the stimulus-meaning model, where agents are tested on shared observable events and terms are certified if empirical disagreement falls below a statistical threshold. In this protocol, agents restricting their reasoning to certified terms ("core-guarded reasoning") achieve provably bounded disagreement. We also outline mechanisms for detecting drift (recertification) and recovering shared vocabulary (renegotiation). In simulations with varying degrees of semantic divergence, core-guarding reduces disagreement by 72-96%. In a validation with fine-tuned language models, disagreement is reduced by 51%. Our framework provides a first step towards verifiable agent-to-agent communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Training AI agents in high-fidelity RL environments like CoreCraft enhances generalization beyond training data, improving task pass rates and transfer performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that high-fidelity RL environments can produce AI agents with generalizable capabilities beyond their training distribution.

Method: Introduces CoreCraft, a detailed enterprise simulation, and trains GLM~4.6 using GRPO and adaptive clipping.

Result: Task pass rate improves from 25.37% to 36.76%, with notable gains on out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: Environment quality, diversity, and realism are crucial for developing generalizable AI agent capabilities.

Abstract: We show that training AI agents on high-fidelity reinforcement learning environments produces capabilities that generalize beyond the training distribution. We introduce \corecraft{}, the first environment in \textsc{EnterpriseGym}, Surge AI's suite of agentic RL environments. \corecraft{} is a fully operational enterprise simulation of a customer support organization, comprising over 2,500 entities across 14 entity types with 23 unique tools, designed to measure whether AI agents can perform the multi-step, domain-specific work that real jobs demand. Frontier models such as GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.6 solve fewer than 30\% of tasks when all expert-authored rubric criteria must be satisfied. Using this environment, we train GLM~4.6 with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and adaptive clipping. After a single epoch of training, the model improves from 25.37\% to 36.76\% task pass rate on held-out evaluation tasks. More importantly, these gains transfer to out-of-distribution benchmarks: +4.5\% on BFCL Parallel, +7.4\% on $τ^2$-Bench Retail, and +6.8\% on Toolathlon (Pass@1). We believe three environment properties are consistent with the observed transfer: task-centric world building that optimizes for diverse, challenging tasks; expert-authored rubrics enabling reliable reward computation; and enterprise workflows that reflect realistic professional patterns. Our results suggest that environment quality, diversity, and realism are key factors enabling generalizable agent capabilities.

### [209] [Causally-Guided Automated Feature Engineering with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16435)
*Arun Vignesh Malarkkan,Wangyang Ying,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAFE is a causally-guided framework for automated feature engineering (AFE) that outperforms statistical methods by improving robustness and efficiency through causal priors and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics, resulting in brittle features that fail under distribution shift. CAFE addresses this by integrating causal discovery with reinforcement learning.

Method: CAFE has two phases: Phase I learns causal priors via a sparse directed acyclic graph, grouping features by causal influence. Phase II uses multi-agent deep Q-learning to select causal groups and transformations, guided by hierarchical rewards.

Result: CAFE improves performance by up to 7% over baselines, reduces convergence time, and maintains robustness under distribution shifts, with more compact and stable feature sets.

Conclusion: Using causal structure as a soft inductive prior enhances AFE robustness and efficiency, as demonstrated by CAFE's superior performance.

Abstract: Automated feature engineering (AFE) enables AI systems to autonomously construct high-utility representations from raw tabular data. However, existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics, yielding brittle features that fail under distribution shift. We introduce CAFE, a framework that reformulates AFE as a causally-guided sequential decision process, bridging causal discovery with reinforcement learning-driven feature construction. Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and the target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on their causal influence with respect to the target. Phase II uses a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that favor causally plausible transformations while controlling feature complexity. Across 15 public benchmarks (classification with macro-F1; regression with inverse relative absolute error), CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline, and produces more compact feature sets with more stable post-hoc attributions. These findings underscore that causal structure, used as a soft inductive prior rather than a rigid constraint, can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering.

TL;DR: The paper critiques the 'extract then store' paradigm in AI memory systems, advocating for 'store then on-demand extract' and other unexplored approaches to reduce information loss and enhance adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inherent limitations in current AI memory systems, particularly information loss during extraction, and explore alternative approaches for achieving artificial superintelligence.

Method: Proposes alternative memory approaches: 'store then on-demand extract,' deeper insights from probabilistic experiences, and efficient experience sharing. Validates with simple experiments.

Result: Experiments confirm the intuitive effectiveness of the proposed approaches in mitigating information loss and improving adaptability.

Conclusion: Highlights challenges hindering investigation into these directions and suggests future research topics to overcome them.

Abstract: Driven by our mission of "uplifting the world with memory," this paper explores the design concept of "memory" that is essential for achieving artificial superintelligence (ASI). Rather than proposing novel methods, we focus on several alternative approaches whose potential benefits are widely imaginable, yet have remained largely unexplored. The currently dominant paradigm, which can be termed "extract then store," involves extracting information judged to be useful from experiences and saving only the extracted content. However, this approach inherently risks the loss of information, as some valuable knowledge particularly for different tasks may be discarded in the extraction process. In contrast, we emphasize the "store then on-demand extract" approach, which seeks to retain raw experiences and flexibly apply them to various tasks as needed, thus avoiding such information loss. In addition, we highlight two further approaches: discovering deeper insights from large collections of probabilistic experiences, and improving experience collection efficiency by sharing stored experiences. While these approaches seem intuitively effective, our simple experiments demonstrate that this is indeed the case. Finally, we discuss major challenges that have limited investigation into these promising directions and propose research topics to address them.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Proxy State-Based Evaluation, a scalable LLM-driven framework for benchmarking interactive LLM agents without needing deterministic backends, offering reliable rankings and transferable training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for interactive LLM agents rely on deterministic backends, which are expensive and inflexible. A more scalable and practical alternative is needed for industrial use.

Method: The proposed framework uses LLM-driven simulations where scenarios specify goals, facts, and expected outcomes. An LLM state tracker infers proxy states from interactions, and LLM judges verify goal completion and detect errors against scenario constraints.

Result: The benchmark produces stable model rankings, transferable supervision for training, and achieves near-zero hallucination rates. Human-LLM judge agreement exceeds 90%, showing reliable automated evaluation.

Conclusion: Proxy State-Based Evaluation is a practical and scalable solution for benchmarking industrial LLM agents, outperforming deterministic backends in flexibility and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Interactive large language model (LLM) agents operating via multi-turn dialogue and multi-step tool calling are increasingly used in production. Benchmarks for these agents must both reliably compare models and yield on-policy training data. Prior agentic benchmarks (e.g., tau-bench, tau2-bench, AppWorld) rely on fully deterministic backends, which are costly to build and iterate. We propose Proxy State-Based Evaluation, an LLM-driven simulation framework that preserves final state-based evaluation without a deterministic database. Specifically, a scenario specifies the user goal, user/system facts, expected final state, and expected agent behavior, and an LLM state tracker infers a structured proxy state from the full interaction trace. LLM judges then verify goal completion and detect tool/user hallucinations against scenario constraints. Empirically, our benchmark produces stable, model-differentiating rankings across families and inference-time reasoning efforts, and its on-/off-policy rollouts provide supervision that transfers to unseen scenarios. Careful scenario specification yields near-zero simulator hallucination rates as supported by ablation studies. The framework also supports sensitivity analyses over user personas. Human-LLM judge agreement exceeds 90%, indicating reliable automated evaluation. Overall, proxy state-based evaluation offers a practical, scalable alternative to deterministic agentic benchmarks for industrial LLM agents.

TL;DR: Sequence models enable learning-aware cooperation among agents without hardcoded assumptions or timescale separation, adapting naturally to diverse co-players.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of fostering cooperation among self-interested agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Method: Training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players to induce in-context best-response strategies.

Result: Agents naturally learn cooperative behaviors through mutual shaping dynamics driven by vulnerability to extortion.

Conclusion: Decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models with co-player diversity offers a scalable approach to cooperative learning.

Abstract: Achieving cooperation among self-interested agents remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between "learning-aware" agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce a strict separation between "naive learners" updating on fast timescales and "meta-learners" observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) as imperfect experts in Causal Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) to combine semantic priors with observational data for causal discovery, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for expert knowledge in causal discovery by leveraging LLMs to provide semantic structural priors, enhancing the integration of data and expertise.

Method: Uses Causal ABA framework with LLMs to elicit priors from variable names and descriptions, combined with conditional-independence evidence. Tests on benchmarks and synthetic graphs.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and introduces a protocol to mitigate LLM memorisation bias in causal discovery evaluations.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively supplement expert knowledge in causal discovery when integrated with Causal ABA, improving performance and robustness.

Abstract: Causal discovery seeks to uncover causal relations from data, typically represented as causal graphs, and is essential for predicting the effects of interventions. While expert knowledge is required to construct principled causal graphs, many statistical methods have been proposed to leverage observational data with varying formal guarantees. Causal Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) is a framework that uses symbolic reasoning to ensure correspondence between input constraints and output graphs, while offering a principled way to combine data and expertise. We explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as imperfect experts for Causal ABA, eliciting semantic structural priors from variable names and descriptions and integrating them with conditional-independence evidence. Experiments on standard benchmarks and semantically grounded synthetic graphs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and we additionally introduce an evaluation protocol to mitigate memorisation bias when assessing LLMs for causal discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Framework of Thoughts (FoT) is introduced as a general-purpose foundation framework to enhance dynamic reasoning schemes in large language models, addressing limitations in adaptability and optimization of existing prompting schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompting schemes like Chain of Thought and Tree of Thoughts lack adaptability and optimization for dynamic or unseen problems, prompting the need for a more flexible and efficient framework.

Method: FoT provides built-in features for hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and intelligent caching to optimize reasoning schemes.

Result: Empirical results show FoT enables faster execution, cost reduction, and improved task scores by implementing Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, and ProbTree.

Conclusion: FoT offers a scalable and efficient solution for dynamic reasoning schemes, with potential for broader application in future developments.

Abstract: Prompting schemes such as Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, and Graph of Thoughts can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, most existing schemes require users to define static, problem-specific reasoning structures that lack adaptability to dynamic or unseen problem types. Additionally, these schemes are often under-optimized in terms of hyperparameters, prompts, runtime, and prompting cost. To address these limitations, we introduce Framework of Thoughts (FoT)--a general-purpose foundation framework for building and optimizing dynamic reasoning schemes. FoT comes with built-in features for hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and intelligent caching, unlocking the latent performance potential of reasoning schemes. We demonstrate FoT's capabilities by implementing three popular schemes--Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, and ProbTree--within FoT. We empirically show that FoT enables significantly faster execution, reduces costs, and achieves better task scores through optimization. We release our codebase to facilitate the development of future dynamic and efficient reasoning schemes.

TL;DR: A study explored whether AI can write poetry by shaping a language model into a digital poet through expert feedback, achieving human-like results in blind tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate AI's potential in creative writing, particularly poetry, and its implications for art and authorship.

Method: A large language model was refined over seven months using iterative expert feedback without retraining. It developed a unique style, corpus, and even a pen name and image.

Result: In blinded tests, AI poems were indistinguishable from human poems (AI labeled human 52%, human labeled human 54%). A commercial poetry collection by the AI was later published.

Conclusion: Workshop-style prompting can shape AI creativity effectively, challenging traditional views on authorship and renewing debates about art and machine creativity.

Abstract: Can a machine write good poetry? Any positive answer raises fundamental questions about the nature and value of art. We report a seven-month poetry workshop in which a large language model was shaped into a digital poet through iterative in-context expert feedback, without retraining. Across sessions, the model developed a distinctive style and a coherent corpus, supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses, and it produced a pen name and author image. In a blinded authorship test with 50 humanities students and graduates (three AI poems and three poems by well-known poets each), judgments were at chance: human poems were labeled human 54% of the time and AI poems 52%, with 95% confidence intervals including 50%. After the workshop, a commercial publisher released a poetry collection authored by the model. These results show that workshop-style prompting can support long-horizon creative shaping and renew debates on creativity and authorship.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the Agent Skill framework's effectiveness with small language models (SLMs), showing benefits for mid-sized SLMs (12B-30B parameters) and code-specialized variants (~80B parameters), while smaller models struggle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to determine if the Agent Skill paradigm, successful with proprietary models, can also enhance SLMs, addressing industrial needs for data security, budget constraints, and customization in scenarios where public APIs are unsuitable.

Method: The research introduces a formal mathematical definition of Agent Skills and systematically evaluates SLMs of varying sizes across open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims dataset.

Result: Mid-sized SLMs (12B-30B parameters) benefit significantly from Agent Skills, and code-specialized variants (~80B parameters) match closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency. Tiny models struggle with skill selection.

Conclusion: The findings offer actionable insights for deploying Agent Skills in SLM-centered environments, highlighting the framework's potential and limitations for smaller models.

Abstract: Agent Skill framework, now widely and officially supported by major players such as GitHub Copilot, LangChain, and OpenAI, performs especially well with proprietary models by improving context engineering, reducing hallucinations, and boosting task accuracy. Based on these observations, an investigation is conducted to determine whether the Agent Skill paradigm provides similar benefits to small language models (SLMs). This question matters in industrial scenarios where continuous reliance on public APIs is infeasible due to data-security and budget constraints requirements, and where SLMs often show limited generalization in highly customized scenarios. This work introduces a formal mathematical definition of the Agent Skill process, followed by a systematic evaluation of language models of varying sizes across multiple use cases. The evaluation encompasses two open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims data set. The results show that tiny models struggle with reliable skill selection, while moderately sized SLMs (approximately 12B - 30B) parameters) benefit substantially from the Agent Skill approach. Moreover, code-specialized variants at around 80B parameters achieve performance comparable to closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive and nuanced characterization of the capabilities and constraints of the framework, while providing actionable insights for the effective deployment of Agent Skills in SLM-centered environments.

TL;DR: The paper critiques current AI evaluations for oversimplifying agent performance into single success metrics, proposing twelve metrics across four dimensions (consistency, robustness, predictability, safety) to better assess reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discrepancy between high benchmark scores and real-world failures underscores the need for more nuanced evaluations that capture operational flaws.

Method: The authors propose twelve metrics decomposing agent reliability into consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety, evaluating 14 agent models across two benchmarks.

Result: Recent AI advancements show only marginal reliability improvements, revealing persistent limitations.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics provide a holistic performance profile, aiding better understanding of agent behavior, degradation, and failure.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed to execute important tasks. While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail.
