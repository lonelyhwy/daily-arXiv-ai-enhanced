### [1] [Replication Study: Federated Text-Driven Prompt Generation for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18439)
*Suraj Prasad,Anubha Pant*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A replication study of FedTPG validates its text-driven prompt generation network, showing improved generalization to unseen classes in federated learning while maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adapting vision-language models like CLIP to federated learning, especially for generalization to unseen classes.

Method: Replicates FedTPG's text-driven prompt generation network, evaluating it on six vision datasets without sharing private data.

Result: Achieves results within 0.2% of original accuracies, with 74.58% on base classes and 76.00% on new classes (+1.43pp improvement).

Conclusion: FedTPG's robustness and reproducibility are confirmed, validating its superior generalization and federated training benefits.

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities, yet their adaptation to federated learning scenarios presents significant
  challenges, particularly regarding generalization to unseen classes. The original FedTPG paper \cite{Qiu2024} addresses this limitation by introducing a text driven prompt generation network that dynamically creates prompts conditioned on class names, enabling better cross-class generalization in federated settings. In
  this work, we present a faithful replication study of FedTPG, evaluating the pre-trained model on six diverse vision datasets: Caltech101, Oxford Flowers, FGVC Aircraft,
  Oxford Pets, Food-101, and DTD. Our evaluation achieves results within 0.2\% of the original paper's reported accuracies, with an average accuracy of 74.58\% on seen
  (base) classes and 76.00\% on unseen (new) classes, demonstrating a +1.43 percentage point improvement in generalization. These results validate the original
  paper's core claims: (1) text-driven prompt generation enables superior generalization to unseen classes compared to static prompt learning methods, and (2)
  federated training of prompt generators maintains high performance across diverse visual domains without sharing private data. Our successful replication confirms
  the robustness and reproducibility of the FedTPG approach.

*Anvi Sud,Jialu Huang,Gregory R. Hart,Keshav Saxena,John Kim,Lauren Tressel,Jun Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COMPASS is an AI-driven system using temporal digital twins to model dynamic biological responses in NSCLC radiotherapy, predicting toxicity risks early by analyzing sequential PET, CT, and dosimetry data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current radiotherapy relies on static NTCP models, ignoring dynamic biological trajectories encoded in sequential data, which COMPASS aims to address.

Method: COMPASS employs a GRU autoencoder to learn organ-specific latent trajectories from per-fraction PET, CT, dosiomics, radiomics, and cumulative BED data, classified via logistic regression for toxicity prediction.

Result: Despite a small cohort, COMPASS identified early warning signals for toxicity, revealing spatially relevant dose textures missed by traditional dosimetry.

Conclusion: COMPASS demonstrates AI-driven adaptive radiotherapy potential, guiding treatment via continually updated digital twins tracking individual biological responses.

Abstract: Radiotherapy continues to become more precise and data dense, with current treatment regimens generating high frequency imaging and dosimetry streams ideally suited for AI driven temporal modeling to characterize how normal tissues evolve with time. Each fraction in biologically guided radiotherapy(BGRT) treated non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients records new metabolic, anatomical, and dose information. However, clinical decision making is largely informed by static, population based NTCP models which overlook the dynamic, unique biological trajectories encoded in sequential data. We developed COMPASS (Comprehensive Personalized Assessment System) for safe radiotherapy, functioning as a temporal digital twin architecture utilizing per fraction PET, CT, dosiomics, radiomics, and cumulative biologically equivalent dose (BED) kinetics to model normal tissue biology as a dynamic time series process. A GRU autoencoder was employed to learn organ specific latent trajectories, which were classified via logistic regression to predict eventual CTCAE grade 1 or higher toxicity. Eight NSCLC patients undergoing BGRT contributed to the 99 organ fraction observations covering 24 organ trajectories (spinal cord, heart, and esophagus). Despite the small cohort, intensive temporal phenotyping allowed for comprehensive analysis of individual dose response dynamics. Our findings revealed a viable AI driven early warning window, as increasing risk ratings occurred from several fractions before clinical toxicity. The dense BED driven representation revealed biologically relevant spatial dose texture characteristics that occur before toxicity and are averaged out with traditional volume based dosimetry. COMPASS establishes a proof of concept for AI enabled adaptive radiotherapy, where treatment is guided by a continually updated digital twin that tracks each patients evolving biological response.

### [3] [Scaling Ultrasound Volumetric Reconstruction via Mobile Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18500)
*Kian Wei Ng,Yujia Gao,Deborah Khoo,Ying Zhen Tan,Chengzheng Mao,Haojie Cheng,Andrew Makmur,Kee Yuan Ngiam,Serene Goh,Eng Tat Khoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARVUS is a resource-efficient system improving volumetric lesion measurement accuracy in ultrasound, reducing inter-user variability without specialized hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate volumetric lesion measurement is crucial for oncology, but 2D-US lacks precision and current 3D-US solutions are costly and less portable.

Method: MARVUS uses a foundation model for cross-specialty generalization and AR visualizations, requiring minimal hardware beyond conventional US systems.

Result: MARVUS improved volume estimation accuracy (mean difference: 0.469 cm3) and reduced inter-user variability (mean difference: 0.417 cm3) in breast phantom tests.

Conclusion: MARVUS offers scalable, cost-effective, and accurate volumetric assessment for cancer screening and treatment planning.

Abstract: Accurate volumetric characterization of lesions is essential for oncologic diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment planning. While imaging modalities such as Computed Tomography provide high-quality 3D data, 2D ultrasound (2D-US) remains the preferred first-line modality for breast and thyroid imaging due to cost, portability, and safety factors. However, volume estimates derived from 2D-US suffer from high inter-user variability even among experienced clinicians. Existing 3D ultrasound (3D-US) solutions use specialized probes or external tracking hardware, but such configurations increase costs and diminish portability, constraining widespread clinical use. To address these limitations, we present Mobile Augmented Reality Volumetric Ultrasound (MARVUS), a resource-efficient system designed to increase accessibility to accurate and reproducible volumetric assessment. MARVUS is interoperable with conventional ultrasound (US) systems, using a foundation model to enhance cross-specialty generalization while minimizing hardware requirements relative to current 3D-US solutions. In a user study involving experienced clinicians performing measurements on breast phantoms, MARVUS yielded a substantial improvement in volume estimation accuracy (mean difference: 0.469 cm3) with reduced inter-user variability (mean difference: 0.417 cm3). Additionally, we prove that augmented reality (AR) visualizations enhance objective performance metrics and clinician-reported usability. Collectively, our findings suggests that MARVUS can enhance US-based cancer screening, diagnostic workflows, and treatment planning in a scalable, cost-conscious, and resource-efficient manner.

### [4] [Mitigating Shortcut Learning via Feature Disentanglement in Medical Imaging: A Benchmark Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18502)
*Sarah Müller,Philipp Berens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates feature disentanglement methods to mitigate shortcut learning in medical imaging, showing improved classification performance under strong spurious correlations and highlighting the benefits of combining data-centric and model-centric approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging may rely on spurious correlations (shortcut learning), risking generalization across clinical settings. Feature disentanglement aims to separate task-relevant features from confounders to address this issue.

Method: Systematically evaluated adversarial learning and latent space splitting for disentanglement. Assessed classification performance and disentanglement quality on artificial and medical datasets with natural/synthetic confounders, tested robustness, and compared computational efficiency.

Result: Shortcut mitigation improved performance under strong spurious correlations. Latent space analyses revealed representation quality differences. Best models combined data-centric rebalancing with model-centric disentanglement, achieving robust mitigation while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: Combining data-centric and model-centric approaches enhances shortcut mitigation in medical imaging, improving robustness and maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Although deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve excellent classification performance, they can rely on shortcut learning, exploiting spurious correlations or confounding factors that are not causally related to the target task. This poses risks in clinical settings, where models must generalize across institutions, populations, and acquisition conditions. Feature disentanglement is a promising approach to mitigate shortcut learning by separating task-relevant information from confounder-related features in latent representations. In this study, we systematically evaluated feature disentanglement methods for mitigating shortcuts in medical imaging, including adversarial learning and latent space splitting based on dependence minimization. We assessed classification performance and disentanglement quality using latent space analyses across one artificial and two medical datasets with natural and synthetic confounders. We also examined robustness under varying levels of confounding and compared computational efficiency across methods. We found that shortcut mitigation methods improved classification performance under strong spurious correlations during training. Latent space analyses revealed differences in representation quality not captured by classification metrics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each method. Model reliance on shortcuts depended on the degree of confounding in the training data. The best-performing models combine data-centric rebalancing with model-centric disentanglement, achieving stronger and more robust shortcut mitigation than rebalancing alone while maintaining similar computational efficiency.

### [5] [A Computer Vision Framework for Multi-Class Detection and Tracking in Soccer Broadcast Footage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18504)
*Daniel Tshiani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI extracts player-level spatial data from single broadcast footage, enabling scalable soccer analytics without costly hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lower-budget teams lack access to expensive multi-camera or GPS tracking systems, limiting competitive data analysis. This paper explores affordable alternatives using standard broadcast footage.

Method: Develops an end-to-end system combining YOLO object detector and ByteTrack tracking algorithm to identify and track players, referees, goalkeepers, and the ball.

Result: High performance in detecting and tracking players/officials (strong precision, recall, mAP50), but ball detection remains challenging.

Conclusion: AI can extract meaningful spatial data from single-camera footage, making soccer analytics scalable and affordable for non-professional teams.

Abstract: Clubs with access to expensive multi-camera setups or GPS tracking systems gain a competitive advantage through detailed data, whereas lower-budget teams are often unable to collect similar information. This paper examines whether such data can instead be extracted directly from standard broadcast footage using a single-camera computer vision pipeline. This project develops an end-to-end system that combines a YOLO object detector with the ByteTrack tracking algorithm to identify and track players, referees, goalkeepers, and the ball throughout a match. Experimental results show that the pipeline achieves high performance in detecting and tracking players and officials, with strong precision, recall, and mAP50 scores, while ball detection remains the primary challenge. Despite this limitation, our findings demonstrate that AI can extract meaningful player-level spatial information from a single broadcast camera. By reducing reliance on specialized hardware, the proposed approach enables colleges, academies, and amateur clubs to adopt scalable, data-driven analysis methods previously accessible only to professional teams, highlighting the potential for affordable computer vision-based soccer analytics.

### [6] [Suppression or Deletion: A Restoration-Based Representation-Level Analysis of Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18505)
*Yurim Jang,Jaeung Lee,Dohyun Kim,Jaemin Jo,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a restoration-based framework to evaluate machine unlearning methods, revealing that most methods only suppress rather than delete information, and proposes new evaluation guidelines focused on representation-level verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to verify whether machine unlearning methods truly delete sensitive information, rather than just suppressing it, due to increasing reliance on shared pretrained models.

Method: A restoration-based analysis framework using Sparse Autoencoders to identify class-specific features and inference-time steering to distinguish suppression from deletion.

Result: Most unlearning methods achieve high restoration rates, indicating suppression rather than deletion, even retraining retains semantic features from pretraining.

Conclusion: Output-based metrics are insufficient; new evaluation criteria prioritizing representation-level verification are needed for privacy-critical applications.

Abstract: As pretrained models are increasingly shared on the web, ensuring that models can forget or delete sensitive, copyrighted, or private information upon request has become crucial. Machine unlearning has been proposed to address this challenge. However, current evaluations for unlearning methods rely on output-based metrics, which cannot verify whether information is completely deleted or merely suppressed at the representation level, where suppression is insufficient for true unlearning. To address this gap, we propose a novel restoration-based analysis framework that uses Sparse Autoencoders to identify class-specific expert features in intermediate layers and applies inference-time steering to quantitatively distinguish between suppression and deletion. Applying our framework to 12 major unlearning methods in image classification tasks, we find that most methods achieve high restoration rates of unlearned information, indicating that they only suppress information at the decision-boundary level, while preserving semantic features in intermediate representations. Notably, even retraining from pretrained checkpoints shows high restoration, revealing that robust semantic features inherited from pretraining are not removed by retraining. These results demonstrate that representation-level retention poses significant risks overlooked by output-based metrics, highlighting the need for new unlearning evaluation criteria. We propose new evaluation guidelines that prioritize representation-level verification, especially for privacy-critical applications in the era of pre-trained models.

### [7] [Depth from Defocus via Direct Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18509)
*Holly Jackson,Caleb Adams,Ignacio Lopez-Francos,Benjamin Recht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a feasible global optimization method for depth-from-defocus using alternating minimization, achieving better results than deep learning methods at higher resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recovering depth from defocused images is computationally challenging, but modern optimization methods and resources make global optimization feasible.

Method: Alternating minimization is used: fixing depth maps allows linear optimization for the all-in-focus image, and fixing the image enables parallel depth computation. Convex optimization and grid search are alternated.

Result: The method works effectively at higher resolutions than deep learning and shows promising results on synthetic and real benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that global optimization is viable for depth-from-defocus and outperforms prior methods.

Abstract: Though there exists a reasonable forward model for blur based on optical physics, recovering depth from a collection of defocused images remains a computationally challenging optimization problem. In this paper, we show that with contemporary optimization methods and reasonable computing resources, a global optimization approach to depth from defocus is feasible. Our approach rests on alternating minimization. When holding the depth map fixed, the forward model is linear with respect to the all-in-focus image. When holding the all-in-focus image fixed, the depth at each pixel can be computed independently, enabling embarrassingly parallel computation. We show that alternating between convex optimization and parallel grid search can effectively solve the depth-from-defocus problem at higher resolutions than current deep learning methods. We demonstrate our approach on benchmark datasets with synthetic and real defocus blur and show promising results compared to prior approaches. Our code is available at github.com/hollyjackson/dfd.

### [8] [Sketch2Feedback: Grammar-in-the-Loop Framework for Rubric-Aligned Feedback on Student STEM Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18520)
*Aayam Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sketch2Feedback introduces a grammar-in-the-loop framework to provide accurate, rubric-aligned feedback on student diagrams by combining hybrid perception and constrained VLM feedback, reducing hallucinations compared to end-to-end LMMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of providing timely and accurate feedback on student-drawn diagrams in STEM education, particularly addressing the issue of hallucination in large multimodal models (LMMs) which undermines trust in classroom use.

Method: A four-stage framework (hybrid perception, symbolic graph construction, constraint checking, and constrained VLM feedback) that uses a rule engine to verify violations before generating feedback, compared against end-to-end LMMs and other baselines.

Result: Qwen2-VL-7B achieved the highest micro-F1 scores (0.570 for free-body diagrams, 0.528 for circuits) but with high hallucination rates (0.78, 0.98). The grammar pipeline outperformed in producing actionable feedback (4.85/5 vs. 3.11/5) and reduced hallucinations with confidence thresholding.

Conclusion: The grammar-in-the-loop framework balances accuracy and trustworthiness in feedback generation, demonstrating the complementary benefits of combining symbolic and neural approaches, especially in noisy or domain-specific conditions.

Abstract: Providing timely, rubric-aligned feedback on student-drawn diagrams is a persistent challenge in STEM education. While large multimodal models (LMMs) can jointly parse images and generate explanations, their tendency to hallucinate undermines trust in classroom deployments. We present Sketch2Feedback, a grammar-in-the-loop framework that decomposes the problem into four stages -- hybrid perception, symbolic graph construction, constraint checking, and constrained VLM feedback -- so that the language model verbalizes only violations verified by an upstream rule engine. We evaluate on two synthetic micro-benchmarks, FBD-10 (free-body diagrams) and Circuit-10 (circuit schematics), each with 500 images spanning standard and hard noise augmentation tiers, comparing our pipeline against end-to-end LMMs (LLaVA-1.5-7B, Qwen2-VL-7B), a vision-only detector, a YOLOv8-nano learned detector, and an ensemble oracle. On n=100 test samples per benchmark with 95% bootstrap CIs, results are mixed and instructive: Qwen2-VL-7B achieves the highest micro-F1 on both FBDs (0.570) and circuits (0.528), but with extreme hallucination rates (0.78, 0.98). An ensemble oracle that selects the best prediction per sample reaches F1=0.556 with hallucination 0.320 on FBDs, demonstrating exploitable complementarity between grammar and end-to-end approaches. Confidence thresholding at tau=0.7 reduces circuit hallucination from 0.970 to 0.880 with no F1 loss. Hard noise augmentation reveals domain-dependent robustness: FBD detection is resilient while circuit detection degrades sharply. An LLM-as-judge evaluation confirms that the grammar pipeline produces more actionable circuit feedback (4.85/5) than the end-to-end LMM (3.11/5). We release all code, datasets, and evaluation scripts.

### [9] [Do Generative Metrics Predict YOLO Performance? An Evaluation Across Models, Augmentation Ratios, and Dataset Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18525)
*Vasile Marian,Yong-Bin Kang,Alexander Buddery*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates synthetic image augmentation for object detection, showing its impact varies by dataset and generator. It introduces metrics to predict performance and finds gains depend on regime and augmentation level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reliably evaluating synthetic datasets before training for object detection, as standard metrics often fail to predict downstream performance.

Method: Controlled evaluation of synthetic augmentation using six generators across three detection regimes, with metrics on global features and object-centric distributions. YOLOv11 is trained from scratch and with pretraining, tested on held-out splits.

Result: Synthetic augmentation significantly improves performance in challenging regimes (e.g., +30.6% mAP for PottedPlant) but offers marginal gains in simpler cases or with pretrained models. Metric-performance alignment varies by regime.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of synthetic augmentation depends on the dataset and augmentation level, with regime-specific metric-performance correlations. Standard metrics may not generalize across scenarios.

Abstract: Synthetic images are increasingly used to augment object-detection training sets, but reliably evaluating a synthetic dataset before training remains difficult: standard global generative metrics (e.g., FID) often do not predict downstream detection mAP. We present a controlled evaluation of synthetic augmentation for YOLOv11 across three single-class detection regimes -- Traffic Signs (sparse/near-saturated), Cityscapes Pedestrian (dense/occlusion-heavy), and COCO PottedPlant (multi-instance/high-variability). We benchmark six GAN-, diffusion-, and hybrid-based generators over augmentation ratios from 10% to 150% of the real training split, and train YOLOv11 both from scratch and with COCO-pretrained initialization, evaluating on held-out real test splits (mAP@0.50:0.95). For each dataset-generator-augmentation configuration, we compute pre-training dataset metrics under a matched-size bootstrap protocol, including (i) global feature-space metrics in both Inception-v3 and DINOv2 embeddings and (ii) object-centric distribution distances over bounding-box statistics. Synthetic augmentation yields substantial gains in the more challenging regimes (up to +7.6% and +30.6% relative mAP in Pedestrian and PottedPlant, respectively) but is marginal in Traffic Signs and under pretrained fine-tuning. To separate metric signal from augmentation quantity, we report both raw and augmentation-controlled (residualized) correlations with multiple-testing correction, showing that metric-performance alignment is strongly regime-dependent and that many apparent raw associations weaken after controlling for augmentation level.

### [10] [JAEGER: Joint 3D Audio-Visual Grounding and Reasoning in Simulated Physical Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18527)
*Zhan Liu,Changli Tang,Yuxin Wang,Zhiyuan Zhu,Youjun Chen,Yiwen Shao,Tianzi Wang,Lei Ke,Zengrui Jin,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JAEGER extends audio-visual large language models (AV-LLMs) to 3D space using RGB-D and multi-channel audio, improving spatial reasoning and source localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AV-LLMs are limited to 2D perception, hindering reliable spatial reasoning in 3D environments. JAEGER aims to address this gap.

Method: Introduces JAEGER with Neural IV, a learned spatial audio representation, and SpatialSceneQA, a benchmark for training and evaluation in 3D environments.

Result: JAEGER outperforms 2D baselines in spatial perception and reasoning tasks, highlighting the importance of 3D modeling.

Conclusion: Explicit 3D modeling is essential for advancing AI in physical environments, and JAEGER provides a robust framework for this purpose.

Abstract: Current audio-visual large language models (AV-LLMs) are predominantly restricted to 2D perception, relying on RGB video and monaural audio. This design choice introduces a fundamental dimensionality mismatch that precludes reliable source localization and spatial reasoning in complex 3D environments. We address this limitation by presenting JAEGER, a framework that extends AV-LLMs to 3D space, to enable joint spatial grounding and reasoning through the integration of RGB-D observations and multi-channel first-order ambisonics. A core contribution of our work is the neural intensity vector (Neural IV), a learned spatial audio representation that encodes robust directional cues to enhance direction-of-arrival estimation, even in adverse acoustic scenarios with overlapping sources. To facilitate large-scale training and systematic evaluation, we propose SpatialSceneQA, a benchmark of 61k instruction-tuning samples curated from simulated physical environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses 2D-centric baselines across diverse spatial perception and reasoning tasks, underscoring the necessity of explicit 3D modelling for advancing AI in physical environments. Our source code, pre-trained model checkpoints and datasets will be released upon acceptance.

*Hatice Karatas,Irfan Atabas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparison of 10 deep learning architectures for classifying Turkish black table olives shows EfficientNetV2-S has highest accuracy (95.8%) and EfficientNetB0 balances accuracy and complexity best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of various deep learning models for image-based classification of locally cultivated black table olive varieties under limited data conditions.

Method: Used transfer learning on 2500 images across 10 architectures (e.g., MobileNetV2, EfficientNetV2-S). Evaluated with metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and computational efficiency.

Result: EfficientNetV2-S achieved highest accuracy (95.8%), while EfficientNetB0 offered the best balance between accuracy and computational complexity.

Conclusion: Parametric efficiency is more critical than model depth alone for classification tasks with limited data.

Abstract: This study compares multiple deep learning architectures for the automated, image-based classification of five locally cultivated black table olive varieties in Turkey: Gemlik, Ayvalik, Uslu, Erkence, and Celebi. Using a dataset of 2500 images, ten architectures - MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetV2-S, ResNet50, ResNet101, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, ConvNeXt-Tiny, ViT-B16, and Swin-T - were trained using transfer learning. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen's Kappa, ROC-AUC, number of parameters, FLOPs, inference time, and generalization gap. EfficientNetV2-S achieved the highest classification accuracy (95.8%), while EfficientNetB0 provided the best trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. Overall, the results indicate that under limited data conditions, parametric efficiency plays a more critical role than model depth alone.

### [12] [VLANeXt: Recipes for Building Strong VLA Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18532)
*Xiao-Ming Wu,Bin Fan,Kang Liao,Jian-Jian Jiang,Runze Yang,Yihang Luo,Zhonghua Wu,Wei-Shi Zheng,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses fragmentation in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models by proposing VLANeXt, a simple yet effective model derived from systematic analysis of design choices, achieving superior performance on benchmarks and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify the fragmented and exploratory landscape of VLA models by identifying impactful design choices under a standardized framework.

Method: Systematic dissection of VLA design space along foundational components, perception essentials, and action modelling perspectives, starting from a baseline similar to RT-2 and OpenVLA.

Result: VLANeXt outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on LIBERO and LIBERO-plus benchmarks and shows strong real-world generalization.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical recipe (12 key findings) for building effective VLA models and releases a unified codebase for community use.

Abstract: Following the rise of large foundation models, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) emerged, leveraging strong visual and language understanding for general-purpose policy learning. Yet, the current VLA landscape remains fragmented and exploratory. Although many groups have proposed their own VLA models, inconsistencies in training protocols and evaluation settings make it difficult to identify which design choices truly matter. To bring structure to this evolving space, we reexamine the VLA design space under a unified framework and evaluation setup. Starting from a simple VLA baseline similar to RT-2 and OpenVLA, we systematically dissect design choices along three dimensions: foundational components, perception essentials, and action modelling perspectives. From this study, we distill 12 key findings that together form a practical recipe for building strong VLA models. The outcome of this exploration is a simple yet effective model, VLANeXt. VLANeXt outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on the LIBERO and LIBERO-plus benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization in real-world experiments. We will release a unified, easy-to-use codebase that serves as a common platform for the community to reproduce our findings, explore the design space, and build new VLA variants on top of a shared foundation.

### [13] [Morphological Addressing of Identity Basins in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18533)
*Andrew Fraser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper shows how morphological features guide text-to-image generation in Stable Diffusion, revealing navigable identity gradients and the impact of phonestheme-based prompts on visual coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explores how morphological descriptors and phonological patterns influence generative models, aiming to understand and manipulate identity formation in synthetic images.

Method: Uses Stable Diffusion 1.5 with morphological descriptors for identity navigation (Study 1) and phonestheme-based nonsense words to test visual coherence (Study 2).

Result: Morphological descriptors enable identity convergence via LoRA training, while phonestheme-bearing prompts yield more coherent images than random controls.

Conclusion: Morphological structure systematically shapes generative model outputs, demonstrating phase transitions and novel visual concepts from sub-lexical patterns.

Abstract: We demonstrate that morphological pressure creates navigable gradients at multiple levels of the text-to-image generative pipeline. In Study~1, identity basins in Stable Diffusion 1.5 can be navigated using morphological descriptors -- constituent features like platinum blonde,'' beauty mark,'' and 1950s glamour'' -- without the target's name or photographs. A self-distillation loop (generating synthetic images from descriptor prompts, then training a LoRA on those outputs) achieves consistent convergence toward a specific identity as measured by ArcFace similarity. The trained LoRA creates a local coordinate system shaping not only the target identity but also its inverse: maximal away-conditioning produces eldritch'' structural breakdown in base SD1.5, while the LoRA-equipped model produces ``uncanny valley'' outputs -- coherent but precisely wrong. In Study~2, we extend this to prompt-level morphology. Drawing on phonestheme theory, we generate 200 novel nonsense words from English sound-symbolic clusters (e.g., \emph{cr-}, \emph{sn-}, \emph{-oid}, \emph{-ax}) and find that phonestheme-bearing candidates produce significantly more visually coherent outputs than random controls (mean Purity@1 = 0.371 vs.\ 0.209, p<0.00001p < 0.00001 p<0.00001, Cohen's d=0.55d = 0.55 d=0.55). Three candidates -- \emph{snudgeoid}, \emph{crashax}, and \emph{broomix} -- achieve perfect visual consistency (Purity@1 = 1.0) with zero training data contamination, each generating a distinct, coherent visual identity from phonesthetic structure alone. Together, these studies establish that morphological structure -- whether in feature descriptors or prompt-level phonological form -- creates systematic navigational gradients through diffusion model latent spaces. We document phase transitions in identity basins, CFG-invariant identity stability, and novel visual concepts emerging from sub-lexical sound patterns.

### [14] [Rodent-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18540)
*Thomas Heap,Laurence Aitchison,Emma Cahill,Adriana Casado Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rodent-Bench evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for annotating rodent behavior footage, revealing their limitations despite diverse datasets and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess MLLMs' ability to automate behavioral annotation in neuroscience research, addressing gaps in temporal segmentation and subtle behavior detection.

Method: Evaluates state-of-the-art MLLMs (Gemini-2.5-Pro, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Qwen-VL-Max) using diverse rodent behavior datasets and standardized metrics like F1 and mutual information.

Result: No MLLMs performed strongly; modest results in grooming detection but poor temporal segmentation and handling of extended videos.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs struggle with rodent behavior annotation; Rodent-Bench sets a foundation for future model improvement in neuroscience.

Abstract: We present Rodent-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to annotate rodent behaviour footage. We evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs, including Gemini-2.5-Pro, Gemini-2.5-Flash and Qwen-VL-Max, using this benchmark and find that none of these models perform strongly enough to be used as an assistant for this task. Our benchmark encompasses diverse datasets spanning multiple behavioral paradigms including social interactions, grooming, scratching, and freezing behaviors, with videos ranging from 10 minutes to 35 minutes in length. We provide two benchmark versions to accommodate varying model capabilities and establish standardized evaluation metrics including second-wise accuracy, macro F1, mean average precision, mutual information, and Matthew's correlation coefficient. While some models show modest performance on certain datasets (notably grooming detection), overall results reveal significant challenges in temporal segmentation, handling extended video sequences, and distinguishing subtle behavioral states. Our analysis identifies key limitations in current MLLMs for scientific video annotation and provides insights for future model development. Rodent-Bench serves as a foundation for tracking progress toward reliable automated behavioral annotation in neuroscience research.

*Safwat Nusrat,Prithwiraj Bhattacharjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Benchmarking YOLO architectures for flower detection shows YOLOv8m excels in isolated scenarios, while YOLOv12n performs best in dense environments, highlighting the impact of annotation density and model optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancing automated agriculture requires precise flower localization and recognition for tasks like plant phenotyping and yield monitoring. The study aims to evaluate YOLO models under different annotation regimes to optimize detection accuracy.

Method: Various YOLO architectures (YOLOv5s, YOLOv8n/s/m, YOLOv12n) were benchmarked using the FloralSix dataset (2,816 images of six flower species). Evaluations used Precision, Recall, and mAP at IoU thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5-0.95 under SISBB and SIMBB annotation regimes.

Result: YOLOv8m (SGD) achieved top results in SISBB (Precision 0.956, Recall 0.951, mAP@0.5 0.978). For SIMBB, YOLOv12n (SGD) outperformed others (mAP@0.5 0.934, mAP@0.5:0.95 0.752). SGD consistently outperformed other optimizers.

Conclusion: Annotation density and model optimization significantly impact detection performance. Precision-focused models excel in sparse scenarios, while recall-optimized models handle dense environments better. These findings support applications like crop analysis and robotic pollination.

Abstract: Precise localization and recognition of flowers are crucial for advancing automated agriculture, particularly in plant phenotyping, crop estimation, and yield monitoring. This paper benchmarks several YOLO architectures such as YOLOv5s, YOLOv8n/s/m, and YOLOv12n for flower object detection under two annotation regimes: single-image single-bounding box (SISBB) and single-image multiple-bounding box (SIMBB). The FloralSix dataset, comprising 2,816 high-resolution photos of six different flower species, is also introduced. It is annotated for both dense (clustered) and sparse (isolated) scenarios. The models were evaluated using Precision, Recall, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) at IoU thresholds of 0.5 (mAP@0.5) and 0.5-0.95 (mAP@0.5:0.95). In SISBB, YOLOv8m (SGD) achieved the best results with Precision 0.956, Recall 0.951, mAP@0.5 0.978, and mAP@0.5:0.95 0.865, illustrating strong accuracy in detecting isolated flowers. With mAP@0.5 0.934 and mAP@0.5:0.95 0.752, YOLOv12n (SGD) outperformed the more complicated SIMBB scenario, proving robustness in dense, multi-object detection. Results show how annotation density, IoU thresholds, and model size interact: recall-optimized models perform better in crowded environments, whereas precision-oriented models perform best in sparse scenarios. In both cases, the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer consistently performed better than alternatives. These density-sensitive sensors are helpful for non-destructive crop analysis, growth tracking, robotic pollination, and stress evaluation.

*Massoud Dehghan,Ramona Woitek,Amirreza Mahbod*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTs show better classification performance with smaller patch sizes (1, 2, 4) in medical imaging, though computationally expensive. Ensembles of these models further improve results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore underexamined patch size impact on ViTs in medical imaging, addressing gaps in 2D and 3D modalities.

Method: Fine-tuned ViTs on 12 medical datasets (7 2D, 5 3D) with patch sizes 1-28, evaluated performance, and tested ensemble strategies.

Result: Smaller patches (1, 2, 4) improved accuracy by up to 12.78% (2D) and 23.78% (3D). Ensembles boosted performance further.

Conclusion: Smaller patch sizes enhance ViT accuracy in medical tasks, with ensembles offering additional gains, despite higher computational costs.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) and their variants have become state-of-the-art in many computer vision tasks and are widely used as backbones in large-scale vision and vision-language foundation models. While substantial research has focused on architectural improvements, the impact of patch size, a crucial initial design choice in ViTs, remains underexplored, particularly in medical domains where both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) imaging modalities exist.
  In this study, using 12 medical imaging datasets from various imaging modalities (including seven 2D and five 3D datasets), we conduct a thorough evaluation of how different patch sizes affect ViT classification performance. Using a single graphical processing unit (GPU) and a range of patch sizes (1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28), we fine-tune ViT models and observe consistent improvements in classification performance with smaller patch sizes (1, 2, and 4), which achieve the best results across nearly all datasets. More specifically, our results indicate improvements in balanced accuracy of up to 12.78% for 2D datasets (patch size 2 vs. 28) and up to 23.78% for 3D datasets (patch size 1 vs. 14), at the cost of increased computational expense. Moreover, by applying a straightforward ensemble strategy that fuses the predictions of the models trained with patch sizes 1, 2, and 4, we demonstrate a further boost in performance in most cases, especially for the 2D datasets. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/HealMaDe/MedViT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to generate realistic audio and video of a person speaking by combining textual prompts, static images, and voice profiles.

Method: The model encodes text, image, and voice profiles into a multi-entangled latent space to create spatiotemporal features, which are decoded into audio and video outputs.

Result: The approach successfully generates realistic speaking faces by leveraging entangled features across modalities.

Conclusion: The method effectively synthesizes realistic speaking and talking faces, demonstrating the potential of multi-entangled latent spaces for multimodal generation.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating realistic speaking and talking faces by synthesizing a person's voice and facial movements from a static image, a voice profile, and a target text. The model encodes the prompt/driving text, the driving image, and the voice profile of an individual and then combines them to pass them to the multi-entangled latent space to foster key-value pairs and queries for the audio and video modality generation pipeline. The multi-entangled latent space is responsible for establishing the spatiotemporal person-specific features between the modalities. Further, entangled features are passed to the respective decoder of each modality for output audio and video generation.

*Xiangming Wang,Haijin Zeng,Benteng Sun,Jiezhang Cao,Kai Zhang,Qiangqiang Shen,Yongyong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoRun, a generalized Deep Low-rank Adaptation Unfolding Network for image restoration, addressing limitations in existing DUNs by adapting denoising levels across stages with compressed memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Deep Unfolding Networks (DUNs) for image restoration suffer from redundant parameters and lack stage-specific adaptation to varying noise levels, hindering efficiency.

Method: LoRun shares a pretrained base denoiser across stages and uses lightweight LoRA adapters in Proximal Mapping Modules to dynamically adjust denoising behavior per stage.

Result: LoRun achieves up to N-times parameter reduction for an N-stage DUN while maintaining or improving performance, validated across three image restoration tasks.

Conclusion: LoRun offers an efficient and adaptable solution for image restoration, optimizing memory usage and performance in Deep Unfolding Networks.

Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs), combining conventional iterative optimization algorithms and deep neural networks into a multi-stage framework, have achieved remarkable accomplishments in Image Restoration (IR), such as spectral imaging reconstruction, compressive sensing and super-resolution.It unfolds the iterative optimization steps into a stack of sequentially linked blocks.Each block consists of a Gradient Descent Module (GDM) and a Proximal Mapping Module (PMM) which is equivalent to a denoiser from a Bayesian perspective, operating on Gaussian noise with a known level.However, existing DUNs suffer from two critical limitations: (i) their PMMs share identical architectures and denoising objectives across stages, ignoring the need for stage-specific adaptation to varying noise levels; and (ii) their chain of structurally repetitive blocks results in severe parameter redundancy and high memory consumption, hindering deployment in large-scale or resource-constrained scenarios.To address these challenges, we introduce generalized Deep Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) Unfolding Networks for image restoration, named LoRun, harmonizing denoising objectives and adapting different denoising levels between stages with compressed memory usage for more efficient DUN.LoRun introduces a novel paradigm where a single pretrained base denoiser is shared across all stages, while lightweight, stage-specific LoRA adapters are injected into the PMMs to dynamically modulate denoising behavior according to the noise level at each unfolding step.This design decouples the core restoration capability from task-specific adaptation, enabling precise control over denoising intensity without duplicating full network parameters and achieving up to $N$ times parameter reduction for an $N$-stage DUN with on-par or better performance.Extensive experiments conducted on three IR tasks validate the efficiency of our method.

TL;DR: Video-TwG is a novel framework for long video understanding that uses a Think-with-Grounding paradigm to reduce hallucinations by selectively grounding question-relevant clips. It employs a Two-stage Reinforced Curriculum Strategy and TwG-GRPO algorithm, outperforming baselines on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for long video understanding suffer from hallucinations due to text-only reasoning under fixed video context, ignoring crucial clues. Video-TwG addresses this by dynamically grounding relevant clips.

Method: Video-TwG uses a Think-with-Grounding paradigm with a Two-stage Reinforced Curriculum Strategy and TwG-GRPO algorithm. It trains on short-video data with grounding labels before scaling to diverse QA data.

Result: Experiments on Video-MME, LongVideoBench, and MLVU show Video-TwG outperforms baselines. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of its curriculum strategy and grounding rewards.

Conclusion: Video-TwG effectively reduces hallucinations and improves grounding quality in long video understanding through its innovative paradigm and training strategy, demonstrating strong performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Long video understanding is challenging due to rich and complicated multimodal clues in long temporal range.Current methods adopt reasoning to improve the model's ability to analyze complex video clues in long videos via text-form reasoning.However,the existing literature suffers from the fact that the text-only reasoning under fixed video context may exacerbate hallucinations since detailed crucial clues are often ignored under limited video context length due to the temporal redundancy of long videos.To address this gap,we propose Video-TwG,a curriculum reinforced framework that employs a novel Think-with-Grounding paradigm,enabling video LLMs to actively decide when to perform on-demand grounding during interleaved text-video reasoning, selectively zooming into question-relevant clips only when necessary.Video-TwG can be trained end-to-end in a straightforward manner, without relying on complex auxiliary modules or heavily annotated reasoning tracesIn detail,we design a Two-stage Reinforced Curriculum Strategy, where the model first learns think-with-grounding behavior on a small short-video GQA dataset with grounding labels,and then scales to diverse general QA data with videos of diverse domains to encourage generalization. Further, to handle complex think-with-grounding reasoning for various kinds of data,we propose TwG-GRPO algorithm which features the fine-grained grounding reward, self-confirmed pseudo reward and accuracy-gated mechanism.Finally,we propose to construct a new TwG-51K dataset that facilitates training. Experiments on Video-MME, LongVideoBench, and MLVU show that Video-TwG consistently outperforms strong LVU baselines.Further ablation validates the necessity of our Two-stage Reinforced Curriculum Strategy and shows our TwG-GRPO better leverages diverse unlabeled data to improve grounding quality and reduce redundant groundings without sacrificing QA performance.

TL;DR: IRIS-SLAM integrates geometric and semantic understanding using a unified model, outperforming existing methods in consistency and loop closure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLAM systems lack deep semantic understanding and robust loop closure, while semantic mapping suffers from decoupled architectures and fragile data association.

Method: Extends a geometry foundation model to predict dense geometry and cross-view consistent instance embeddings, enabling semantic-synergized association and instance-guided loop closure.

Result: IRIS-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in map consistency and wide-baseline loop closure reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed unified geometric-instance representation enhances semantic SLAM, bridging the gap between geometric reconstruction and open-vocabulary mapping.

Abstract: Geometry foundation models have significantly advanced dense geometric SLAM, yet existing systems often lack deep semantic understanding and robust loop closure capabilities. Meanwhile, contemporary semantic mapping approaches are frequently hindered by decoupled architectures and fragile data association. We propose IRIS-SLAM, a novel RGB semantic SLAM system that leverages unified geometric-instance representations derived from an instance-extended foundation model. By extending a geometry foundation model to concurrently predict dense geometry and cross-view consistent instance embeddings, we enable a semantic-synergized association mechanism and instance-guided loop closure detection. Our approach effectively utilizes viewpoint-agnostic semantic anchors to bridge the gap between geometric reconstruction and open-vocabulary mapping. Experimental results demonstrate that IRIS-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in map consistency and wide-baseline loop closure reliability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLMs suffer from object hallucination, and fine-tuning is costly. The study introduces HIS to identify sensitive layers and HIME for targeted editing, reducing hallucinations by 61.8%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address object hallucination in LVLMs without costly fine-tuning, preserving pre-trained knowledge.

Method: Analyze LVLM decoders (Qwen, LLaMA, Vicuna), develop HIS metric, and propose HIME for layer-adaptive weight editing.

Result: HIME reduces hallucinations by 61.8% without extra parameters or latency.

Conclusion: HIME effectively suppresses hallucinations while maintaining pre-trained knowledge, offering a practical solution.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal understanding capabilities, yet they remain prone to object hallucination, where models describe non-existent objects or attribute incorrect factual information, raising serious concerns for reliable real-world deployment. While fine-tuning is a commonly adopted mitigation strategy, its high computational cost and practical difficulty motivate the need for training-free alternatives, among which model editing has recently emerged as a promising direction. However, indiscriminate editing risks disrupting the rich implicit knowledge encoded in pre-trained LVLMs, leading to a fundamental question: how much intervention is necessary at each layer to suppress hallucinations while preserving pre-trained knowledge? To address this question, we present a systematic analysis of LVLM decoders built on three widely used large language model backbones-Qwen, LLaMA, and Vicuna-revealing clear layer-wise differences in susceptibility to object hallucination. Building on these insights, we introduce the Hallucination Insensitivity Score (HIS), a principled metric that quantifies each layer's sensitivity to hallucination and provides guidance for targeted intervention. Leveraging HIS, we propose Hallucination Insensitivity Model Editing (HIME), a simple yet effective layer-adaptive weight editing approach that selectively modifies latent features to suppress hallucinations while preserving pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIME reduces hallucinations by an average of 61.8% across open-ended generation benchmarks, including CHAIR, MME, and GPT-4V-aided evaluation, without introducing additional parameters, inference-time latency, or computational overhead.

TL;DR: WiCompass improves mmWave Human Pose Estimation by focusing on coverage-aware data collection instead of brute-force scaling, enhancing OOD robustness efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address poor generalization of mmWave HPE under distribution shifts by solving inefficiency and coverage gaps in data collection.

Method: Introduce WiCompass, a framework that uses a pose space oracle from motion-capture data to guide targeted sample collection via a closed-loop policy.

Result: WiCompass improves OOD accuracy and scales better than traditional methods at matched budgets.

Conclusion: Coverage-aware data acquisition, as demonstrated by WiCompass, provides a practical solution for robust mmWave sensing.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave Human Pose Estimation (mmWave HPE) promises privacy but suffers from poor generalization under distribution shifts. We demonstrate that brute-force data scaling is ineffective for out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness; efficiency and coverage are the true bottlenecks. To address this, we introduce WiCompass, a coverage-aware data-collection framework. WiCompass leverages large-scale motion-capture corpora to build a universal pose space ``oracle'' that quantifies dataset redundancy and identifies underrepresented motions. Guided by this oracle, WiCompass employs a closed-loop policy to prioritize collecting informative missing samples. Experiments show that WiCompass consistently improves OOD accuracy at matched budgets and exhibits superior scaling behavior compared to conventional collection strategies. By shifting focus from brute-force scaling to coverage-aware data acquisition, this work offers a practical path toward robust mmWave sensing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MiSCHiEF, benchmarking datasets for fine-grained image-caption alignment in safety (MiS) and culture (MiC) domains, revealing VLMs' struggles with subtle distinctions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for fine-grained alignment in VLMs, especially in critical contexts like safety and culture, where minor misinterpretations can have significant consequences.

Method: Created MiSCHiEF datasets with contrastive pairs (safe/unsafe scenarios and cultural proxies), evaluated four VLMs on tasks requiring fine-grained differentiation.

Result: VLMs perform better confirming correct pairs than rejecting incorrect ones, and fare better selecting captions for images than vice versa.

Conclusion: Results show persistent modality misalignment challenges in VLMs, emphasizing the difficulty of precise cross-modal grounding for subtle distinctions.

Abstract: Fine-grained image-caption alignment is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs), especially in socially critical contexts such as identifying real-world risk scenarios or distinguishing cultural proxies, where correct interpretation hinges on subtle visual or linguistic clues and where minor misinterpretations can lead to significant real-world consequences. We present MiSCHiEF, a set of two benchmarking datasets based on a contrastive pair design in the domains of safety (MiS) and culture (MiC), and evaluate four VLMs on tasks requiring fine-grained differentiation of paired images and captions. In both datasets, each sample contains two minimally differing captions and corresponding minimally differing images. In MiS, the image-caption pairs depict a safe and an unsafe scenario, while in MiC, they depict cultural proxies in two distinct cultural contexts. We find that models generally perform better at confirming the correct image-caption pair than rejecting incorrect ones. Additionally, models achieve higher accuracy when selecting the correct caption from two highly similar captions for a given image, compared to the converse task. The results, overall, highlight persistent modality misalignment challenges in current VLMs, underscoring the difficulty of precise cross-modal grounding required for applications with subtle semantic and visual distinctions.

Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with complex geometry due to limited training data and weak visual-symbolic alignment.

Method: A pipeline synthesizes GeoCode, decoupling problem generation into symbolic seed construction, grounded instantiation with verification, and code-based diagram rendering.

Result: GeoCode outperforms existing benchmarks in complexity and correctness, and models trained on it show consistent improvements.

Conclusion: GeoCode and its alignment strategy effectively enhance multimodal geometry reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal geometry reasoning requires models to jointly understand visual diagrams and perform structured symbolic inference, yet current vision--language models struggle with complex geometric constructions due to limited training data and weak visual--symbolic alignment. We propose a pipeline for synthesizing complex multimodal geometry problems from scratch and construct a dataset named \textbf{GeoCode}, which decouples problem generation into symbolic seed construction, grounded instantiation with verification, and code-based diagram rendering, ensuring consistency across structure, text, reasoning, and images. Leveraging the plotting code provided in GeoCode, we further introduce code prediction as an explicit alignment objective, transforming visual understanding into a supervised structured prediction task. GeoCode exhibits substantially higher structural complexity and reasoning difficulty than existing benchmarks, while maintaining mathematical correctness through multi-stage validation. Extensive experiments show that models trained on GeoCode achieve consistent improvements on multiple geometry benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness of the dataset and the proposed alignment strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIRROR, a framework enhancing multimodal reasoning in VLMs by iteratively reflecting on visual regions to reduce hallucinations and improve correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs often produce ungrounded answers and struggle with corrections, necessitating a robust method like MIRROR for evidence-based reasoning.

Method: MIRROR uses a closed-loop process: draft, critique, region-based verification, and revision, trained with ReflectV, a dataset containing reflection triggers and visual evidence.

Result: Experiments show MIRROR improves correctness and reduces hallucinations compared to benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of region-aware reflection.

Conclusion: MIRROR demonstrates the value of integrating visual reflection as an evidence-seeking process in VLMs for more accurate multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: In the era of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), enhancing multimodal reasoning capabilities remains a critical challenge, particularly in handling ambiguous or complex visual inputs, where initial inferences often lead to hallucinations or logic errors. Existing VLMs often produce plausible yet ungrounded answers, and even when prompted to "reflect", their corrections may remain detached from the image evidence. To address this, we propose the MIRROR framework for Multimodal Iterative Reasoning via Reflection On visual Regions. By embedding visual reflection as a core mechanism, MIRROR is formulated as a closed-loop process comprising draft, critique, region-based verification, and revision, which are repeated until the output is visually grounded. To facilitate training of this model, we construct **ReflectV**, a visual reflective dataset for multi-turn supervision that explicitly contains reflection triggers, region-based verification actions, and answer revision grounded in visual evidence. Experiments on both general vision-language benchmarks and representative vision-language reasoning benchmarks show that MIRROR improves correctness and reduces visual hallucinations, demonstrating the value of training reflection as an evidence-seeking, region-aware verification process rather than a purely textual revision step.

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks 10 foundation models for pixel-level semantic segmentation in histopathology, finding CONCH performs best and ensemble models improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic evaluations of foundation models for histopathology segmentation are lacking, prompting a need for robust benchmarking.

Method: Attention maps from foundation models are used as pixel-wise features, classified by XGBoost without fine-tuning, enabling model-agnostic evaluation.

Result: CONCH outperformed vision-only models, and combining features from CONCH, PathDino, and CellViT improved segmentation by 7.95% on average.

Conclusion: Ensemble foundation models generalize better for diverse histopathological segmentation tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models such as CLIP, DINO,and CONCH have demonstrated remarkable domain generalization and unsupervised feature extraction capabilities across diverse imaging tasks. However, systematic and independent evaluations of these models for pixel-level semantic segmentation in histopathology remain scarce. In this study, we propose a robust benchmarking approach to asses 10 foundational models on four histopathological datasets covering both morphological tissue-region and cellular/nuclear segmentation tasks. Our method leverages attention maps of foundation models as pixel-wise features, which are then classified using a machine learning algorithm, XGBoost, enabling fast, interpretable, and model-agnostic evaluation without finetuning. We show that the vision language foundation model, CONCH performed the best across datasets when compared to vision-only foundation models, with PathDino as close second. Further analysis shows that models trained on distinct histopathology cohorts capture complementary morphological representations, and concatenating their features yields superior segmentation performance. Concatenating features from CONCH, PathDino and CellViT outperformed individual models across all the datasets by 7.95% (averaged across the datasets), suggesting that ensembles of foundation models can better generalize to diverse histopathological segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: EditedID is a framework addressing facial identity inconsistency in portrait editing by aligning, disentangling, and entangling features, achieving state-of-the-art performance without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to maintain facial identity and edited element consistency due to distribution bias and feature contamination, limiting practical use.

Method: Introduced EditedID with: 1) adaptive mixing for latent alignment, 2) hybrid solver for attribute disentanglement, and 3) attentional gating for selective element entanglement.

Result: EditedID outperforms existing methods in preserving facial identity and edited element consistency in experiments.

Conclusion: The framework sets a new benchmark for reliable facial restoration, enabling practical deployment of multimodal editing models.

Abstract: Multimodal editing large models have demonstrated powerful editing capabilities across diverse tasks. However, a persistent and long-standing limitation is the decline in facial identity (ID) consistency during realistic portrait editing. Due to the human eye's high sensitivity to facial features, such inconsistency significantly hinders the practical deployment of these models. Current facial ID preservation methods struggle to achieve consistent restoration of both facial identity and edited element IP due to Cross-source Distribution Bias and Cross-source Feature Contamination. To address these issues, we propose EditedID, an Alignment-Disentanglement-Entanglement framework for robust identity-specific facial restoration. By systematically analyzing diffusion trajectories, sampler behaviors, and attention properties, we introduce three key components: 1) Adaptive mixing strategy that aligns cross-source latent representations throughout the diffusion process. 2) Hybrid solver that disentangles source-specific identity attributes and details. 3) Attentional gating mechanism that selectively entangles visual elements. Extensive experiments show that EditedID achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving original facial ID and edited element IP consistency. As a training-free and plug-and-play solution, it establishes a new benchmark for practical and reliable single/multi-person facial identity restoration in open-world settings, paving the way for the deployment of multimodal editing large models in real-person editing scenarios.

Achieving personalized E2E-AD faces challenges across three levels: limited real-world datasets with individual-level annotations, a lack of quantitative metrics for evaluating personal driving styles, and the absence of algorithms that can learn stylized representations from users' trajectories. To address these gaps, we propose Person2Drive, a comprehensive personalized E2E-AD platform and benchmark. It includes an open-source, flexible data collection system that simulates realistic scenarios to generate scalable and diverse personalized driving datasets; style vector-based evaluation metrics with Maximum Mean Discrepancy and KL divergence to comprehensively quantify individual driving behaviors; and a personalized E2E-AD framework with a style reward model that efficiently adapts E2E models for safe and individualized driving. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Person2Drive enables fine-grained analysis, reproducible evaluation, and effective personalization in end-to-end autonomous driving. Our dataset and code will be released after acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAG, a vision-language framework for Facial Expression Recognition (FER) that grounds reasoning in facial Action Units (AUs) to improve robustness and visual faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) for FER often produce unverifiable rationales and suffer from hallucinations, leading to poor robustness. The goal is to enhance trustworthiness and accuracy.

Method: TAG grounds intermediate reasoning steps in AU-related facial regions and employs supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with an AU-aware reward.

Result: TAG outperforms VLM baselines on RAF-DB, FERPlus, and AffectNet, improving both performance and visual faithfulness.

Conclusion: Structured grounding in AUs stabilizes reasoning and mitigates hallucinations, highlighting its importance for trustworthy FER.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a fine-grained visual understanding task where reliable predictions require reasoning over localized and meaningful facial cues. Recent vision--language models (VLMs) enable natural language explanations for FER, but their reasoning is often ungrounded, producing fluent yet unverifiable rationales that are weakly tied to visual evidence and prone to hallucination, leading to poor robustness across different datasets. We propose TAG (Thinking with Action Unit Grounding), a vision--language framework that explicitly constrains multimodal reasoning to be supported by facial Action Units (AUs). TAG requires intermediate reasoning steps to be grounded in AU-related facial regions, yielding predictions accompanied by verifiable visual evidence. The model is trained via supervised fine-tuning on AU-grounded reasoning traces followed by reinforcement learning with an AU-aware reward that aligns predicted regions with external AU detectors. Evaluated on RAF-DB, FERPlus, and AffectNet, TAG consistently outperforms strong open-source and closed-source VLM baselines while simultaneously improving visual faithfulness. Ablation and preference studies further show that AU-grounded rewards stabilize reasoning and mitigate hallucination, demonstrating the importance of structured grounded intermediate representations for trustworthy multimodal reasoning in FER.

TL;DR: GeoLink-UV is a nationwide dataset mapping Urban Villages (UVs) in China using multisource geospatial data and a foundation model-driven framework, revealing regional disparities in UV prevalence and morphology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate identification of UVs is crucial for urban governance, renewal, and sustainable development, but a consistent nationwide dataset was lacking due to UV heterogeneity.

Method: The dataset is derived from optical remote sensing images and geo-vector data, processed through a foundation model-driven framework to ensure generalization and quality.

Result: The dataset covers 342 cities, with UVs accounting for 8% of built-up land on average, showing clustering in central and south China and consistent low-rise, high-density patterns.

Conclusion: GeoLink-UV provides a reliable, open geospatial foundation for urban studies and aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 11.

Abstract: Urban Villages (UVs) represent a distinctive form of high-density informal settlement embedded within China's rapidly urbanizing cities. Accurate identification of UVs is critical for urban governance, renewal, and sustainable development. But due to the pronounced heterogeneity and diversity of UVs across China's vast territory, a consistent and reliable nationwide dataset has been lacking. In this work, we present GeoLink-UV, a high-resolution nationwide UV mapping product that clearly delineates the locations and boundaries of UVs in 342 Chinese cities. The dataset is derived from multisource geospatial data, including optical remote sensing images and geo-vector data, and is generated through a foundation model-driven mapping framework designed to address the generalization issues and improve the product quality. A geographically stratified accuracy assessment based on independent samples from 28 cities confirms the reliability and scientific credibility of the nationwide dataset across heterogeneous urban contexts. Based on this nationwide product, we reveal substantial interregional disparities in UV prevalence and spatial configuration. On average, UV areas account for 8 % of built-up land, with marked clustering in central and south China. Building-level analysis further confirms a consistent low-rise, high-density development pattern of UVs nationwide, while highlighting regionally differentiated morphological characteristics. The GeoLink-UV dataset provides an open and systematically validated geospatial foundation for urban studies, informal settlement monitoring, and evidence-based urban renewal planning, and contributes directly to large-scale assessments aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 11.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZS-MIL leverages VLM class-level embeddings for classifier initialization, outperforming random initialization in few-shot MIL tasks for WSI classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random classifier initialization underperforms zero-shot prediction in MIL problems, prompting the need for a better initialization method using VLM text encoder embeddings.

Method: ZS-MIL initializes the classification layer with VLM text encoder class-level embeddings to compute bag-level probabilities for MIL tasks.

Result: ZS-MIL outperforms traditional initialization techniques in performance and variability for few-shot WSI subtyping prediction.

Conclusion: ZS-MIL provides a robust alternative to random initialization, enhancing MIL-based WSI classification in few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLM) pre-trained on datasets of histopathological image-caption pairs enabled zero-shot slide-level classification. The ability of VLM image encoders to extract discriminative features also opens the door for supervised fine-tuning for whole-slide image (WSI) classification, ideally using few labeled samples. Slide-level prediction frameworks require the incorporation of multiple instance learning (MIL) due to the gigapixel size of the WSI. Following patch-level feature extraction and aggregation, MIL frameworks rely on linear classifiers trained on top of the slide-level aggregated features. Classifier weight initialization has a large influence on Linear Probing performance in efficient transfer learning (ETL) approaches based on few-shot learning. In this work, we propose Zero-Shot Multiple-Instance Learning (ZS-MIL) to address the limitations of random classifier initialization that underperform zero-shot prediction in MIL problems. ZS-MIL uses the class-level embeddings of the VLM text encoder as the classification layer's starting point to compute each sample's bag-level probabilities. Through multiple experiments, we demonstrate the robustness of ZS-MIL compared to well-known weight initialization techniques both in terms of performance and variability in an ETL few-shot scenario for subtyping prediction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based counterfactual methods are slow, expensive, and imprecise. MaskDiME aims to solve these issues.

Method: MaskDiME uses localized sampling to unify semantic consistency and spatial precision, focusing on decision-relevant regions.

Result: MaskDiME achieves 30x faster inference than baselines and performs comparably or better across five datasets.

Conclusion: MaskDiME offers a practical, generalizable solution for efficient counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Visual counterfactual explanations aim to reveal the minimal semantic modifications that can alter a model's prediction, providing causal and interpretable insights into deep neural networks. However, existing diffusion-based counterfactual generation methods are often computationally expensive, slow to sample, and imprecise in localizing the modified regions. To address these limitations, we propose MaskDiME, a simple, fast, and effective diffusion framework that unifies semantic consistency and spatial precision through localized sampling. Our approach adaptively focuses on decision-relevant regions to achieve localized and semantically consistent counterfactual generation while preserving high image fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method improves alignment of text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by using contrastive guidance without retraining the base model, achieving better generalization and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of aligning text-to-image diffusion models with nuanced human preferences while avoiding large-scale finetuning's generalization gap.

Method: Proposes contrastive guidance by decoupling preference learning into two modules (positive and negative data), forming a guidance vector at inference for better alignment.

Result: Demonstrates consistent quantitative and qualitative improvements on Stable Diffusion models with Pick-a-Pic v2 and HPDv3 datasets.

Conclusion: The approach offers a simple, effective, and controllable solution for aligning diffusion models with human preferences, enhancing generalization.

Abstract: Aligning large-scale text-to-image diffusion models with nuanced human preferences remains challenging. While direct preference optimization (DPO) is simple and effective, large-scale finetuning often shows a generalization gap. We take inspiration from test-time guidance and cast preference alignment as classifier-free guidance (CFG): a finetuned preference model acts as an external control signal during sampling. Building on this view, we propose a simple method that improves alignment without retraining the base model. To further enhance generalization, we decouple preference learning into two modules trained on positive and negative data, respectively, and form a \emph{contrastive guidance} vector at inference by subtracting their predictions (positive minus negative), scaled by a user-chosen strength and added to the base prediction at each step. This yields a sharper and controllable alignment signal. We evaluate on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and Stable Diffusion XL with Pick-a-Pic v2 and HPDv3, showing consistent quantitative and qualitative gains.

*Wanqi Wang,Jingcai Guo,Yuxiang Cai,Zhi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LMP is a dual-branch detector for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) that combines text prompts with visual exemplars to improve localization. It achieves top performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary detectors rely on text prompts but lack domain-specific visual details for precise localization in few-shot settings. LMP addresses this gap by integrating visual and textual guidance.

Method: LMP uses a dual-branch approach: one branch learns visual prototypes from support RoIs and hard-negative distractors, while the other preserves text-guided semantics. The branches are trained jointly and ensembled at inference.

Result: LMP achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive mAP on six cross-domain benchmark datasets under 1/5/10-shot settings.

Conclusion: Combining visual and textual modalities enhances cross-domain few-shot object detection, with LMP demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel classes in unseen target domains given only a few labeled examples. While open-vocabulary detectors built on vision-language models (VLMs) transfer well, they depend almost entirely on text prompts, which encode domain-invariant semantics but miss domain-specific visual information needed for precise localization under few-shot supervision. We propose a dual-branch detector that Learns Multi-modal Prototypes, dubbed LMP, by coupling textual guidance with visual exemplars drawn from the target domain. A Visual Prototype Construction module aggregates class-level prototypes from support RoIs and dynamically generates hard-negative prototypes in query images via jittered boxes, capturing distractors and visually similar backgrounds. In the visual-guided branch, we inject these prototypes into the detection pipeline with components mirrored from the text branch as the starting point for training, while a parallel text-guided branch preserves open-vocabulary semantics. The branches are trained jointly and ensembled at inference by combining semantic abstraction with domain-adaptive details. On six cross-domain benchmark datasets and standard 1/5/10-shot settings, our method achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive mAP.

*Chongyang Xu,Shen Cheng,Haipeng Li,Haoqiang Fan,Ziliang Feng,Shuaicheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HeRO is a diffusion-based policy combining geometry and semantics for pose-aware robotic manipulation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geometric policies lack part-level semantics needed for pose-aware manipulation, such as distinguishing shoe parts.

Method: HeRO uses hierarchical semantic fields, fusing features from DINOv2 and Stable Diffusion, processed into global and local fields for coherent policy generation.

Result: HeRO improves success by 12.3% on Place Dual Shoes and averages 6.5% gains across six tasks.

Conclusion: HeRO effectively integrates geometry and semantics for superior pose-aware robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation has progressed from 2D image policies to 3D representations that explicitly encode geometry. Yet purely geometric policies often lack explicit part-level semantics, which are critical for pose-aware manipulation (e.g., distinguishing a shoe's toe from heel). In this paper, we present HeRO, a diffusion-based policy that couples geometry and semantics via hierarchical semantic fields. HeRO employs dense semantics lifting to fuse discriminative, geometry-sensitive features from DINOv2 with the smooth, globally coherent correspondences from Stable Diffusion, yielding dense features that are both fine-grained and spatially consistent. These features are processed and partitioned to construct a global field and a set of local fields. A hierarchical conditioning module conditions the generative denoiser on global and local fields using permutation-invariant network architecture, thereby avoiding order-sensitive bias and producing a coherent control policy for pose-aware manipulation. In various tests, HeRO establishes a new state-of-the-art, improving success on Place Dual Shoes by 12.3% and averaging 6.5% gains across six challenging pose-aware tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobSelf is a self-supervised model for cross-modal super-resolution on misaligned data, using a misalignment-aware translator and content-aware filter to achieve high-fidelity results without training data or pre-alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of cross-modal SR on real-world misaligned data with limited and complex misaligned LR-HR pairs.

Method: RobSelf employs a misalignment-aware feature translator and a content-aware reference filter for self-supervised optimization.

Result: State-of-the-art performance and superior efficiency across various tasks, validated by the new RealMisSR dataset.

Conclusion: RobSelf successfully tackles cross-modal SR without ground-truth supervision, demonstrating effectiveness and introducing a valuable dataset.

Abstract: We study cross-modal super-resolution (SR) on real-world misaligned data, where only a limited number of low-resolution (LR) source and high-resolution (HR) guide image pairs with complex spatial misalignments are available. To address this challenge, we propose RobSelf--a fully self-supervised model that is optimized online, requiring no training data, ground-truth supervision, or pre-alignment. RobSelf features two key techniques: a misalignment-aware feature translator and a content-aware reference filter. The translator reformulates unsupervised cross-modal and cross-resolution alignment as a weakly-supervised, misalignment-aware translation subtask, producing an aligned guide feature with inherent redundancy. Guided by this feature, the filter performs reference-based discriminative self-enhancement on the source, enabling SR predictions with high resolution and high fidelity. Across a variety of tasks, we demonstrate that RobSelf achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a real-world dataset, RealMisSR, to advance research on this topic. Dataset and code: https://github.com/palmdong/RobSelf.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DSTAR proposes an autoregressive model for generating spatially and temporally consistent 4D objects by leveraging state propagation from previous timesteps and a 4D VQ-VAE for encoding and decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods struggle with spatial-temporal inconsistency in generating 4D objects, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: The method includes a spatial-temporal state propagation autoregressive model (STAR) that propagates states from past timesteps and a 4D VQ-VAE for encoding and decoding 4D structure.

Result: Experiments show 4DSTAR generates consistent 4D objects and performs competitively with diffusion models.

Conclusion: 4DSTAR effectively addresses spatial-temporal inconsistency in 4D object generation, offering a robust alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Generating high-quality 4D objects with spatial-temporal consistency is still formidable. Existing diffusion-based methods often struggle with spatial-temporal inconsistency, as they fail to leverage outputs from all previous timesteps to guide the generation at the current timestep. Therefore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal State Propagation AutoRegressive Model (4DSTAR), which generates 4D objects maintaining temporal-spatial consistency. 4DSTAR formulates the generation problem as the prediction of tokens that represent the 4D object. It consists of two key components: (1) The dynamic spatial-temporal state propagation autoregressive model (STAR) is proposed, which achieves spatial-temporal consistent generation. Unlike standard autoregressive models, STAR divides prediction tokens into groups based on timesteps. It models long-term dependencies by propagating spatial-temporal states from previous groups and utilizes these dependencies to guide generation at the next timestep. To this end, a spatial-temporal container is proposed, which dynamically updating the effective spatial-temporal state features from all historical groups, then updated features serve as conditional features to guide the prediction of the next token group. (2) The 4D VQ-VAE is proposed, which implicitly encodes the 4D structure into discrete space and decodes the discrete tokens predicted by STAR into temporally coherent dynamic 3D Gaussians. Experiments demonstrate that 4DSTAR generates spatial-temporal consistent 4D objects, and achieves performance competitive with diffusion models.

*Fadi Boutros,Eduarda Caldeira,Tahar Chettaoui,Naser Damer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDPERTURB is a geometric-driven sampling strategy to enhance synthetic face diversity, improving face recognition training outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy and legal concerns restrict the use of real biometric data, making synthetic data a practical alternative. However, existing synthetic face models lack sufficient intra-class variation, which is crucial for robust face recognition.

Method: IDPERTURB perturbs identity embeddings within a constrained angular region of the unit hyper-sphere to generate diverse embeddings, without altering the underlying generative model. These embeddings condition a pre-trained diffusion model to produce varied yet identity-coherent face images.

Result: Empirical results show that face recognition models trained on IDPERTURB-generated data perform better across multiple benchmarks compared to other synthetic data generation methods.

Conclusion: IDPERTURB effectively enhances synthetic face diversity, improving the generalization and robustness of face recognition systems trained on synthetic data.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a practical alternative to authentic face datasets for training face recognition (FR) systems, especially as privacy and legal concerns increasingly restrict the use of real biometric data. Recent advances in identity-conditional diffusion models have enabled the generation of photorealistic and identity-consistent face images. However, many of these models suffer from limited intra-class variation, an essential property for training robust and generalizable FR models. In this work, we propose IDPERTURB, a simple yet effective geometric-driven sampling strategy to enhance diversity in synthetic face generation. IDPERTURB perturbs identity embeddings within a constrained angular region of the unit hyper-sphere, producing a diverse set of embeddings without modifying the underlying generative model. Each perturbed embedding serves as a conditioning vector for a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of visually varied yet identity-coherent face images suitable for training generalizable FR systems. Empirical results demonstrate that training FR on datasets generated using IDPERTURB yields improved performance across multiple FR benchmarks, compared to existing synthetic data generation approaches.

*Asish Bera,Subhajit Roy,Sudiptendu Banerjee*

TL;DR: The paper proposes CLAP, a lightweight autoencoder using separable convolutional layers for plant disease classification, achieving competitive accuracy with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models struggle with subtle variations in leaf images under realistic field conditions, while existing deep learning methods are computationally intensive.

Method: Lightweight autoencoder with separable convolutional layers, sigmoid gating for feature refinement, and combined encoder-decoder feature maps for classification.

Result: Improved or competitive accuracies on three datasets (Integrated Plant Disease, Groundnut, CCMT) with 5M parameters, 20ms training time, and 1ms inference per image.

Conclusion: CLAP balances performance and computational efficiency, making it suitable for practical plant disease classification tasks.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have remarkably progressed the performance of distinguishing plant diseases, severity grading, and nutrition deficiency prediction using leaf images. However, these tasks become more challenging in a realistic in-situ field condition. Often, a traditional machine learning model may fail to capture and interpret discriminative characteristics of plant health, growth and diseases due to subtle variations within leaf subcategories. A few deep learning methods have used additional preprocessing stages or network modules to address the problem, whereas several other methods have utilized pre-trained backbone CNNs, most of which are computationally intensive. Therefore, to address the challenge, we propose a lightweight autoencoder using separable convolutional layers in its encoder decoder blocks. A sigmoid gating is applied for refining the prowess of the encoders feature discriminability, which is improved further by the decoder. Finally, the feature maps of the encoder decoder are combined for rich feature representation before classification. The proposed Convolutional Lightweight Autoencoder for Plant disease classification, called CLAP, has been experimented on three public plant datasets consisting of cassava, tomato, maize, groundnut, grapes, etc. for determining plant health conditions. The CLAP has attained improved or competitive accuracies on the Integrated Plant Disease, Groundnut, and CCMT datasets balancing a tradeoff between the performance, and little computational cost requiring 5 million parameters. The training time is 20 milliseconds and inference time is 1 ms per image.

TL;DR: IFA-Net improves localization of AI-generated image forgeries using a frozen Masked Autoencoder and iterative refinement, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of realistic AI-generated images requires better tools for detecting manipulated regions, as current methods fail with novel techniques.

Method: IFA-Net uses a frozen MAE trained on real images, combining coarse localization via DSSN and refinement via TAPI prompts.

Result: IFA-Net outperforms benchmarks by 6.5% IoU and 8.1% F1-score, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: IFA-Net's shift from detecting 'what is fake' to modeling 'what is real' proves effective for forgery localization.

Abstract: The proliferation of highly realistic AI-generated images poses critical challenges for digital forensics, demanding precise pixel-level localization of manipulated regions. Existing methods predominantly learn discriminative patterns of specific forgeries and often struggle with novel manipulations as editing techniques continue to evolve. We propose the Iterative Forgery Amplifier Network (IFA-Net), which shifts from learning "what is fake" to modeling "what is real". Grounded in the principle that all manipulations deviate from the natural image manifold, IFA-Net leverages a frozen Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretrained on real images as a universal realness prior. Our framework operates through a two-stage closed-loop process: an initial Dual-Stream Segmentation Network (DSSN) fuses the original image with MAE reconstruction residuals for coarse localization, followed by a Task-Adaptive Prior Injection (TAPI) module that converts this coarse prediction into guiding prompts to steer the MAE decoder and amplify reconstruction failures in suspicious regions for precise refinement. Extensive experiments on four diffusion-based inpainting benchmarks show that IFA-Net achieves an average improvement of 6.5% in IoU and 8.1% in F1-score over the second-best method, while demonstrating strong generalization to traditional manipulation types.

*Chengwei Xia,Fan Ma,Ruijie Quan,Yunqiu Xu,Kun Zhan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for generating copyright triggers in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to embed verifiable ownership information, ensuring exclusive responses in derivative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing intellectual property concerns by enabling model publishers to track and verify ownership in derivative models.

Method: Constructs trigger images as learnable tensors using adversarial optimization with dual-injection of ownership-relevant semantic information (textual consistency and CLIP feature alignment) and adversarial training.

Result: Effective tracking of model lineage under fine-tuning and domain-shift scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-injection approach provides a robust solution for MLLM ownership verification.

Abstract: With the rapid deployment and widespread adoption of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), disputes regarding model version attribution and ownership have become increasingly frequent, raising significant concerns about intellectual property protection. In this paper, we propose a framework for generating copyright triggers for MLLMs, enabling model publishers to embed verifiable ownership information into the model. The goal is to construct trigger images that elicit ownership-related textual responses exclusively in fine-tuned derivatives of the original model, while remaining inert in other non-derivative models. Our method constructs a tracking trigger image by treating the image as a learnable tensor, performing adversarial optimization with dual-injection of ownership-relevant semantic information. The first injection is achieved by enforcing textual consistency between the output of an auxiliary MLLM and a predefined ownership-relevant target text; the consistency loss is backpropagated to inject this ownership-related information into the image. The second injection is performed at the semantic-level by minimizing the distance between the CLIP features of the image and those of the target text. Furthermore, we introduce an additional adversarial training stage involving the auxiliary model derived from the original model itself. This auxiliary model is specifically trained to resist generating ownership-relevant target text, thereby enhancing robustness in heavily fine-tuned derivative models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual-injection approach in tracking model lineage under various fine-tuning and domain-shift scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DUET-VLM is a dual-stage compression framework for vision-language models that reduces visual tokens significantly while maintaining high accuracy, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of dense visual tokenization in vision-language models without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Proposes a two-stage approach: (1) vision-only redundancy-aware compression, and (2) text-guided layer-wise token dropping in the language backbone.

Result: Achieves 99.7% accuracy with 67% fewer tokens and retains >97% accuracy at 89% reduction, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: DUET-VLM enables aggressive token reduction while preserving critical semantics, offering a robust solution for efficient VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities, yet remain computationally expensive due to dense visual tokenization. Existing efficiency approaches either merge redundant visual tokens or drop them progressively in language backbone, often trading accuracy for speed. In this work, we propose DUET-VLM, a versatile plug-and-play dual compression framework that consists of (a) vision-only redundancy aware compression of vision encoder's output into information-preserving tokens, followed by (b) layer-wise, salient text-guided dropping of visual tokens within the language backbone to progressively prune less informative tokens. This coordinated token management enables aggressive compression while retaining critical semantics. On LLaVA-1.5-7B, our approach maintains over 99% of baseline accuracy with 67% fewer tokens, and still retains >97% even at 89% reduction. With this dual-stage compression during training, it achieves 99.7% accuracy at 67% and 97.6% at 89%, surpassing prior SoTA visual token reduction methods across multiple benchmarks. When integrated into Video-LLaVA-7B, it even surpasses the baseline -- achieving >100% accuracy with a substantial 53.1% token reduction and retaining 97.6% accuracy under an extreme 93.4% setting. These results highlight end-to-end training with DUET-VLM, enabling robust adaptation to reduced visual (image/video) input without sacrificing accuracy, producing compact yet semantically rich representations within the same computational budget.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Open-Vocabulary Domain Generalization in Semantic Segmentation (OVDG-SS) for autonomous driving, addressing unseen domains and categories. It proposes S2-Corr to refine text-image correlations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and demonstrates improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for Domain Generalization in Semantic Segmentation (DG-SS) are limited to fixed categories and struggle with open-world scenarios. Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OV-SS) models, while recognizing more concepts, are sensitive to domain shifts, especially in urban-driving contexts. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Result: Extensive experiments show S2-Corr achieves superior cross-domain performance and efficiency compared to existing OV-SS approaches, addressing both synthetic-to-real and real-to-real generalization.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the challenges of unseen domains and categories in semantic segmentation, offering a robust solution for autonomous driving scenarios through the innovative use of S2-Corr.

Abstract: Domain Generalization in Semantic Segmentation (DG-SS) aims to enable segmentation models to perform robustly in unseen environments. However, conventional DG-SS methods are restricted to a fixed set of known categories, limiting their applicability in open-world scenarios. Recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has advanced Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OV-SS) by enabling models to recognize a broader range of concepts. Yet, these models remain sensitive to domain shifts and struggle to maintain robustness when deployed in unseen environments, a challenge that is particularly severe in urban-driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Open-Vocabulary Domain Generalization in Semantic Segmentation (OVDG-SS), a new setting that jointly addresses unseen domains and unseen categories. We introduce the first benchmark for OVDG-SS in autonomous driving, addressing a previously unexplored problem and covering both synthetic-to-real and real-to-real generalization across diverse unseen domains and unseen categories. In OVDG-SS, we observe that domain shifts often distort text-image correlations in pre-trained VLMs, which hinders the performance of OV-SS models. To tackle this challenge, we propose S2-Corr, a state-space-driven text-image correlation refinement mechanism that mitigates domain-induced distortions and produces more consistent text-image correlations under distribution changes. Extensive experiments on our constructed benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior cross-domain performance and efficiency compared to existing OV-SS approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve quantization methods for Vision Transformers, addressing limitations of prior post-training or block-wise approaches, focusing on efficient edge deployment.

Method: The framework jointly optimizes all layers and inter-block dependencies without labeled data, supported by a data-free calibration strategy using Stable Diffusion Turbo and multi-mode prompts.

Result: Achieves SOTA W4A4 and W3A3 accuracies on ImageNet and maintains strong accuracy under extremely low-bit settings (W1.58A8) for ViT, DeiT, and Swin-T models.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates robust performance for efficient edge deployment and outperforms baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of the data-free calibration strategy.

Abstract: We present a framework for end-to-end joint quantization of Vision Transformers trained on ImageNet for the purpose of image classification. Unlike prior post-training or block-wise reconstruction methods, we jointly optimize over the entire set of all layers and inter-block dependencies without any labeled data, scaling effectively with the number of samples and completing in just one hour on a single GPU for ViT-small. We achieve state-of-the-art W4A4 and W3A3 accuracies on ImageNet and, to the best of our knowledge, the first PTQ results that maintain strong accuracy on ViT, DeiT, and Swin-T models under extremely low-bit settings (W1.58A8), demonstrating the potential for efficient edge deployment. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free calibration strategy that synthesizes diverse, label-free samples using Stable Diffusion Turbo guided by learned multi-mode prompts. By encouraging diversity in both the learned prompt embeddings and the generated image features, our data-free approach achieves performance on par with real-data ImageNet calibration and surpasses simple text-prompt baselines such as "a <adjective> photo of <adjective> <cls>".

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MM2D3D, a multi-modal segmentation model improving 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation by leveraging camera images to create dense, accurate 2D predictions, enhancing final 3D accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR point clouds is crucial for urban remote sensing, but sparsity in projected maps limits accuracy.

Method: Developed MM2D3D, using cross-modal guided filtering and dynamic cross pseudo supervision to integrate camera images for dense predictions.

Result: Achieved dense 2D predictions with higher accuracy, leading to improved 3D segmentation performance.

Conclusion: MM2D3D outperforms previous methods in both 2D and 3D spaces, demonstrating effective enhancement of semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR point clouds is important in urban remote sensing for understanding real-world street environments. This task, by projecting LiDAR point clouds and 3D semantic labels as sparse maps, can be reformulated as a 2D problem. However, the intrinsic sparsity of the projected LiDAR and label maps can result in sparse and inaccurate intermediate 2D semantic predictions, which in return limits the final 3D accuracy. To address this issue, we enhance this task by shaping dense and accurate 2D predictions. Specifically, we develop a multi-modal segmentation model, MM2D3D. By leveraging camera images as auxiliary data, we introduce cross-modal guided filtering to overcome label map sparsity by constraining intermediate 2D semantic predictions with dense semantic relations derived from the camera images; and we introduce dynamic cross pseudo supervision to overcome LiDAR map sparsity by encouraging the 2D predictions to emulate the dense distribution of the semantic predictions from the camera images. Experiments show that our techniques enable our model to achieve intermediate 2D semantic predictions with dense distribution and higher accuracy, which effectively enhances the final 3D accuracy. Comparisons with previous methods demonstrate our superior performance in both 2D and 3D spaces.

*Miaowei Wang,Qingxuan Yan,Zhi Cao,Yayuan Li,Oisin Mac Aodha,Jason J. Corso,Amir Vaxman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiMotion introduces continuous B-spline curves and novel losses for high-quality, text-aligned 3D motion generation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with limited or incoherent motion due to fixed-length inputs and discrete representations, lacking rich motion semantics.

Method: Uses continuous B-spline curves with Laplacian regularization and introduces normal-fusion, correspondence-aware, and local-rigidity losses for motion restoration.

Result: BiMotion generates more expressive, prompt-aligned motions faster than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses motion semantics and generation quality, validated by extensive evaluations.

Abstract: Text-guided dynamic 3D character generation has advanced rapidly, yet producing high-quality motion that faithfully reflects rich textual descriptions remains challenging. Existing methods tend to generate limited sub-actions or incoherent motion due to fixed-length temporal inputs and discrete frame-wise representations that fail to capture rich motion semantics. We address these limitations by representing motion with continuous differentiable B-spline curves, enabling more effective motion generation without modifying the capabilities of the underlying generative model. Specifically, our closed-form, Laplacian-regularized B-spline solver efficiently compresses variable-length motion sequences into compact representations with a fixed number of control points. Further, we introduce a normal-fusion strategy for input shape adherence along with correspondence-aware and local-rigidity losses for motion-restoration quality. To train our model, we collate BIMO, a new dataset containing diverse variable-length 3D motion sequences with rich, high-quality text annotations. Extensive evaluations show that our feed-forward framework BiMotion generates more expressive, higher-quality, and better prompt-aligned motions than existing state-of-the-art methods, while also achieving faster generation.

*Jie Li,Suorong Yang,Jian Zhao,Furao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLD-Font introduces structure-level disentanglement for Chinese font generation, improving style fidelity and content accuracy using diffusion models and CLIP-based style integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for few-shot Chinese font generation suffer from content distortion and poor style fidelity due to feature-level disentanglement, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: SLD-Font uses separate channels for content and style, with SimSun-style images as content templates and CLIP-extracted style features integrated via cross-attention. It includes a Background Noise Removal module and employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: SLD-Font achieves higher style fidelity while maintaining content accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SLD-Font demonstrates effective disentanglement and adaptation to new styles, validated by improved metrics and experimental results.

Abstract: Few-shot Chinese font generation aims to synthesize new characters in a target style using only a handful of reference images. Achieving accurate content rendering and faithful style transfer requires effective disentanglement between content and style. However, existing approaches achieve only feature-level disentanglement, allowing the generator to re-entangle these features, leading to content distortion and degraded style fidelity. We propose the Structure-Level Disentangled Diffusion Model (SLD-Font), which receives content and style information from two separate channels. SimSun-style images are used as content templates and concatenated with noisy latent features as the input. Style features extracted by a CLIP model from target-style images are integrated via cross-attention. Additionally, we train a Background Noise Removal module in the pixel space to remove background noise in complex stroke regions. Based on theoretical validation of disentanglement effectiveness, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that updates only the style-related modules. This allows the model to better adapt to new styles while avoiding overfitting to the reference images' content. We further introduce the Grey and OCR metrics to evaluate the content quality of generated characters. Experimental results show that SLD-Font achieves significantly higher style fidelity while maintaining comparable content accuracy to existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: FOCA is a multimodal framework for image forgery detection and localization, combining RGB and frequency domain features with interpretable cross-attention fusion, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in current IFDL methods, such as over-reliance on semantics and poor interpretability of tampering traces.

Method: Proposes FOCA, integrating RGB and frequency domain features via cross-attention fusion, and introduces FSE-Set dataset.

Result: FOCA achieves superior detection performance and interpretability in both spatial and frequency domains.

Conclusion: FOCA offers an effective, interpretable solution for detecting and localizing image forgeries.

Abstract: Advances in image tampering techniques, particularly generative models, pose significant challenges to media verification, digital forensics, and public trust. Existing image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods suffer from two key limitations: over-reliance on semantic content while neglecting textural cues, and limited interpretability of subtle low-level tampering traces. To address these issues, we propose FOCA, a multimodal large language model-based framework that integrates discriminative features from both the RGB spatial and frequency domains via a cross-attention fusion module. This design enables accurate forgery detection and localization while providing explicit, human-interpretable cross-domain explanations. We further introduce FSE-Set, a large-scale dataset with diverse authentic and tampered images, pixel-level masks, and dual-domain annotations. Extensive experiments show that FOCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection performance and interpretability across both spatial and frequency domains.

*Mohammad Asim,Christopher Wewer,Jan Eric Lenssen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneTok is a novel tokenizer compressing scene views into unstructured tokens, achieving strong compression and high-quality reconstruction while enabling efficient scene generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene representations rely on structured grids or view-aligned fields, limiting efficiency and flexibility. SceneTok aims to overcome these limitations with unstructured tokens.

Method: SceneTok uses a multi-view tokenizer to encode scenes into permutation-invariant tokens and a rectified flow decoder for rendering novel views.

Result: The method achieves 1-3 orders of magnitude better compression than alternatives while maintaining state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and enabling fast scene generation (~5 seconds).

Conclusion: SceneTok offers a highly efficient and flexible representation for scenes, outperforming previous methods in compression, quality, and speed.

Abstract: We present SceneTok, a novel tokenizer for encoding view sets of scenes into a compressed and diffusable set of unstructured tokens. Existing approaches for 3D scene representation and generation commonly use 3D data structures or view-aligned fields. In contrast, we introduce the first method that encodes scene information into a small set of permutation-invariant tokens that is disentangled from the spatial grid. The scene tokens are predicted by a multi-view tokenizer given many context views and rendered into novel views by employing a light-weight rectified flow decoder. We show that the compression is 1-3 orders of magnitude stronger than for other representations while still reaching state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Further, our representation can be rendered from novel trajectories, including ones deviating from the input trajectory, and we show that the decoder gracefully handles uncertainty. Finally, the highly-compressed set of unstructured latent scene tokens enables simple and efficient scene generation in 5 seconds, achieving a much better quality-speed trade-off than previous paradigms.

TL;DR: PhysConvex, a physics-informed 3D dynamic convex radiance field, unifies visual rendering and physical simulation for deformable scenes, outperforming existing methods in fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural representations like NeRFs and 3DGS lack the ability to model complex material deformation and dynamics, which PhysConvex aims to address.

Method: PhysConvex uses physics-grounded convex primitives and a boundary-driven dynamic convex representation to model deformation, along with a reduced-order convex simulation for efficiency.

Result: The method achieves high-fidelity reconstruction of geometry, appearance, and physical properties from videos, surpassing current techniques.

Conclusion: PhysConvex successfully integrates visual rendering with physical simulation, offering improved performance in dynamic 3D scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Reconstructing and simulating dynamic 3D scenes with both visual realism and physical consistency remains a fundamental challenge. Existing neural representations, such as NeRFs and 3DGS, excel in appearance reconstruction but struggle to capture complex material deformation and dynamics. We propose PhysConvex, a Physics-informed 3D Dynamic Convex Radiance Field that unifies visual rendering and physical simulation. PhysConvex represents deformable radiance fields using physically grounded convex primitives governed by continuum mechanics. We introduce a boundary-driven dynamic convex representation that models deformation through vertex and surface dynamics, capturing spatially adaptive, non-uniform deformation, and evolving boundaries. To efficiently simulate complex geometries and heterogeneous materials, we further develop a reduced-order convex simulation that advects dynamic convex fields using neural skinning eigenmodes as shape- and material-aware deformation bases with time-varying reduced DOFs under Newtonian dynamics. Convex dynamics also offers compact, gap-free volumetric coverage, enhancing both geometric efficiency and simulation fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that PhysConvex achieves high-fidelity reconstruction of geometry, appearance, and physical properties from videos, outperforming existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the critical challenge of ensuring safety in end-to-end driving frameworks.

Method: Combines Sparse World Network (SWNet) for interaction-centric representations and Fine-grained Reasoning Network (FRNet) for safety evaluations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: 91.6 PDMS, 87.5 EPDMS on NAVSIM, and 66.8% driving score on Bench2Drive.

Conclusion: SafeDrive proves effective for safety-critical autonomous driving, with a low collision rate (0.5%).

Abstract: The end-to-end (E2E) paradigm, which maps sensor inputs directly to driving decisions, has recently attracted significant attention due to its unified modeling capability and scalability. However, ensuring safety in this unified framework remains one of the most critical challenges. In this work, we propose SafeDrive, an E2E planning framework designed to perform explicit and interpretable safety reasoning through a trajectory-conditioned Sparse World Model. SafeDrive comprises two complementary networks: the Sparse World Network (SWNet) and the Fine-grained Reasoning Network (FRNet). SWNet constructs trajectory-conditioned sparse worlds that simulate the future behaviors of critical dynamic agents and road entities, providing interaction-centric representations for downstream reasoning. FRNet then evaluates agent-specific collision risks and temporal adherence to drivable regions, enabling precise identification of safety-critical events across future timesteps. SafeDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance on both open-loop and closed-loop benchmarks. On NAVSIM, it records a PDMS of 91.6 and an EPDMS of 87.5, with only 61 collisions out of 12,146 scenarios (0.5%). On Bench2Drive, SafeDrive attains a 66.8% driving score.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating dense MDE depth maps into SfM is challenging due to high error variance.

Method: Proposed Marginalized Bundle Adjustment (MBA) leverages MDE density to reduce error variance.

Result: MBA achieves SoTA or competitive results in SfM and camera relocalization, robust across varying scales.

Conclusion: MBA demonstrates MDE's potential for multi-view 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) is a fundamental 3D vision task for recovering camera parameters and scene geometry from multi-view images. While recent deep learning advances enable accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) from single images without depending on camera motion, integrating MDE into SfM remains a challenge. Unlike conventional triangulated sparse point clouds, MDE produces dense depth maps with significantly higher error variance. Inspired by modern RANSAC estimators, we propose Marginalized Bundle Adjustment (MBA) to mitigate MDE error variance leveraging its density. With MBA, we show that MDE depth maps are sufficiently accurate to yield SoTA or competitive results in SfM and camera relocalization tasks. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate consistently robust performance across varying scales, ranging from few-frame setups to large multi-view systems with thousands of images. Our method highlights the significant potential of MDE in multi-view 3D vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in balancing content fidelity and stylistic consistency in personalized image generation using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

Method: CRAFT-LoRA introduces rank-constrained backbone fine-tuning, a prompt-guided expert encoder, and a training-free classifier-free guidance scheme.

Result: The method achieves better content-style disentanglement, flexible semantic control, and high-fidelity generation without retraining.

Conclusion: CRAFT-LoRA effectively addresses limitations of existing LoRA combination techniques for personalized image generation.

Abstract: Personalized image generation requires effectively balancing content fidelity with stylistic consistency when synthesizing images based on text and reference examples. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers an efficient personalization approach, with potential for precise control through combining LoRA weights on different concepts. However, existing combination techniques face persistent challenges: entanglement between content and style representations, insufficient guidance for controlling elements' influence, and unstable weight fusion that often require additional training. We address these limitations through CRAFT-LoRA, with complementary components: (1) rank-constrained backbone fine-tuning that injects low-rank projection residuals to encourage learning decoupled content and style subspaces; (2) a prompt-guided approach featuring an expert encoder with specialized branches that enables semantic extension and precise control through selective adapter aggregation; and (3) a training-free, timestep-dependent classifier-free guidance scheme that enhances generation stability by strategically adjusting noise predictions across diffusion steps. Our method significantly improves content-style disentanglement, enables flexible semantic control over LoRA module combinations, and achieves high-fidelity generation without additional retraining overhead.

TL;DR: DACo is a decoupled architecture for vision-and-language navigation, separating global planning (Global Commander) from local execution (Local Operative) to improve long-horizon stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing approaches—either multi-agent complexity or single-agent cognitive overload—in long-horizon navigation tasks.

Method: Introduces DACo, a planning-grounding decoupled framework with dynamic subgoal planning and adaptive replanning.

Result: Achieves significant improvements (4.9%, 6.5%, 5.4%) over baselines in zero-shot settings and generalizes across different backbones.

Conclusion: DACo offers a scalable and robust paradigm for long-horizon navigation, enhancing performance and stability.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Scene navigation is a fundamental capability for embodied human-AI collaboration, requiring agents to follow natural language instructions to execute coherent action sequences in complex environments. Existing approaches either rely on multiple agents, incurring high coordination and resource costs, or adopt a single-agent paradigm, which overloads the agent with both global planning and local perception, often leading to degraded reasoning and instruction drift in long-horizon settings. To address these issues, we introduce DACo, a planning-grounding decoupled architecture that disentangles global deliberation from local grounding. Concretely, it employs a Global Commander for high-level strategic planning and a Local Operative for egocentric observing and fine-grained execution. By disentangling global reasoning from local action, DACo alleviates cognitive overload and improves long-horizon stability. The framework further integrates dynamic subgoal planning and adaptive replanning to enable structured and resilient navigation. Extensive evaluations on R2R, REVERIE, and R4R demonstrate that DACo achieves 4.9%, 6.5%, 5.4% absolute improvements over the best-performing baselines in zero-shot settings, and generalizes effectively across both closed-source (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source (e.g., Qwen-VL Series) backbones. DACo provides a principled and extensible paradigm for robust long-horizon navigation. Project page: https://github.com/ChocoWu/DACo

The model is trained on the Trauma THOMPSON Challenge 2025 Task 2 dataset, consisting of first-person surgical videos with annotated hand bounding boxes. Extensive data augmentation and a multi-task detection design improve robustness against motion blur, lighting variations, and diverse hand appearances. Evaluation demonstrates accurate left-hand (67\%) and right-hand (71\%) classification, while distinguishing hands from the background remains challenging. The model achieves an $mAP_{[0.5:0.95]}$ of 0.33 and maintains real-time inference, highlighting its potential for intraoperative deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a depth-enhanced YOLO-SAM2 framework to detect railway track ballast insufficiency using RGB-D data, improving recall and F1-score over RGB-only models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The RGB-only YOLOv8 model struggles with low recall due to over-predicting sufficient ballast, prompting the need for depth-based enhancements for better reliability.

Method: The framework integrates depth-correction (polynomial modeling, RANSAC, temporal smoothing) and SAM2 segmentation to refine sleeper and ballast profiles for geometric classification.

Result: Depth-enhanced configurations boost recall from 0.49 to 0.80 and F1-score from 0.66 to over 0.80, outperforming RGB-only models.

Conclusion: Combining depth correction with YOLO-SAM2 creates a robust solution for automated railway ballast inspection, especially in ambiguous cases.

Abstract: This paper presents a depth-enhanced YOLO-SAM2 framework for detecting ballast insufficiency in railway tracks using RGB-D data. Although YOLOv8 provides reliable localization, the RGB-only model shows limited safety performance, achieving high precision (0.99) but low recall (0.49) due to insufficient ballast, as it tends to over-predict the sufficient class. To improve reliability, we incorporate depth-based geometric analysis enabled by a sleeper-aligned depth-correction pipeline that compensates for RealSense spatial distortion using polynomial modeling, RANSAC, and temporal smoothing. SAM2 segmentation further refines region-of-interest masks, enabling accurate extraction of sleeper and ballast profiles for geometric classification.
  Experiments on field-collected top-down RGB-D data show that depth-enhanced configurations substantially improve the detection of insufficient ballast. Depending on bounding-box sampling (AABB or RBB) and geometric criteria, recall increases from 0.49 to as high as 0.80, and F1-score improves from 0.66 to over 0.80. These results demonstrate that integrating depth correction with YOLO-SAM2 yields a more robust and reliable approach for automated railway ballast inspection, particularly in visually ambiguous or safety-critical scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face presentation attack detection is essential for securing facial authentication against spoofing methods like print, replay, and masks.

Method: The paper enhances MobileNetV3 with content-adaptive spatial operators (involution) to capture localized spoof cues, using end-to-end training with binary cross-entropy.

Result: CASO-PAD achieves high test accuracy (up to 100%), AUC (up to 1.00), and low HTER/EER on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong robustness.

Conclusion: CASO-PAD offers a practical solution for robust, on-device FacePAD, balancing accuracy and efficiency without needing additional sensors or temporal data.

Abstract: Face presentation attack detection (FacePAD) is critical for securing facial authentication against print, replay, and mask-based spoofing. This paper proposes CASO-PAD, an RGB-only, single-frame model that enhances MobileNetV3 with content-adaptive spatial operators (involution) to better capture localized spoof cues. Unlike spatially shared convolution kernels, the proposed operator generates location-specific, channel-shared kernels conditioned on the input, improving spatial selectivity with minimal overhead. CASO-PAD remains lightweight (3.6M parameters; 0.64 GFLOPs at $256\times256$) and is trained end-to-end using a standard binary cross-entropy objective. Extensive experiments on Replay-Attack, Replay-Mobile, ROSE-Youtu, and OULU-NPU demonstrate strong performance, achieving 100/100/98.9/99.7\% test accuracy, AUC of 1.00/1.00/0.9995/0.9999, and HTER of 0.00/0.00/0.82/0.44\%, respectively. On the large-scale SiW-Mv2 Protocol-1 benchmark, CASO-PAD further attains 95.45\% accuracy with 3.11\% HTER and 3.13\% EER, indicating improved robustness under diverse real-world attacks. Ablation studies show that placing the adaptive operator near the network head and using moderate group sharing yields the best accuracy--efficiency balance.

*Thinesh Thiyakesan Ponbagavathi,Constantin Seibold,Alina Roitberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Frame2Freq introduces frequency-aware adapters for video adaptation of image-pretrained models, improving fine-grained action recognition by capturing multi-scale temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time-domain adapters focus on static cues or fast flicker changes, missing medium-speed motion crucial for fine-grained temporal analysis.

Method: Frame2Freq uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for spectral encoding, learning frequency-band specific embeddings to highlight discriminative frequency ranges.

Result: Outperforms prior PEFT methods and fully fine-tuned models on four out of five fine-grained activity recognition datasets.

Conclusion: Frequency analysis is effective for modeling temporal dynamics in image-to-video transfer.

Abstract: Adapting image-pretrained backbones to video typically relies on time-domain adapters tuned to a single temporal scale. Our experiments show that these modules pick up static image cues and very fast flicker changes, while overlooking medium-speed motion. Capturing dynamics across multiple time-scales is, however, crucial for fine-grained temporal analysis (i.e., opening vs. closing bottle).
  To address this, we introduce Frame2Freq -- a family of frequency-aware adapters that perform spectral encoding during image-to-video adaptation of pretrained Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), improving fine-grained action recognition. Frame2Freq uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) along time and learns frequency-band specific embeddings that adaptively highlight the most discriminative frequency ranges. Across five fine-grained activity recognition datasets, Frame2Freq outperforms prior PEFT methods and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models on four of them. These results provide encouraging evidence that frequency analysis methods are a powerful tool for modeling temporal dynamics in image-to-video transfer.

*Yuyang Ji,Yixuan Shen,Kien Nguyen,Lifeng Zhou,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDSelect is a reinforcement learning-based selector that optimizes video-based person recognition by choosing efficient models per modality, balancing accuracy and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems inefficiently process all modalities with fixed heavyweight ensembles, wasting resources regardless of input complexity.

Method: Uses actor-critic reinforcement learning to train a lightweight agent for selecting pre-trained models per modality per-sequence, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-off with budget-aware rewards and entropy regularization.

Result: Achieves 95.9% Rank-1 accuracy with 92.4% less computation on CCVID and reduces computation by 41.3% on MEVID while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: IDSelect surpasses fixed ensembles in efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness for resource-aware video-based person recognition.

Abstract: Video-based person recognition achieves robust identification by integrating face, body, and gait. However, current systems waste computational resources by processing all modalities with fixed heavyweight ensembles regardless of input complexity. To address these limitations, we propose IDSelect, a reinforcement learning-based cost-aware selector that chooses one pre-trained model per modality per-sequence to optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Our key insight is that an input-conditioned selector can discover complementary model choices that surpass fixed ensembles while using substantially fewer resources. IDSelect trains a lightweight agent end-to-end using actor-critic reinforcement learning with budget-aware optimization. The reward balances recognition accuracy with computational cost, while entropy regularization prevents premature convergence. At inference, the policy selects the most probable model per modality and fuses modality-specific similarities for the final score. Extensive experiments on challenging video-based datasets demonstrate IDSelect's superior efficiency: on CCVID, it achieves 95.9% Rank-1 accuracy with 92.4% less computation than strong baselines while improving accuracy by 1.8%; on MEVID, it reduces computation by 41.3% while maintaining competitive performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeaCache introduces spectrally aligned caching to accelerate diffusion models, focusing on spectral evolution for better latency-quality trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address slow inference in diffusion models caused by sequential denoising, leveraging spectral evolution insights for efficient caching.

Method: Proposes Spectral-Evolution-Aware Cache (SeaCache), using SEA-filtered features to dynamically schedule cache reuse.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art latency-quality trade-offs across diverse generative models.

Conclusion: SeaCache effectively speeds up diffusion models by aligning caching strategies with spectral evolution principles.

Abstract: Diffusion models are a strong backbone for visual generation, but their inherently sequential denoising process leads to slow inference. Previous methods accelerate sampling by caching and reusing intermediate outputs based on feature distances between adjacent timesteps. However, existing caching strategies typically rely on raw feature differences that entangle content and noise. This design overlooks spectral evolution, where low-frequency structure appears early and high-frequency detail is refined later. We introduce Spectral-Evolution-Aware Cache (SeaCache), a training-free cache schedule that bases reuse decisions on a spectrally aligned representation. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we derive a Spectral-Evolution-Aware (SEA) filter that preserves content-relevant components while suppressing noise. Employing SEA-filtered input features to estimate redundancy leads to dynamic schedules that adapt to content while respecting the spectral priors underlying the diffusion model. Extensive experiments on diverse visual generative models and the baselines show that SeaCache achieves state-of-the-art latency-quality trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of establishing visual correspondence between egocentric and exocentric viewpoints in videos without relying on ground-truth annotations.

Method: Uses conditional binary segmentation with a latent representation for object queries and introduces a cycle-consistency objective for self-supervision.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on Ego-Exo4D and HANDAL-X benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The framework is simple yet effective, enabling robust, view-invariant representations and test-time training.

Abstract: We study the task of establishing object-level visual correspondence across different viewpoints in videos, focusing on the challenging egocentric-to-exocentric and exocentric-to-egocentric scenarios. We propose a simple yet effective framework based on conditional binary segmentation, where an object query mask is encoded into a latent representation to guide the localization of the corresponding object in a target video. To encourage robust, view-invariant representations, we introduce a cycle-consistency training objective: the predicted mask in the target view is projected back to the source view to reconstruct the original query mask. This bidirectional constraint provides a strong self-supervisory signal without requiring ground-truth annotations and enables test-time training (TTT) at inference. Experiments on the Ego-Exo4D and HANDAL-X benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization objective and TTT strategy, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Result: Existing methods struggle with complex personalized tasks, showing performance gaps. LifeGraph improves results by leveraging structured knowledge but highlights ongoing challenges.

Conclusion: Advanced personalization tasks remain challenging, motivating further research, with Life-Bench and LifeGraph providing foundational tools for progress.

Abstract: The powerful reasoning of modern Vision Language Models open a new frontier for advanced personalization study. However, progress in this area is critically hampered by the lack of suitable benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce Life-Bench, a comprehensive, synthetically generated multimodal benchmark built on simulated user digital footprints. Life-Bench features over questions evaluating a wide spectrum of capabilities, from persona understanding to complex reasoning over historical data. These capabilities expand far beyond prior benchmarks, reflecting the critical demands essential for real-world applications. Furthermore, we propose LifeGraph, an end-to-end framework that organizes personal context into a knowledge graph to facilitate structured retrieval and reasoning. Our experiments on Life-Bench reveal that existing methods falter significantly on complex personalized tasks, exposing a large performance headroom, especially in relational, temporal and aggregative reasoning. While LifeGraph closes this gap by leveraging structured knowledge and demonstrates a promising direction, these advanced personalization tasks remain a critical open challenge, motivating new research in this area.

### [65] [MoBind: Motion Binding for Fine-Grained IMU-Video Pose Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19004)
*Duc Duy Nguyen,Tat-Jun Chin,Minh Hoai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoBind introduces a hierarchical contrastive learning framework to align IMU signals with 2D pose sequences, enabling cross-modal tasks like retrieval and action recognition, outperforming baselines on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to learn joint representations between IMU signals and 2D pose sequences to address challenges like irrelevant background filtering, multi-sensor modeling, and fine-grained temporal alignment.

Method: MoBind uses skeletal motion sequences instead of raw pixels, decomposes motion into body-part trajectories, and employs hierarchical contrastive learning for alignment at token and global levels.

Result: MoBind outperforms baselines on mRi, TotalCapture, and EgoHumans datasets across tasks like retrieval, synchronization, and recognition.

Conclusion: MoBind demonstrates robust temporal alignment and semantic consistency across modalities, proving effective for cross-modal tasks.

Abstract: We aim to learn a joint representation between inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals and 2D pose sequences extracted from video, enabling accurate cross-modal retrieval, temporal synchronization, subject and body-part localization, and action recognition. To this end, we introduce MoBind, a hierarchical contrastive learning framework designed to address three challenges: (1) filtering out irrelevant visual background, (2) modeling structured multi-sensor IMU configurations, and (3) achieving fine-grained, sub-second temporal alignment. To isolate motion-relevant cues, MoBind aligns IMU signals with skeletal motion sequences rather than raw pixels. We further decompose full-body motion into local body-part trajectories, pairing each with its corresponding IMU to enable semantically grounded multi-sensor alignment. To capture detailed temporal correspondence, MoBind employs a hierarchical contrastive strategy that first aligns token-level temporal segments, then fuses local (body-part) alignment with global (body-wide) motion aggregation. Evaluated on mRi, TotalCapture, and EgoHumans, MoBind consistently outperforms strong baselines across all four tasks, demonstrating robust fine-grained temporal alignment while preserving coarse semantic consistency across modalities.

Motivation: Non-invasive grading of prostate cancer from micro-US can improve triage and biopsy guidance, but current models struggle with coarse resolution.

Method: An unpaired histopathology knowledge-distillation strategy trains a micro-US encoder to emulate a pretrained histopathology model, using ISUP grades without requiring paired data.

Result: The method increases sensitivity to clinically significant prostate cancer by 3.5% and overall sensitivity by 1.2% at 60% specificity.

Conclusion: The approach enhances cancer risk stratification from imaging alone, advancing clinical feasibility; source code will be shared upon publication.

Abstract: Purpose: Non-invasive grading of prostate cancer (PCa) from micro-ultrasound (micro-US) could expedite triage and guide biopsies toward the most aggressive regions, yet current models struggle to infer tissue micro-structure at coarse imaging resolutions.
  Methods: We introduce an unpaired histopathology knowledge-distillation strategy that trains a micro-US encoder to emulate the embedding distribution of a pretrained histopathology foundation model, conditioned on International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grades. Training requires no patient-level pairing or image registration, and histopathology inputs are not used at inference.
  Results: Compared to the current state of the art, our approach increases sensitivity to clinically significant PCa (csPCa) at 60% specificity by 3.5% and improves overall sensitivity at 60% specificity by 1.2%.
  Conclusion: By enabling earlier and more dependable cancer risk stratification solely from imaging, our method advances clinical feasibility. Source code will be publicly released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEFNet improves blind image quality assessment by integrating multitask optimization and advanced uncertainty estimation, demonstrating robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BIQA methods face limitations due to poor integration and inflexible uncertainty estimation, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: Proposes DEFNet, leveraging multitask optimization (scene/distortion classification) and a trustworthy fusion strategy combining local-global features. Uses evidential learning for uncertainty estimation.

Result: Shows effectiveness and robustness on synthetic and authentic distortion datasets, with strong generalization to unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: DEFNet enhances BIQA performance through integrated multitasking and reliable uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods often incorporate auxiliary tasks to improve performance. However, existing approaches face limitations due to insufficient integration and a lack of flexible uncertainty estimation, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a multitasks-based Deep Evidential Fusion Network (DEFNet) for BIQA, which performs multitask optimization with the assistance of scene and distortion type classification tasks. To achieve a more robust and reliable representation, we design a novel trustworthy information fusion strategy. It first combines diverse features and patterns across sub-regions to enhance information richness, and then performs local-global information fusion by balancing fine-grained details with coarse-grained context. Moreover, DEFNet exploits advanced uncertainty estimation technique inspired by evidential learning with the help of normal-inverse gamma distribution mixture. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and authentic distortion datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Additional evaluation and analysis are carried out to highlight its strong generalization capability and adaptability to previously unseen scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenTrace is a novel watermarking framework for multi-concept attribution in generative AI, outperforming existing methods by embedding signatures in the semantic domain and enabling query-based retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of intellectual property protection in generative AI, where existing watermarking methods fail to attribute multiple concepts within a single image.

Method: TokenTrace embeds secret signatures by perturbing text prompt embeddings and initial latent noise in diffusion models, using a query-based module for retrieval.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in single and multi-concept attribution, maintaining high visual quality and robustness to transformations.

Conclusion: TokenTrace provides a robust solution for multi-concept attribution in generative AI, significantly improving over existing watermarking techniques.

Abstract: Generative AI models pose a significant challenge to intellectual property (IP), as they can replicate unique artistic styles and concepts without attribution. While watermarking offers a potential solution, existing methods often fail in complex scenarios where multiple concepts (e.g., an object and an artistic style) are composed within a single image. These methods struggle to disentangle and attribute each concept individually. In this work, we introduce TokenTrace, a novel proactive watermarking framework for robust, multi-concept attribution. Our method embeds secret signatures into the semantic domain by simultaneously perturbing the text prompt embedding and the initial latent noise that guide the diffusion model's generation process. For retrieval, we propose a query-based TokenTrace module that takes the generated image and a textual query specifying which concepts need to be retrieved (e.g., a specific object or style) as inputs. This query-based mechanism allows the module to disentangle and independently verify the presence of multiple concepts from a single generated image. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-concept (object and style) and multi-concept attribution tasks, significantly outperforming existing baselines while maintaining high visual quality and robustness to common transformations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Summary: Enhances texture generation for 3D garments by addressing non-isometric image-geometry constraints, using simulated data and iterative baking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for texture generation in 3D garment meshes are limited by strict topological consistency requirements or reliance on accurate mesh deformation, restricting texture quality and flexibility.

Method: Constructs a dataset (3D Garment Videos) for consistent geometry/material supervision, uses Nano Banana for non-isometric editing, and proposes iterative baking with uncertainty-guided view selection.

Result: Achieves versatile, spatially aligned PBR materials suitable for industry-level garment design.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively overcomes limitations of existing methods, enabling robust cross-pose texture learning and high-quality texture generation.

Abstract: Existing industrial 3D garment meshes already cover most real-world clothing geometries, yet their texture diversity remains limited. To acquire more realistic textures, generative methods are often used to extract Physically-based Rendering (PBR) textures and materials from large collections of wild images and project them back onto garment meshes. However, most image-conditioned texture generation approaches require strict topological consistency between the input image and the input 3D mesh, or rely on accurate mesh deformation to match to the image poses, which significantly constrains the texture generation quality and flexibility. To address the challenging problem of non-isometric image-based garment texture generation, we construct 3D Garment Videos, a physically simulated, garment-centric dataset that provides consistent geometry and material supervision across diverse deformations, enabling robust cross-pose texture learning. We further employ Nano Banana for high-quality non-isometric image editing, achieving reliable cross-topology texture generation between non-isometric image-geometry pairs. Finally, we propose an iterative baking method via uncertainty-guided view selection and reweighting that fuses multi-view predictions into seamless, production-ready PBR textures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our feedforward dual-branch architecture generates versatile and spatially aligned PBR materials suitable for industry-level 3D garment design.

TL;DR: FishProtoNet is a non-invasive, interpretable computer vision framework for sex identification in delta smelt, achieving strong performance in certain life stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sex identification methods for fish are invasive or stressful, posing risks to endangered species like delta smelt. FishProtoNet addresses this with a non-invasive approach.

Method: FishProtoNet uses a visual foundation model for ROI extraction, feature extraction, and an interpretable prototype network for sex identification.

Result: Achieves accuracies of 74.40% (early spawning) and 81.16% (post-spawning), with F1 scores of 74.27% and 79.43%. Subadult stage remains challenging.

Conclusion: FishProtoNet offers a robust, interpretable solution for delta smelt sex identification, though further improvements are needed for subadult stages.

Abstract: Accurate sex identification in fish is vital for optimizing breeding and management strategies in aquaculture, particularly for species at the risk of extinction. However, most existing methods are invasive or stressful and may cause additional mortality, posing severe risks to threatened or endangered fish populations. To address these challenges, we propose FishProtoNet, a robust, non-invasive computer vision-based framework for sex identification of delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), an endangered fish species native to California, across its full life cycle. Unlike the traditional deep learning methods, FishProtoNet provides interpretability through learned prototype representations while improving robustness by leveraging foundation models to reduce the influence of background noise. Specifically, the FishProtoNet framework consists of three key components: fish regions of interest (ROIs) extraction using visual foundation model, feature extraction from fish ROIs and fish sex identification based on an interpretable prototype network. FishProtoNet demonstrates strong performance in delta smelt sex identification during early spawning and post-spawning stages, achieving the accuracies of 74.40% and 81.16% and corresponding F1 scores of 74.27% and 79.43% respectively. In contrast, delta smelt sex identification at the subadult stage remains challenging for current computer vision methods, likely due to less pronounced morphological differences in immature fish. The source code of FishProtoNet is publicly available at: https://github.com/zhengmiao1/Fish_sex_identification

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt tuning in large-scale vision-language models often results in poor confidence calibration and unreliable predictive uncertainty, which this work aims to address.

Method: The framework extends cross-entropy loss with two regularizers: a mean-variance margin penalty to stabilize logit margins and a text moment-matching loss to align text embeddings with frozen CLIP counterparts.

Result: Experiments across 7 prompt-tuning methods and 11 datasets show significant reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to competitive techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances predictive reliability and calibration without disrupting the pretrained CLIP embedding space.

Abstract: Prompt tuning of large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP enables efficient task adaptation without updating model weights. However, it often leads to poor confidence calibration and unreliable predictive uncertainty. We address this problem by proposing a calibration framework that enhances predictive reliability while preserving the geometry of the pretrained CLIP embedding space, which is required for robust generalization. Our approach extends the standard cross-entropy loss with two complementary regularizers: (1) a mean-variance margin penalty that stabilizes inter-class logit margins by maximizing their average while minimizing dispersion, mitigating underconfidence and overconfidence spikes; and (2) a text moment-matching loss that aligns the first and second moments of tuned text embeddings with their frozen CLIP counterparts, preserving semantic dispersion crucial for generalization. Through extensive experiments across 7 prompt-tuning methods and 11 diverse datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to competitive calibration techniques on both base and novel classes

TL;DR: OpenVO is a framework for Open-world Visual Odometry that improves ego-motion estimation under varying observation rates and uncalibrated cameras, outperforming existing methods by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VO methods struggle with varying observation frequencies and uncalibrated cameras, limiting their generalizability for real-world applications like dashcam footage analysis.

Method: OpenVO encodes temporal dynamics in a two-frame pose regression framework and uses 3D geometric priors from foundation models.

Result: Validated on KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2, OpenVO achieves over 20% better performance and 46%-92% lower errors under varying observation rates.

Conclusion: OpenVO is versatile and robust, making it suitable for real-world 3D reconstruction and diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: We introduce OpenVO, a novel framework for Open-world Visual Odometry (VO) with temporal awareness under limited input conditions. OpenVO effectively estimates real-world-scale ego-motion from monocular dashcam footage with varying observation rates and uncalibrated cameras, enabling robust trajectory dataset construction from rare driving events recorded in dashcam. Existing VO methods are trained on fixed observation frequency (e.g., 10Hz or 12Hz), completely overlooking temporal dynamics information. Many prior methods also require calibrated cameras with known intrinsic parameters. Consequently, their performance degrades when (1) deployed under unseen observation frequencies or (2) applied to uncalibrated cameras. These significantly limit their generalizability to many downstream tasks, such as extracting trajectories from dashcam footage. To address these challenges, OpenVO (1) explicitly encodes temporal dynamics information within a two-frame pose regression framework and (2) leverages 3D geometric priors derived from foundation models. We validate our method on three major autonomous-driving benchmarks - KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2 - achieving more than 20 performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. Under varying observation rate settings, our method is significantly more robust, achieving 46%-92% lower errors across all metrics. These results demonstrate the versatility of OpenVO for real-world 3D reconstruction and diverse downstream applications.

*Qingwen Zhang,Chenhan Jiang,Xiaomeng Zhu,Yunqi Miao,Yushan Zhang,Olov Andersson,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeFlow improves scene flow estimation by using multi-frame supervision, outperforming existing methods and matching optimization-based speeds while being much faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised methods rely on unreliable two-frame correspondences, especially under occlusions. Multi-frame supervision could offer better stability but lacks effective implementation.

Method: TeFlow introduces temporal ensembling to aggregate consistent motion cues across multiple frames, forming reliable supervisory signals.

Result: TeFlow achieves a 33% performance gain on Argoverse 2 and nuScenes, matching top optimization-based methods while being 150 times faster.

Conclusion: TeFlow effectively leverages multi-frame supervision for accurate and efficient scene flow estimation, outperforming existing self-supervised methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised feed-forward methods for scene flow estimation offer real-time efficiency, but their supervision from two-frame point correspondences is unreliable and often breaks down under occlusions. Multi-frame supervision has the potential to provide more stable guidance by incorporating motion cues from past frames, yet naive extensions of two-frame objectives are ineffective because point correspondences vary abruptly across frames, producing inconsistent signals. In the paper, we present TeFlow, enabling multi-frame supervision for feed-forward models by mining temporally consistent supervision. TeFlow introduces a temporal ensembling strategy that forms reliable supervisory signals by aggregating the most temporally consistent motion cues from a candidate pool built across multiple frames. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TeFlow establishes a new state-of-the-art for self-supervised feed-forward methods, achieving performance gains of up to 33\% on the challenging Argoverse 2 and nuScenes datasets. Our method performs on par with leading optimization-based methods, yet speeds up 150 times. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/KTH-RPL/OpenSceneFlow along with trained model weights.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PoseRecover and PoseAlign to enable direction-aware 3D LMMs by supplementing ego poses into benchmarks and aligning point cloud data, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud benchmarks lack ego poses, making directional question-answering and spatial reasoning ill-posed for 3D LMMs.

Method: Proposes PoseRecover (automatic pose recovery pipeline) and PoseAlign (point cloud transformation), avoiding textual prompts or pose-encoded features.

Result: Improves ScanRefer mIoU by 30.0% and Scan2Cap accuracy by 11.7%, validating effectiveness across multiple 3D LMM backbones.

Conclusion: The approach is simple, generic, and training-efficient, establishing a strong baseline for direction-aware 3D LMMs.

Abstract: 3D large multimodal models (3D LMMs) rely heavily on ego poses for enabling directional question-answering and spatial reasoning. However, most existing point cloud benchmarks contain rich directional queries but lack the corresponding ego poses, making them inherently ill-posed in 3D large multimodal modelling. In this work, we redefine a new and rigorous paradigm that enables direction-aware 3D LMMs by identifying and supplementing ego poses into point cloud benchmarks and transforming the corresponding point cloud data according to the identified ego poses. We enable direction-aware 3D LMMs with two novel designs. The first is PoseRecover, a fully automatic pose recovery pipeline that matches questions with ego poses from RGB-D video extrinsics via object-frustum intersection and visibility check with Z-buffers. The second is PoseAlign that transforms the point cloud data to be aligned with the identified ego poses instead of either injecting ego poses into textual prompts or introducing pose-encoded features in the projection layers. Extensive experiments show that our designs yield consistent improvements across multiple 3D LMM backbones such as LL3DA, LL3DA-SONATA, Chat-Scene, and 3D-LLAVA, improving ScanRefer mIoU by 30.0% and Scan2Cap LLM-as-judge accuracy by 11.7%. In addition, our approach is simple, generic, and training-efficient, requiring only instruction tuning while establishing a strong baseline for direction-aware 3D-LMMs.

Conclusion: L3DR effectively rectifies RV artifacts, improves geometry realism, and is applicable to various LiDAR diffusion models with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Range-view (RV) based LiDAR diffusion has recently made huge strides towards 2D photo-realism. However, it neglects 3D geometry realism and often generates various RV artifacts such as depth bleeding and wavy surfaces. We design L3DR, a 3D-aware LiDAR Diffusion and Rectification framework that can regress and cancel RV artifacts in 3D space and restore local geometry accurately. Our theoretical and empirical analysis reveals that 3D models are inherently superior to 2D models in generating sharp and authentic boundaries. Leveraging such analysis, we design a 3D residual regression network that rectifies RV artifacts and achieves superb geometry realism by predicting point-level offsets in 3D space. On top of that, we design a Welsch Loss that helps focus on local geometry and ignore anomalous regions effectively. Extensive experiments over multiple benchmarks including KITTI, KITTI360, nuScenes and Waymo show that the proposed L3DR achieves state-of-the-art generation and superior geometry-realism consistently. In addition, L3DR is generally applicable to different LiDAR diffusion models with little computational overhead.

*Liangsi Lu,Xuhang Chen,Minzhe Guo,Shichu Li,Jingchao Wang,Yang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChordEdit introduces a training-free, inversion-free method for high-fidelity one-step text-guided image editing by framing it as a transport problem and using dynamic optimal transport theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing one-step text-to-image models struggle with editing due to distortion and inconsistency in non-edited regions, stemming from unstable vector arithmetic.

Method: ChordEdit reframes editing as a transport problem between source and target distributions, using dynamic optimal transport theory for stable, low-energy control.

Result: The method produces smooth, variance-reduced editing fields, enabling high-fidelity edits in a single step without distortion or loss of consistency.

Conclusion: ChordEdit achieves real-time, precise text-guided image editing on challenging one-step models with stability and efficiency.

Abstract: The advent of one-step text-to-image (T2I) models offers unprecedented synthesis speed. However, their application to text-guided image editing remains severely hampered, as forcing existing training-free editors into a single inference step fails. This failure manifests as severe object distortion and a critical loss of consistency in non-edited regions, resulting from the high-energy, erratic trajectories produced by naive vector arithmetic on the models' structured fields. To address this problem, we introduce ChordEdit, a model agnostic, training-free, and inversion-free method that facilitates high-fidelity one-step editing. We recast editing as a transport problem between the source and target distributions defined by the source and target text prompts. Leveraging dynamic optimal transport theory, we derive a principled, low-energy control strategy. This strategy yields a smoothed, variance-reduced editing field that is inherently stable, facilitating the field to be traversed in a single, large integration step. A theoretically grounded and experimentally validated approach allows ChordEdit to deliver fast, lightweight and precise edits, finally achieving true real-time editing on these challenging models.

*Rui-Yang Ju,Kohei Yamashita,Hirotaka Kameko,Shinsuke Mori*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a three-stage framework (RG-KCR) to improve Kuzushiji character recognition under seal interference, achieving high precision and recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern Japanese readers struggle with Kuzushiji due to its cursive forms and glyph variations, especially when seals overlap characters.

Method: Proposes RG-KCR with stages for detection, restoration, and classification, using YOLOv12-medium and Vision Transformer-based models.

Result: Achieves 98.0% precision and 93.3% recall in detection; restoration boosts classification accuracy from 93.45% to 95.33%.

Conclusion: RG-KCR effectively addresses seal interference, enhancing Kuzushiji recognition accuracy.

Abstract: Kuzushiji was one of the most popular writing styles in pre-modern Japan and was widely used in both personal letters and official documents. However, due to its highly cursive forms and extensive glyph variations, most modern Japanese readers cannot directly interpret Kuzushiji characters. Therefore, recent research has focused on developing automated Kuzushiji character recognition methods, which have achieved satisfactory performance on relatively clean Kuzushiji document images. However, existing methods struggle to maintain recognition accuracy under seal interference (e.g., when seals overlap characters), despite the frequent occurrence of seals in pre-modern Japanese documents. To address this challenge, we propose a three-stage restoration-guided Kuzushiji character recognition (RG-KCR) framework specifically designed to mitigate seal interference. We construct datasets for evaluating Kuzushiji character detection (Stage 1) and classification (Stage 3). Experimental results show that the YOLOv12-medium model achieves a precision of 98.0% and a recall of 93.3% on the constructed test set. We quantitatively evaluate the restoration performance of Stage 2 using PSNR and SSIM. In addition, we conduct an ablation study to demonstrate that Stage 2 improves the Top-1 accuracy of Metom, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based Kuzushiji classifier employed in Stage 3, from 93.45% to 95.33%. The implementation code of this work is available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/RG-KCR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIGiA is a multimodal dialogue model for instructional videos, combining visual and textual inputs for accurate plan-aware dialogue, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in prior work by enabling grounded, plan-aware dialogue that integrates visual inputs and instructional plans.

Method: Incorporates multimodal plan reasoning and plan-based retrieval to align queries with task plans and retrieve relevant steps.

Result: Achieves over 90% accuracy on plan-aware VQA, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: VIGiA demonstrates superior performance in handling complex, multimodal instructional dialogues.

Abstract: We introduce VIGiA, a novel multimodal dialogue model designed to understand and reason over complex, multi-step instructional video action plans. Unlike prior work which focuses mainly on text-only guidance, or treats vision and language in isolation, VIGiA supports grounded, plan-aware dialogue that requires reasoning over visual inputs, instructional plans, and interleaved user interactions. To this end, VIGiA incorporates two key capabilities: (1) multimodal plan reasoning, enabling the model to align uni- and multimodal queries with the current task plan and respond accurately; and (2) plan-based retrieval, allowing it to retrieve relevant plan steps in either textual or visual representations. Experiments were done on a novel dataset with rich Instructional Video Dialogues aligned with Cooking and DIY plans. Our evaluation shows that VIGiA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on all tasks in a conversational plan guidance setting, reaching over 90\% accuracy on plan-aware VQA.

*Qi Sun,Can Wang,Jiaxiang Shang,Yingchun Liu,Jing Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ani3DHuman combines kinematics-based animation and video diffusion priors to achieve photorealistic 3D human animation by addressing rigid and non-rigid motion separately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either lack non-rigid dynamics (kinematics-based) or suffer from quality artifacts and identity loss (video diffusion priors), motivating a hybrid approach.

Method: The framework uses layered motion representation, generates rigid motion via kinematics, and employs a self-guided stochastic sampling method to restore non-rigid motion with video diffusion priors.

Result: Ani3DHuman outperforms existing methods, producing high-quality, photorealistic 3D human animations.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully addresses limitations of prior methods, achieving superior results in 3D human animation.

Abstract: Current 3D human animation methods struggle to achieve photorealism: kinematics-based approaches lack non-rigid dynamics (e.g., clothing dynamics), while methods that leverage video diffusion priors can synthesize non-rigid motion but suffer from quality artifacts and identity loss. To overcome these limitations, we present Ani3DHuman, a framework that marries kinematics-based animation with video diffusion priors. We first introduce a layered motion representation that disentangles rigid motion from residual non-rigid motion. Rigid motion is generated by a kinematic method, which then produces a coarse rendering to guide the video diffusion model in generating video sequences that restore the residual non-rigid motion. However, this restoration task, based on diffusion sampling, is highly challenging, as the initial renderings are out-of-distribution, causing standard deterministic ODE samplers to fail. Therefore, we propose a novel self-guided stochastic sampling method, which effectively addresses the out-of-distribution problem by combining stochastic sampling (for photorealistic quality) with self-guidance (for identity fidelity). These restored videos provide high-quality supervision, enabling the optimization of the residual non-rigid motion field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \MethodName can generate photorealistic 3D human animation, outperforming existing methods. Code is available in https://github.com/qiisun/ani3dhuman.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CREM is a unified framework enhancing multimodal representations for retrieval without losing generative capabilities by using compression-based prompts and training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with embedding-based tasks like retrieval due to format discrepancies, and fine-tuning compromises generative abilities. Shared cognitive mechanisms suggest a unified solution.

Method: CREM employs compression-driven prompts with learnable tokens and integrates contrastive-generative training via compression-aware attention.

Result: CREM excels in retrieval on MMEB and maintains strong generative performance on comprehension benchmarks, proving generative supervision boosts representation quality.

Conclusion: CREM successfully balances retrieval and generative tasks, demonstrating the value of compression-driven approaches in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable success in comprehension tasks such as visual description and visual question answering. However, their direct application to embedding-based tasks like retrieval remains challenging due to the discrepancy between output formats and optimization objectives. Previous approaches often employ contrastive fine-tuning to adapt MLLMs for retrieval, but at the cost of losing their generative capabilities. We argue that both generative and embedding tasks fundamentally rely on shared cognitive mechanisms, specifically cross-modal representation alignment and contextual comprehension. To this end, we propose CREM (Compression-driven Representation Enhanced Model), with a unified framework that enhances multimodal representations for retrieval while preserving generative ability. Specifically, we introduce a compression-based prompt design with learnable chorus tokens to aggregate multimodal semantics and a compression-driven training strategy that integrates contrastive and generative objectives through compression-aware attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CREM achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance on MMEB while maintaining strong generative performance on multiple comprehension benchmarks. Our findings highlight that generative supervision can further improve the representational quality of MLLMs under the proposed compression-driven paradigm.

*Qinfeng Xiao,Guofeng Mei,Bo Yang,Liying Zhang,Jian Zhang,Kit-lun Yick*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMatch is a semantic-aware framework designed to establish dense semantic correspondences between non-isometric shapes without category restrictions, leveraging coarse semantic cues and fine-tuning via contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely on near-isometric assumptions and homogeneous subject types, limiting their application. UniMatch addresses the challenge of building cross-category semantic correspondences.

Method: UniMatch operates in two stages: (1) Coarse segmentation using class-agnostic 3D segmentation and MLLMs/VLMs for semantic part matching, and (2) Fine-grained correspondence learning via rank-based contrastive schemes guided by coarse matches.

Result: UniMatch outperforms competing methods across diverse scenarios, demonstrating versatility for universal object categories without predefined part proposals.

Conclusion: UniMatch successfully enables dense semantic correspondences for inter-class and non-isometric shapes, advancing the field beyond traditional limitations.

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences between shapes is a crucial task in computer vision and graphics, while prior approaches depend on near-isometric assumptions and homogeneous subject types (i.e., only operate for human shapes). However, building semantic correspondences for cross-category objects remains challenging and has received relatively little attention. To achieve this, we propose UniMatch, a semantic-aware, coarse-to-fine framework for constructing dense semantic correspondences between strongly non-isometric shapes without restricting object categories. The key insight is to lift "coarse" semantic cues into "fine" correspondence, which is achieved through two stages. In the "coarse" stage, we perform class-agnostic 3D segmentation to obtain non-overlapping semantic parts and prompt multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to identify part names. Then, we employ pretrained vision language models (VLMs) to extract text embeddings, enabling the construction of matched semantic parts. In the "fine" stage, we leverage these coarse correspondences to guide the learning of dense correspondences through a dedicated rank-based contrastive scheme. Thanks to class-agnostic segmentation, language guiding, and rank-based contrastive learning, our method is versatile for universal object categories and requires no predefined part proposals, enabling universal matching for inter-class and non-isometric shapes. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniMatch consistently outperforms competing methods in various challenging scenarios.

*Minxue Tang,Yangyang Yu,Aolin Ding,Maziyar Baran Pouyan,Taha Belkhouja Yujia Bao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADAMAB is an efficient embedding calibration framework for few-shot pattern recognition, reducing computational costs and data needs while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recognizing implicit patterns is crucial for AI, but current pre-trained models struggle with long-tail tasks due to data and computational constraints.

Method: ADAMAB trains embedder-agnostic calibrators on fixed embeddings and uses adaptive data augmentation via a Multi-Armed Bandit mechanism.

Result: ADAMAB improves accuracy by up to 40% with less than 5 initial data samples per class.

Conclusion: ADAMAB offers a practical solution for few-shot pattern recognition with minimal data and computational overhead.

Abstract: Recognizing implicit visual and textual patterns is essential in many real-world applications of modern AI. However, tackling long-tail pattern recognition tasks remains challenging for current pre-trained foundation models such as LLMs and VLMs. While finetuning pre-trained models can improve accuracy in recognizing implicit patterns, it is usually infeasible due to a lack of training data and high computational overhead. In this paper, we propose ADAMAB, an efficient embedding calibration framework for few-shot pattern recognition. To maximally reduce the computational costs, ADAMAB trains embedder-agnostic light-weight calibrators on top of fixed embedding models without accessing their parameters. To mitigate the need for large-scale training data, we introduce an adaptive data augmentation strategy based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) mechanism. With a modified upper confidence bound algorithm, ADAMAB diminishes the gradient shifting and offers theoretically guaranteed convergence in few-shot training. Our multi-modal experiments justify the superior performance of ADAMAB, with up to 40% accuracy improvement when training with less than 5 initial data samples of each class.

*Jaeyun Jang,Seunghui Shin,Taeho Park,Hyoseok Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SymPL improves allocentric spatial reasoning in VLMs by converting it into symbolic-layout forms, boosting performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with allocentric spatial reasoning, which requires understanding spatial relationships from object-centered viewpoints.

Method: SymPL reformulates allocentric reasoning using projection, abstraction, bipartition, and localization into symbolic-layout representations.

Result: SymPL significantly enhances performance in allocentric and egocentric tasks and improves robustness against visual illusions and multi-view scenarios.

Conclusion: SymPL offers a principled and effective solution for complex perspective-aware spatial reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Perspective-aware spatial reasoning involves understanding spatial relationships from specific viewpoints-either egocentric (observer-centered) or allocentric (object-centered). While vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in egocentric settings, their performance deteriorates when reasoning from allocentric viewpoints, where spatial relations must be inferred from the perspective of objects within the scene. In this study, we address this underexplored challenge by introducing Symbolic Projective Layout (SymPL), a framework that reformulates allocentric reasoning into symbolic-layout forms that VLMs inherently handle well. By leveraging four key factors-projection, abstraction, bipartition, and localization-SymPL converts allocentric questions into structured symbolic-layout representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this reformulation substantially improves performance in both allocentric and egocentric tasks, enhances robustness under visual illusions and multi-view scenarios, and that each component contributes critically to these gains. These results show that SymPL provides an effective and principled approach for addressing complex perspective-aware spatial reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces StreetTree, a large-scale dataset for fine-grained street tree classification, addressing gaps in existing datasets and benchmarking vision models under complex urban conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of diverse, large-scale datasets for street tree classification hinders urban planning and ecosystem assessment.

Method: They create StreetTree, a dataset with 12M images of 8,300 species from 133 countries, including expert-verified data and hierarchical taxonomy.

Result: Experiments show the challenges for vision models due to high inter-species similarity, long-tailed distributions, and urban imaging conditions.

Conclusion: StreetTree is a key resource for urban tree research and highlights limitations in current computer vision methods.

Abstract: The fine-grained classification of street trees is a crucial task for urban planning, streetscape management, and the assessment of urban ecosystem services. However, progress in this field has been significantly hindered by the lack of large-scale, geographically diverse, and publicly available benchmark datasets specifically designed for street trees. To address this critical gap, we introduce StreetTree, the world's first large-scale benchmark dataset dedicated to fine-grained street tree classification. The dataset contains over 12 million images covering more than 8,300 common street tree species, collected from urban streetscapes across 133 countries spanning five continents, and supplemented with expert-verified observational data. StreetTree poses substantial challenges for pretrained vision models under complex urban environments: high inter-species visual similarity, long-tailed natural distributions, significant intra-class variations caused by seasonal changes, and diverse imaging conditions such as lighting, occlusions from buildings, and varying camera angles. In addition, we provide a hierarchical taxonomy (order-family-genus-species) to support research in hierarchical classification and representation learning. Through extensive experiments with various visual models, we establish strong baselines and reveal the limitations of existing methods in handling such real-world complexities. We believe that StreetTree will serve as a key resource for the refined management and research of urban street trees, while also driving new advancements at the intersection of computer vision and urban science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of high parameter counts and overfitting in modern deep learning models.

Method: Introduces Mapping Networks that replace high-dimensional weights with a compact latent vector, enforced by a Mapping Loss.

Result: Achieves comparable or better performance with a 99.5% reduction in trainable parameters across vision and sequence tasks.

Conclusion: Mapping Networks offer an efficient solution to overfitting and parameter inefficiency in large networks.

Abstract: The escalating parameter counts in modern deep learning models pose a fundamental challenge to efficient training and resolution of overfitting. We address this by introducing the \emph{Mapping Networks} which replace the high dimensional weight space by a compact, trainable latent vector based on the hypothesis that the trained parameters of large networks reside on smooth, low-dimensional manifolds. Henceforth, the Mapping Theorem enforced by a dedicated Mapping Loss, shows the existence of a mapping from this latent space to the target weight space both theoretically and in practice. Mapping Networks significantly reduce overfitting and achieve comparable to better performance than target network across complex vision and sequence tasks, including Image Classification, Deepfake Detection etc, with $\mathbf{99.5\%}$, i.e., around $500\times$ reduction in trainable parameters.

*Sijie Mai,Shiqin Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces rectified flow for modality distribution mapping, using a one-to-many strategy and adaptive relaxed alignment to reduce the modality gap and improve multimodal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reducing the modality gap focus on one-to-one alignment and lack global distribution awareness. This limits their effectiveness in multimodal fusion.

Method: Extends rectified flow for modality distribution mapping with a one-to-many strategy and adaptive relaxed alignment. Introduces cyclic rectified flow to prevent information loss.

Result: Achieves competitive results in multimodal affective computing tasks and effectively reduces the modality gap.

Conclusion: The proposed method robustly transforms distributions and enhances multimodal fusion, validated by strong performance and visualizations.

Abstract: Modality gap significantly restricts the effectiveness of multimodal fusion. Previous methods often use techniques such as diffusion models and adversarial learning to reduce the modality gap, but they typically focus on one-to-one alignment without exposing the data points of the source modality to the global distribution information of the target modality. To this end, leveraging the characteristic of rectified flow that can map one distribution to another via a straight trajectory, we extend rectified flow for modality distribution mapping. Specifically, we leverage the `one-to-many mapping' strategy in rectified flow that allows each data point of the source modality to observe the overall target distribution. This also alleviates the issue of insufficient paired data within each sample, enabling a more robust distribution transformation. Moreover, to achieve more accurate distribution mapping and address the ambiguous flow directions in one-to-many mapping, we design `adaptive relaxed alignment', enforcing stricter alignment for modality pairs belonging to the same sample, while applying relaxed mapping for pairs not belonging to the same sample or category. Additionally, to prevent information loss during distribution mapping, we introduce `cyclic rectified flow' to ensure the transferred features can be translated back to the original features, allowing multimodal representations to learn sufficient modality-specific information. After distribution alignment, our approach achieves very competitive results on multiple tasks of multimodal affective computing even with a simple fusion method, and visualizations verify that it can effectively reduce the modality gap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KOH microscopy for dermatophytosis suffers from artefacts and variability. This study aims to improve accuracy with AI-driven automated detection.

Method: The RT-DETR model was trained on 2,540 annotated KOH images with morphology-preserving augmentations to localize fungal structures accurately.

Result: The model showed high performance (recall: 0.9737, precision: 0.8043, AP@0.50: 93.56%) and 100% sensitivity in image-level diagnosis.

Conclusion: The AI system is a reliable automated screening tool, enhancing clinical decision-making in dermatomycology.

Abstract: Dermatophytosis is commonly assessed using potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy, yet accurate recognition of fungal hyphae is hindered by artefacts, heterogeneous keratin clearance, and notable inter-observer variability. This study presents a transformer-based detection framework using the RT-DETR model architecture to achieve precise, query-driven localization of fungal structures in high-resolution KOH images. A dataset of 2,540 routinely acquired microscopy images was manually annotated using a multi-class strategy to explicitly distinguish fungal elements from confounding artefacts. The model was trained with morphology-preserving augmentations to maintain the structural integrity of thin hyphae. Evaluation on an independent test set demonstrated robust object-level performance, with a recall of 0.9737, precision of 0.8043, and an AP@0.50 of 93.56%. When aggregated for image-level diagnosis, the model achieved 100% sensitivity and 98.8% accuracy, correctly identifying all positive cases without missing a single diagnosis. Qualitative outputs confirmed the robust localization of low-contrast hyphae even in artefact-rich fields. These results highlight that an artificial intelligence (AI) system can serve as a highly reliable, automated screening tool, effectively bridging the gap between image-level analysis and clinical decision-making in dermatomycology.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Flash-VAED, a framework to accelerate VAE decoders in latent diffusion models while maintaining quality, achieving a 6× speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent diffusion models face high latency in VAE decoders, hindering efficient video synthesis.

Method: Introduces an independence-aware channel pruning method and stage-wise optimization for causal 3D convolutions, plus a dynamic distillation framework.

Result: Flash-VAED achieves a 6× speedup with 96.9% reconstruction performance and accelerates end-to-end pipelines by 36%.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces VAE decoder latency without compromising quality.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet their inference remains costly and time-consuming. As diffusion transformers become increasingly efficient, the latency bottleneck inevitably shifts to VAE decoders. To reduce their latency while maintaining quality, we propose a universal acceleration framework for VAE decoders that preserves full alignment with the original latent distribution. Specifically, we propose (1) an independence-aware channel pruning method to effectively mitigate severe channel redundancy, and (2) a stage-wise dominant operator optimization strategy to address the high inference cost of the widely used causal 3D convolutions in VAE decoders. Based on these innovations, we construct a Flash-VAED family. Moreover, we design a three-phase dynamic distillation framework that efficiently transfers the capabilities of the original VAE decoder to Flash-VAED. Extensive experiments on Wan and LTX-Video VAE decoders demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in both quality and speed, achieving approximately a 6$\times$ speedup while maintaining the reconstruction performance up to 96.9%. Notably, Flash-VAED accelerates the end-to-end generation pipeline by up to 36% with negligible quality drops on VBench-2.0.

TL;DR: The paper introduces JavisDiT++, a framework for joint audio-video generation (JAVG) that improves quality, synchrony, and alignment with human preferences using techniques like MS-MoE, TA-RoPE, and AV-DPO. It achieves state-of-the-art results with minimal training data.

Motivation: Existing open-source JAVG methods lag behind commercial models in quality, synchrony, and human preference alignment. This paper aims to bridge these gaps.

Method: Proposes JavisDiT++ with MS-MoE for cross-modal interaction, TA-RoPE for frame-level synchrony, and AV-DPO for human preference alignment. Built on Wan2.1-1.3B-T2V.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with ~1M training entries, outperforming prior methods in quality and synchrony. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm module effectiveness.

Conclusion: JavisDiT++ advances JAVG by addressing key limitations, offering a robust framework with open-source availability.

Abstract: AIGC has rapidly expanded from text-to-image generation toward high-quality multimodal synthesis across video and audio. Within this context, joint audio-video generation (JAVG) has emerged as a fundamental task that produces synchronized and semantically aligned sound and vision from textual descriptions. However, compared with advanced commercial models such as Veo3, existing open-source methods still suffer from limitations in generation quality, temporal synchrony, and alignment with human preferences. To bridge the gap, this paper presents JavisDiT++, a concise yet powerful framework for unified modeling and optimization of JAVG. First, we introduce a modality-specific mixture-of-experts (MS-MoE) design that enables cross-modal interaction efficacy while enhancing single-modal generation quality. Then, we propose a temporal-aligned RoPE (TA-RoPE) strategy to achieve explicit, frame-level synchronization between audio and video tokens. Besides, we develop an audio-video direct preference optimization (AV-DPO) method to align model outputs with human preference across quality, consistency, and synchrony dimensions. Built upon Wan2.1-1.3B-T2V, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance merely with around 1M public training entries, significantly outperforming prior approaches in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Comprehensive ablation studies have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

*Kanglei Zhou,Chang Li,Qingyi Pan,Liyuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BriMA improves multi-modal AQA under missing modalities by reconstructing data and prioritizing informative samples, outperforming existing methods by 6-8% in correlation and 12-15% in error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world AQA deployments face non-stationary modality imbalance due to sensor or annotation issues, which existing methods overlook.

Method: BriMA uses memory-guided bridging imputation and modality-aware replay to handle missing modalities.

Result: BriMA achieves higher correlation and lower error rates across three datasets (RG, Fis-V, FS1000).

Conclusion: BriMA advances robust multi-modal AQA for real-world constraints.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to score how well an action is performed and is widely used in sports analysis, rehabilitation assessment, and human skill evaluation. Multi-modal AQA has recently achieved strong progress by leveraging complementary visual and kinematic cues, yet real-world deployments often suffer from non-stationary modality imbalance, where certain modalities become missing or intermittently available due to sensor failures or annotation gaps. Existing continual AQA methods overlook this issue and assume that all modalities remain complete and stable throughout training, which restricts their practicality. To address this challenge, we introduce Bridged Modality Adaptation (BriMA), an innovative approach to multi-modal continual AQA under modality-missing conditions. BriMA consists of a memory-guided bridging imputation module that reconstructs missing modalities using both task-agnostic and task-specific representations, and a modality-aware replay mechanism that prioritizes informative samples based on modality distortion and distribution drift. Experiments on three representative multi-modal AQA datasets (RG, Fis-V, and FS1000) show that BriMA consistently improves performance under different modality-missing conditions, achieving 6--8\% higher correlation and 12--15\% lower error on average.

### [91] [EMAD: Evidence-Centric Grounded Multimodal Diagnosis for Alzheimer's Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19178)
*Qiuhui Chen,Xuancheng Yao,Zhenglei Zhou,Xinyue Hu,Yi Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EMAD is a vision-language framework for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis that generates structured reports with explicit multimodal evidence grounding, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of transparency and clinical alignment in deep learning models for medical image analysis, particularly in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

Method: EMAD uses a hierarchical Sentence-Evidence-Anatomy (SEA) grounding mechanism and GTX-Distill for annotation efficiency, combined with Executable-Rule GRPO for clinical consistency.

Result: EMAD achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and produces anatomically faithful, transparent reports on the AD-MultiSense dataset.

Conclusion: EMAD advances trustworthy medical vision-language models by integrating explicit evidence grounding and clinical consistency, with plans to release code and annotations for further research.

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image analysis often act as black boxes, seldom aligning with clinical guidelines or explicitly linking decisions to supporting evidence. This is especially critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where predictions should be grounded in both anatomical and clinical findings. We present EMAD, a vision-language framework that generates structured AD diagnostic reports in which each claim is explicitly grounded in multimodal evidence. EMAD uses a hierarchical Sentence-Evidence-Anatomy (SEA) grounding mechanism: (i) sentence-to-evidence grounding links generated sentences to clinical evidence phrases, and (ii) evidence-to-anatomy grounding localizes corresponding structures on 3D brain MRI. To reduce dense annotation requirements, we propose GTX-Distill, which transfers grounding behavior from a teacher trained with limited supervision to a student operating on model-generated reports. We further introduce Executable-Rule GRPO, a reinforcement fine-tuning scheme with verifiable rewards that enforces clinical consistency, protocol adherence, and reasoning-diagnosis coherence. On the AD-MultiSense dataset, EMAD achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and produces more transparent, anatomically faithful reports than existing methods. We will release code and grounding annotations to support future research in trustworthy medical vision-language models.

### [92] [VLM-Guided Group Preference Alignment for Diffusion-based Human Mesh Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19180)
*Wenhao Shen,Hao Wang,Wanqi Yin,Fayao Liu,Xulei Yang,Chao Liang,Zhongang Cai,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method improves human mesh recovery (HMR) from RGB images by using dual-memory augmented critique agents and group preference alignment to generate more accurate and plausible 3D poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ambiguity in HMR from single RGB images and the trade-off between diversity and accuracy in diffusion-based methods motivate this work.

Method: Introduces a dual-memory augmented HMR critique agent for quality scores and a group preference alignment framework to fine-tune diffusion-based HMR models.

Result: The method produces more physically plausible and image-consistent human meshes, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses ambiguity and improves HMR accuracy by leveraging context-aware quality scores and preference alignment.

Abstract: Human mesh recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image is inherently ambiguous, as multiple 3D poses can correspond to the same 2D observation. Recent diffusion-based methods tackle this by generating various hypotheses, but often sacrifice accuracy. They yield predictions that are either physically implausible or drift from the input image, especially under occlusion or in cluttered, in-the-wild scenes. To address this, we introduce a dual-memory augmented HMR critique agent with self-reflection to produce context-aware quality scores for predicted meshes. These scores distill fine-grained cues about 3D human motion structure, physical feasibility, and alignment with the input image. We use these scores to build a group-wise HMR preference dataset. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a group preference alignment framework for finetuning diffusion-based HMR models. This process injects the rich preference signals into the model, guiding it to generate more physically plausible and image-consistent human meshes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

*Chen Duan,Zhentao Guo,Pei Fu,Zining Wang,Kai Zhou,Pengfei Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PositionOCR integrates text spotting efficiency with LLM contextual power for accurate multi-modal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs lack positional reasoning, while specialists lack semantic reasoning. PositionOCR aims to combine both strengths.

Method: Introduces PositionOCR, a hybrid architecture merging text spotting positional accuracy with LLM contextual reasoning, using 131M parameters.

Result: Excels in text grounding and spotting, outperforming traditional MLLMs.

Conclusion: PositionOCR successfully synergizes specialist efficiency with LLM power for superior multi-modal processing.

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance in OCR-centric Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, illustrating their capability to process heterogeneous data and exhibit adaptability across varied contexts. However, these MLLMs rely on a Large Language Model (LLM) as the decoder, which is primarily designed for linguistic processing, and thus inherently lacks the positional reasoning required for precise visual tasks, such as text spotting and text grounding. Additionally, the extensive parameters of MLLMs necessitate substantial computational resources and large-scale data for effective training. Conversely, text spotting specialists achieve state-of-the-art coordinate predictions but lack semantic reasoning capabilities. This dichotomy motivates our key research question: Can we synergize the efficiency of specialists with the contextual power of LLMs to create a positionally-accurate MLLM? To overcome these challenges, we introduce PositionOCR, a parameter-efficient hybrid architecture that seamlessly integrates a text spotting model's positional strengths with an LLM's contextual reasoning. Comprising 131M trainable parameters, this framework demonstrates outstanding multi-modal processing capabilities, particularly excelling in tasks such as text grounding and text spotting, consistently surpassing traditional MLLMs.

*Xiaokun Zhang,Yi Yang,Ziqi Ye,Baiyun,Xiaorong Guo,Qingchen Fang,Ruyi Zhang,Xinpeng Zhou,Haipeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FUSAR-GPT, a Visual Language Model (VLM) tailored for SAR imagery, addressing limitations of existing VLMs by leveraging a geospatial baseline model and spatiotemporal features for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with SAR imagery due to its complexity, scattering sensitivity, and lack of quality text data, prompting the need for a specialized solution.

Method: Constructed SAR Image-Text-AlphaEarth dataset; developed FUSAR-GPT with geospatial prior and spatiotemporal feature embedding; employed two-stage SFT strategy.

Result: FUSAR-GPT outperforms mainstream baseline models by over 12% in remote sensing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses SAR challenges, setting new performance standards in the field.

Abstract: Research on the intelligent interpretation of all-weather, all-time Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is crucial for advancing remote sensing applications. In recent years, although Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong open-world understanding capabilities on RGB images, their performance is severely limited when directly applied to the SAR field due to the complexity of the imaging mechanism, sensitivity to scattering features, and the scarcity of high-quality text corpora. To systematically address this issue, we constructed the inaugural SAR Image-Text-AlphaEarth feature triplet dataset and developed FUSAR-GPT, a VLM specifically for SAR. FUSAR-GPT innovatively introduces a geospatial baseline model as a 'world knowledge' prior and embeds multi-source remote-sensing temporal features into the model's visual backbone via 'spatiotemporal anchors', enabling dynamic compensation for the sparse representation of targets in SAR images. Furthermore, we designed a two-stage SFT strategy to decouple the knowledge injection and task execution of large models. The spatiotemporal feature embedding and the two-stage decoupling paradigm enable FUSAR-GPT to achieve state-of-the-art performance across several typical remote sensing visual-language benchmark tests, significantly outperforming mainstream baseline models by over 12%.

*Xi Yang,Yuanrong Xu,Weigang Zhang,Guangming Lu,David Zhang,Jie Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt tuning adapts pretrained models efficiently but risks feature drift under limited data. ManiPT confines tuning to the pretrained manifold, improving generalization across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent prompt tuning from driving features away from pretrained representations under limited supervision, degrading generalization.

Method: ManiPT uses cosine consistency constraints in text/image modalities and structural bias for incremental corrections to stay within the pretrained manifold.

Result: ManiPT outperforms baselines in unseen-class generalization, few-shot classification, cross-dataset transfer, and domain generalization.

Conclusion: ManiPT effectively mitigates overfitting in prompt tuning under limited supervision and improves transfer performance.

Abstract: Prompt tuning introduces learnable prompt vectors that adapt pretrained vision-language models to downstream tasks in a parameter-efficient manner. However, under limited supervision, prompt tuning alters pretrained representations and drives downstream features away from the pretrained manifold toward directions that are unfavorable for transfer. This drift degrades generalization. To address this limitation, we propose ManiPT, a framework that performs prompt tuning on the pretrained manifold. ManiPT introduces cosine consistency constraints in both the text and image modalities to confine the learned representations within the pretrained geometric neighborhood. Furthermore, we introduce a structural bias that enforces incremental corrections, guiding the adaptation along transferable directions to mitigate reliance on shortcut learning. From a theoretical perspective, ManiPT alleviates overfitting tendencies under limited data. Our experiments cover four downstream settings: unseen-class generalization, few-shot classification, cross-dataset transfer, and domain generalization. Across these settings, ManiPT achieves higher average performance than baseline methods. Notably, ManiPT provides an explicit perspective on how prompt tuning overfits under limited supervision.

*Gang Xu,Zhiyu Zhu,Junhui Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a pre-trained video diffusion model to reconstruct high-fidelity video frames from sparse event camera data, enhancing accuracy with event-based inter-frame residual guidance and extending the method to interpolation and prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras lose spatial and static texture details due to recording only relative intensity changes, limiting their utility. The paper aims to overcome this by leveraging generative models.

Method: The approach involves conditioning a video diffusion model with event data, introducing event-based inter-frame residual guidance for accuracy, and extending it to interpolation and prediction via modulated reverse diffusion sampling.

Result: The method outperforms previous approaches quantitatively and qualitatively on real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively reconstructs high-fidelity video frames from event data, offering a unified solution for event-to-frame tasks.

Abstract: Event cameras excel at high-speed, low-power, and high-dynamic-range scene perception. However, as they fundamentally record only relative intensity changes rather than absolute intensity, the resulting data streams suffer from a significant loss of spatial information and static texture details. In this paper, we address this limitation by leveraging the generative prior of a pre-trained video diffusion model to reconstruct high-fidelity video frames from sparse event data. Specifically, we first establish a baseline model by directly applying event data as a condition to synthesize videos. Then, based on the physical correlation between the event stream and video frames, we further introduce the event-based inter-frame residual guidance to enhance the accuracy of video frame reconstruction. Furthermore, we extend our method to video frame interpolation and prediction in a zero-shot manner by modulating the reverse diffusion sampling process, thereby creating a unified event-to-frame reconstruction framework. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also refer the reviewers to the video demo contained in the supplementary material for video results. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/CS-GangXu/UniE2F.

*Zehao Deng,An Liu,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS-CLIP is a zero-shot 3D anomaly detection framework that uses geometry-aware prompts and synergistic view representation learning to improve detection performance by addressing limitations of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lose geometric details and rely on incomplete visual understanding due to single 2D modality projections. Addressing these limitations improves anomaly detection in scenarios with scarce or private data.

Method: GS-CLIP uses a two-stage process: (1) dynamically generating text prompts with 3D geometric priors via GDDM, and (2) synergistic representation learning from rendered and depth images fused by SRM.

Result: GS-CLIP outperforms existing methods on four large-scale datasets, demonstrating superior detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed GS-CLIP framework effectively addresses geometric detail loss and incomplete visual understanding, enhancing zero-shot 3D anomaly detection capabilities.

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D Anomaly Detection is an emerging task that aims to detect anomalies in a target dataset without any target training data, which is particularly important in scenarios constrained by sample scarcity and data privacy concerns. While current methods adapt CLIP by projecting 3D point clouds into 2D representations, they face challenges. The projection inherently loses some geometric details, and the reliance on a single 2D modality provides an incomplete visual understanding, limiting their ability to detect diverse anomaly types. To address these limitations, we propose the Geometry-Aware Prompt and Synergistic View Representation Learning (GS-CLIP) framework, which enables the model to identify geometric anomalies through a two-stage learning process. In stage 1, we dynamically generate text prompts embedded with 3D geometric priors. These prompts contain global shape context and local defect information distilled by our Geometric Defect Distillation Module (GDDM). In stage 2, we introduce Synergistic View Representation Learning architecture that processes rendered and depth images in parallel. A Synergistic Refinement Module (SRM) subsequently fuses the features of both streams, capitalizing on their complementary strengths. Comprehensive experimental results on four large-scale public datasets show that GS-CLIP achieves superior performance in detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegMoTE is an efficient framework adapting SAM for medical image segmentation, addressing modality-specific challenges and reducing annotation dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation struggles with modality heterogeneity and high annotation costs, limiting the generalization of existing models like SAM.

Method: SegMoTE introduces learnable parameters for dynamic adaptation and a progressive prompt tokenization mechanism for automatic segmentation.

Result: Trained on MedSeg-HQ (~1% of large datasets), SegMoTE achieves SOTA performance across diverse modalities and tasks.

Conclusion: SegMoTe provides robust, scalable medical segmentation with low annotation cost, advancing clinical deployment of foundation models.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis and quantitative analysis, yet remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of imaging modalities and the high cost of pixel-level annotations. Although general interactive segmentation models like SAM have achieved remarkable progress, their transfer to medical imaging still faces two key bottlenecks: (i) the lack of adaptive mechanisms for modality- and anatomy-specific tasks, which limits generalization in out-of-distribution medical scenarios; and (ii) current medical adaptation methods fine-tune on large, heterogeneous datasets without selection, leading to noisy supervision, higher cost, and negative transfer. To address these issues, we propose SegMoTE, an efficient and adaptive framework for medical image segmentation. SegMoTE preserves SAM's original prompt interface, efficient inference, and zero-shot generalization while introducing only a small number of learnable parameters to dynamically adapt across modalities and tasks. In addition, we design a progressive prompt tokenization mechanism that enables fully automatic segmentation, significantly reducing annotation dependence. Trained on MedSeg-HQ, a curated dataset less than 1% of existing large-scale datasets, SegMoTE achieves SOTA performance across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical tasks. It represents the first efficient, robust, and scalable adaptation of general segmentation models to the medical domain under extremely low annotation cost, advancing the practical deployment of foundation vision models in clinical applications.

*Siran Li,Li Mi,Javiera Castillo-Navarro,Devis Tuia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces KRSVQG, a model that generates richer questions for remote sensing images by integrating external knowledge and image captions. It outperforms existing methods and advances vision-language systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current question generation for remote sensing images is simplistic and template-based, limiting real-world applications. The paper aims to diversify questions using image content and commonsense knowledge.

Method: KRSVQG combines external knowledge triplets with image captions, employs vision-language pre-training and fine-tuning, and is evaluated on two new datasets (NWPU-300 and TextRS-300).

Result: KRSVQG outperforms existing methods, producing richer questions grounded in both image and domain knowledge, as confirmed by metrics and human assessment.

Conclusion: KRSVQG enhances vision-language systems by integrating knowledge and vision, enabling deeper image understanding and practical applications.

Abstract: With the rapid development of remote sensing image archives, asking questions about images has become an effective way of gathering specific information or performing semantic image retrieval. However, current automatically generated questions tend to be simplistic and template-based, which hinders the deployment of question answering or visual dialogue systems for real-world applications. To enrich and diversify the questions with both image content and commonsense knowledge, we propose a Knowledge-aware Remote Sensing Visual Question Generation model (KRSVQG). The proposed model incorporates related knowledge triplets from external knowledge sources to broaden the question content, while employing image captioning as an intermediary representation to ground questions to the corresponding images. Moreover, KRSVQG utilizes a vision-language pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, enabling the model's adaptation to low data regimes. To evaluate the proposed KRSVQG model, we construct two knowledge-aware remote sensing visual question generation datasets: the NWPU-300 dataset and the TextRS-300 dataset. Evaluations, including metrics and human assessment, demonstrate that KRSVQG outperforms existing methods and leads to rich questions, grounded in both image and domain knowledge. As a key practice in vision-language research, knowledge-aware visual question generation advances the understanding of image content beyond pixels, facilitating the development of knowledge-enriched vision-language systems with vision-grounded human commonsense.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for facial expression editing using a pre-trained face generator to address label scarcity and class imbalance in AU analysis. It reduces attribute entanglement and improves AU detector training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label scarcity and class imbalance challenge deep learning models. Facial expression editing can augment data, but current methods introduce artifacts and entanglement.

Method: Uses Diffusion Autoencoder's semantic latent space with lightweight linear models for dependency-aware conditioning and orthogonal projection to reduce entanglement.

Result: Generated data improves AU detector accuracy and disentanglement, outperforming other data-efficient strategies.

Conclusion: The method produces stronger, artifact-free edits, preserves identity, and enhances AU analysis performance without needing large labeled datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning vision models excel with abundant supervision, but many applications face label scarcity and class imbalance. Controllable image editing can augment scarce labeled data, yet edits often introduce artifacts and entangle non-target attributes. We study this in facial expression analysis, targeting Action Unit (AU) manipulation where annotation is costly and AU co-activation drives entanglement. We present a facial manipulation method that operates in the semantic latent space of a pre-trained face generator (Diffusion Autoencoder). Using lightweight linear models, we reduce entanglement of semantic features via (i) dependency-aware conditioning that accounts for AU co-activation, and (ii) orthogonal projection that removes nuisance attribute directions (e.g., glasses), together with an expression neutralization step to enable absolute AU edit. We use these edits to balance AU occurrence by editing labeled faces and to diversify identities/demographics via controlled synthesis. Augmenting AU detector training with the generated data improves accuracy and yields more disentangled predictions with fewer co-activation shortcuts, outperforming alternative data-efficient training strategies and suggesting improvements similar to what would require substantially more labeled data in our learning-curve analysis. Compared to prior methods, our edits are stronger, produce fewer artifacts, and preserve identity better.

Conclusion: KRSVQG effectively improves question quality and diversity in remote sensing by integrating external knowledge and image captioning.

Abstract: With the rapid development of remote sensing image archives, asking questions about images has become an effective way of gathering specific information or performing image retrieval. However, automatically generated image-based questions tend to be simplistic and template-based, which hinders the real deployment of question answering or visual dialogue systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video anomaly detection methods struggle in open-world scenarios due to limited dataset diversity and poor context-dependent anomaly understanding.

Method: LAVIDA introduces an Anomaly Exposure Sampler for pseudo-anomaly creation, integrates a Multimodal Large Language Model for semantic comprehension, and uses token compression for efficiency.

Result: LAVIDA achieves SOTA performance in frame-level and pixel-level anomaly detection on four benchmark datasets without needing actual VAD data for training.

Conclusion: LAVIDA effectively addresses the challenges of video anomaly detection by leveraging pseudo-anomalies and semantic understanding, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The collection and detection of video anomaly data has long been a challenging problem due to its rare occurrence and spatio-temporal scarcity. Existing video anomaly detection (VAD) methods under perform in open-world scenarios. Key contributing factors include limited dataset diversity, and inadequate understanding of context-dependent anomalous semantics. To address these issues, i) we propose LAVIDA, an end-to-end zero-shot video anomaly detection framework. ii) LAVIDA employs an Anomaly Exposure Sampler that transforms segmented objects into pseudo-anomalies to enhance model adaptability to unseen anomaly categories. It further integrates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to bolster semantic comprehension capabilities. Additionally, iii) we design a token compression approach based on reverse attention to handle the spatio-temporal scarcity of anomalous patterns and decrease computational cost. The training process is conducted solely on pseudo anomalies without any VAD data. Evaluations across four benchmark VAD datasets demonstrate that LAVIDA achieves SOTA performance in both frame-level and pixel-level anomaly detection under the zero-shot setting.

*Bowen Chen,Jake Zuena,Alan C. Bovik,Divya Kothandaraman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an attention-supervised diffusion framework for localized style transfer, addressing limitations in existing methods by aligning style tokens with object masks using Focus and Cover losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models lack precise spatial control in style transfer, relying on masks or post-processing, which introduces artifacts. The paper seeks to enable mask-free, localized style transfer.

Method: Proposes an attention-supervised diffusion framework with Focus (KL divergence) and Cover (binary cross-entropy) losses for accurate style localization. Uses LoRA-MoE for multi-style adaptation and introduces Regional Style Editing Score for evaluation.

Result: The method achieves mask-free, single-object style transfer with regionally accurate and visually coherent results, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables precise spatial control in diffusion-based style transfer without masks, offering scalable and efficient multi-style adaptation.

Abstract: Precise spatial control in diffusion-based style transfer remains challenging. This challenge arises because diffusion models treat style as a global feature and lack explicit spatial grounding of style representations, making it difficult to restrict style application to specific objects or regions. To our knowledge, existing diffusion models are unable to perform true localized style transfer, typically relying on handcrafted masks or multi-stage post-processing that introduce boundary artifacts and limit generalization. To address this, we propose an attention-supervised diffusion framework that explicitly teaches the model where to apply a given style by aligning the attention scores of style tokens with object masks during training. Two complementary objectives, a Focus loss based on KL divergence and a Cover loss using binary cross-entropy, jointly encourage accurate localization and dense coverage. A modular LoRA-MoE design further enables efficient and scalable multi-style adaptation. To evaluate localized stylization, we introduce the Regional Style Editing Score, which measures Regional Style Matching through CLIP-based similarity within the target region and Identity Preservation via masked LPIPS and pixel-level consistency on unedited areas. Experiments show that our method achieves mask-free, single-object style transfer at inference, producing regionally accurate and visually coherent results that outperform existing diffusion-based editing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DD-CAM, a gradient-free method for identifying minimal and sufficient explanations in vision models by isolating the smallest subset of representational units that preserve predictions, improving clarity and accuracy over existing CAM-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for explaining vision models often aggregate all units, resulting in cluttered saliency maps. The authors aim to provide clearer, minimal explanations by focusing on the smallest subset of units that suffice to preserve predictions.

Method: DD-CAM adapts delta debugging, a systematic reduction strategy from software debugging, to isolate minimal sufficient subsets of units. The search strategy is configured based on unit interactions in the classifier head.

Result: DD-CAM generates minimal, prediction-preserving saliency maps, outperforming state-of-the-art CAM-based approaches in both faithfulness and localization accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed DD-CAM framework offers a more efficient and accurate way to explain vision models by highlighting only the most essential features, advancing the field of interpretability.

Abstract: We introduce a gradient-free framework for identifying minimal, sufficient, and decision-preserving explanations in vision models by isolating the smallest subset of representational units whose joint activation preserves predictions. Unlike existing approaches that aggregate all units, often leading to cluttered saliency maps, our approach, DD-CAM, identifies a 1-minimal subset whose joint activation suffices to preserve the prediction (i.e., removing any unit from the subset alters the prediction). To efficiently isolate minimal sufficient subsets, we adapt delta debugging, a systematic reduction strategy from software debugging, and configure its search strategy based on unit interactions in the classifier head: testing individual units for models with non-interacting units and testing unit combinations for models in which unit interactions exist. We then generate minimal, prediction-preserving saliency maps that highlight only the most essential features. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach can produce more faithful explanations and achieve higher localization accuracy than the state-of-the-art CAM-based approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage detection-tracking framework using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack is proposed for stable multi-apple quality inspection on conveyor belts, with ResNet18 for defect classification. Track-level aggregation improves temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fruit inspection systems lack temporal stability in video streams, which is crucial for industrial applications.

Method: Combines YOLOv8 for apple localization, ByteTrack for multi-object tracking, and ResNet18 for defect classification, with track-level aggregation for consistency.

Result: Improved stability over frame-wise inference, demonstrating the importance of tracking for automated fruit grading.

Conclusion: Integrating tracking is essential for practical and stable automated fruit inspection systems.

Abstract: Industrial fruit inspection systems must operate reliably under dense multi-object interactions and continuous motion, yet most existing works evaluate detection or classification at the image level without ensuring temporal stability in video streams. We present a two-stage detection-tracking framework for stable multi-apple quality inspection in conveyor-belt environments. An orchard-trained YOLOv8 model performs apple localization, followed by ByteTrack multi-object tracking to maintain persistent identities. A ResNet18 defect classifier, fine-tuned on a healthy-defective fruit dataset, is applied to cropped apple regions. Track-level aggregation is introduced to enforce temporal consistency and reduce prediction oscillation across frames. We define video-level industrial metrics such as track-level defect ratio and temporal consistency to evaluate system robustness under realistic processing conditions. Results demonstrate improved stability compared to frame-wise inference, suggesting that integrating tracking is essential for practical automated fruit grading systems.

TL;DR: MRI CEKWorld with STCL addresses overfitting and temporal discontinuities in MRI contrast enhancement modeling by using LAL and LDL techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical MRI contrast acquisition lacks efficiency due to sparse data and risks/costs, needing better modeling of enhancement kinetics.

Method: Proposes MRI CEKWorld with STCL: LAL ensures structural consistency, LDL ensures temporal smoothness via interpolation.

Result: Experiments show improved realism in content and kinetics on two datasets.

Conclusion: MRI CEKWorld successfully addresses key limitations in modeling MRI contrast enhancement kinetics.

Abstract: Clinical MRI contrast acquisition suffers from inefficient information yield, which presents as a mismatch between the risky and costly acquisition protocol and the fixed and sparse acquisition sequence. Applying world models to simulate the contrast enhancement kinetics in the human body enables continuous contrast-free dynamics. However, the low temporal resolution in MRI acquisition restricts the training of world models, leading to a sparsely sampled dataset. Directly training a generative model to capture the kinetics leads to two limitations: (a) Due to the absence of data on missing time, the model tends to overfit to irrelevant features, leading to content distortion. (b) Due to the lack of continuous temporal supervision, the model fails to learn the continuous kinetics law over time, causing temporal discontinuities. For the first time, we propose MRI Contrast Enhancement Kinetics World model (MRI CEKWorld) with SpatioTemporal Consistency Learning (STCL). For (a), guided by the spatial law that patient-level structures remain consistent during enhancement, we propose Latent Alignment Learning (LAL) that constructs a patient-specific template to constrain contents to align with this template. For (b), guided by the temporal law that the kinetics follow a consistent smooth trend, we propose Latent Difference Learning (LDL) which extends the unobserved intervals by interpolation and constrains smooth variations in the latent space among interpolated sequences. Extensive experiments on two datasets show our MRI CEKWorld achieves better realistic contents and kinetics. Codes will be available at https://github.com/DD0922/MRI-Contrast-Enhancement-Kinetics-World-Model.

### [107] [IPv2: An Improved Image Purification Strategy for Real-World Ultra-Low-Dose Lung CT Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19314)
*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IPv2, an improved image purification strategy for denoising ultra-low-dose CT images, addressing limitations in background and lung parenchyma denoising through three core modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Original image purification strategies inadequately address noise in background and lung parenchyma regions, prompting the redesign into IPv2.

Method: IPv2 integrates three modules: Remove Background, Add noise, and Remove noise, enhancing denoising capability and evaluation protocol refinement.

Result: Experiments on a real-world lung CT dataset show IPv2 improves background suppression and lung parenchyma restoration across denoising models.

Conclusion: IPv2 effectively addresses prior limitations and enhances denoising performance in ultra-low-dose CT images.

Abstract: The image purification strategy constructs an intermediate distribution with aligned anatomical structures, which effectively corrects the spatial misalignment between real-world ultra-low-dose CT and normal-dose CT images and significantly enhances the structural preservation ability of denoising models. However, this strategy exhibits two inherent limitations. First, it suppresses noise only in the chest wall and bone regions while leaving the image background untreated. Second, it lacks a dedicated mechanism for denoising the lung parenchyma. To address these issues, we systematically redesign the original image purification strategy and propose an improved version termed IPv2. The proposed strategy introduces three core modules, namely Remove Background, Add noise, and Remove noise. These modules endow the model with denoising capability in both background and lung tissue regions during training data construction and provide a more reasonable evaluation protocol through refined label construction at the testing stage. Extensive experiments on our previously established real-world patient lung CT dataset acquired at 2% radiation dose demonstrate that IPv2 consistently improves background suppression and lung parenchyma restoration across multiple mainstream denoising models. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/Image-Purification-Strategy-v2.

*Alexandros Haliassos,Rodrigo Mira,Stavros Petridis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USR 2.0 improves upon Unified Speech Recognition by introducing CTC-driven teacher forcing and mixed sampling to reduce training time and enhance robustness, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original USR framework faced challenges like expensive training and susceptibility to errors due to autoregressive pseudo-labelling and decoupled supervision under distribution shifts.

Method: Proposes CTC-driven teacher forcing for efficient knowledge transfer and mixed sampling to mitigate decoder exposure bias.

Result: Halves training time, improves robustness, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks (LRS3, LRS2, WildVSR).

Conclusion: USR 2.0 effectively addresses the limitations of USR, offering a more efficient and robust solution for unified speech recognition.

Abstract: Unified Speech Recognition (USR) has emerged as a semi-supervised framework for training a single model for audio, visual, and audiovisual speech recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results on in-distribution benchmarks. However, its reliance on autoregressive pseudo-labelling makes training expensive, while its decoupled supervision of CTC and attention branches increases susceptibility to self-reinforcing errors, particularly under distribution shifts involving longer sequences, noise, or unseen domains. We propose CTC-driven teacher forcing, where greedily decoded CTC pseudo-labels are fed into the decoder to generate attention targets in a single forward pass. Although these can be globally incoherent, in the pseudo-labelling setting they enable efficient and effective knowledge transfer. Because CTC and CTC-driven attention pseudo-labels have the same length, the decoder can predict both simultaneously, benefiting from the robustness of CTC and the expressiveness of attention without costly beam search. We further propose mixed sampling to mitigate the exposure bias of the decoder relying solely on CTC inputs. The resulting method, USR 2.0, halves training time, improves robustness to out-of-distribution inputs, and achieves state-of-the-art results on LRS3, LRS2, and WildVSR, surpassing USR and modality-specific self-supervised baselines.

*Ashwath Radhachandran,Vedrana Ivezić,Shreeram Athreya,Ronit Anilkumar,Corey W. Arnold,William Speier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: US-JEPA introduces a self-supervised framework for ultrasound imaging, overcoming noise challenges with masked latent prediction and a frozen teacher, achieving competitive results on benchmark tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound imaging's low signal-to-noise ratio and speckle noise hinder standard self-supervised learning, requiring a robust alternative like masked latent prediction.

Method: US-JEPA employs Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training (SALT) with a frozen teacher to provide stable latent targets, decoupling student-teacher optimization.

Result: US-JEPA outperforms or matches domain-specific and universal vision foundation models in classification tasks on UltraBench.

Conclusion: Masked latent prediction is effective for robust ultrasound representation learning, as demonstrated by US-JEPA's performance.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging poses unique challenges for representation learning due to its inherently noisy acquisition process. The low signal-to-noise ratio and stochastic speckle patterns hinder standard self-supervised learning methods relying on a pixel-level reconstruction objective. Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) address this drawback by predicting masked latent representations rather than raw pixels. However, standard approaches depend on hyperparameter-brittle and computationally expensive online teachers updated via exponential moving average. We propose US-JEPA, a self-supervised framework that adopts the Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training (SALT) objective. By using a frozen, domain-specific teacher to provide stable latent targets, US-JEPA decouples student-teacher optimization and pushes the student to expand upon the semantic priors of the teacher. In addition, we provide the first rigorous comparison of all publicly available state-of-the-art ultrasound foundation models on UltraBench, a public dataset benchmark spanning multiple organs and pathological conditions. Under linear probing for diverse classification tasks, US-JEPA achieves performance competitive with or superior to domain-specific and universal vision foundation model baselines. Our results demonstrate that masked latent prediction provides a stable and efficient path toward robust ultrasound representations.

*Yiran Qiao,Yiren Lu,Yunlai Zhou,Rui Yang,Linlin Hou,Yu Yin,Jing Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes vulnerabilities in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to adversarial corruptions and proposes a frequency-aware defense strategy to mitigate these issues while maintaining performance on clean inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies highlight 3DGS's susceptibility to adversarial corruptions, which degrade rendering quality and inflate resource usage. The authors aim to address these vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors analyze adversarial perturbations using wavelet transforms, distinguishing low- and high-frequency components. They design a frequency-aware defense that filters high-frequency noise while preserving low-frequency content.

Result: The proposed method effectively suppresses adversarial artifacts without significantly harming clean data performance. Extensive experiments show improved robustness across various attack intensities.

Conclusion: The work enhances 3DGS robustness against adversarial attacks, balancing security and performance, and encourages more secure 3D reconstruction methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for real-time and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from posed images. However, recent studies reveal its vulnerability to adversarial corruptions in input views, where imperceptible yet consistent perturbations can drastically degrade rendering quality, increase training and rendering time, and inflate memory usage, even leading to server denial-of-service. In our work, to mitigate this issue, we begin by analyzing the distinct behaviors of adversarial perturbations in the low- and high-frequency components of input images using wavelet transforms. Based on this observation, we design a simple yet effective frequency-aware defense strategy that reconstructs training views by filtering high-frequency noise while preserving low-frequency content. This approach effectively suppresses adversarial artifacts while maintaining the authenticity of the original scene. Notably, it does not significantly impair training on clean data, achieving a desirable trade-off between robustness and performance on clean inputs. Through extensive experiments under a wide range of attack intensities on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the robustness of 3DGS without access to clean ground-truth supervision. By highlighting and addressing the overlooked vulnerabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting, our work paves the way for more robust and secure 3D reconstructions.

Abstract: Early and accurate classification of retinal diseases is critical to counter vision loss and for guiding clinical management of retinal diseases. In this study, we proposed a deep learning method for retinal disease classification utilizing optical coherence tomography (OCT) images from the Retinal OCT Image Classification - C8 dataset (comprising 24,000 labeled images spanning eight conditions). Images were resized to 224x224 px and tested on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: Xception and InceptionV3. Data augmentation techniques (CutMix, MixUp) were employed to enhance model generalization. Additionally, we applied GradCAM and LIME for interpretability evaluation. We implemented this in a real-world scenario via our web application named RetinaVision. This study found that Xception was the most accurate network (95.25%), followed closely by InceptionV3 (94.82%). These results suggest that deep learning methods allow effective OCT retinal disease classification and highlight the importance of implementing accuracy and interpretability for clinical applications.

TL;DR: MultiDiffSense is a unified diffusion model synthesizing images for multiple vision-based tactile sensors, addressing the costly and slow process of aligned visuo-tactile dataset acquisition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and slow pace of acquiring aligned visuo-tactile datasets necessitate synthetic solutions, but existing methods lack cross-modal capabilities.

Method: MultiDiffSense uses dual conditioning on CAD-derived depth maps and structured prompts for controllable, consistent multi-modal image synthesis.

Result: MultiDiffSense outperforms Pix2Pix cGAN significantly across sensors and reduces real data needs for pose estimation by half when mixed with synthetic data.

Conclusion: MultiDiffSense effectively addresses the tactile sensing data bottleneck, enabling scalable, multi-modal dataset generation for robotics.

Abstract: Acquiring aligned visuo-tactile datasets is slow and costly, requiring specialised hardware and large-scale data collection. Synthetic generation is promising, but prior methods are typically single-modality, limiting cross-modal learning. We present MultiDiffSense, a unified diffusion model that synthesises images for multiple vision-based tactile sensors (ViTac, TacTip, ViTacTip) within a single architecture. Our approach uses dual conditioning on CAD-derived, pose-aligned depth maps and structured prompts that encode sensor type and 4-DoF contact pose, enabling controllable, physically consistent multi-modal synthesis. Evaluating on 8 objects (5 seen, 3 novel) and unseen poses, MultiDiffSense outperforms a Pix2Pix cGAN baseline in SSIM by +36.3% (ViTac), +134.6% (ViTacTip), and +64.7% (TacTip). For downstream 3-DoF pose estimation, mixing 50% synthetic with 50% real halves the required real data while maintaining competitive performance. MultiDiffSense alleviates the data-collection bottleneck in tactile sensing and enables scalable, controllable multi-modal dataset generation for robotic applications.

*Rohit Mohan,Florian Drews,Yakov Miron,Daniele Cattaneo,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UP-Fuse is an uncertainty-aware LiDAR-camera fusion framework for robust 3D panoptic segmentation, addressing camera sensor degradation and failure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera sensor degradation or failure can compromise LiDAR-camera fusion reliability in adverse conditions.

Method: UP-Fuse projects LiDAR data and camera features into a shared range-view, uses uncertainty-guided fusion, and decodes with a hybrid 2D-3D transformer.

Result: UP-Fuse performs robustly on benchmarks like Panoptic nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, even under severe visual corruption.

Conclusion: UP-Fuse is effective for safety-critical robotic perception, maintaining performance despite sensor challenges.

Abstract: LiDAR-camera fusion enhances 3D panoptic segmentation by leveraging camera images to complement sparse LiDAR scans, but it also introduces a critical failure mode. Under adverse conditions, degradation or failure of the camera sensor can significantly compromise the reliability of the perception system. To address this problem, we introduce UP-Fuse, a novel uncertainty-aware fusion framework in the 2D range-view that remains robust under camera sensor degradation, calibration drift, and sensor failure. Raw LiDAR data is first projected into the range-view and encoded by a LiDAR encoder, while camera features are simultaneously extracted and projected into the same shared space. At its core, UP-Fuse employs an uncertainty-guided fusion module that dynamically modulates cross-modal interaction using predicted uncertainty maps. These maps are learned by quantifying representational divergence under diverse visual degradations, ensuring that only reliable visual cues influence the fused representation. The fused range-view features are decoded by a novel hybrid 2D-3D transformer that mitigates spatial ambiguities inherent to the 2D projection and directly predicts 3D panoptic segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on Panoptic nuScenes, SemanticKITTI, and our introduced Panoptic Waymo benchmark demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of UP-Fuse, which maintains strong performance even under severe visual corruption or misalignment, making it well suited for robotic perception in safety-critical settings.

TL;DR: PoseCraft is a diffusion framework using a tokenized 3D interface for photorealistic avatar synthesis, overcoming issues of ambiguous 2D re-projection and labor-intensive rigging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for digitizing humans and synthesizing avatars involve manual rigging or volumetric templates, which are labor-intensive or limited in handling unseen poses. PoseCraft aims to address these challenges by preserving 3D semantics and improving photorealism.

Method: PoseCraft uses a diffusion framework with tokenized 3D landmarks and camera extrinsics injected via cross-attention, avoiding reliance on rasterized 2D geometry. It also introduces GenHumanRF for scalable data generation from volumetric reconstructions.

Result: PoseCraft outperforms diffusion-centric methods in perceptual quality and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art volumetric rendering metrics while better preserving details like fabric and hair.

Conclusion: PoseCraft offers a scalable and effective solution for photorealistic avatar synthesis, leveraging 3D tokens to improve accuracy and detail preservation over existing methods.

Abstract: Digitizing humans and synthesizing photorealistic avatars with explicit 3D pose and camera controls are central to VR, telepresence, and entertainment. Existing skinning-based workflows require laborious manual rigging or template-based fittings, while neural volumetric methods rely on canonical templates and re-optimization for each unseen pose. We present PoseCraft, a diffusion framework built around tokenized 3D interface: instead of relying only on rasterized geometry as 2D control images, we encode sparse 3D landmarks and camera extrinsics as discrete conditioning tokens and inject them into diffusion via cross-attention. Our approach preserves 3D semantics by avoiding 2D re-projection ambiguity under large pose and viewpoint changes, and produces photorealistic imagery that faithfully captures identity and appearance. To train and evaluate at scale, we also implement GenHumanRF, a data generation workflow that renders diverse supervision from volumetric reconstructions. Our experiments show that PoseCraft achieves significant perceptual quality improvement over diffusion-centric methods, and attains better or comparable metrics to latest volumetric rendering SOTA while better preserving fabric and hair details.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper assesses spatial visualization in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using MentalBlackboard, highlighting struggles with symmetry and rotations, and varying performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if VLMs possess spatial visualization abilities akin to humans.

Method: Developed MentalBlackboard benchmark for Paper Folding and Hole Punching tests, focusing on prediction and planning tasks.

Result: Models struggled with symmetry and rotations; Claude Opus 4.1 scored 10% in planning, while o3 achieved 71.6% in generalization but only 25% in text-based prediction.

Conclusion: VLMs exhibit significant limitations in spatial visualization, especially with symmetrical transformations and multi-stage processes.

Abstract: Spatial visualization is the mental ability to imagine, transform, and manipulate the spatial characteristics of objects and actions. This intelligence is a part of human cognition where actions and perception are connected on a mental level. To explore whether state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit this ability, we develop MentalBlackboard, an open-ended spatial visualization benchmark for Paper Folding and Hole Punching tests within two core tasks: prediction and planning. Our prediction experiments reveal that models struggle with applying symmetrical transformations, even when they predict the sequence of unfolding steps correctly. Also, rotations introduce a significant challenge to the physical situational awareness for models. The planning task reveals limitations of models in analyzing symmetrical relationships and in implementing the multi-stage symmetry process, with Claude Opus 4.1 achieving the highest planning score at an accuracy of 10\%. The top-performing model, o3, attains a peak performance of 71.6\% on the generalization task, which does not require spatial visualization but transfers spatial data; however, it achieves only 25\% accuracy on text-based prediction tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Referring Layer Decomposition (RLD) task and RefLade dataset for isolating and manipulating individual scene elements in images using layered representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing approaches lack precise control over individual objects, limiting compositional understanding and controllable editing.

Method: Proposes RLD task and RefLade dataset (1.11M image-layer-prompt triplets) with manual curation. Introduces RefLayer, a baseline model for prompt-conditioned layer decomposition.

Result: Achieves high visual fidelity, semantic alignment, and zero-shot generalization, enabling effective training and reliable evaluation.

Conclusion: RLD and RefLade provide a structured framework for advanced image editing, bridging the gap in object-aware control.

Abstract: Precise, object-aware control over visual content is essential for advanced image editing and compositional generation. Yet, most existing approaches operate on entire images holistically, limiting the ability to isolate and manipulate individual scene elements. In contrast, layered representations, where scenes are explicitly separated into objects, environmental context, and visual effects, provide a more intuitive and structured framework for interpreting and editing visual content. To bridge this gap and enable both compositional understanding and controllable editing, we introduce the Referring Layer Decomposition (RLD) task, which predicts complete RGBA layers from a single RGB image, conditioned on flexible user prompts, such as spatial inputs (e.g., points, boxes, masks), natural language descriptions, or combinations thereof. At the core is the RefLade, a large-scale dataset comprising 1.11M image-layer-prompt triplets produced by our scalable data engine, along with 100K manually curated, high-fidelity layers. Coupled with a perceptually grounded, human-preference-aligned automatic evaluation protocol, RefLade establishes RLD as a well-defined and benchmarkable research task. Building on this foundation, we present RefLayer, a simple baseline designed for prompt-conditioned layer decomposition, achieving high visual fidelity and semantic alignment. Extensive experiments show our approach enables effective training, reliable evaluation, and high-quality image decomposition, while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the temporal instability in glottic opening localization caused by the weaknesses of single-frame detectors and foundation-model trackers.

Method: Closed-Loop Memory Correction (CL-MC) integrates high-confidence detections to reset and correct tracker memory dynamically.

Result: CL-MC outperforms SAM2 variants and open-loop methods, reducing drift and missing rates in emergency intubation videos.

Conclusion: Memory correction is essential for reliable clinical video tracking, validated by CL-MC's state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Temporal stability in glottic opening localization remains challenging due to the complementary weaknesses of single-frame detectors and foundation-model trackers: the former lacks temporal context, while the latter suffers from memory drift. Specifically, in video laryngoscopy, rapid tissue deformation, occlusions, and visual ambiguities in emergency settings require a robust, temporally aware solution that can prevent progressive tracking errors. We propose Closed-Loop Memory Correction (CL-MC), a detector-in-the-loop framework that supervises Segment Anything Model 2(SAM2) through confidence-aligned state decisions and active memory rectification. High-confidence detections trigger semantic resets that overwrite corrupted tracker memory, effectively mitigating drift accumulation with a training-free foundation tracker in complex endoscopic scenes. On emergency intubation videos, CL-MC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing drift and missing rate compared with the SAM2 variants and open loop based methods. Our results establish memory correction as a crucial component for reliable clinical video tracking. Our code will be available in https://github.com/huayuww/CL-MR.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: U-Net architectures have been instrumental in advancing biomedical image segmentation (BIS) but often struggle with capturing long-range information. One reason is the conventional down-sampling techniques that prioritize computational efficiency at the expense of information retention. This paper introduces a simple but effective strategy, we call it Stair Pooling, which moderates the pace of down-sampling and reduces information loss by leveraging a sequence of concatenated small and narrow pooling operations in varied orientations. Specifically, our method modifies the reduction in dimensionality within each 2D pooling step from $\frac{1}{4}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$. This approach can also be adapted for 3D pooling to preserve even more information. Such preservation aids the U-Net in more effectively reconstructing spatial details during the up-sampling phase, thereby enhancing its ability to capture long-range information and improving segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on three BIS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Stair Pooling can increase both 2D and 3D U-Net performance by an average of 3.8\% in Dice scores. Moreover, we leverage the transfer entropy to select the optimal down-sampling paths and quantitatively show how the proposed Stair Pooling reduces the information loss.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PA-Attack is a gray-box adversarial attack method for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) that uses prototype-anchored guidance and a two-stage attention mechanism to achieve strong attack effectiveness, efficiency, and task generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing white-box attacks lack generalization and black-box methods are inefficient. The vision encoder's stability provides a gray-box opportunity.

Method: PA-Attack employs prototype-anchored guidance for stable attack direction and a two-stage attention mechanism (token-level focus and adaptive recalibration) to enhance attack effectiveness.

Result: PA-Attack achieves a 75.1% average score reduction rate (SRR) in experiments across diverse LVLMs and tasks, demonstrating high effectiveness and generalization.

Conclusion: PA-Attack addresses limitations of prior adversarial attacks on LVLMs, offering a robust and efficient solution with strong cross-task performance.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are foundational to modern multimodal applications, yet their susceptibility to adversarial attacks remains a critical concern. Prior white-box attacks rarely generalize across tasks, and black-box methods depend on expensive transfer, which limits efficiency. The vision encoder, standardized and often shared across LVLMs, provides a stable gray-box pivot with strong cross-model transfer. Building on this premise, we introduce PA-Attack (Prototype-Anchored Attentive Attack). PA-Attack begins with a prototype-anchored guidance that provides a stable attack direction towards a general and dissimilar prototype, tackling the attribute-restricted issue and limited task generalization of vanilla attacks. Building on this, we propose a two-stage attention enhancement mechanism: (i) leverage token-level attention scores to concentrate perturbations on critical visual tokens, and (ii) adaptively recalibrate attention weights to track the evolving attention during the adversarial process. Extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks and LVLM architectures show that PA-Attack achieves an average 75.1% score reduction rate (SRR), demonstrating strong attack effectiveness, efficiency, and task generalization in LVLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hefeimei06/PA-Attack.

TL;DR: Prefer-DAS introduces sparse promptable learning and local preference alignment for efficient domain adaptive segmentation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised domain adaptation strategies are limited and biased, hindering practical use. The study aims to leverage sparse points and local human preferences for efficient segmentation.

Method: Develops Prefer-DAS, a multitask model integrating self-training and prompt-guided contrastive learning. Introduces Local Preference Optimization (LPO) and Unsupervised Preference Optimization (UPO) for alignment and addressing missing feedback.

Result: Prefer-DAS outperforms SAM-like, unsupervised, and weakly-supervised DAS methods across four tasks, achieving performance close to or exceeding supervised models.

Conclusion: Prefer-DAS offers strong generalizability and flexibility in both weakly-supervised and unsupervised DAS, making it a practical solution for efficient segmentation.

Abstract: Domain adaptive segmentation (DAS) is a promising paradigm for delineating intracellular structures from various large-scale electron microscopy (EM) without incurring extensive annotated data in each domain. However, the prevalent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) strategies often demonstrate limited and biased performance, which hinders their practical applications. In this study, we explore sparse points and local human preferences as weak labels in the target domain, thereby presenting a more realistic yet annotation-efficient setting. Specifically, we develop Prefer-DAS, which pioneers sparse promptable learning and local preference alignment. The Prefer-DAS is a promptable multitask model that integrates self-training and prompt-guided contrastive learning. Unlike SAM-like methods, the Prefer-DAS allows for the use of full, partial, and even no point prompts during both training and inference stages and thus enables interactive segmentation. Instead of using image-level human preference alignment for segmentation, we introduce Local direct Preference Optimization (LPO) and sparse LPO (SLPO), plug-and-play solutions for alignment with spatially varying human feedback or sparse feedback. To address potential missing feedback, we also introduce Unsupervised Preference Optimization (UPO), which leverages self-learned preferences. As a result, the Prefer-DAS model can effectively perform both weakly-supervised and unsupervised DAS, depending on the availability of points and human preferences. Comprehensive experiments on four challenging DAS tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms SAM-like methods as well as unsupervised and weakly-supervised DAS methods in both automatic and interactive segmentation modes, highlighting strong generalizability and flexibility. Additionally, the performance of our model is very close to or even exceeds that of supervised models.

Motivation: Current computational approaches for diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma suffer from fixed-resolution processing and inefficient feature aggregation, causing information loss or redundancy.

Method: Introduces Hepato-LLaVA with a Sparse Topo-Pack Attention mechanism for 2D tissue topology modeling and uses the HepatoPathoVQA dataset for multi-scale analysis.

Result: Hepato-LLaVA achieves state-of-the-art performance in HCC diagnosis and captioning tasks, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed model and dataset effectively address diagnostic challenges, offering superior performance in hepatocellular pathology analysis.

Abstract: Hepatocellular Carcinoma diagnosis relies heavily on the interpretation of gigapixel Whole Slide Images. However, current computational approaches are constrained by fixed-resolution processing mechanisms and inefficient feature aggregation, which inevitably lead to either severe information loss or high feature redundancy. To address these challenges, we propose Hepato-LLaVA, a specialized Multi-modal Large Language Model designed for fine-grained hepatocellular pathology analysis. We introduce a novel Sparse Topo-Pack Attention mechanism that explicitly models 2D tissue topology. This mechanism effectively aggregates local diagnostic evidence into semantic summary tokens while preserving global context.

*Dong-Guw Lee,Tai Hyoung Rhee,Hyunsoo Jang,Young-Sik Shin,Ukcheol Shin,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TherA is a framework for RGB-to-TIR image translation that ensures thermal plausibility and fine-grained control, outperforming baselines by up to 33%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale TIR data collection and annotation are challenging, and existing RGB-to-TIR methods often ignore thermal physics.

Method: TherA uses a controllable framework with TherA-VLM for thermal-aware embeddings and a latent-diffusion model for realistic TIR synthesis.

Result: TherA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 33% improvement in zero-shot translation metrics.

Conclusion: TherA effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by integrating thermal physics and user control into RGB-to-TIR translation.

Abstract: Despite the inherent advantages of thermal infrared(TIR) imaging, large-scale data collection and annotation remain a major bottleneck for TIR-based perception. A practical alternative is to synthesize pseudo TIR data via image translation; however, most RGB-to-TIR approaches heavily rely on RGB-centric priors that overlook thermal physics, yielding implausible heat distributions. In this paper, we introduce TherA, a controllable RGB-to-TIR translation framework that produces diverse and thermally plausible images at both scene and object level. TherA couples TherA-VLM with a latent-diffusion-based translator. Given a single RGB image and a user-prompted condition pair, TherA-VLM yields a thermal-aware embedding that encodes scene, object, material, and heat-emission context reflecting the input scene-condition pair. Conditioning the diffusion model on this embedding enables realistic TIR synthesis and fine-grained control across time of day, weather, and object state. Compared to other baselines, TherA achieves state-of-the-art translation performance, demonstrating improved zero-shot translation performance up to 33% increase averaged across all metrics.

*Yifeng Huang,Gia Khanh Nguyen,Minh Hoai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountEx is a visual counting framework that addresses the limitation of existing prompt-based methods by allowing users to specify both inclusion and exclusion intent through multimodal prompts, significantly improving accuracy in cluttered scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual counting methods struggle with ambiguity and overcounting in cluttered scenes due to their inability to exclude visually similar distractors.

Method: CountEx introduces a Discriminative Query Refinement module that jointly reasons over inclusion and exclusion cues, isolates exclusion-specific patterns, and applies selective suppression to refine counting queries.

Result: Experiments demonstrate CountEx's substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, validated on the CoCount benchmark with 1,780 videos and 10,086 annotated frames.

Conclusion: CountEx effectively addresses the limitations of prompt-based counting methods by enabling explicit exclusion of distractors, achieving superior performance on both known and novel categories.

Abstract: This paper presents CountEx, a discriminative visual counting framework designed to address a key limitation of existing prompt-based methods: the inability to explicitly exclude visually similar distractors. While current approaches allow users to specify what to count via inclusion prompts, they often struggle in cluttered scenes with confusable object categories, leading to ambiguity and overcounting. CountEx enables users to express both inclusion and exclusion intent, specifying what to count and what to ignore, through multimodal prompts including natural language descriptions and optional visual exemplars. At the core of CountEx is a novel Discriminative Query Refinement module, which jointly reasons over inclusion and exclusion cues by first identifying shared visual features, then isolating exclusion-specific patterns, and finally applying selective suppression to refine the counting query. To support systematic evaluation of fine-grained counting methods, we introduce CoCount, a benchmark comprising 1,780 videos and 10,086 annotated frames across 97 category pairs. Experiments show that CountEx achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods for counting objects from both known and novel categories.

*Jinsong Yang,Zeyuan Hu,Yichen Li,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FinSight-Net is a physics-aware underwater fish detection framework addressing wavelength and turbidity challenges, achieving high accuracy with efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional detectors neglect underwater physics like absorption and scattering, leading to poor detection reliability in aquaculture environments.

Method: FinSight-Net uses MS-DDSP for frequency-specific loss compensation and EPA-FPN for detail restoration via skip connections and pruning.

Result: Achieves 92.8% mAP on UW-BlurredFish, outperforming YOLOv11s by 4.8% with 29.0% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: FinSight-Net offers a robust, lightweight solution for real-time fish detection in challenging underwater conditions.

Abstract: Underwater fish detection (UFD) is a core capability for smart aquaculture and marine ecological monitoring. While recent detectors improve accuracy by stacking feature extractors or introducing heavy attention modules, they often incur substantial computational overhead and, more importantly, neglect the physics that fundamentally limits UFD: wavelength-dependent absorption and turbidity-induced scattering significantly degrade contrast, blur fine structures, and introduce backscattering noise, leading to unreliable localization and recognition. To address these challenges, we propose FinSight-Net, an efficient and physics-aware detection framework tailored for complex aquaculture environments. FinSight-Net introduces a Multi-Scale Decoupled Dual-Stream Processing (MS-DDSP) bottleneck that explicitly targets frequency-specific information loss via heterogeneous convolutional branches, suppressing backscattering artifacts while compensating distorted biological cues through scale-aware and channel-weighted pathways. We further design an Efficient Path Aggregation FPN (EPA-FPN) as a detail-filling mechanism: it restores high-frequency spatial information typically attenuated in deep layers by establishing long-range skip connections and pruning redundant fusion routes, enabling robust detection of non-rigid fish targets under severe blur and turbidity. Extensive experiments on DeepFish, AquaFishSet, and our challenging UW-BlurredFish benchmark demonstrate that FinSight-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, on UW-BlurredFish, FinSight-Net reaches 92.8% mAP, outperforming YOLOv11s by 4.8% while reducing parameters by 29.0%, providing a strong and lightweight solution for real-time automated monitoring in smart aquaculture.

TL;DR: A training-free pipeline aligns VLM outputs with human preferences for subjective perception tasks, outperforming supervised baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning vision-language models with human preferences typically requires costly training; this work aims to achieve alignment without training.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: concept mining, multi-agent structured scoring, and geometric calibration, unified by dimension optimization.

Result: Achieves 72.2% accuracy on Place Pulse 2.0, outperforming supervised baselines by +15.1 pp and uncalibrated VLM by +16.3 pp.

Conclusion: The framework effectively aligns VLMs with human preferences without model-weight modification, offering interpretability and strong performance.

Abstract: Aligning vision-language model (VLM) outputs with human preferences in domain-specific tasks typically requires fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, both of which demand labelled data and GPU compute. We show that for subjective perception tasks, this alignment can be achieved without any model training: VLMs are already strong concept extractors but poor decision calibrators, and the gap can be closed externally. We propose a training-free post-hoc concept-bottleneck pipeline consisting of three tightly coupled stages: concept mining, multi-agent structured scoring, and geometric calibration, unified by an end-to-end dimension optimization loop. Interpretable evaluation dimensions are mined from a handful of human annotations; an Observer-Debater-Judge chain extracts robust continuous concept scores from a frozen VLM; and locally-weighted ridge regression on a hybrid visual-semantic manifold calibrates these scores against human ratings. Applied to urban perception as UrbanAlign, the framework achieves 72.2% accuracy ($κ=0.45$) on Place Pulse 2.0 across six categories, outperforming the best supervised baseline by +15.1 pp and uncalibrated VLM scoring by +16.3 pp, with full dimension-level interpretability and zero model-weight modification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAFT introduces a lightweight method for fine-tuning vision encoders in LVLMs using a discrete codebook, enabling domain adaptation without modifying other model parts, and achieves significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision encoders in LVLMs underperform in domain-specific tasks, leading to cascading errors. Existing methods require re-alignment when encoders change, limiting flexibility.

Method: CRAFT fine-tunes the encoder using a discrete codebook to anchor visual representations, decoupling it from the language model for seamless adaptation across architectures.

Result: CRAFT achieves a 13.51% average gain on domain-specific benchmarks like VQARAD and PlantVillage, preserving linguistic capabilities and outperforming continuous token methods.

Conclusion: CRAFT offers a decoupled, efficient solution for adapting vision encoders in LVLMs, improving performance in specialized domains without compromising language capabilities.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) use their vision encoders to translate images into representations for downstream reasoning, but the encoders often underperform in domain-specific visual tasks such as medical image diagnosis or fine-grained classification, where representation errors can cascade through the language model, leading to incorrect responses. Existing adaptation methods modify the continuous feature interface between encoder and language model through projector tuning or other parameter-efficient updates, which still couples the two components and requires re-alignment whenever the encoder changes. We introduce CRAFT (Codebook RegulAted Fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that fine-tunes the encoder using a discrete codebook that anchors visual representations to a stable token space, achieving domain adaptation without modifying other parts of the model. This decoupled design allows the adapted encoder to seamlessly boost the performance of LVLMs with different language architectures, as long as they share the same codebook. Empirically, CRAFT achieves an average gain of 13.51% across 10 domain-specific benchmarks such as VQARAD and PlantVillage, while preserving the LLM's linguistic capabilities and outperforming peer methods that operate on continuous tokens.

*Kartik Jhawar,Lipo Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hypothesis-Driven TTA (HD-TTA), a framework for safer test-time adaptation in medical segmentation by dynamically selecting between geometric hypotheses to avoid degrading predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard TTA methods lack selectivity in medical segmentation, risking spillage of tumor masks into healthy tissue or degrading accurate predictions.

Method: HD-TTA generates competing geometric hypotheses (compaction vs. inflation) and uses a representation-guided selector to choose the safest outcome. A Gatekeeper skips adaptation on confident cases.

Result: HD-TTA improves safety metrics (HD95 reduced by ~6.4 mm, Precision increased by 4%) while maintaining Dice scores, validating its viability for clinical deployment.

Conclusion: Explicit hypothesis selection resolves the safety-adaptation trade-off, making HD-TTA a robust solution for safe clinical model deployment.

Abstract: Standard Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods typically treat inference as a blind optimization task, applying generic objectives to all or filtered test samples. In safety-critical medical segmentation, this lack of selectivity often causes the tumor mask to spill into healthy brain tissue or degrades predictions that were already correct. We propose Hypothesis-Driven TTA, a novel framework that reformulates adaptation as a dynamic decision process. Rather than forcing a single optimization trajectory, our method generates intuitive competing geometric hypotheses: compaction (is the prediction noisy? trim artifacts) versus inflation (is the valid tumor under-segmented? safely inflate to recover). It then employs a representation-guided selector to autonomously identify the safest outcome based on intrinsic texture consistency. Additionally, a pre-screening Gatekeeper prevents negative transfer by skipping adaptation on confident cases. We validate this proof-of-concept on a cross-domain binary brain tumor segmentation task, applying a source model trained on adult BraTS gliomas to unseen pediatric and more challenging meningioma target domains. HD-TTA improves safety-oriented outcomes (Hausdorff Distance (HD95) and Precision) over several state-of-the-art representative baselines in the challenging safety regime, reducing the HD95 by approximately 6.4 mm and improving Precision by over 4%, while maintaining comparable Dice scores. These results demonstrate that resolving the safety-adaptation trade-off via explicit hypothesis selection is a viable, robust path for safe clinical model deployment. Code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: LapFlow is a multi-scale flow matching framework for image generation, using Laplacian pyramid residuals and a mixture-of-transformers architecture to improve quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance flow matching in image generation by leveraging multi-scale representations, eliminating the need for explicit renoising between scales.

Method: Decomposes images into Laplacian pyramid residuals and processes scales in parallel with a mixture-of-transformers architecture using causal attention mechanisms.

Result: Achieves superior sample quality, faster inference, and lower computational overhead compared to single-scale and multi-scale baselines.

Conclusion: LapFlow is effective for high-resolution image generation (up to 1024x1024) with improved efficiency and quality.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Laplacian multiscale flow matching (LapFlow), a novel framework that enhances flow matching by leveraging multi-scale representations for image generative modeling. Our approach decomposes images into Laplacian pyramid residuals and processes different scales in parallel through a mixture-of-transformers (MoT) architecture with causal attention mechanisms. Unlike previous cascaded approaches that require explicit renoising between scales, our model generates multi-scale representations in parallel, eliminating the need for bridging processes. The proposed multi-scale architecture not only improves generation quality but also accelerates the sampling process and promotes scaling flow matching methods. Through extensive experimentation on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet, we demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample quality with fewer GFLOPs and faster inference compared to single-scale and multi-scale flow matching baselines. The proposed model scales effectively to high-resolution generation (up to 1024$\times$1024) while maintaining lower computational overhead.

*Jiazhang Wang,Hyelim Yang,Tianyi Wang,Florian Willomitzer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A physics-informed deep learning framework is proposed for single-shot 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces, combining polarization cues and structured illumination for accurate and robust normal estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional techniques like deflectometry and Fourier-based methods are either slow or inaccurate for dynamic environments and complex surfaces. Polarimetric 3D imaging lacks accuracy due to orthographic assumptions. This work aims to address these limitations.

Method: The approach uses a dual-encoder architecture with mutual feature modulation to combine polarization cues and structured illumination, resolving their nonlinear coupling for direct surface normal inference.

Result: The method achieves accurate and robust normal estimation in a single shot with fast inference, enabling practical 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully overcomes the limitations of existing techniques, offering a reliable solution for single-shot 3D imaging of specular surfaces in dynamic environments.

Abstract: 3D imaging of specular surfaces remains challenging in real-world scenarios, such as in-line inspection or hand-held scanning, requiring fast and accurate measurement of complex geometries. Optical metrology techniques such as deflectometry achieve high accuracy but typically rely on multi-shot acquisition, making them unsuitable for dynamic environments. Fourier-based single-shot approaches alleviate this constraint, yet their performance deteriorates when measuring surfaces with high spatial frequency structure or large curvature. Alternatively, polarimetric 3D imaging in computer vision operates in a single-shot fashion and exhibits robustness to geometric complexity. However, its accuracy is fundamentally limited by the orthographic imaging assumption. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework for single-shot 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces. Polarization cues provide orientation priors that assist in interpreting geometric information encoded by structured illumination. These complementary cues are processed through a dual-encoder architecture with mutual feature modulation, allowing the network to resolve their nonlinear coupling and directly infer surface normals. The proposed method achieves accurate and robust normal estimation in single-shot with fast inference, enabling practical 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces.

*Zheang Huai,Hui Tang,Hualiang Wang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FRLA, a novel method for source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) in fundus image diagnosis, addressing forgetting issues and leveraging fine-grained knowledge from vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFDA methods using vision-language models suffer from forgetting superior predictions and ignoring fine-grained knowledge, especially in fundus image diagnosis.

Method: FRLA includes a forgetting-resistant adaptation module to preserve confident predictions and a lesion-aware module for patch-wise predictions from vision-language models.

Result: The method outperforms the vision-language model and state-of-the-art SFDA techniques in experiments.

Conclusion: FRLA effectively addresses forgetting and leverages fine-grained knowledge, demonstrating superior performance in SFDA for fundus image diagnosis.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a model trained in the source domain to perform well in the target domain, with only unlabeled target domain data and the source model. Taking into account that conventional SFDA methods are inevitably error-prone under domain shift, recently greater attention has been directed to SFDA assisted with off-the-shelf foundation models, e.g., vision-language (ViL) models. However, existing works of leveraging ViL models for SFDA confront two issues: (i) Although mutual information is exploited to consider the joint distribution between the predictions of ViL model and the target model, we argue that the forgetting of some superior predictions of the target model still occurs, as indicated by the decline of the accuracies of certain classes during adaptation; (ii) Prior research disregards the rich, fine-grained knowledge embedded in the ViL model, which offers detailed grounding for fundus image diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce a novel forgetting-resistant and lesion-aware (FRLA) method for SFDA of fundus image diagnosis with ViL model. Specifically, a forgetting-resistant adaptation module explicitly preserves the confident predictions of the target model, and a lesion-aware adaptation module yields patch-wise predictions from ViL model and employs them to help the target model be aware of the lesion areas and leverage the ViL model's fine-grained knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our method not only significantly outperforms the vision-language model, but also achieves consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A spatially regularized MIL framework improves patch-level feature learning in whole slide images by leveraging spatial relationships and joint optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole slide images are crucial for disease diagnosis but suffer from large data size and sparse annotations, leading to unstable optimization in existing MIL methods.

Method: The proposed framework uses spatial relationships among patch features as regularization signals and jointly optimizes spatial reconstruction and classification objectives.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on multiple public datasets.

Conclusion: This approach offers a promising solution for handling sparse supervision in whole slide image analysis.

Abstract: Whole slide images, with their gigapixel-scale panoramas of tissue samples, are pivotal for precise disease diagnosis. However, their analysis is hindered by immense data size and scarce annotations. Existing MIL methods face challenges due to the fundamental imbalance where a single bag-level label must guide the learning of numerous patch-level features. This sparse supervision makes it difficult to reliably identify discriminative patches during training, leading to unstable optimization and suboptimal solutions. We propose a spatially regularized MIL framework that leverages inherent spatial relationships among patch features as label-independent regularization signals. Our approach learns a shared representation space by jointly optimizing feature-induced spatial reconstruction and label-guided classification objectives, enforcing consistency between intrinsic structural patterns and supervisory signals. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, offering a promising direction.

TL;DR: MICON-Bench introduces a benchmark for multi-image tasks and Dynamic Attention Rebalancing (DAR) to improve model coherence and reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack focus on multi-image reasoning, prompting the creation of MICON-Bench to evaluate and enhance model performance in this area.

Method: Introduces MICON-Bench with six tasks and an MLLM-driven evaluation framework, alongside DAR for dynamic attention adjustment during inference.

Result: MICON-Bench effectively exposes multi-image reasoning challenges, and DAR improves generation quality and coherence across images.

Conclusion: MICON-Bench fills a gap in evaluating multi-image tasks, while DAR offers a practical solution to enhance model performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have enabled remarkable image understanding and generation capabilities. However, while models like Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image show emerging abilities to reason over multiple related images, existing benchmarks rarely address the challenges of multi-image context generation, focusing mainly on text-to-image or single-image editing tasks. In this work, we introduce \textbf{MICON-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark covering six tasks that evaluate cross-image composition, contextual reasoning, and identity preservation. We further propose an MLLM-driven Evaluation-by-Checkpoint framework for automatic verification of semantic and visual consistency, where multimodal large language model (MLLM) serves as a verifier. Additionally, we present \textbf{Dynamic Attention Rebalancing (DAR)}, a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention during inference to enhance coherence and reduce hallucinations. Extensive experiments on various state-of-the-art open-source models demonstrate both the rigor of MICON-Bench in exposing multi-image reasoning challenges and the efficacy of DAR in improving generation quality and cross-image coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift from general object detection to precise target identification in drone applications necessitates more efficient and accurate models.

Method: The proposed model replaces the C2f layer with a C3k2 layer in YOLOv8's backbone for better local feature representation and optimizes parallel processing for speed and lightweight design.

Result: Experiments on VisDrone show improved precision (40.6% to 41.6%), recall (30.8% to 31%), F1 score (35% to 35.5%), mAP@0.5 (30.4% to 30.7%), and reduced parameters (4M to 3.8M) and FLOPs (15.7B to 15.2B).

Conclusion: The model offers a practical, efficient solution for precise drone-based object detection, outperforming the original YOLO-World.

Abstract: As drone-based object detection technology continues to evolve, the demand is shifting from merely detecting objects to enabling users to accurately identify specific targets. For example, users can input particular targets as prompts to precisely detect desired objects. To address this need, an efficient text-guided object detection model has been developed to enhance the detection of small objects. Specifically, an improved version of the existing YOLO-World model is introduced. The proposed method replaces the C2f layer in the YOLOv8 backbone with a C3k2 layer, enabling more precise representation of local features, particularly for small objects or those with clearly defined boundaries. Additionally, the proposed architecture improves processing speed and efficiency through parallel processing optimization, while also contributing to a more lightweight model design. Comparative experiments on the VisDrone dataset show that the proposed model outperforms the original YOLO-World model, with precision increasing from 40.6% to 41.6%, recall from 30.8% to 31%, F1 score from 35% to 35.5%, and mAP@0.5 from 30.4% to 30.7%, confirming its enhanced accuracy. Furthermore, the model demonstrates superior lightweight performance, with the parameter count reduced from 4 million to 3.8 million and FLOPs decreasing from 15.7 billion to 15.2 billion. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a practical and effective solution for precise object detection in drone-based applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RFC improves feature caching in diffusion transformers by leveraging input-output relationships and relational cache scheduling, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feature caching methods rely heavily on temporal extrapolation, leading to prediction errors and performance degradation due to irregular feature changes.

Method: RFC introduces relational feature estimation (RFE) for accurate output feature prediction and relational cache scheduling (RCS) to manage prediction errors effectively.

Result: Experiments show RFC consistently outperforms prior feature caching approaches across various diffusion transformer models.

Conclusion: RFC enhances feature caching accuracy and efficiency, making it superior to existing temporal extrapolation-based methods.

Abstract: Feature caching approaches accelerate diffusion transformers (DiTs) by storing the output features of computationally expensive modules at certain timesteps, and exploiting them for subsequent steps to reduce redundant computations. Recent forecasting-based caching approaches employ temporal extrapolation techniques to approximate the output features with cached ones. Although effective, relying exclusively on temporal extrapolation still suffers from significant prediction errors, leading to performance degradation. Through a detailed analysis, we find that 1) these errors stem from the irregular magnitude of changes in the output features, and 2) an input feature of a module is strongly correlated with the corresponding output. Based on this, we propose relational feature caching (RFC), a novel framework that leverages the input-output relationship to enhance the accuracy of the feature prediction. Specifically, we introduce relational feature estimation (RFE) to estimate the magnitude of changes in the output features from the inputs, enabling more accurate feature predictions. We also present relational cache scheduling (RCS), which estimates the prediction errors using the input features and performs full computations only when the errors are expected to be substantial. Extensive experiments across various DiT models demonstrate that RFC consistently outperforms prior approaches significantly. Project page is available at https://cvlab.yonsei.ac.kr/projects/RFC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage strategy combining high-authenticity and high-fidelity methods for realistic generative image composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve high authenticity (foreground-background compatibility) and high fidelity (foreground detail preservation).

Method: A two-stage approach: first generates reasonable foreground shape using high-authenticity methods, then uses this as input for high-fidelity methods in the second stage.

Result: Experiments on the MureCOM dataset confirm the strategy's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage method successfully achieves both authenticity and fidelity in image composition, with released code and models.

Abstract: Generative image composition aims to regenerate the given foreground object in the background image to produce a realistic composite image. Some high-authenticity methods can adjust foreground pose/view to be compatible with background, while some high-fidelity methods can preserve the foreground details accurately. However, existing methods can hardly achieve both goals at the same time. In this work, we propose a two-stage strategy to achieve both goals. In the first stage, we use high-authenticity method to generate reasonable foreground shape, serving as the condition of high-fidelity method in the second stage. The experiments on MureCOM dataset verify the effectiveness of our two-stage strategy. The code and model have been released at https://github.com/bcmi/OSInsert-Image-Composition.

Method: ORION employs low-rank adaptation to optimize a novel loss function with two terms: one promoting orthogonality between class representations and another penalizing deviations from initial prototypes. It also connects the orthogonality penalty to MLE via Huygens theorem.

Result: Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks and three VLM backbones show ORION's refined embeddings outperform standard CLIP prototypes, consistently improving performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and test-time adaptation settings.

Conclusion: ORION's plug-and-play framework significantly enhances VLM performance by optimizing text embeddings, proving effective across diverse tasks and methods.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization across diverse tasks, yet their performance remains constrained by the quality and geometry of the textual prototypes used to represent classes. Standard zero shot classifiers, derived from frozen text encoders and handcrafted prompts, may yield correlated or weakly separated embeddings that limit task specific discriminability. We introduce ORION, a text encoder fine tuning framework that improves pretrained VLMs using only class names. Our method optimizes, via low rank adaptation, a novel loss integrating two terms, one promoting pairwise orthogonality between the textual representations of the classes of a given task and the other penalizing deviations from the initial class prototypes. Furthermore, we provide a probabilistic interpretation of our orthogonality penalty, connecting it to the general maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) principle via Huygens theorem. We report extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks and three large VLM backbones, showing that the refined textual embeddings yield powerful replacements for the standard CLIP prototypes. Added as plug and play module on top of various state of the art methods, and across different prediction settings (zero shot, few shot and test time adaptation), ORION improves the performance consistently and significantly.

### [138] [Fore-Mamba3D: Mamba-based Foreground-Enhanced Encoding for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19536)
*Zhiwei Ning,Xuanang Gao,Jiaxi Cao,Runze Yang,Huiying Xu,Xinzhong Zhu,Jie Yang,Wei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fore-Mamba3D enhances foreground voxel encoding in 3D object detection by addressing response attenuation and restricted context in Mamba-based methods, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based methods encode entire non-empty voxel sequences, including useless background, leading to performance degradation when focusing only on foreground voxels due to response attenuation and limited context.

Method: Fore-Mamba3D samples foreground voxels, uses a regional-to-global slide window (RGSW) for information propagation, and employs SASFMamba to enrich context with semantic and geometric awareness.

Result: Fore-Mamba3D achieves superior performance in 3D object detection benchmarks by effectively enhancing foreground encoding.

Conclusion: Fore-Mamba3D successfully addresses limitations of Mamba-based methods for foreground voxel encoding, improving accuracy in 3D object detection.

Abstract: Linear modeling methods like Mamba have been merged as the effective backbone for the 3D object detection task. However, previous Mamba-based methods utilize the bidirectional encoding for the whole non-empty voxel sequence, which contains abundant useless background information in the scenes. Though directly encoding foreground voxels appears to be a plausible solution, it tends to degrade detection performance. We attribute this to the response attenuation and restricted context representation in the linear modeling for fore-only sequences. To address this problem, we propose a novel backbone, termed Fore-Mamba3D, to focus on the foreground enhancement by modifying Mamba-based encoder. The foreground voxels are first sampled according to the predicted scores. Considering the response attenuation existing in the interaction of foreground voxels across different instances, we design a regional-to-global slide window (RGSW) to propagate the information from regional split to the entire sequence. Furthermore, a semantic-assisted and state spatial fusion module (SASFMamba) is proposed to enrich contextual representation by enhancing semantic and geometric awareness within the Mamba model. Our method emphasizes foreground-only encoding and alleviates the distance-based and causal dependencies in the linear autoregression model. The superior performance across various benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of Fore-Mamba3D in the 3D object detection task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cosmetic modifications like beards and makeup can trick AI age estimators into classifying minors as adults, revealing vulnerabilities in age-verification systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the robustness of AI age estimation systems against household-accessible cosmetic modifications that could bypass age restrictions.

Method: Simulated physical attacks (beards, grey hair, makeup, wrinkles) on 329 facial images using a VLM image editor. Evaluated 8 models (5 specialized, 3 vision-language) using Attack Conversion Rate (ACR).

Result: Cosmetic changes, especially synthetic beards, achieved high ACRs (28-83%). Vision-language models showed lower vulnerability than specialized ones.

Conclusion: Deployed age-verification systems lack robustness to adversarial cosmetic changes, necessitating adversarial testing in model selection.

Abstract: Age estimation systems are increasingly deployed as gatekeepers for age-restricted online content, yet their robustness to cosmetic modifications has not been systematically evaluated. We investigate whether simple, household-accessible cosmetic changes, including beards, grey hair, makeup, and simulated wrinkles, can cause AI age estimators to classify minors as adults. To study this threat at scale without ethical concerns, we simulate these physical attacks on 329 facial images of individuals aged 10 to 21 using a VLM image editor (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image). We then evaluate eight models from our prior benchmark: five specialized architectures (MiVOLO, Custom-Best, Herosan, MiViaLab, DEX) and three vision-language models (Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-5-Nano). We introduce the Attack Conversion Rate (ACR), defined as the fraction of images predicted as minor at baseline that flip to adult after attack, a population-agnostic metric that does not depend on the ratio of minors to adults in the test set. Our results reveal that a synthetic beard alone achieves 28 to 69 percent ACR across all eight models; combining all four attacks shifts predicted age by +7.7 years on average across all 329 subjects and reaches up to 83 percent ACR; and vision-language models exhibit lower ACR (59 to 71 percent) than specialized models (63 to 83 percent) under the full attack, although the ACR ranges overlap and the difference is not statistically tested. These findings highlight a critical vulnerability in deployed age-verification pipelines and call for adversarial robustness evaluation as a mandatory criterion for model selection.

TL;DR: A green learning (GL) approach is proposed for restoring low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) images, offering efficient, transparent, and high-performance restoration compared to deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDCT images suffer from noise and artifacts, making restoration crucial for medical analysis. While deep learning methods exist, they may lack transparency and efficiency, prompting exploration of GL.

Method: The GL methodology is applied to restore LDCT images, focusing on mathematical transparency, computational efficiency, and high performance.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that GL achieves state-of-the-art restoration performance with a smaller model size and lower inference complexity.

Conclusion: The GL approach is a viable alternative to deep learning for LDCT image restoration, offering advantages in efficiency and transparency.

Abstract: This work proposes a green learning (GL) approach to restore medical images. Without loss of generality, we use low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) images as examples. LDCT images are susceptible to noise and artifacts, where the imaging process introduces distortion. LDCT image restoration is an important preprocessing step for further medical analysis. Deep learning (DL) methods have been developed to solve this problem. We examine an alternative solution using the Green Learning (GL) methodology. The new restoration method is characterized by mathematical transparency, computational and memory efficiency, and high performance. Experiments show that our GL method offers state-of-the-art restoration performance at a smaller model size and with lower inference complexity.

TL;DR: Vinedresser3D is an agentic framework for high-quality text-guided 3D editing using multimodal LLMs and latent space operations, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with complex prompts, automatic localization of edits, and preserving unedited content in 3D assets.

Method: Uses multimodal LLMs to infer descriptions and edit details, applies image editing for visual guidance, and performs latent space editing with inversion-based rectified-flow inpainting.

Result: Outperforms baselines in automatic metrics and human preference studies, enabling precise and coherent 3D editing without masks.

Conclusion: Vinedresser3D successfully addresses key challenges in text-guided 3D editing, offering a robust and effective solution.

Abstract: Text-guided 3D editing aims to modify existing 3D assets using natural-language instructions. Current methods struggle to jointly understand complex prompts, automatically localize edits in 3D, and preserve unedited content. We introduce Vinedresser3D, an agentic framework for high-quality text-guided 3D editing that operates directly in the latent space of a native 3D generative model. Given a 3D asset and an editing prompt, Vinedresser3D uses a multimodal large language model to infer rich descriptions of the original asset, identify the edit region and edit type (addition, modification, deletion), and generate decomposed structural and appearance-level text guidance. The agent then selects an informative view and applies an image editing model to obtain visual guidance. Finally, an inversion-based rectified-flow inpainting pipeline with an interleaved sampling module performs editing in the 3D latent space, enforcing prompt alignment while maintaining 3D coherence and unedited regions. Experiments on diverse 3D edits demonstrate that Vinedresser3D outperforms prior baselines in both automatic metrics and human preference studies, while enabling precise, coherent, and mask-free 3D editing.

TL;DR: DICArt introduces a discrete diffusion framework for articulated object pose estimation, addressing challenges in complex search spaces and kinematic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with large search spaces and lack intrinsic kinematic constraints, prompting the need for a more robust approach.

Method: DICArt uses a learned reverse discrete diffusion process, a flexible flow decider for denoising/resetting tokens, and hierarchical kinematic coupling to estimate poses.

Result: Experiments show DICArt outperforms existing methods in robustness and performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DICArt provides a reliable paradigm for category-level 6D pose estimation by combining discrete generative modeling with structural priors.

Abstract: Articulated object pose estimation is a core task in embodied AI. Existing methods typically regress poses in a continuous space, but often struggle with 1) navigating a large, complex search space and 2) failing to incorporate intrinsic kinematic constraints. In this work, we introduce DICArt (DIsCrete Diffusion for Articulation Pose Estimation), a novel framework that formulates pose estimation as a conditional discrete diffusion process. Instead of operating in a continuous domain, DICArt progressively denoises a noisy pose representation through a learned reverse diffusion procedure to recover the GT pose. To improve modeling fidelity, we propose a flexible flow decider that dynamically determines whether each token should be denoised or reset, effectively balancing the real and noise distributions during diffusion. Additionally, we incorporate a hierarchical kinematic coupling strategy, estimating the pose of each rigid part hierarchically to respect the object's kinematic structure. We validate DICArt on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance and robustness. By integrating discrete generative modeling with structural priors, DICArt offers a new paradigm for reliable category-level 6D pose estimation in complex environments.

*Nadav Kadvil,Ayellet Tal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A defense method for LVLMs against adversarial images using image transformations and agentic data consolidation, ensuring efficiency and state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs are vulnerable to adversarial images that bias outputs incorrectly; a robust, efficient defense is needed.

Method: Combines image transformations with a two-stage detection mechanism (image consistency and text-embedding space discrepancies) and uses LLMs sparingly.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy; most clean images avoid costly processing, and adversarial examples add minimal overhead.

Conclusion: The approach effectively defends LVLMs against adversarial attacks while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can be vulnerable to adversarial images that subtly bias their outputs toward plausible yet incorrect responses. We introduce a general, efficient, and training-free defense that combines image transformations with agentic data consolidation to recover correct model behavior. A key component of our approach is a two-stage detection mechanism that quickly filters out the majority of clean inputs. We first assess image consistency under content-preserving transformations at negligible computational cost. For more challenging cases, we examine discrepancies in a text-embedding space. Only when necessary do we invoke a powerful LLM to resolve attack-induced divergences. A key idea is to consolidate multiple responses, leveraging both their similarities and their differences. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining notable efficiency: most clean images skip costly processing, and even in the presence of numerous adversarial examples, the overhead remains minimal.

*Chang Liu,Yunfan Ye,Qingyang Zhou,Xichen Tan,Mengxuan Luo,Zhenyu Qiu,Wei Peng,Zhiping Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOCA-Bench is a benchmark evaluating Video-LLMs' ability to detect physical anomalies, showing significant struggles with causal mechanisms despite advancements in semantic perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in Video-LLMs' predictive world modeling, specifically their difficulty in identifying physical anomalies, which is crucial for grounded intelligence.

Method: The authors introduce HOCA-Bench, categorizing anomalies into ontological and causal types, and use generative video models to create a testbed of 1,439 videos (3,470 QA pairs) for evaluation.

Result: Evaluations reveal Video-LLMs perform poorly on causal anomalies (e.g., gravity, friction), with a 20% performance drop compared to ontological anomalies. System-2 reasoning helps but doesn't bridge the gap.

Conclusion: Current Video-LLMs excel at visual pattern recognition but lack foundational understanding of physical laws, highlighting a need for architectural improvements.

Abstract: Video-LLMs have improved steadily on semantic perception, but they still fall short on predictive world modeling, which is central to physically grounded intelligence. We introduce HOCA-Bench, a benchmark that frames physical anomalies through a Hegelian lens. HOCA-Bench separates anomalies into two types: ontological anomalies, where an entity violates its own definition or persistence, and causal anomalies, where interactions violate physical relations. Using state-of-the-art generative video models as adversarial simulators, we build a testbed of 1,439 videos (3,470 QA pairs). Evaluations on 17 Video-LLMs show a clear cognitive lag: models often identify static ontological violations (e.g., shape mutations) but struggle with causal mechanisms (e.g., gravity or friction), with performance dropping by more than 20% on causal tasks. System-2 "Thinking" modes improve reasoning, but they do not close the gap, suggesting that current architectures recognize visual patterns more readily than they apply basic physical laws.

TL;DR: ConceptPrism automatically disentangles shared visual concepts from image-specific residuals using reconstruction and exclusion losses, improving fidelity and alignment without manual guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized text-to-image generation faces concept entanglement, where irrelevant residual information from reference images complicates balancing concept fidelity and text alignment. Existing methods rely on manual guidance, limiting applicability.

Method: ConceptPrism compares images within a set to disentangle shared concepts from residuals. It jointly optimizes target and residual tokens using reconstruction loss for fidelity and exclusion loss to ensure residuals discard shared concepts.

Result: Experiments show ConceptPrism effectively resolves entanglement, achieving better fidelity-alignment trade-offs without supervision.

Conclusion: ConceptPrism offers a novel, unsupervised solution to concept entanglement in text-to-image generation, outperforming manual guidance methods.

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation suffers from concept entanglement, where irrelevant residual information from reference images is captured, leading to a trade-off between concept fidelity and text alignment. Recent disentanglement approaches attempt to solve this utilizing manual guidance, such as linguistic cues or segmentation masks, which limits their applicability and fails to fully articulate the target concept. In this paper, we propose ConceptPrism, a novel framework that automatically disentangles the shared visual concept from image-specific residuals by comparing images within a set. Our method jointly optimizes a target token and image-wise residual tokens using two complementary objectives: a reconstruction loss to ensure fidelity, and a novel exclusion loss that compels residual tokens to discard the shared concept. This process allows the target token to capture the pure concept without direct supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConceptPrism effectively resolves concept entanglement, achieving a significantly improved trade-off between fidelity and alignment.

TL;DR: MVIG attack is a novel adversarial framework exploiting vulnerabilities in collaborative perception systems, reducing defense success by 62% and achieving 47% lower detection rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CP systems enhance safety but are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks exploiting timing, target regions, and implicit confidence leaks in shared data.

Method: Proposes MVIG attack using mutual view information graphs and temporal graph learning to generate risk maps, optimizing attack parameters for adaptive attacks.

Result: MVIG attack reduces defense success by 62% and lowers detection rates by 47% at 29.9 FPS, highlighting CP system vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The MVIG attack exposes critical security gaps in CP systems, necessitating stronger defenses.

Abstract: Collaborative perception (CP) enables data sharing among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to enhance driving safety. However, CP systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks where malicious agents forge false objects via feature-level perturbations. Current defensive systems use threshold-based consensus verification by comparing collaborative and ego detection results. Yet, these defenses remain vulnerable to more sophisticated attack strategies that could exploit two critical weaknesses: (i) lack of robustness against attacks with systematic timing and target region optimization, and (ii) inadvertent disclosure of vulnerability knowledge through implicit confidence information in shared collaboration data. In this paper, we propose MVIG attack, a novel adaptive adversarial CP framework learning to capture vulnerability knowledge disclosed by different defensive CP systems from a unified mutual view information graph (MVIG) representation. Our approach combines MVIG representation with temporal graph learning to generate evolving fabrication risk maps and employs entropy-aware vulnerability search to optimize attack location, timing and persistence, enabling adaptive attacks with generalizability across various defensive configurations. Extensive evaluations on OPV2V and Adv-OPV2V datasets demonstrate that MVIG attack reduces defense success rates by up to 62\% against state-of-the-art defenses while achieving 47\% lower detection for persistent attacks at 29.9 FPS, exposing critical security gaps in CP systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLCR introduces a hierarchical framework for multimodal learning, ensuring semantic alignment and preventing leakage of private information, achieving strong performance across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fusion methods often overlook asynchronous, multi-level semantic structures, leading to semantic misalignment and degraded representation quality.

Method: CLCR organizes features into a three-level semantic hierarchy, uses IntraCED for shared-private subspace factorization, and employs InterCAD for cross-level fusion with learned anchors and regularization.

Result: Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate CLCR's strong performance and generalization across tasks like emotion recognition, sentiment analysis, and action recognition.

Conclusion: CLCR effectively addresses semantic misalignment in multimodal learning by hierarchically organizing and constraining cross-modal interactions, achieving robust task performance.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to capture both shared and private information from multiple modalities. However, existing methods that project all modalities into a single latent space for fusion often overlook the asynchronous, multi-level semantic structure of multimodal data. This oversight induces semantic misalignment and error propagation, thereby degrading representation quality. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Level Co-Representation (CLCR), which explicitly organizes each modality's features into a three-level semantic hierarchy and specifies level-wise constraints for cross-modal interactions. First, a semantic hierarchy encoder aligns shallow, mid, and deep features across modalities, establishing a common basis for interaction. And then, at each level, an Intra-Level Co-Exchange Domain (IntraCED) factorizes features into shared and private subspaces and restricts cross-modal attention to the shared subspace via a learnable token budget. This design ensures that only shared semantics are exchanged and prevents leakage from private channels. To integrate information across levels, the Inter-Level Co-Aggregation Domain (InterCAD) synchronizes semantic scales using learned anchors, selectively fuses the shared representations, and gates private cues to form a compact task representation. We further introduce regularization terms to enforce separation of shared and private features and to minimize cross-level interference. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning emotion recognition, event localization, sentiment analysis, and action recognition show that CLCR achieves strong performance and generalizes well across tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Looting threatens cultural heritage, and monitoring remote sites is challenging.

Method: Compares CNNs (trained on RGB patches) and traditional ML (using spectral/texture features) on a dataset of 1,943 Afghan sites.

Result: CNNs with ImageNet pretraining and spatial masking achieve higher accuracy (F1=0.926) than traditional ML (F1=0.710).

Conclusion: ImageNet pretraining and spatial masking improve detection; looting signatures are highly localized.

Abstract: Looting at archaeological sites poses a severe risk to cultural heritage, yet monitoring thousands of remote locations remains operationally difficult. We present a scalable and satellite-based pipeline to detect looted archaeological sites, using PlanetScope monthly mosaics (4.7m/pixel) and a curated dataset of 1,943 archaeological sites in Afghanistan (898 looted, 1,045 preserved) with multi-year imagery (2016--2023) and site-footprint masks. We compare (i) end-to-end CNN classifiers trained on raw RGB patches and (ii) traditional machine learning (ML) trained on handcrafted spectral/texture features and embeddings from recent remote-sensing foundation models. Results indicate that ImageNet-pretrained CNNs combined with spatial masking reach an F1 score of 0.926, clearly surpassing the strongest traditional ML setup, which attains an F1 score of 0.710 using SatCLIP-V+RF+Mean, i.e., location and vision embeddings fed into a Random Forest with mean-based temporal aggregation. Ablation studies demonstrate that ImageNet pretraining (even in the presence of domain shift) and spatial masking enhance performance. In contrast, geospatial foundation model embeddings perform competitively with handcrafted features, suggesting that looting signatures are extremely localized.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with rare object reasoning due to scarce pretraining data. Prior methods are computationally intensive and underutilize original data.

Method: Learn multi-modal class embeddings for rare objects using vision foundation models and synonym-augmented text. Refine visual tokens via lightweight attention and inject embeddings as hints into text prompts.

Result: Experiments show significant gains in rare object recognition and reasoning for pretrained VLMs.

Conclusion: The method efficiently enhances VLMs' focus and reasoning on rare objects without finetuning.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in broad visual understanding, yet they remain challenged by object-centric reasoning on rare objects due to the scarcity of such instances in pretraining data. While prior efforts alleviate this issue by retrieving additional data or introducing stronger vision encoders, these methods are still computationally intensive during finetuning VLMs and don't fully exploit the original training data. In this paper, we introduce an efficient plug-and-play module that substantially improves VLMs' reasoning over rare objects by refining visual tokens and enriching input text prompts, without VLMs finetuning. Specifically, we propose to learn multi-modal class embeddings for rare objects by leveraging prior knowledge from vision foundation models and synonym-augmented text descriptions, compensating for limited training examples. These embeddings refine the visual tokens in VLMs through a lightweight attention-based enhancement module that improves fine-grained object details. In addition, we use the learned embeddings as object-aware detectors to generate informative hints, which are injected into the text prompts to help guide the VLM's attention toward relevant image regions. Experiments on two benchmarks show consistent and substantial gains for pretrained VLMs in rare object recognition and reasoning. Further analysis reveals how our method strengthens the VLM's ability to focus on and reason about rare objects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V models prioritize visual fidelity over instructional effectiveness, creating a gap for pedagogically sound video generation.

Method: PedaCo-Gen introduces an IR phase for interactive educator-AI collaboration, refining video blueprints (scripts and visuals) based on CTML.

Result: The system improved video quality and was rated highly for production efficiency (M=4.26) and guidance validity (M=4.04) by 23 experts.

Conclusion: PedaCo-Gen demonstrates the value of combining AI generative power with human pedagogical expertise for effective instructional content.

Abstract: While advancements in Text-to-Video (T2V) generative AI offer a promising path toward democratizing content creation, current models are often optimized for visual fidelity rather than instructional efficacy. This study introduces PedaCo-Gen, a pedagogically-informed human-AI collaborative video generating system for authoring instructional videos based on Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML). Moving away from traditional "one-shot" generation, PedaCo-Gen introduces an Intermediate Representation (IR) phase, enabling educators to interactively review and refine video blueprints-comprising scripts and visual descriptions-with an AI reviewer. Our study with 23 education experts demonstrates that PedaCo-Gen significantly enhances video quality across various topics and CTML principles compared to baselines. Participants perceived the AI-driven guidance not merely as a set of instructions but as a metacognitive scaffold that augmented their instructional design expertise, reporting high production efficiency (M=4.26) and guide validity (M=4.04). These findings highlight the importance of reclaiming pedagogical agency through principled co-creation, providing a foundation for future AI authoring tools that harmonize generative power with human professional expertise.

Motivation: The goal is to improve planar tracking robustness and accuracy by leveraging SAM 2's segmentation capabilities and enhancing lost target re-detection.

Method: SAM-H estimates homographies from segmentation mask contours, while WOFTSAM improves WOFT by using SAM-H's re-detection feature.

Abstract: We present SAM-H and WOFTSAM, novel planar trackers that combine robust long-term segmentation tracking provided by SAM 2 with 8 degrees-of-freedom homography pose estimation. SAM-H estimates homographies from segmentation mask contours and is thus highly robust to target appearance changes. WOFTSAM significantly improves the current state-of-the-art planar tracker WOFT by exploiting lost target re-detection provided by SAM-H. The proposed methods are evaluated on POT-210 and PlanarTrack tracking benchmarks, setting the new state-of-the-art performance on both. On the latter, they outperform the second best by a large margin, +12.4 and +15.2pp on the p@15 metric. We also present improved ground-truth annotations of initial PlanarTrack poses, enabling more accurate benchmarking in the high-precision p@5 metric.

*Uichan Lee,Jeonghyeon Kim,Sangheum Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiRM is a method for precise concept erasure in text-to-image models by misdirecting high-level semantic representations in the text encoder, minimizing impact on non-target concepts and preserving generative quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about misuse of text-to-image models for harmful or copyrighted content, HiRM aims to improve concept erasure techniques by focusing on early text encoder layers.

Method: HiRM misdirects high-level semantic representations of target concepts in early text encoder layers toward designated vectors, updating only those layers while preserving unrelated concepts.

Result: HiRM achieves strong performance on benchmarks (UnlearnCanvas, NSFW), preserves generative utility, and works synergistically with denoiser-based methods.

Conclusion: HiRM offers an effective, low-cost solution for concept erasure in text-to-image models, with minimal impact on non-target concepts and broad applicability.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have seen rapid and widespread adoption. However, their powerful generative capabilities raise concerns about potential misuse for synthesizing harmful, private, or copyrighted content. To mitigate such risks, concept erasure techniques have emerged as a promising solution. Prior works have primarily focused on fine-tuning the denoising component (e.g., the U-Net backbone). However, recent causal tracing studies suggest that visual attribute information is localized in the early self-attention layers of the text encoder, indicating a potential alternative for concept erasing. Building on this insight, we conduct preliminary experiments and find that directly fine-tuning early layers can suppress target concepts but often degrades the generation quality of non-target concepts. To overcome this limitation, we propose High-Level Representation Misdirection (HiRM), which misdirects high-level semantic representations of target concepts in the text encoder toward designated vectors such as random directions or semantically defined directions (e.g., supercategories), while updating only early layers that contain causal states of visual attributes. Our decoupling strategy enables precise concept removal with minimal impact on unrelated concepts, as demonstrated by strong results on UnlearnCanvas and NSFW benchmarks across diverse targets (e.g., objects, styles, nudity). HiRM also preserves generative utility at low training cost, transfers to state-of-the-art architectures such as Flux without additional training, and shows synergistic effects with denoiser-based concept erasing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedTAR is a federated learning framework addressing longitudinal medical report generation by integrating temporal adaptation and personalized updates, improving accuracy and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning methods fail to account for temporal dynamics and patient-specific heterogeneity in longitudinal medical data, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: FedTAR combines demographic-driven personalization with time-aware global aggregation, using LoRA adapters and meta-learned temporal policies.

Result: Experiments show FedTAR outperforms in linguistic accuracy, temporal coherence, and cross-site generalization on J-MID and MIMIC-CXR datasets.

Conclusion: FedTAR provides a robust, privacy-preserving solution for federated longitudinal medical report generation.

Abstract: Longitudinal medical report generation is clinically important yet remains challenging due to strict privacy constraints and the evolving nature of disease progression. Although federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without data sharing, existing FL methods largely overlook longitudinal dynamics by assuming stationary client distributions, making them unable to model temporal shifts across visits or patient-specific heterogeneity-ultimately leading to unstable optimization and suboptimal report generation.
  We introduce Federated Temporal Adaptation (FTA), a federated setting that explicitly accounts for the temporal evolution of client data. Building upon this setting, we propose FedTAR, a framework that integrates demographic-driven personalization with time-aware global aggregation. FedTAR generates lightweight LoRA adapters from demographic embeddings and performs temporal residual aggregation, where updates from different visits are weighted by a meta-learned temporal policy optimized via first-order MAML.
  Experiments on J-MID (1M exams) and MIMIC-CXR demonstrate consistent improvements in linguistic accuracy, temporal coherence, and cross-site generalization, establishing FedTAR as a robust and privacy-preserving paradigm for federated longitudinal modeling.

*Hyeongjin Nam,Daniel Sungho Jung,Kyoung Mu Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeHOR introduces text descriptions and appearance cues for 3D human-object reconstruction, addressing limitations of contact reliance and local geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely heavily on physical contact and local geometry, missing non-contact interactions and global context.

Method: TeHOR uses text descriptions for semantic alignment and appearance cues for holistic context.

Result: Achieves accurate, semantically coherent reconstructions with state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: TeHOR effectively addresses key limitations in 3D human-object reconstruction.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of 3D human and object from a single image is an active research area, with pivotal applications in robotics and digital content creation. Despite recent advances, existing approaches suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, their reconstructions rely heavily on physical contact information, which inherently cannot capture non-contact human-object interactions, such as gazing at or pointing toward an object. Second, the reconstruction process is primarily driven by local geometric proximity, neglecting the human and object appearances that provide global context crucial for understanding holistic interactions. To address these issues, we introduce TeHOR, a framework built upon two core designs. First, beyond contact information, our framework leverages text descriptions of human-object interactions to enforce semantic alignment between the 3D reconstruction and its textual cues, enabling reasoning over a wider spectrum of interactions, including non-contact cases. Second, we incorporate appearance cues of the 3D human and object into the alignment process to capture holistic contextual information, thereby ensuring visually plausible reconstructions. As a result, our framework produces accurate and semantically coherent reconstructions, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: BayesFusion-SDF is a probabilistic framework for dense 3D reconstruction from depth observations, offering a CPU-centric solution with systematic uncertainty handling and improved accuracy over TSDF baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional volumetric fusion techniques lack systematic uncertainty handling, while neural implicit methods require high GPU power and lack interpretability. BayesFusion-SDF addresses these gaps.

Method: The framework uses a sparse Gaussian random field for geometry, combining depth observations via heteroscedastic Bayesian formulation solved with sparse linear algebra and preconditioned conjugate gradients.

Result: Tests show superior geometric accuracy over TSDF baselines and useful uncertainty estimates for active sensing.

Conclusion: BayesFusion-SDF provides a clear, efficient, and interpretable alternative to GPU-heavy neural methods, balancing performance and probabilistic transparency.

Abstract: Key part of robotics, augmented reality, and digital inspection is dense 3D reconstruction from depth observations. Traditional volumetric fusion techniques, including truncated signed distance functions (TSDF), enable efficient and deterministic geometry reconstruction; however, they depend on heuristic weighting and fail to transparently convey uncertainty in a systematic way. Recent neural implicit methods, on the other hand, get very high fidelity but usually need a lot of GPU power for optimization and aren't very easy to understand for making decisions later on. This work presents BayesFusion-SDF, a CPU-centric probabilistic signed distance fusion framework that conceptualizes geometry as a sparse Gaussian random field with a defined posterior distribution over voxel distances. First, a rough TSDF reconstruction is used to create an adaptive narrow-band domain. Then, depth observations are combined using a heteroscedastic Bayesian formulation that is solved using sparse linear algebra and preconditioned conjugate gradients. Randomized diagonal estimators are a quick way to get an idea of posterior uncertainty. This makes it possible to extract surfaces and plan the next best view while taking into account uncertainty. Tests on a controlled ablation scene and a CO3D object sequence show that the new method is more accurate geometrically than TSDF baselines and gives useful estimates of uncertainty for active sensing. The proposed formulation provides a clear and easy-to-use alternative to GPU-heavy neural reconstruction methods while still being able to be understood in a probabilistic way and acting in a predictable way.

TL;DR: A training-free method enhances HDR reconstruction using diffusion-based inpainting to recover details in over-exposed regions, integrating with existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail in over-exposed regions due to complete information loss, prompting a need for a robust solution.

Method: Combines text-guided diffusion models with SDEdit refinement and iterative compensation to maintain luminance coherence.

Result: Significant improvements in perceptual quality and quantitative metrics on standard datasets and real-world captures.

Conclusion: The method effectively recovers natural details in challenging scenarios while preserving existing HDR pipeline advantages.

Abstract: Single LDR to HDR reconstruction remains challenging for over-exposed regions where traditional methods often fail due to complete information loss. We present a training-free approach that enhances existing indirect and direct HDR reconstruction methods through diffusion-based inpainting. Our method combines text-guided diffusion models with SDEdit refinement to generate plausible content in over-exposed areas while maintaining consistency across multi-exposure LDR images. Unlike previous approaches requiring extensive training, our method seamlessly integrates with existing HDR reconstruction techniques through an iterative compensation mechanism that ensures luminance coherence across multiple exposures. We demonstrate significant improvements in both perceptual quality and quantitative metrics on standard HDR datasets and in-the-wild captures. Results show that our method effectively recovers natural details in challenging scenarios while preserving the advantages of existing HDR reconstruction pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method combining class-shared and per-image LoRAs in diffusion models to enhance diversity and detail in synthetic images for few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized domains like medical applications face data scarcity, especially for tail classes, leading to biased models. Diffusion models are used to supplement underrepresented data regions.

Method: The approach separates the adapter into a class-shared LoRA for class priors and per-image LoRAs for fine details. Semantic boosting preserves class bounding boxes to expose coherent class semantics. Generated images compose these LoRAs using Dirichlet-distributed coefficients.

Result: The synthesized images are diverse, detail-rich, and align closely with the few-shot real distribution, improving downstream classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively combines diversity and detail in synthetic images, addressing data scarcity in specialized domains.

Abstract: Beyond general recognition tasks, specialized domains including privacy-constrained medical applications and fine-grained settings often encounter data scarcity, especially for tail classes. To obtain less biased and more reliable models under such scarcity, practitioners leverage diffusion models to supplement underrepresented regions of real data. Specifically, recent studies fine-tune pretrained diffusion models with LoRA on few-shot real sets to synthesize additional images. While an image-wise LoRA trained on a single image captures fine-grained details yet offers limited diversity, a class-wise LoRA trained over all shots produces diverse images as it encodes class priors yet tends to overlook fine details. To combine both benefits, we separate the adapter into a class-shared LoRA~$A$ for class priors and per-image LoRAs~$\mathcal{B}$ for image-specific characteristics. To expose coherent class semantics in the shared LoRA~$A$, we propose a semantic boosting by preserving class bounding boxes during training. For generation, we compose $A$ with a mixture of $\mathcal{B}$ using coefficients drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. Across diverse datasets, our synthesized images are both diverse and detail-rich while closely aligning with the few-shot real distribution, yielding robust gains in downstream classification accuracy.

TL;DR: Pose-VLA decouples Vision-Language-Action model training into pre-training for 3D spatial priors and post-training for embodiment alignment, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models suffer from feature collapse and inefficiency due to entangled perception and action supervision, lacking focus on 3D state variations.

Method: Proposes Pose-VLA, using discrete pose tokens for universal representation, with a two-stage pre-training pipeline for spatial grounding and motion alignment.

Result: Achieves 79.5% success on RoboTwin 2.0 and 96.0% on LIBERO, with robust real-world generalization using minimal demonstrations.

Conclusion: Pose-VLA resolves misalignments in VLA models, enhancing efficiency and performance through decoupled training and universal pose tokens.

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often suffer from feature collapse and low training efficiency because they entangle high-level perception with sparse, embodiment-specific action supervision. Since these models typically rely on VLM backbones optimized for Visual Question Answering (VQA), they excel at semantic identification but often overlook subtle 3D state variations that dictate distinct action patterns.
  To resolve these misalignments, we propose Pose-VLA, a decoupled paradigm that separates VLA training into a pre-training phase for extracting universal 3D spatial priors in a unified camera-centric space, and a post-training phase for efficient embodiment alignment within robot-specific action space. By introducing discrete pose tokens as a universal representation, Pose-VLA seamlessly integrates spatial grounding from diverse 3D datasets with geometry-level trajectories from robotic demonstrations. Our framework follows a two-stage pre-training pipeline, establishing fundamental spatial grounding via poses followed by motion alignment through trajectory supervision.
  Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Pose-VLA achieves state-of-the-art results on RoboTwin 2.0 with a 79.5% average success rate and competitive performance on LIBERO at 96.0%. Real-world experiments further showcase robust generalization across diverse objects using only 100 demonstrations per task, validating the efficiency of our pre-training paradigm.

Motivation: Existing deepfake detection models lack reliable reasoning grounded in visual evidence, limiting their trustworthiness and interpretability.

Method: DeepfakeJudge integrates an out-of-distribution benchmark, human-annotated visual reasoning labels, and specialized evaluation models. It uses a bootstrapped generator-evaluator process for scalable supervision and supports pointwise and pairwise evaluation.

Result: The model achieves 96.2% accuracy, 98.9% pairwise agreement with human ratings, and outperforms baselines 30x larger. Users prefer its reasoning 70% of the time for faithfulness and usefulness.

Conclusion: Reasoning fidelity is quantifiable in deepfake detection, and DeepfakeJudge offers scalable, interpretable supervision. All resources are open-sourced.

Abstract: Deepfake detection models often generate natural-language explanations, yet their reasoning is frequently ungrounded in visual evidence, limiting reliability. Existing evaluations measure classification accuracy but overlook reasoning fidelity. We propose DeepfakeJudge, a framework for scalable reasoning supervision and evaluation, that integrates an out-of-distribution benchmark containing recent generative and editing forgeries, a human-annotated subset with visual reasoning labels, and a suite of evaluation models, that specialize in evaluating reasoning rationales without the need for explicit ground truth reasoning rationales. The Judge is optimized through a bootstrapped generator-evaluator process that scales human feedback into structured reasoning supervision and supports both pointwise and pairwise evaluation. On the proposed meta-evaluation benchmark, our reasoning-bootstrapped model achieves an accuracy of 96.2\%, outperforming \texttt{30x} larger baselines. The reasoning judge attains very high correlation with human ratings and 98.9\% percent pairwise agreement on the human-annotated meta-evaluation subset. These results establish reasoning fidelity as a quantifiable dimension of deepfake detection and demonstrate scalable supervision for interpretable deepfake reasoning. Our user study shows that participants preferred the reasonings generated by our framework 70\% of the time, in terms of faithfulness, groundedness, and usefulness, compared to those produced by other models and datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flose is a generative method for 6D pose estimation using conditional flow matching and semantic features, outperforming prior methods by +4.5 Average Recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with object symmetries or lack of local features, motivating a novel approach combining geometric and semantic guidance.

Method: Flose uses conditional flow matching with denoising, integrating semantic features and RANSAC-based registration for robustness.

Result: Validated on five BOP benchmark datasets, Flose improves Average Recall by +4.5 over prior methods.

Conclusion: Flose successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by leveraging semantic guidance and robustness techniques.

Abstract: Existing methods for instance-level 6D pose estimation typically rely on neural networks that either directly regress the pose in $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ or estimate it indirectly via local feature matching. The former struggle with object symmetries, while the latter fail in the absence of distinctive local features. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel formulation of 6D pose estimation as a conditional flow matching problem in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We introduce Flose, a generative method that infers object poses via a denoising process conditioned on local features. While prior approaches based on conditional flow matching perform denoising solely based on geometric guidance, Flose integrates appearance-based semantic features to mitigate ambiguities caused by object symmetries. We further incorporate RANSAC-based registration to handle outliers. We validate Flose on five datasets from the established BOP benchmark. Flose outperforms prior methods with an average improvement of +4.5 Average Recall. Project Website : https://tev-fbk.github.io/Flose/

TL;DR: PMM-Synth is a personalized MRI synthesis framework that generalizes across diverse datasets, outperforming existing methods in missing modality synthesis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing modalities in multi-modal MRI hinder diagnostic completeness. Current models lack generalizability across diverse datasets, limiting practical deployment.

Method: PMM-Synth integrates a Personalized Feature Modulation module, Modality-Consistent Batch Scheduler, and selective supervision loss to adapt to heterogeneous datasets.

Result: PMM-Synth achieves superior PSNR and SSIM scores, preserves anatomical structures better, and supports downstream tasks like tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: PMM-Synth effectively addresses cross-dataset generalization in MRI synthesis, offering potential for reliable diagnosis in real-world missing-modality scenarios.

Abstract: Synthesizing missing modalities in multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is vital for ensuring diagnostic completeness, particularly when full acquisitions are infeasible due to time constraints, motion artifacts, and patient tolerance. Recent unified synthesis models have enabled flexible synthesis tasks by accommodating various input-output configurations. However, their training and evaluation are typically restricted to a single dataset, limiting their generalizability across diverse clinical datasets and impeding practical deployment. To address this limitation, we propose PMM-Synth, a personalized MRI synthesis framework that not only supports various synthesis tasks but also generalizes effectively across heterogeneous datasets. PMM-Synth is jointly trained on multiple multi-modal MRI datasets that differ in modality coverage, disease types, and intensity distributions. It achieves cross-dataset generalization through three core innovations: a Personalized Feature Modulation module that dynamically adapts feature representations based on dataset identifier to mitigate the impact of distributional shifts; a Modality-Consistent Batch Scheduler that facilitates stable and efficient batch training under inconsistent modality conditions; and a selective supervision loss to ensure effective learning when ground truth modalities are partially missing. Evaluated on four clinical multi-modal MRI datasets, PMM-Synth consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both one-to-one and many-to-one synthesis tasks, achieving superior PSNR and SSIM scores. Qualitative results further demonstrate improved preservation of anatomical structures and pathological details. Additionally, downstream tumor segmentation and radiological reporting studies suggest that PMM-Synth holds potential for supporting reliable diagnosis under real-world modality-missing scenarios.

TL;DR: VGGT-MPR is a multimodal place recognition framework using Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer for global retrieval and re-ranking, achieving state-of-the-art performance without costly retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust place recognition is essential for autonomous driving, but existing multimodal methods rely on hand-crafted fusion strategies and heavily parameterized backbones.

Method: VGGT-MPR extracts geometrically-rich embeddings, densifies LiDAR point clouds, and uses a training-free re-ranking mechanism with cross-view keypoint-tracking.

Result: The framework achieves top performance on large-scale benchmarks, handling environmental changes, viewpoint shifts, and occlusions effectively.

Conclusion: VGGT-MPR offers a scalable and efficient solution for multimodal place recognition, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, robust place recognition is critical for global localization and loop closure detection. While inter-modality fusion of camera and LiDAR data in multimodal place recognition (MPR) has shown promise in overcoming the limitations of unimodal counterparts, existing MPR methods basically attend to hand-crafted fusion strategies and heavily parameterized backbones that require costly retraining. To address this, we propose VGGT-MPR, a multimodal place recognition framework that adopts the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) as a unified geometric engine for both global retrieval and re-ranking. In the global retrieval stage, VGGT extracts geometrically-rich visual embeddings through prior depth-aware and point map supervision, and densifies sparse LiDAR point clouds with predicted depth maps to improve structural representation. This enhances the discriminative ability of fused multimodal features and produces global descriptors for fast retrieval. Beyond global retrieval, we design a training-free re-ranking mechanism that exploits VGGT's cross-view keypoint-tracking capability. By combining mask-guided keypoint extraction with confidence-aware correspondence scoring, our proposed re-ranking mechanism effectively refines retrieval results without additional parameter optimization. Extensive experiments on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks and our self-collected data demonstrate that VGGT-MPR achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong robustness to severe environmental changes, viewpoint shifts, and occlusions. Our code and data will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: InfScene-SR is a framework for spatially continuous super-resolution of large, arbitrary scenes, addressing the limitations of standard diffusion-based SR models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion-based SR models struggle with scaling to arbitrary-sized images and produce artifacts due to patch processing.

Method: The paper introduces guided and variance-corrected fusion mechanisms within DDPMs for seamless large-scale SR without retraining.

Result: InfScene-SR effectively reconstructs fine details with high perceptual quality and removes boundary artifacts, improving downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances SR capabilities for large scenes, offering practical benefits for applications like semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to recover high-resolution (HR) details from low-resolution (LR) inputs, a task where Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have recently shown superior performance compared to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based approaches. However, standard diffusion-based SR models, such as SR3, are typically trained on fixed-size patches and struggle to scale to arbitrary-sized images due to memory constraints. Applying these models via independent patch processing leads to visible seams and inconsistent textures across boundaries. In this paper, we propose InfScene-SR, a framework enabling spatially continuous super-resolution for large, arbitrary scenes. We adapt the iterative refinement process of diffusion models with a novel guided and variance-corrected fusion mechanism, allowing for the seamless generation of large-scale high-resolution imagery without retraining. We validate our approach on remote sensing datasets, demonstrating that InfScene-SR not only reconstructs fine details with high perceptual quality but also eliminates boundary artifacts, benefiting downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: RAP is a fast, rendering-free method for predicting primitive importance in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), addressing scalability and efficiency issues of existing rendering-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rendering-based methods for estimating primitive importance in 3DGS are computationally expensive, view-dependent, and lack scalability. RAP aims to overcome these limitations by avoiding rendering-based computations.

Method: RAP predicts primitive importance scores directly from intrinsic Gaussian attributes and local neighborhood statistics using a compact MLP, trained with rendering loss, pruning-aware loss, and significance distribution regularization.

Result: RAP generalizes well to unseen scenes, offers fast computation, and integrates seamlessly into reconstruction, compression, and transmission pipelines.

Conclusion: RAP provides an efficient and scalable solution for primitive importance estimation in 3DGS, enhancing performance and practicality compared to existing methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading technology for high-quality 3D scene reconstruction. However, the iterative refinement and densification process leads to the generation of a large number of primitives, each contributing to the reconstruction to a substantially different extent. Estimating primitive importance is thus crucial, both for removing redundancy during reconstruction and for enabling efficient compression and transmission. Existing methods typically rely on rendering-based analyses, where each primitive is evaluated through its contribution across multiple camera viewpoints. However, such methods are sensitive to the number and selection of views, rely on specialized differentiable rasterizers, and have long calculation times that grow linearly with view count, making them difficult to integrate as plug-and-play modules and limiting scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose RAP, a fast feedforward rendering-free attribute-guided method for efficient importance score prediction in 3DGS. RAP infers primitive significance directly from intrinsic Gaussian attributes and local neighborhood statistics, avoiding rendering-based or visibility-dependent computations. A compact MLP predicts per-primitive importance scores using rendering loss, pruning-aware loss, and significance distribution regularization. After training on a small set of scenes, RAP generalizes effectively to unseen data and can be seamlessly integrated into reconstruction, compression, and transmission pipelines.

TL;DR: A learning-free dataset distillation framework is proposed for efficient multimodal learning, reducing reliance on large-scale training while improving cross-architecture generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal learning relies on costly large-scale datasets, and existing methods struggle with small subsets or require inefficient full-dataset training.

Method: The framework uses CLIP for aligned embeddings, derives prototypes, and synthesizes images with an unCLIP decoder, avoiding joint optimization.

Result: Outperforms optimization-based methods and subset selection, achieving state-of-the-art cross-architecture generalization.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable and efficient alternative for multimodal dataset distillation.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal learning have achieved remarkable success across diverse vision-language tasks. However, such progress heavily relies on large-scale image-text datasets, making training costly and inefficient. Prior efforts in dataset filtering and pruning attempt to mitigate this issue, but still require relatively large subsets to maintain performance and fail under very small subsets. Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative, yet existing multimodal dataset distillation methods require full-dataset training and joint optimization of image pixels and text features, making them architecture-dependent and limiting cross-architecture generalization. To overcome this, we propose a learning-free dataset distillation framework that eliminates the need for large-scale training and optimization while enhancing generalization across architectures. Our method uses CLIP to extract aligned image-text embeddings, obtains prototypes, and employs an unCLIP decoder to synthesize images, enabling efficient and scalable multimodal dataset distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms optimization-based dataset distillation and subset selection methods, achieving state-of-the-art cross-architecture generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates ten deep stereo matching networks for autonomous drone-based tree pruning, identifying BANet-3D as the best performer in quality and RAFT-Stereo for scene understanding, with AnyNet offering near-real-time speed at 1080P.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate real-time depth estimation is critical for autonomous drone-based tree pruning, as small disparity errors lead to noticeable depth mistakes at working distances.

Method: Ten deep stereo matching networks were trained and tested on real tree branch images using the Canterbury Tree Branches dataset, with DEFOM-generated disparity maps as targets. Methods included refinement, 3D convolution, edge-aware attention, and lightweight designs.

Result: BANet-3D achieved the best overall quality (SSIM = 0.883, LPIPS = 0.157), RAFT-Stereo excelled in scene-level understanding (ViTScore = 0.799), and AnyNet reached near-real-time speed (6.99 FPS at 1080P).

Conclusion: The findings guide resolution choices for forestry drone systems, balancing quality and speed, with BANet-3D and RAFT-Stereo as top performers and AnyNet as a practical real-time option.

Abstract: Autonomous drone-based tree pruning needs accurate, real-time depth estimation from stereo cameras. Depth is computed from disparity maps using $Z = f B/d$, so even small disparity errors cause noticeable depth mistakes at working distances. Building on our earlier work that identified DEFOM-Stereo as the best reference disparity generator for vegetation scenes, we present the first study to train and test ten deep stereo matching networks on real tree branch images. We use the Canterbury Tree Branches dataset -- 5,313 stereo pairs from a ZED Mini camera at 1080P and 720P -- with DEFOM-generated disparity maps as training targets. The ten methods cover step-by-step refinement, 3D convolution, edge-aware attention, and lightweight designs. Using perceptual metrics (SSIM, LPIPS, ViTScore) and structural metrics (SIFT/ORB feature matching), we find that BANet-3D produces the best overall quality (SSIM = 0.883, LPIPS = 0.157), while RAFT-Stereo scores highest on scene-level understanding (ViTScore = 0.799). Testing on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Super (16 GB, independently powered) mounted on our drone shows that AnyNet reaches 6.99 FPS at 1080P -- the only near-real-time option -- while BANet-2D gives the best quality-speed balance at 1.21 FPS. We also compare 720P and 1080P processing times to guide resolution choices for forestry drone systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to support free exploration in 3D scenes from a single image, causing distortions and artifacts. One2Scene aims to address this by decomposing the problem into manageable sub-tasks.

Method: The framework uses a panorama generator, a Gaussian Splatting network for 3D scaffold creation, and a novel view generator conditioned on the scaffold. Cross-view consistency is enforced via bidirectional feature fusion.

Result: One2Scene outperforms state-of-the-art methods in panorama depth estimation, 360° reconstruction, and explorable 3D scene generation.

Conclusion: By leveraging geometric priors and explicit 3D scaffolds, One2Scene enables stable and immersive scene exploration from a single image.

Abstract: Generating explorable 3D scenes from a single image is a highly challenging problem in 3D vision. Existing methods struggle to support free exploration, often producing severe geometric distortions and noisy artifacts when the viewpoint moves far from the original perspective. We introduce \textbf{One2Scene}, an effective framework that decomposes this ill-posed problem into three tractable sub-tasks to enable immersive explorable scene generation. We first use a panorama generator to produce anchor views from a single input image as initialization. Then, we lift these 2D anchors into an explicit 3D geometric scaffold via a generalizable, feed-forward Gaussian Splatting network. Instead of treating the panorama as a single image for reconstruction, we project it into multiple sparse anchor views and reformulate the reconstruction task as multi-view stereo matching, which allows us to leverage robust geometric priors learned from large-scale multi-view datasets. A bidirectional feature fusion module is used to enforce cross-view consistency, yielding an efficient and geometrically reliable scaffold. Finally, the scaffold serves as a strong prior for a novel view generator to produce photorealistic and geometrically accurate views at arbitrary cameras. By explicitly conditioning on a 3D-consistent scaffold to perform reconstruction, One2Scene works stably under large camera motions, supporting immersive scene exploration. Extensive experiments show that One2Scene substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in panorama depth estimation, feed-forward 360° reconstruction, and explorable 3D scene generation. Code and models will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TraceVision is a new vision-language model that integrates trajectory-aware spatial understanding, improving interpretability and performance in tasks like captioning and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs lack human-like visual attention and struggle to link descriptions to specific image regions, limiting their interpretability and spatial interaction capabilities.

Method: TraceVision uses a Trajectory-aware Visual Perception module and geometric simplification for bidirectional fusion of visual and trajectory data. It includes a three-stage training pipeline for guided description generation and region localization.

Result: TraceVision achieves state-of-the-art performance in tasks like trajectory-guided captioning and segmentation, enhancing interpretability and cross-frame analysis.

Conclusion: TraceVision sets a foundation for more intuitive and interpretable visual understanding by integrating trajectory-aware spatial features.

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in image understanding and natural language generation. However, current approaches focus predominantly on global image understanding, struggling to simulate human visual attention trajectories and explain associations between descriptions and specific regions. We propose TraceVision, a unified vision-language model integrating trajectory-aware spatial understanding in an end-to-end framework. TraceVision employs a Trajectory-aware Visual Perception (TVP) module for bidirectional fusion of visual features and trajectory information. We design geometric simplification to extract semantic keypoints from raw trajectories and propose a three-stage training pipeline where trajectories guide description generation and region localization. We extend TraceVision to trajectory-guided segmentation and video scene understanding, enabling cross-frame tracking and temporal attention analysis. We construct the Reasoning-based Interactive Localized Narratives (RILN) dataset to enhance logical reasoning and interpretability. Extensive experiments on trajectory-guided captioning, text-guided trajectory prediction, understanding, and segmentation demonstrate that TraceVision achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a foundation for intuitive spatial interaction and interpretable visual understanding.

TL;DR: A two-stage deep learning framework enhances endometrial carcinoma screening by synthesizing high-fidelity ultrasound images from MRI and using lightweight networks for efficient detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of myometrial invasion in endometrial carcinoma is crucial but hindered by low tissue contrast and data scarcity in ultrasound screening.

Method: Developed a structure-guided cross-modal generation network to create diverse ultrasound images from MRI and introduced a lightweight screening network with gradient distillation.

Result: Achieved 99.5% sensitivity, 97.2% specificity, and AUC of 0.987 with minimal computational cost (0.289 GFLOPs), outperforming expert sonographers.

Conclusion: Combining cross-modal synthetic augmentation and knowledge-driven modeling enables expert-level, real-time cancer screening in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Early detection of myometrial invasion is critical for the staging and life-saving management of endometrial carcinoma (EC), a prevalent global malignancy. Transvaginal ultrasound serves as the primary, accessible screening modality in resource-constrained primary care settings; however, its diagnostic reliability is severely hindered by low tissue contrast, high operator dependence, and a pronounced scarcity of positive pathological samples. Existing artificial intelligence solutions struggle to overcome this severe class imbalance and the subtle imaging features of invasion, particularly under the strict computational limits of primary care clinics. Here we present an automated, highly efficient two-stage deep learning framework that resolves both data and computational bottlenecks in EC screening. To mitigate pathological data scarcity, we develop a structure-guided cross-modal generation network that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity ultrasound images from unpaired magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, strictly preserving clinically essential anatomical junctions. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight screening network utilizing gradient distillation, which transfers discriminative knowledge from a high-capacity teacher model to dynamically guide sparse attention towards task-critical regions. Evaluated on a large, multicenter cohort of 7,951 participants, our model achieves a sensitivity of 99.5\%, a specificity of 97.2\%, and an area under the curve of 0.987 at a minimal computational cost (0.289 GFLOPs), substantially outperforming the average diagnostic accuracy of expert sonographers. Our approach demonstrates that combining cross-modal synthetic augmentation with knowledge-driven efficient modeling can democratize expert-level, real-time cancer screening for resource-constrained primary care settings.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of current open-vocabulary methods in industrial settings by proposing a training-free 3D perception pipeline using semantic superpoints and evaluating "IndustrialCLIP" for segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-vocabulary methods using 2D Vision-Language Foundation Models fail to generalize well for industrial objects, prompting the need for improved solutions tailored to industrial environments.

Method: The authors introduce a training-free pipeline that generates masks by merging pre-computed superpoints based on semantic features, avoiding reliance on pre-trained segmentation models. They then evaluate "IndustrialCLIP" for open-vocabulary querying.

Result: Qualitative results show successful segmentation of industrial objects, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free, open-vocabulary 3D perception pipeline effectively addresses the generalization issue of existing methods in industrial settings, showcasing promising results.

Abstract: Autonomous vision applications in production, intralogistics, or manufacturing environments require perception capabilities beyond a small, fixed set of classes. Recent open-vocabulary methods, leveraging 2D Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLFMs), target this task but often rely on class-agnostic segmentation models pre-trained on non-industrial datasets (e.g., household scenes). In this work, we first demonstrate that such models fail to generalize, performing poorly on common industrial objects. Therefore, we propose a training-free, open-vocabulary 3D perception pipeline that overcomes this limitation. Instead of using a pre-trained model to generate instance proposals, our method simply generates masks by merging pre-computed superpoints based on their semantic features. Following, we evaluate the domain-adapted VLFM "IndustrialCLIP" on a representative 3D industrial workshop scene for open-vocabulary querying. Our qualitative results demonstrate successful segmentation of industrial objects.

TL;DR: TextShield-R1 is a reinforcement learning-based MLLM for tampered text detection, using novel training and inference methods, and introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable detection of tampered images due to growing security threats, and the limitations of existing MLLMs in micro-level artifact detection and annotation dependence.

Method: Uses Forensic Continual Pre-training and Group Relative Policy Optimization for training, and OCR Rectification for inference. Introduces the TFR benchmark for evaluation.

Result: TextShield-R1 significantly improves interpretable tampered text detection, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed solution advances the state of the art in tampered text detection and provides a robust benchmark for future research.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of tampered images poses serious security threats, highlighting the urgent need for reliable detection methods. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong potential in analyzing tampered images and generating interpretations. However, they still struggle with identifying micro-level artifacts, exhibit low accuracy in localizing tampered text regions, and heavily rely on expensive annotations for forgery interpretation. To this end, we introduce TextShield-R1, the first reinforcement learning based MLLM solution for tampered text detection and reasoning. Specifically, our approach introduces Forensic Continual Pre-training, an easy-to-hard curriculum that well prepares the MLLM for tampered text detection by harnessing the large-scale cheap data from natural image forensic and OCR tasks. During fine-tuning, we perform Group Relative Policy Optimization with novel reward functions to reduce annotation dependency and improve reasoning capabilities. At inference time, we enhance localization accuracy via OCR Rectification, a method that leverages the MLLM's strong text recognition abilities to refine its predictions. Furthermore, to support rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Text Forensics Reasoning (TFR) benchmark, comprising over 45k real and tampered images across 16 languages, 10 tampering techniques, and diverse domains. Rich reasoning-style annotations are included, allowing for comprehensive assessment. Our TFR benchmark simultaneously addresses seven major limitations of existing benchmarks and enables robust evaluation under cross-style, cross-method, and cross-language conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TextShield-R1 significantly advances the state of the art in interpretable tampered text detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3S-Net, a multimodal fusion network, improves ultra-short-term PV power forecasting by capturing fine-grained cloud features and complex spatiotemporal coupling, reducing error by 6.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of shallow feature concatenation and binary cloud segmentation in PV forecasting amid solar intermittency and cloud variability.

Method: Uses multi-scale partial channel selection, FFT-based time-frequency analysis, and a cross-modal Mamba module with dynamic C-matrix swapping.

Result: Achieves a 6.2% reduction in mean absolute error for 10-minute forecasts on a new dataset.

Conclusion: M3S-Net offers a robust solution for high-precision PV forecasting through deep multimodal fusion.

Abstract: The inherent intermittency and high-frequency variability of solar irradiance, particularly during rapid cloud advection, present significant stability challenges to high-penetration photovoltaic grids. Although multimodal forecasting has emerged as a viable mitigation strategy, existing architectures predominantly rely on shallow feature concatenation and binary cloud segmentation, thereby failing to capture the fine-grained optical features of clouds and the complex spatiotemporal coupling between visual and meteorological modalities. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes M3S-Net, a novel multimodal feature fusion network based on multi-scale data for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting. First, a multi-scale partial channel selection network leverages partial convolutions to explicitly isolate the boundary features of optically thin clouds, effectively transcending the precision limitations of coarse-grained binary masking. Second, a multi-scale sequence to image analysis network employs Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based time-frequency representation to disentangle the complex periodicity of meteorological data across varying time horizons. Crucially, the model incorporates a cross-modal Mamba interaction module featuring a novel dynamic C-matrix swapping mechanism. By exchanging state-space parameters between visual and temporal streams, this design conditions the state evolution of one modality on the context of the other, enabling deep structural coupling with linear computational complexity, thus overcoming the limitations of shallow concatenation. Experimental validation on the newly constructed fine-grained PV power dataset demonstrates that M3S-Net achieves a mean absolute error reduction of 6.2% in 10-minute forecasts compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Addressing class imbalance in skin lesion datasets via synthetic image generation and self-supervised pretraining, followed by knowledge distillation for lightweight deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in skin lesion datasets biases deep learning models, necessitating solutions like synthetic data generation and efficient model deployment for clinical use.

Method: Use class-conditioned diffusion models to generate synthetic images, self-supervised MAE pretraining for robust feature learning, and knowledge distillation for lightweight ViT models.

Result: Improved classification performance and efficient on-device inference in clinical settings.

Conclusion: Combining synthetic data, MAE pretraining, and distillation enhances model robustness and practicality for skin lesion classification.

Abstract: Skin lesion classification datasets often suffer from severe class imbalance, with malignant cases significantly underrepresented, leading to biased decision boundaries during deep learning training. We address this challenge using class-conditioned diffusion models to generate synthetic dermatological images, followed by self-supervised MAE pretraining to enable huge ViT models to learn robust, domain-relevant features. To support deployment in practical clinical settings, where lightweight models are required, we apply knowledge distillation to transfer these representations to a smaller ViT student suitable for mobile devices. Our results show that MAE pretraining on synthetic data, combined with distillation, improves classification performance while enabling efficient on-device inference for practical clinical use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models degrade in performance due to variability in image acquisition and domain-specific visual characteristics, especially in clinical settings.

Method: An adaptation strategy based on visual meta-domains transfers visual representations from larger dermoscopic datasets to clinical image domains.

Conclusion: Domain-aware training is crucial for creating robust and deployable dermatological image analysis systems.

Abstract: Deep learning models for dermatological image analysis remain sensitive to acquisition variability and domain-specific visual characteristics, leading to performance degradation when deployed in clinical settings. We investigate how visual artifacts and domain shifts affect deep learning-based skin lesion classification. We propose an adaptation strategy, grounded in the idea of visual meta-domains, that transfers visual representations from larger dermoscopic datasets into clinical image domains, thereby improving generalization robustness. Experiments across multiple dermatology datasets show consistent gains in classification performance and reduced gaps between dermoscopic and clinical images. These results emphasize the importance of domain-aware training for deployable systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dual-teacher contrastive distillation framework for multispectral imagery to improve knowledge transfer across Earth Observation (EO) modalities, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EO pretraining methods like masked image modeling lack control over global semantic structure, limiting effective knowledge transfer across diverse EO sensors and modalities.

Method: A dual-teacher contrastive distillation framework is introduced, combining a multispectral teacher with an optical vision foundation model teacher for cross-modal representation learning.

Result: The model outperforms existing methods, improving semantic segmentation by 3.64%, change detection by 1.2%, and classification by 1.31% on average.

Conclusion: Contrastive distillation is an efficient and scalable approach for cross-modal EO representation learning, maintaining performance across optical and multispectral data.

Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth Observation (EO), yet the diversity of EO sensors and modalities makes a single universal model unrealistic. Multiple specialized EO foundation models (EOFMs) will likely coexist, making efficient knowledge transfer across modalities essential. Most existing EO pretraining relies on masked image modeling, which emphasizes local reconstruction but provides limited control over global semantic structure. To address this, we propose a dual-teacher contrastive distillation framework for multispectral imagery that aligns the student's pretraining objective with the contrastive self-distillation paradigm of modern optical vision foundation models (VFMs). Our approach combines a multispectral teacher with an optical VFM teacher, enabling coherent cross-modal representation learning. Experiments across diverse optical and multispectral benchmarks show that our model adapts to multispectral data without compromising performance on optical-only inputs, achieving state-of-the-art results in both settings, with an average improvement of 3.64 percentage points in semantic segmentation, 1.2 in change detection, and 1.31 in classification tasks. This demonstrates that contrastive distillation provides a principled and efficient approach to scalable representation learning across heterogeneous EO data sources. Code: Coming soon.

TL;DR: ApET is a visual token compression framework for Vision-Language Models, eliminating attention dependencies to improve efficiency and compatibility with FlashAttention, achieving high performance retention and significant token reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency caused by redundant visual tokens in VLMs, avoiding attention-based methods that introduce bias and lack compatibility with efficient attention kernels.

Method: Proposes ApET, which uses linear approximation and reconstruction error to compress visual tokens without attention, integrating seamlessly with FlashAttention.

Result: Retains 95.2% performance on image tasks and 100.4% on video tasks while reducing tokens by 88.9% and 87.5%, respectively.

Conclusion: ApET offers a practical, attention-free solution for efficient VLM deployment without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal understanding capabilities, yet the redundant visual tokens incur prohibitive computational overhead and degrade inference efficiency. Prior studies typically relies on [CLS] attention or text-vision cross-attention to identify and discard redundant visual tokens. Despite promising results, such solutions are prone to introduce positional bias and, more critically, are incompatible with efficient attention kernels such as FlashAttention, limiting their practical deployment for VLM acceleration. In this paper, we step away from attention dependencies and revisit visual token compression from an information-theoretic perspective, aiming to maximally preserve visual information without any attention involvement. We present ApET, an Approximation-Error guided Token compression framework. ApET first reconstructs the original visual tokens with a small set of basis tokens via linear approximation, then leverages the approximation error to identify and drop the least informative tokens. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that ApET retains 95.2% of the original performance on image-understanding tasks and even attains 100.4% on video-understanding tasks, while compressing the token budgets by 88.9% and 87.5%, respectively. Thanks to its attention-free design, ApET seamlessly integrates with FlashAttention, enabling further inference acceleration and making VLM deployment more practical.

Motivation: Address forgetting and inconsistent feature alignment in continual generalized category discovery.

Result: Outperforms Happy by reducing forgetting by 16.1% and boosting novel class discovery by 3.2%.

Conclusion: GOAL is a robust solution for long-horizon continual discovery.

Abstract: Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD) requires identifying novel classes from unlabeled data while retaining knowledge of known classes over time. Existing methods typically update classifier weights dynamically, resulting in forgetting and inconsistent feature alignment. We propose GOAL, a unified framework that introduces a fixed Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) classifier to impose a consistent geometric structure throughout learning. GOAL conducts supervised alignment for labeled samples and confidence-guided alignment for novel samples, enabling stable integration of new classes without disrupting old ones. Experiments on four benchmarks show that GOAL outperforms the prior method Happy, reducing forgetting by 16.1% and boosting novel class discovery by 3.2%, establishing a strong solution for long-horizon continual discovery.

TL;DR: BigMaQ introduces a large-scale dataset of rhesus macaques' 3D motion and animation, improving action recognition accuracy by integrating detailed 3D pose descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose descriptions for non-human primates lack detail, limiting the understanding of action dynamics.

Method: The dataset includes 750 scenes with subject-specific textured avatars, derived from a macaque template mesh.

Result: Including pose descriptors improves mean average precision (mAP) significantly.

Conclusion: BigMaQ advances animal action recognition by integrating dynamic 3D pose-shape representations and serves as a resource for studying non-human primate behavior.

Abstract: The recognition of dynamic and social behavior in animals is fundamental for advancing ethology, ecology, medicine and neuroscience. Recent progress in deep learning has enabled automated behavior recognition from video, yet an accurate reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3D) pose and shape has not been integrated into this process. Especially for non-human primates, mesh-based tracking efforts lag behind those for other species, leaving pose descriptions restricted to sparse keypoints that are unable to fully capture the richness of action dynamics. To address this gap, we introduce the $\textbf{Big Ma}$ca$\textbf{Q}$ue 3D Motion and Animation Dataset ($\texttt{BigMaQ}$), a large-scale dataset comprising more than 750 scenes of interacting rhesus macaques with detailed 3D pose descriptions. Extending previous surface-based animal tracking methods, we construct subject-specific textured avatars by adapting a high-quality macaque template mesh to individual monkeys. This allows us to provide pose descriptions that are more accurate than previous state-of-the-art surface-based animal tracking methods. From the original dataset, we derive BigMaQ500, an action recognition benchmark that links surface-based pose vectors to single frames across multiple individual monkeys. By pairing features extracted from established image and video encoders with and without our pose descriptors, we demonstrate substantial improvements in mean average precision (mAP) when pose information is included. With these contributions, $\texttt{BigMaQ}$ establishes the first dataset that both integrates dynamic 3D pose-shape representations into the learning task of animal action recognition and provides a rich resource to advance the study of visual appearance, posture, and social interaction in non-human primates. The code and data are publicly available at https://martinivis.github.io/BigMaQ/ .

TL;DR: MaSoN is an unsupervised change detection framework that synthesizes diverse changes in latent feature space, improving generalization and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UCD methods rely on predefined assumptions about change types, limiting their generalization. MaSoN addresses this by dynamically generating diverse changes aligned with target data.

Method: MaSoN synthesizes changes directly in latent feature space using target data statistics, enabling data-driven variation and adaptability to new modalities like SAR.

Result: MaSoN outperforms existing methods, improving the average F1 score by 14.1 percentage points across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: MaSoN offers a flexible and effective solution for UCD, demonstrating strong generalization and performance across diverse change types.

Abstract: Unsupervised change detection (UCD) in remote sensing aims to localise semantic changes between two images of the same region without relying on labelled data during training. Most recent approaches rely either on frozen foundation models in a training-free manner or on training with synthetic changes generated in pixel space. Both strategies inherently rely on predefined assumptions about change types, typically introduced through handcrafted rules, external datasets, or auxiliary generative models. Due to these assumptions, such methods fail to generalise beyond a few change types, limiting their real-world usage, especially in rare or complex scenarios. To address this, we propose MaSoN (Make Some Noise), an end-to-end UCD framework that synthesises diverse changes directly in the latent feature space during training. It generates changes that are dynamically estimated using feature statistics of target data, enabling diverse yet data-driven variation aligned with the target domain. It also easily extends to new modalities, such as SAR. MaSoN generalises strongly across diverse change types and achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks, improving the average F1 score by 14.1 percentage points.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the FemaleSaanenGoat dataset and SaanenGoat model for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction and automated body measurement of Saanen goats, improving accuracy in assessing lactation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D body measurement of Saanen goats is essential for assessing milk production potential, but existing methods lack goat-specific data. The study aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors create the FemaleSaanenGoat dataset with synchronized eight-view RGBD videos of 55 goats. They use multi-view DynamicFusion to fuse noisy point clouds into high-fidelity 3D scans and develop the SaanenGoat parametric 3D shape model with a refined template and shape space.

Result: The SaanenGoat model enables high-precision 3D reconstruction from single-view RGBD input and automated measurement of six critical body dimensions, demonstrating superior accuracy in experiments.

Conclusion: The study presents a novel paradigm for large-scale 3D vision applications in precision livestock farming, offering precise tools for assessing goat lactation performance.

Abstract: The lactation performance of Saanen dairy goats, renowned for their high milk yield, is intrinsically linked to their body size, making accurate 3D body measurement essential for assessing milk production potential, yet existing reconstruction methods lack goat-specific authentic 3D data. To address this limitation, we establish the FemaleSaanenGoat dataset containing synchronized eight-view RGBD videos of 55 female Saanen goats (6-18 months). Using multi-view DynamicFusion, we fuse noisy, non-rigid point cloud sequences into high-fidelity 3D scans, overcoming challenges from irregular surfaces and rapid movement. Based on these scans, we develop SaanenGoat, a parametric 3D shape model specifically designed for female Saanen goats. This model features a refined template with 41 skeletal joints and enhanced udder representation, registered with our scan data. A comprehensive shape space constructed from 48 goats enables precise representation of diverse individual variations. With the help of SaanenGoat model, we get high-precision 3D reconstruction from single-view RGBD input, and achieve automated measurement of six critical body dimensions: body length, height, chest width, chest girth, hip width, and hip height. Experimental results demonstrate the superior accuracy of our method in both 3D reconstruction and body measurement, presenting a novel paradigm for large-scale 3D vision applications in precision livestock farming.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with identity preservation and expression accuracy due to sparse or low-rank representations.

Method: Introduces a personalized head representation and an expression transfer module, combined with a diffusion transformer-based generator.

Result: Outperforms previous models in identity preservation, expression accuracy, and temporal stability.

Conclusion: The method advances cinematic portrait video generation by capturing fine-grained details and complex motion effectively.

Abstract: While diffusion models have shown great potential in portrait generation, generating expressive, coherent, and controllable cinematic portrait videos remains a significant challenge. Existing intermediate signals for portrait generation, such as 2D landmarks and parametric models, have limited disentanglement capabilities and cannot express personalized details due to their sparse or low-rank representation. Therefore, existing methods based on these models struggle to accurately preserve subject identity and expressions, hindering the generation of highly expressive portrait videos. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-fidelity personalized head representation that more effectively disentangles expression and identity. This representation captures both static, subject-specific global geometry and dynamic, expression-related details. Furthermore, we introduce an expression transfer module to achieve personalized transfer of head pose and expression details between different identities. We use this sophisticated and highly expressive head model as a conditional signal to train a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based generator to synthesize richly detailed portrait videos. Extensive experiments on self- and cross-reenactment tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous models in terms of identity preservation, expression accuracy, and temporal stability, particularly in capturing fine-grained details of complex motion.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel selection strategy for contrastive learning in medical images, using disease severity labels derived from an anomaly detection algorithm to improve biomarker classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional contrastive learning methods in medical images may distort critical biomarkers due to arbitrary augmentations. Instead, selecting samples based on disease severity characteristics is proposed.

Method: Disease severity labels are generated for unlabeled OCT scans using gradient responses from an anomaly detection algorithm. These labels train a supervised contrastive learning setup.

Result: The method improves biomarker classification accuracy by up to 6% compared to self-supervised baselines for Diabetic Retinopathy indicators.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy effectively leverages disease severity labels for contrastive learning, enhancing biomarker classification in medical imaging.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel selection strategy for contrastive learning for medical images. On natural images, contrastive learning uses augmentations to select positive and negative pairs for the contrastive loss. However, in the medical domain, arbitrary augmentations have the potential to distort small localized regions that contain the biomarkers we are interested in detecting. A more intuitive approach is to select samples with similar disease severity characteristics, since these samples are more likely to have similar structures related to the progression of a disease. To enable this, we introduce a method that generates disease severity labels for unlabeled OCT scans on the basis of gradient responses from an anomaly detection algorithm. These labels are used to train a supervised contrastive learning setup to improve biomarker classification accuracy by as much as 6% above self-supervised baselines for key indicators of Diabetic Retinopathy.

*Krzysztof Adamkiewicz,Brian Moser,Stanislav Frolov,Tobias Christian Nauen,Federico Raue,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Newer text-to-image (T2I) models, despite improved visual quality and prompt adherence, perform worse as synthetic data generators for training classifiers, revealing a decline in diversity and label alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether advancements in T2I diffusion models translate to their effectiveness as synthetic data generators for training classifiers.

Method: Generate synthetic datasets using state-of-the-art T2I models (2022-2025), train classifiers on this synthetic data, and test them on real data.

Result: Despite improved visual fidelity, newer T2I models produce synthetic data that leads to declining classifier accuracy on real test data due to reduced diversity and label-image alignment.

Conclusion: Progress in generative realism does not equate to progress in data realism, challenging assumptions about T2I models' reliability as training data sources.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models produce visually stunning images and demonstrate excellent prompt following. But do they perform well as synthetic vision data generators? In this work, we revisit the promise of synthetic data as a scalable substitute for real training sets and uncover a surprising performance regression. We generate large-scale synthetic datasets using state-of-the-art T2I models released between 2022 and 2025, train standard classifiers solely on this synthetic data, and evaluate them on real test data. Despite observable advances in visual fidelity and prompt adherence, classification accuracy on real test data consistently declines with newer T2I models as training data generators. Our analysis reveals a hidden trend: These models collapse to a narrow, aesthetic-centric distribution that undermines diversity and label-image alignment. Overall, our findings challenge a growing assumption in vision research, namely that progress in generative realism implies progress in data realism. We thus highlight an urgent need to rethink the capabilities of modern T2I models as reliable training data generators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of intra-modality alignment in existing GCD methods to improve representation learning for open-set recognition.

Method: Multi-modal representation learning via Semi-Supervised Rate Reduction, emphasizing intra-modality alignment and integrating Vision Language Models (VLMs).

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on generic and fine-grained benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SSR$^2$-GCD effectively improves GCD tasks by leveraging intra-modality alignment and VLMs.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and unknown categories, with only partial labels given for the known categories, posing a challenging open-set recognition problem. State-of-the-art approaches for GCD task are usually built on multi-modality representation learning, which is heavily dependent upon inter-modality alignment. However, few of them cast a proper intra-modality alignment to generate a desired underlying structure of representation distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective multi-modal representation learning framework for GCD via Semi-Supervised Rate Reduction, called SSR$^2$-GCD, to learn cross-modality representations with desired structural properties based on emphasizing to properly align intra-modality relationships. Moreover, to boost knowledge transfer, we integrate prompt candidates by leveraging the inter-modal alignment offered by Vision Language Models. We conduct extensive experiments on generic and fine-grained benchmark datasets demonstrating superior performance of our approach.

*Yixin Yang,Bojian Wu,Yang Zhou,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Enhanced Gaussian Splatting improves 3DGS by modeling specular effects and using error-driven compensation, outperforming NeRF methods in performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS's spherical harmonics limit its ability to separate diffuse and specular reflections, hindering accurate representation of complex reflections.

Method: Proposes enhanced Gaussian kernels for specular effects and error-driven compensation, starting with 2D Gaussian initialization and optimizing kernels.

Result: Outperforms NeRF methods in rendering performance and achieves greater parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: The enhanced Gaussian Splatting method effectively addresses limitations of 3DGS and improves rendering quality.

Abstract: Due to the real-time rendering performance, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as the leading method for radiance field reconstruction. However, its reliance on spherical harmonics for color encoding inherently limits its ability to separate diffuse and specular components, making it challenging to accurately represent complex reflections. To address this, we propose a novel enhanced Gaussian kernel that explicitly models specular effects through view-dependent opacity. Meanwhile, we introduce an error-driven compensation strategy to improve rendering quality in existing 3DGS scenes. Our method begins with 2D Gaussian initialization and then adaptively inserts and optimizes enhanced Gaussian kernels, ultimately producing an augmented radiance field. Experiments demonstrate that our method not only surpasses state-of-the-art NeRF methods in rendering performance but also achieves greater parameter efficiency.

### [186] [Learning Positive-Incentive Point Sampling in Neural Implicit Fields for Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19937)
*Yifei Shi,Boyan Wan,Xin Xu,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method combining an SO(3)-equivariant convolutional implicit network and PIPS strategy to improve neural implicit fields for 3D object pose estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural implicit fields struggle with predicting canonical coordinates for unobserved regions due to lack of direct signals, leading to high uncertainty and inaccurate estimations.

Method: Proposes an SO(3)-equivariant convolutional implicit network for estimating point-level attributes with SO(3)-equivariance and a PIPS strategy for dynamic point sampling.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on three pose estimation datasets, especially in challenging scenarios like unseen poses, high occlusion, novel geometry, and noise.

Conclusion: The combined approach enhances accuracy and training efficiency, addressing key limitations in neural implicit fields for pose estimation.

Abstract: Learning neural implicit fields of 3D shapes is a rapidly emerging field that enables shape representation at arbitrary resolutions. Due to the flexibility, neural implicit fields have succeeded in many research areas, including shape reconstruction, novel view image synthesis, and more recently, object pose estimation. Neural implicit fields enable learning dense correspondences between the camera space and the object's canonical space-including unobserved regions in camera space-significantly boosting object pose estimation performance in challenging scenarios like highly occluded objects and novel shapes. Despite progress, predicting canonical coordinates for unobserved camera-space regions remains challenging due to the lack of direct observational signals. This necessitates heavy reliance on the model's generalization ability, resulting in high uncertainty. Consequently, densely sampling points across the entire camera space may yield inaccurate estimations that hinder the learning process and compromise performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose a method combining an SO(3)-equivariant convolutional implicit network and a positive-incentive point sampling (PIPS) strategy. The SO(3)-equivariant convolutional implicit network estimates point-level attributes with SO(3)-equivariance at arbitrary query locations, demonstrating superior performance compared to most existing baselines. The PIPS strategy dynamically determines sampling locations based on the input, thereby boosting the network's accuracy and training efficiency. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on three pose estimation datasets. Notably, it demonstrates significant improvements in challenging scenarios, such as objects captured with unseen pose, high occlusion, novel geometry, and severe noise.

*Tianyu Wang,Zhiyuan Ma,Qian Wang,Xinyi Zhang,Xinwei Long,Bowen Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-RIG is a Reinforcement Learning framework addressing spatial reasoning issues in image generation by using a Generate-Reflect-Edit paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image generation models lack accurate spatial reasoning, leading to structurally flawed images.

Method: Proposes RL-RIG with Diffuser, Checker, Actor, and Inverse Diffuser components, trained using Reflection-GRPO for better spatial accuracy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models by 11% in spatial reasoning, evaluated using Scene Graph IoU and VLM-as-a-Judge.

Conclusion: RL-RIG effectively enhances spatial reasoning and structural integrity in image generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image generation have achieved impressive results in producing high-quality images. However, existing image generation models still generally struggle with a spatial reasoning dilemma, lacking the ability to accurately capture fine-grained spatial relationships from the prompt and correctly generate scenes with structural integrity. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose RL-RIG, a Reinforcement Learning framework for Reflection-based Image Generation. Our architecture comprises four primary components: Diffuser, Checker, Actor, and Inverse Diffuser, following a Generate-Reflect-Edit paradigm to spark the Chain of Thought reasoning ability in image generation for addressing the dilemma. To equip the model with better intuition over generation trajectories, we further develop Reflection-GRPO to train the VLM Actor for edit prompts and the Image Editor for better image quality under a given prompt, respectively. Unlike traditional approaches that solely produce visually stunning yet structurally unreasonable content, our evaluation metrics prioritize spatial accuracy, utilizing Scene Graph IoU and employing a VLM-as-a-Judge strategy to assess the spatial consistency of generated images on LAION-SG dataset. Experimental results show that RL-RIG outperforms existing state-of-the-art open-source models by up to 11% in terms of controllable and precise spatial reasoning in image generation.

TL;DR: A curated image dataset is introduced to aid automated identification of Ichneumonoidea parasitoid wasps, addressing taxonomic challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biodiversity monitoring and agricultural management require accurate taxonomic identification, especially for cryptic and diverse groups like Ichneumonoidea.

Method: A dataset of 3,556 high-resolution images, including annotated subsets, is presented to train computer vision models.

Result: The dataset includes multi-class annotations (body, wing venation, scale bars) for 1,739 images, enhancing model robustness.

Conclusion: This resource lays groundwork for developing automated identification systems for Ichneumonoidea and related families.

Abstract: Accurate taxonomic identification is the cornerstone of biodiversity monitoring and agricultural management, particularly for the hyper-diverse superfamily Ichneumonoidea. Comprising the families Ichneumonidae and Braconidae, these parasitoid wasps are ecologically critical for regulating insect populations, yet they remain one of the most taxonomically challenging groups due to their cryptic morphology and vast number of undescribed species. To address the scarcity of robust digital resources for these key groups, we present a curated image dataset designed to advance automated identification systems. The dataset contains 3,556 high-resolution images, primarily focused on Neotropical Ichneumonidae and Braconidae, while also including supplementary families such as Andrenidae, Apidae, Bethylidae, Chrysididae, Colletidae, Halictidae, Megachilidae, Pompilidae, and Vespidae to improve model robustness. Crucially, a subset of 1,739 images is annotated in COCO format, featuring multi-class bounding boxes for the full insect body, wing venation, and scale bars. This resource provides a foundation for developing computer vision models capable of identifying these families.

*Christof Leitgeb,Thomas Puchleitner,Max Peter Ronecker,Daniel Watzenig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D projection method for Radar tensors is proposed, reducing data size by 91.9% while preserving features. The lightweight RADE-Net model improves perception performance, outperforming baseline and Lidar in adverse weather.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar is robust in adverse weather but suffers from data size and information loss in sparse representations. Deep learning can enhance feature extraction from Radar data.

Method: Proposes a 3D projection method for 4D RADE tensors and introduces RADE-Net, a model with spatial/channel-attention and decoupled detection heads for efficient Radar-based perception.

Result: Achieves 16.7% improvement over baseline, 6.5% over Radar-only models, and outperforms Lidar in adverse weather on the K-Radar dataset.

Conclusion: The method and model effectively leverage Radar data for robust perception, especially in challenging weather, with significant performance gains.

Abstract: Automotive perception systems are obligated to meet high requirements. While optical sensors such as Camera and Lidar struggle in adverse weather conditions, Radar provides a more robust perception performance, effectively penetrating fog, rain, and snow. Since full Radar tensors have large data sizes and very few datasets provide them, most Radar-based approaches work with sparse point clouds or 2D projections, which can result in information loss. Additionally, deep learning methods show potential to extract richer and more dense features from low level Radar data and therefore significantly increase the perception performance. Therefore, we propose a 3D projection method for fast-Fourier-transformed 4D Range-Azimuth-Doppler-Elevation (RADE) tensors. Our method preserves rich Doppler and Elevation features while reducing the required data size for a single frame by 91.9% compared to a full tensor, thus achieving higher training and inference speed as well as lower model complexity. We introduce RADE-Net, a lightweight model tailored to 3D projections of the RADE tensor. The backbone enables exploitation of low-level and high-level cues of Radar tensors with spatial and channel-attention. The decoupled detection heads predict object center-points directly in the Range-Azimuth domain and regress rotated 3D bounding boxes from rich feature maps in the cartesian scene. We evaluate the model on scenes with multiple different road users and under various weather conditions on the large-scale K-Radar dataset and achieve a 16.7% improvement compared to their baseline, as well as 6.5% improvement over current Radar-only models. Additionally, we outperform several Lidar approaches in scenarios with adverse weather conditions. The code is available under https://github.com/chr-is-tof/RADE-Net.

*Louis Fabrice Tshimanga,Andrea Zanola,Federico Del Pup,Manfredo Atzori*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Token-UNet integrates TokenLearner and TokenFuser into UNets for efficient 3D segmentation, reducing computational demands while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face computational challenges in medical imaging due to quadratic scaling with tokens. Token-UNet aims to balance efficiency and performance.

Method: Combines convolutional encoders with TokenLearner to pool tokens from feature maps, reducing memory and computation without sacrificing accuracy.

Result: Token-UNet reduces memory by 67%, computation by 90%, and parameters by 65% versus SwinUNETR, achieving higher Dice scores (87.21%).

Conclusion: Token-UNet enables efficient 3D segmentation in resource-limited settings, benefiting research and applications in medical imaging.

Abstract: We present Token-UNet, adopting the TokenLearner and TokenFuser modules to encase Transformers into UNets.
  While Transformers have enabled global interactions among input elements in medical imaging, current computational challenges hinder their deployment on common hardware. Models like (Swin)UNETR adapt the UNet architecture by incorporating (Swin)Transformer encoders, which process tokens that each represent small subvolumes ($8^3$ voxels) of the input.
  The Transformer attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which is tied to the cubic scaling of 3D input resolution.
  This work reconsiders the role of convolution and attention, introducing Token-UNets, a family of 3D segmentation models that can operate in constrained computational environments and time frames.
  To mitigate computational demands, our approach maintains the convolutional encoder of UNet-like models, and applies TokenLearner to 3D feature maps. This module pools a preset number of tokens from local and global structures.
  Our results show this tokenization effectively encodes task-relevant information, yielding naturally interpretable attention maps. The memory footprint, computation times at inference, and parameter counts of our heaviest model are reduced to 33\%, 10\%, and 35\% of the SwinUNETR values, with better average performance (86.75\% $\pm 0.19\%$ Dice score for SwinUNETR vs our 87.21\% $\pm 0.35\%$).
  This work opens the way to more efficient trainings in contexts with limited computational resources, such as 3D medical imaging. Easing model optimization, fine-tuning, and transfer-learning in limited hardware settings can accelerate and diversify the development of approaches, for the benefit of the research community.

*Yeonsung Kim,Junggeun Do,Seunguk Do,Sangmin Kim,Jaesik Park,Jay-Yoon Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEAL-pose is a data-driven framework that uses a learnable loss-net to train a pose-net for 3D human pose estimation, improving structural plausibility and reducing errors without manual priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised losses in 3D HPE fail to capture joint dependencies, and manual priors are inflexible and non-differentiable.

Method: SEAL-pose employs a joint-graph-based loss-net to learn structural dependencies from data, enhancing pose-net training.

Result: SEAL-pose reduces per-joint errors and outperforms models with explicit constraints across benchmarks and backbones.

Conclusion: SEAL-pose effectively improves pose estimation by learning structural dependencies, demonstrating robustness in diverse settings.

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation (HPE) is characterized by intricate local and global dependencies among joints. Conventional supervised losses are limited in capturing these correlations because they treat each joint independently. Previous studies have attempted to promote structural consistency through manually designed priors or rule-based constraints; however, these approaches typically require manual specification and are often non-differentiable, limiting their use as end-to-end training objectives. We propose SEAL-pose, a data-driven framework in which a learnable loss-net trains a pose-net by evaluating structural plausibility. Rather than relying on hand-crafted priors, our joint-graph-based design enables the loss-net to learn complex structural dependencies directly from data. Extensive experiments on three 3D HPE benchmarks with eight backbones show that SEAL-pose reduces per-joint errors and improves pose plausibility compared with the corresponding backbones across all settings. Beyond improving each backbone, SEAL-pose also outperforms models with explicit structural constraints, despite not enforcing any such constraints. Finally, we analyze the relationship between the loss-net and structural consistency, and evaluate SEAL-pose in cross-dataset and in-the-wild settings.

### [192] [Closing the gap in multimodal medical representation alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20046)
*Eleonora Grassucci,Giordano Cicchetti,Danilo Comminiello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-based contrastive losses cause modality gaps in complex settings like the medical domain. This work identifies and addresses the gap with a modality-agnostic framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The modality gap negatively impacts semantic alignment in multimodal learning, especially in complex settings like medical data.

Method: A modality-agnostic framework is proposed to close the modality gap, enhancing alignment between radiology images and clinical text.

Result: Improved cross-modal retrieval and image captioning by ensuring better alignment of semantically related representations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates the modality gap in medical multimodal alignment.

Abstract: In multimodal learning, CLIP has emerged as the de-facto approach for mapping different modalities into a shared latent space by bringing semantically similar representations closer while pushing apart dissimilar ones. However, CLIP-based contrastive losses exhibit unintended behaviors that negatively impact true semantic alignment, leading to sparse and fragmented latent spaces. This phenomenon, known as the modality gap, has been partially mitigated for standard text and image pairs but remains unknown and unresolved in more complex multimodal settings, such as the medical domain. In this work, we study this phenomenon in the latter case, revealing that the modality gap is present also in medical alignment, and we propose a modality-agnostic framework that closes this gap, ensuring that semantically related representations are more aligned, regardless of their source modality. Our method enhances alignment between radiology images and clinical text, improving cross-modal retrieval and image captioning.

TL;DR: HeatPrompt is a zero-shot vision-language framework using satellite images and GIS data to estimate building heat demand, improving accuracy significantly over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many municipalities lack detailed building-level data for heat-demand mapping, hindering decarbonization efforts.

Method: HeatPrompt leverages pretrained VLMs with domain-specific prompts to extract visual attributes from satellite images, combined with GIS data, and uses an MLP regressor for estimation.

Result: The model achieves a 93.7% R2 uplift and reduces MAE by 30% compared to baseline, with qualitative alignment of high-impact tokens to high-demand zones.

Conclusion: HeatPrompt provides a lightweight, effective solution for heat-demand mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting decarbonization goals.

Abstract: Accurate heat-demand maps play a crucial role in decarbonizing space heating, yet most municipalities lack detailed building-level data needed to calculate them. We introduce HeatPrompt, a zero-shot vision-language energy modeling framework that estimates annual heat demand using semantic features extracted from satellite images, basic Geographic Information System (GIS), and building-level features. We feed pretrained Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) with a domain-specific prompt to act as an energy planner and extract the visual attributes such as roof age, building density, etc, from the RGB satellite image that correspond to the thermal load. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor trained on these captions shows an $R^2$ uplift of 93.7% and shrinks the mean absolute error (MAE) by 30% compared to the baseline model. Qualitative analysis shows that high-impact tokens align with high-demand zones, offering lightweight support for heat planning in data-scarce regions.

*Jiahui Chen,Zehang Deng,Zeyu Zhang,Chaoyang Li,Lianchen Jia,Lifeng Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvMark is a two-stage fine-tuning framework for deep learning-based image watermarking, addressing adversarial and regeneration attacks separately to maintain clean accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for deep learning-based image watermarking struggle with adversarial and regeneration attacks, leading to reduced clean accuracy and limited robustness. AdvMark aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: AdvMark uses a two-stage approach: Stage 1 tackles adversarial attacks by fine-tuning the encoder conditionally, while Stage 2 addresses distortion and regeneration attacks through constrained image optimization with theoretical guarantees.

Result: AdvMark achieves significant improvements, with up to 29%, 33%, and 46% accuracy gains against distortion, regeneration, and adversarial attacks, respectively, while maintaining high image quality.

Conclusion: AdvMark effectively decouples defense strategies for different attacks, offering superior robustness and image quality compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image watermarking, while robust against conventional distortions, remains vulnerable to advanced adversarial and regeneration attacks. Conventional countermeasures, which jointly optimize the encoder and decoder via a noise layer, face 2 inevitable challenges: (1) decrease of clean accuracy due to decoder adversarial training and (2) limited robustness due to simultaneous training of all three advanced attacks. To overcome these issues, we propose AdvMark, a novel two-stage fine-tuning framework that decouples the defense strategies. In stage 1, we address adversarial vulnerability via a tailored adversarial training paradigm that primarily fine-tunes the encoder while only conditionally updating the decoder. This approach learns to move the image into a non-attackable region, rather than modifying the decision boundary, thus preserving clean accuracy. In stage 2, we tackle distortion and regeneration attacks via direct image optimization. To preserve the adversarial robustness gained in stage 1, we formulate a principled, constrained image loss with theoretical guarantees, which balances the deviation from cover and previous encoded images. We also propose a quality-aware early-stop to further guarantee the lower bound of visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate AdvMark outperforms with the highest image quality and comprehensive robustness, i.e. up to 29\%, 33\% and 46\% accuracy improvement for distortion, regeneration and adversarial attacks, respectively.

*Zanxi Ruan,Qiuyu Kong,Songqun Gao,Yiming Wang,Marco Cristani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StructXLIP improves vision-language alignment by focusing on structural cues (e.g., edge maps) and introduces auxiliary losses for robust cross-modal retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance vision-language alignment by leveraging structural cues (edge maps) from images and aligning them with corresponding textual descriptions.

Method: StructXLIP extracts edge maps as proxies for visual structure and filters captions to emphasize structural cues. It introduces three structure-centric losses: aligning edge maps with text, matching local edge regions to text chunks, and preventing representation drift.

Result: The method outperforms current competitors in cross-modal retrieval across general and specialized domains and can be integrated into future approaches.

Conclusion: StructXLIP provides a plug-and-play solution for improving vision-language alignment by focusing on structural representations, leading to more robust and semantically stable embeddings.

Abstract: Edge-based representations are fundamental cues for visual understanding, a principle rooted in early vision research and still central today. We extend this principle to vision-language alignment, showing that isolating and aligning structural cues across modalities can greatly benefit fine-tuning on long, detail-rich captions, with a specific focus on improving cross-modal retrieval. We introduce StructXLIP, a fine-tuning alignment paradigm that extracts edge maps (e.g., Canny), treating them as proxies for the visual structure of an image, and filters the corresponding captions to emphasize structural cues, making them "structure-centric". Fine-tuning augments the standard alignment loss with three structure-centric losses: (i) aligning edge maps with structural text, (ii) matching local edge regions to textual chunks, and (iii) connecting edge maps to color images to prevent representation drift. From a theoretical standpoint, while standard CLIP maximizes the mutual information between visual and textual embeddings, StructXLIP additionally maximizes the mutual information between multimodal structural representations. This auxiliary optimization is intrinsically harder, guiding the model toward more robust and semantically stable minima, enhancing vision-language alignment. Beyond outperforming current competitors on cross-modal retrieval in both general and specialized domains, our method serves as a general boosting recipe that can be integrated into future approaches in a plug-and-play manner. Code and pretrained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/intelligolabs/StructXLIP.

TL;DR: MeanFuser improves autonomous driving by replacing discrete anchor vocabularies with Gaussian Mixture Noise, using MeanFlow Identity for planning, and adding an Adaptive Reconstruction Module for robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of discrete anchor vocabularies in generative models for trajectory planning.

Method: Uses Gaussian Mixture Noise for continuous representation, MeanFlow Identity for efficient planning, and Adaptive Reconstruction Module for trajectory selection.

Result: Achieves outstanding performance and efficiency on the NAVSIM benchmark.

Conclusion: MeanFuser provides a robust, efficient solution for end-to-end autonomous driving.

Abstract: Generative models have shown great potential in trajectory planning. Recent studies demonstrate that anchor-guided generative models are effective in modeling the uncertainty of driving behaviors and improving overall performance. However, these methods rely on discrete anchor vocabularies that must sufficiently cover the trajectory distribution during testing to ensure robustness, inducing an inherent trade-off between vocabulary size and model performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose MeanFuser, an end-to-end autonomous driving method that enhances both efficiency and robustness through three key designs. (1) We introduce Gaussian Mixture Noise (GMN) to guide generative sampling, enabling a continuous representation of the trajectory space and eliminating the dependency on discrete anchor vocabularies. (2) We adapt ``MeanFlow Identity" to end-to-end planning, which models the mean velocity field between GMN and trajectory distribution instead of the instantaneous velocity field used in vanilla flow matching methods, effectively eliminating numerical errors from ODE solvers and significantly accelerating inference. (3) We design a lightweight Adaptive Reconstruction Module (ARM) that enables the model to implicitly select from all sampled proposals or reconstruct a new trajectory when none is satisfactory via attention weights. Experiments on the NAVSIM closed-loop benchmark demonstrate that MeanFuser achieves outstanding performance without the supervision of the PDM Score. and exceptional inference efficiency, offering a robust and efficient solution for end-to-end autonomous driving.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the shift from supervised to unsupervised and self-supervised learning in biomedicine, highlighting its ability to unlock biobank-scale datasets and discover novel phenotypes without expert annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance on expert annotations limits AI applications in biomedicine. Unsupervised and self-supervised learning offers a way to overcome this bottleneck by leveraging the intrinsic structure of data.

Method: The paper reviews unsupervised and self-supervised learning techniques that learn directly from data structure (e.g., MRI pixels, genomic tokens) without human labels.

Result: These methods enable discovery of novel phenotypes, link morphology to genetics, and detect anomalies comparably or better than supervised methods.

Conclusion: Unsupervised and self-supervised learning paradigms are transforming biomedicine by reducing dependency on labeled data and unlocking large-scale datasets.

Abstract: The dependence on expert annotation has long constituted the primary rate-limiting step in the application of artificial intelligence to biomedicine. While supervised learning drove the initial wave of clinical algorithms, a paradigm shift towards unsupervised and self-supervised learning (SSL) is currently unlocking the latent potential of biobank-scale datasets. By learning directly from the intrinsic structure of data - whether pixels in a magnetic resonance image (MRI), voxels in a volumetric scan, or tokens in a genomic sequence - these methods facilitate the discovery of novel phenotypes, the linkage of morphology to genetics, and the detection of anomalies without human bias. This article synthesises seminal and recent advances in "learning without labels," highlighting how unsupervised frameworks can derive heritable cardiac traits, predict spatial gene expression in histology, and detect pathologies with performance that rivals or exceeds supervised counterparts.

Result: Detection performance drops significantly when artefacts differ visually from the model's ROI (e.g., AUROC drops for black ink vs. red ink in skin lesion classifiers).

Conclusion: The Invisible Gorilla Effect reveals a critical failure mode in OOD detection, urging the need for more robust methods.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks achieve high performance in vision tasks by learning features from regions of interest (ROI) within images, but their performance degrades when deployed on out-of-distribution (OOD) data that differs from training data. This challenge has led to OOD detection methods that aim to identify and reject unreliable predictions. Although prior work shows that OOD detection performance varies by artefact type, the underlying causes remain underexplored. To this end, we identify a previously unreported bias in OOD detection: for hard-to-detect artefacts (near-OOD), detection performance typically improves when the artefact shares visual similarity (e.g. colour) with the model's ROI and drops when it does not - a phenomenon we term the Invisible Gorilla Effect. For example, in a skin lesion classifier with red lesion ROI, we show the method Mahalanobis Score achieves a 31.5% higher AUROC when detecting OOD red ink (similar to ROI) compared to black ink (dissimilar) annotations. We annotated artefacts by colour in 11,355 images from three public datasets (e.g. ISIC) and generated colour-swapped counterfactuals to rule out dataset bias. We then evaluated 40 OOD methods across 7 benchmarks and found significant performance drops for most methods when artefacts differed from the ROI. Our findings highlight an overlooked failure mode in OOD detection and provide guidance for more robust detectors.

### [199] [Benchmarking Unlearning for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20114)
*Kairan Zhao,Iurie Luca,Peter Triantafillou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks machine unlearning (MU) algorithms for Vision Transformers (VTs), filling a gap in MU research, and evaluates performance across datasets, algorithms, and protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of MU research for VTs and provide a standardized benchmark for evaluating MU algorithms in VT settings.

Method: Uses diverse datasets, MU algorithms, and protocols; focuses on leveraging memorization; and employs unified evaluation metrics.

Result: Provides reproducible comparisons of MU algorithms for VTs, their memorization characteristics, and their impact on performance.

Conclusion: Establishes a benchmark for MU in VTs, highlighting performance baselines and enabling future research.

Abstract: Research in machine unlearning (MU) has gained strong momentum: MU is now widely regarded as a critical capability for building safe and fair AI. In parallel, research into transformer architectures for computer vision tasks has been highly successful: Increasingly, Vision Transformers (VTs) emerge as strong alternatives to CNNs. Yet, MU research for vision tasks has largely centered on CNNs, not VTs. While benchmarking MU efforts have addressed LLMs, diffusion models, and CNNs, none exist for VTs. This work is the first to attempt this, benchmarking MU algorithm performance in different VT families (ViT and Swin-T) and at different capacities. The work employs (i) different datasets, selected to assess the impacts of dataset scale and complexity; (ii) different MU algorithms, selected to represent fundamentally different approaches for MU; and (iii) both single-shot and continual unlearning protocols. Additionally, it focuses on benchmarking MU algorithms that leverage training data memorization, since leveraging memorization has been recently discovered to significantly improve the performance of previously SOTA algorithms. En route, the work characterizes how VTs memorize training data relative to CNNs, and assesses the impact of different memorization proxies on performance. The benchmark uses unified evaluation metrics that capture two complementary notions of forget quality along with accuracy on unseen (test) data and on retained data. Overall, this work offers a benchmarking basis, enabling reproducible, fair, and comprehensive comparisons of existing (and future) MU algorithms on VTs. And, for the first time, it sheds light on how well existing algorithms work in VT settings, establishing a promising reference performance baseline.

*Xinya Chen,Christopher Wewer,Jiahao Xie,Xinting Hu,Jan Eric Lenssen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemanticNVS is a multi-view diffusion model integrating semantic features to enhance novel view synthesis, especially for distant viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NVS methods degrade under long-range camera motion, producing distorted or implausible images, likely due to insufficient semantic understanding of conditioning or intermediate content.

Method: Proposes integrating pre-trained semantic feature extractors via two strategies: warped semantic features and an alternating understanding-generation scheme during denoising.

Result: Shows clear qualitative and quantitative improvements (4.69%-15.26% FID) over state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: SemanticNVS effectively leverages semantic conditioning to improve generation quality and consistency in novel view synthesis, particularly for distant viewpoints.

Abstract: We present SemanticNVS, a camera-conditioned multi-view diffusion model for novel view synthesis (NVS), which improves generation quality and consistency by integrating pre-trained semantic feature extractors. Existing NVS methods perform well for views near the input view, however, they tend to generate semantically implausible and distorted images under long-range camera motion, revealing severe degradation. We speculate that this degradation is due to current models failing to fully understand their conditioning or intermediate generated scene content. Here, we propose to integrate pre-trained semantic feature extractors to incorporate stronger scene semantics as conditioning to achieve high-quality generation even at distant viewpoints. We investigate two different strategies, (1) warped semantic features and (2) an alternating scheme of understanding and generation at each denoising step. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the clear qualitative and quantitative (4.69%-15.26% in FID) improvement over state-of-the-art alternatives.

### [201] [Do Large Language Models Understand Data Visualization Principles?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20084)
*Martin Sinnona,Valentin Bonas,Viviana Siless,Emmanuel Iarussi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) are evaluated for their ability to reason about and enforce visualization principles without symbolic rule specification, using a dataset of annotated Vega-Lite charts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs and VLMs can effectively reason about visualization principles directly, bypassing traditional constraint-based systems that require expert knowledge.

Method: Compiled visualization principles into natural-language statements, created a dataset of ~2,000 Vega-Lite specifications with violations, and evaluated models on detecting violations and correcting flawed charts.

Result: LLMs and VLMs show promise as flexible validators and editors but lag behind symbolic solvers for nuanced aspects of visual perception. They excel more at correcting violations than detecting them.

Conclusion: Large (vision-)language models offer potential as visualization design tools, though gaps persist in nuanced reasoning compared to symbolic methods.

Abstract: Data visualization principles, derived from decades of research in design and perception, ensure proper visual communication. While prior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can generate charts or flag misleading figures, it remains unclear whether they and their vision-language counterparts (VLMs) can reason about and enforce visualization principles directly. Constraint based systems encode these principles as logical rules for precise automated checks, but translating them into formal specifications demands expert knowledge. This motivates leveraging LLMs and VLMs as principle checkers that can reason about visual design directly, bypassing the need for symbolic rule specification. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of both LLMs and VLMs on their ability to reason about visualization principles, using hard verification ground truth derived from Answer Set Programming (ASP). We compiled a set of visualization principles expressed as natural-language statements and generated a controlled dataset of approximately 2,000 Vega-Lite specifications annotated with explicit principle violations, complemented by over 300 real-world Vega-Lite charts. We evaluated both checking and fixing tasks, assessing how well models detect principle violations and correct flawed chart specifications. Our work highlights both the promise of large (vision-)language models as flexible validators and editors of visualization designs and the persistent gap with symbolic solvers on more nuanced aspects of visual perception. They also reveal an interesting asymmetry: frontier models tend to be more effective at correcting violations than at detecting them reliably.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VBVR, a large-scale video reasoning dataset and benchmark suite, addressing the lack of resources for studying video reasoning scalability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video models focus on visual quality, neglecting reasoning capabilities. Video reasoning offers unique insights into spatiotemporal phenomena, but lacks large-scale data for systematic study.

Method: The authors create VBVR, a dataset with 200 reasoning tasks and over 1M video clips, and VBVR-Bench, an evaluation framework using rule-based and human-aligned scorers.

Result: Early signs of emergent generalization to unseen reasoning tasks were observed through large-scale scaling studies.

Conclusion: VBVR provides foundational resources for advancing generalizable video reasoning research.

Abstract: Rapid progress in video models has largely focused on visual quality, leaving their reasoning capabilities underexplored. Video reasoning grounds intelligence in spatiotemporally consistent visual environments that go beyond what text can naturally capture, enabling intuitive reasoning over spatiotemporal structure such as continuity, interaction, and causality. However, systematically studying video reasoning and its scaling behavior is hindered by the lack of large-scale training data. To address this gap, we introduce the Very Big Video Reasoning (VBVR) Dataset, an unprecedentedly large-scale resource spanning 200 curated reasoning tasks following a principled taxonomy and over one million video clips, approximately three orders of magnitude larger than existing datasets. We further present VBVR-Bench, a verifiable evaluation framework that moves beyond model-based judging by incorporating rule-based, human-aligned scorers, enabling reproducible and interpretable diagnosis of video reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the VBVR suite, we conduct one of the first large-scale scaling studies of video reasoning and observe early signs of emergent generalization to unseen reasoning tasks. Together, VBVR lays a foundation for the next stage of research in generalizable video reasoning. The data, benchmark toolkit, and models are publicly available at https://video-reason.com/ .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLMs show promise as flexible validators for visualization rules but struggle with subtle perceptual rules and technical formulations compared to symbolic solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can reason about and enforce visualization rules, given their potential as flexible validators compared to expert-dependent symbolic systems like Draco.

Method: Translated Draco's constraints into natural language, created a dataset of 2,000 annotated Vega-Lite specs, and evaluated LLMs on violation detection and prompt adherence.

Result: Frontier LLMs achieved high adherence (up to 100%) and detected common violations (F1 up to 0.82), but faltered on subtle rules (F1 < 0.15) and technical formulations.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as language-driven validators but remain limited versus symbolic solvers, with natural-language translations boosting smaller models.

Abstract: Data visualization rules-derived from decades of research in design and perception-ensure trustworthy chart communication. While prior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can generate charts or flag misleading figures, it remains unclear whether they can reason about and enforce visualization rules directly. Constraint-based systems such as Draco encode these rules as logical constraints for precise automated checks, but maintaining symbolic encodings requires expert effort, motivating the use of LLMs as flexible rule validators. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of LLMs against visualization rules using hard-verification ground truth derived from Answer Set Programming (ASP). We translated a subset of Draco's constraints into natural-language statements and generated a controlled dataset of 2,000 Vega-Lite specifications annotated with explicit rule violations. LLMs were evaluated on both accuracy in detecting violations and prompt adherence, which measures whether outputs follow the required structured format. Results show that frontier models achieve high adherence (Gemma 3 4B / 27B: 100%, GPT-oss 20B: 98%) and reliably detect common violations (F1 up to 0.82),yet performance drops for subtler perceptual rules (F1 < 0.15 for some categories) and for outputs generated from technical ASP formulations.Translating constraints into natural language improved performance by up to 150% for smaller models. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs as flexible, language-driven validators while highlighting their current limitations compared to symbolic solvers.

*Zhongxiao Cong,Qitao Zhao,Minsik Jeon,Shubham Tulsiani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow3r enhances 3D/4D reconstruction using dense 2D correspondences (flow) as supervision, enabling scalable training from unlabeled monocular videos. It factors flow prediction into geometry and pose latents, improving performance on both static and dynamic scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reconstruction systems require expensive dense geometry and pose supervision, which is scarce, especially for dynamic scenes. Flow3r aims to address this by leveraging scalable, unlabeled monocular videos.

Method: Flow3r introduces factored flow prediction, using geometry latents from one image and pose latents from another to predict flow. This guides scene geometry and camera motion learning and extends to dynamic scenes.

Result: Factored flow prediction outperforms alternatives, scaling consistently with unlabeled data. Trained on ~800K unlabeled videos, Flow3r achieves state-of-the-art results on eight benchmarks, excelling in dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: Flow3r demonstrates that factored flow supervision from unlabeled videos can significantly improve 3D/4D reconstruction, especially in dynamic scenarios where labeled data is scarce.

Abstract: Current feed-forward 3D/4D reconstruction systems rely on dense geometry and pose supervision -- expensive to obtain at scale and particularly scarce for dynamic real-world scenes. We present Flow3r, a framework that augments visual geometry learning with dense 2D correspondences (`flow') as supervision, enabling scalable training from unlabeled monocular videos. Our key insight is that the flow prediction module should be factored: predicting flow between two images using geometry latents from one and pose latents from the other. This factorization directly guides the learning of both scene geometry and camera motion, and naturally extends to dynamic scenes. In controlled experiments, we show that factored flow prediction outperforms alternative designs and that performance scales consistently with unlabeled data. Integrating factored flow into existing visual geometry architectures and training with ${\sim}800$K unlabeled videos, Flow3r achieves state-of-the-art results across eight benchmarks spanning static and dynamic scenes, with its largest gains on in-the-wild dynamic videos where labeled data is most scarce.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: tttLRM is a large 3D reconstruction model using a TTT layer for efficient long-context reconstruction with linear complexity. It compresses images into implicit 3D representations, supports online learning, and excels in reconstruction quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve 3D reconstruction by leveraging TTT layers for efficient, scalable modeling and better reconstruction quality from streaming observations.

Method: The model uses a TTT layer to compress image observations into implicit 3D representations, decoded into explicit formats like Gaussian Splats. It supports online learning for progressive reconstruction.

Result: Pretraining on view synthesis tasks transfers well to 3D modeling, improving quality and convergence speed. The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in feedforward Gaussian reconstruction.

Conclusion: tttLRM demonstrates superior performance in 3D reconstruction, combining efficiency, scalability, and high-quality results for both objects and scenes.

Abstract: We propose tttLRM, a novel large 3D reconstruction model that leverages a Test-Time Training (TTT) layer to enable long-context, autoregressive 3D reconstruction with linear computational complexity, further scaling the model's capability. Our framework efficiently compresses multiple image observations into the fast weights of the TTT layer, forming an implicit 3D representation in the latent space that can be decoded into various explicit formats, such as Gaussian Splats (GS) for downstream applications. The online learning variant of our model supports progressive 3D reconstruction and refinement from streaming observations. We demonstrate that pretraining on novel view synthesis tasks effectively transfers to explicit 3D modeling, resulting in improved reconstruction quality and faster convergence. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in feedforward 3D Gaussian reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art approaches on both objects and scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified multimodal models are data-hungry and too heavy for edge devices, limiting practical deployment. Mobile-O addresses this gap.

Method: Mobile-O uses the Mobile Conditioning Projector (MCP) for efficient cross-modal fusion and is trained in a novel quadruplet format to enhance both understanding and generation.

Result: Mobile-O outperforms Show-O and JanusFlow in performance (74% on GenEval) and speed (6x and 11x faster), with superior visual understanding on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Mobile-O provides a practical framework for real-time multimodal tasks on edge devices, enabling future research in on-device intelligence without cloud dependency.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models can both understand and generate visual content within a single architecture. Existing models, however, remain data-hungry and too heavy for deployment on edge devices. We present Mobile-O, a compact vision-language-diffusion model that brings unified multimodal intelligence to a mobile device. Its core module, the Mobile Conditioning Projector (MCP), fuses vision-language features with a diffusion generator using depthwise-separable convolutions and layerwise alignment. This design enables efficient cross-modal conditioning with minimal computational cost. Trained on only a few million samples and post-trained in a novel quadruplet format (generation prompt, image, question, answer), Mobile-O jointly enhances both visual understanding and generation capabilities. Despite its efficiency, Mobile-O attains competitive or superior performance compared to other unified models, achieving 74% on GenEval and outperforming Show-O and JanusFlow by 5% and 11%, while running 6x and 11x faster, respectively. For visual understanding, Mobile-O surpasses them by 15.3% and 5.1% averaged across seven benchmarks. Running in only ~3s per 512x512 image on an iPhone, Mobile-O establishes the first practical framework for real-time unified multimodal understanding and generation on edge devices. We hope Mobile-O will ease future research in real-time unified multimodal intelligence running entirely on-device with no cloud dependency.

### [207] [ReportLogic: Evaluating Logical Quality in Deep Research Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18446)
*Jujia Zhao,Zhaoxin Huan,Zihan Wang,Xiaolu Zhang,Jun Zhou,Suzan Verberne,Zhaochun Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReportLogic is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate the logical quality of LLM-generated reports, focusing on auditability through Macro-Logic, Expositional-Logic, and Structural-Logic. A human-annotated dataset and LogicJudge are developed for scalable evaluation, revealing vulnerabilities in current LLM judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation frameworks for LLM-generated reports often overlook logical quality, which is critical for trust and downstream use. This gap motivates the creation of ReportLogic to ensure reports are not just fluent but logically reliable.

Method: ReportLogic uses a hierarchical taxonomy to assess logical quality, including Macro-Logic (structure), Expositional-Logic (context), and Structural-Logic (claim-support). A human-annotated dataset and LogicJudge are developed for evaluation, tested via adversarial attacks.

Result: The study shows that off-the-shelf LLM judges are often misled by superficial cues, and reasoning modes can hide flawed support relationships. The LogicJudge performs better but reveals limitations in current models.

Conclusion: ReportLogic provides actionable insights for improving logical reliability in LLM-generated reports and highlights the need for more robust logic evaluators beyond surface-level fluency.

Abstract: Users increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for Deep Research, using them to synthesize diverse sources into structured reports that support understanding and action. In this context, the practical reliability of such reports hinges on logical quality: whether the report's claims and arguments are explicitly supported and can be trusted as a basis for downstream use, rather than merely appearing fluent or informative. However, current evaluation frameworks largely overlook this requirement. To bridge this gap, we introduce ReportLogic, a benchmark that quantifies report-level logical quality through a reader-centric lens of auditability. Specifically, ReportLogic adopts a hierarchical taxonomy that evaluates whether readers can (1) trace an on-topic report structure with a unified analytical arc (Macro-Logic), (2) understand the progression with necessary context (Expositional-Logic), and (3) verify conclusions via explicit claim--support (Structural-Logic). Based on this taxonomy, we construct a human-annotated rubric-guided dataset and train an open-source LogicJudge for scalable evaluation. We further evaluate judge robustness via adversarial attacks, showing that off-the-shelf LLM judges are frequently influenced by superficial cues (e.g., verbosity), and reasoning modes can mask broken support relations. Overall, our results provide actionable guidance for building more robust logic evaluators and improving the logical reliability of LLM-generated reports.

*Siran Liu,Cyril Y. He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConfSpec is a confidence-gated cascaded verification framework that improves efficiency in Chain-of-Thought reasoning by leveraging small draft models for verification, achieving significant speedups without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off among accuracy, inference speed, and resource efficiency in step-level speculative reasoning for Chain-of-Thought tasks.

Method: Utilizes a confidence-gated framework where high-confidence decisions from small draft models are accepted, while uncertain cases are escalated to large target models.

Result: Achieves up to 2.24× speedups while maintaining target-model accuracy across diverse workloads.

Conclusion: ConfSpec resolves the efficiency trade-off in speculative reasoning, offering a scalable and resource-efficient solution.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning significantly improves the performance of large language models on complex tasks, but incurs high inference latency due to long generation traces. Step-level speculative reasoning aims to mitigate this cost, yet existing approaches face a long-standing trade-off among accuracy, inference speed, and resource efficiency. We propose ConfSpec, a confidence-gated cascaded verification framework that resolves this trade-off. Our key insight is an asymmetry between generation and verification: while generating a correct reasoning step requires substantial model capacity, step-level verification is a constrained discriminative task for which small draft models are well-calibrated within their competence range, enabling high-confidence draft decisions to be accepted directly while selectively escalating uncertain cases to the large target model. Evaluation across diverse workloads shows that ConfSpec achieves up to 2.24$\times$ end-to-end speedups while matching target-model accuracy. Our method requires no external judge models and is orthogonal to token-level speculative decoding, enabling further multiplicative acceleration.

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework using DLMs refines prompts iteratively via masked denoising, improving frozen LLM performance without gradient access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLM performance through flexible, model-agnostic prompt optimization without modifying the underlying model.

Method: Uses DLMs for iterative prompt refinement by conditioning on interaction traces (queries, responses, feedback) and masked denoising.

Result: DLM-optimized prompts improve performance of frozen LLMs like GPT-4o-mini across benchmarks, with moderate diffusion steps balancing quality and stability.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based prompt optimization is scalable, general, and effective for enhancing LLMs through iterative refinement.

Abstract: We propose a diffusion-based framework for prompt optimization that leverages Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) to iteratively refine system prompts through masked denoising. By conditioning on interaction traces, including user queries, model responses, and optional feedback, our method enables flexible, span-level prompt updates without requiring gradient access or modifying the downstream language model. Across diverse benchmarks (e.g., $τ$-bench, SST-2, SST-5), DLM-optimized prompts consistently improve the performance of a frozen target LLM (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We further show that moderate diffusion step counts provide the best balance between refinement quality and stability. These results highlight diffusion-based prompt optimization as a general, model-agnostic, and scalable approach for enhancing LLM performance through iterative prompt refinement.

### [210] [Asymptotic Semantic Collapse in Hierarchical Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18450)
*Faruk Alpay,Bugra Kilictas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies Asymptotic Semantic Collapse in multi-agent language systems, where a dominant context absorbs individual semantics, leading to uniform behavior. It models semantic states on a Riemannian manifold and shows path-independent convergence. Context dependence reduces information content, enforcing a shared semantic grammar. Empirical results confirm theoretical predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how dominant contexts homogenize individual semantics in multi-agent systems, exploring the dynamics of semantic alignment and its implications for information content and consensus.

Method: Semantic states are modeled as points on a Riemannian manifold, analyzing projection dynamics. The study examines smooth gradient-style and stochastic updates, and their convergence. Context dependence is quantified via entropy.

Result: Findings show path-independent convergence to a topological endpoint and vanishing entropy for fully entangled representations. Empirical results include zero hash collisions and compliance metrics.

Conclusion: The theory links information-theoretic and geometric structures, suggesting a consensus rule enforcing shared semantics. Empirical validation supports the framework.

Abstract: Multi-agent language systems can exhibit a failure mode where a shared dominant context progressively absorbs individual semantics, yielding near-uniform behavior across agents. We study this effect under the name Asymptotic Semantic Collapse in Hierarchical Optimization. In a closed linguistic setting with a Dominant Anchor Node whose semantic state has effectively infinite inertia, we show that repeated interactions with Peripheral Agent Nodes drive an asymptotic alignment that minimizes a global loss. We model semantic states as points on a Riemannian manifold and analyze the induced projection dynamics. Two consequences follow. First, the limiting semantic configuration is insensitive to the optimization history: both smooth gradient-style updates and stochastic noisy updates converge to the same topological endpoint, establishing path independence at convergence. Second, the degree of context dependence controls information content: moving from atomic (independent) representations to fully entangled (context-bound) representations forces the node entropy, interpreted as available degrees of freedom, to vanish in the limit. The theory connects information-theoretic quantities with differential-geometric structure and suggests an interpretation as an immutable consensus rule that constrains agents to a shared semantic grammar. A lightweight dataset-free benchmark on an RWKV-7 13B GGUF checkpoint complements the analysis, reporting zero hash collisions, mean compliance of 0.50 under greedy decoding and 0.531 under stochastic decoding, and final Jaccard-to-anchor similarity values of 0.295 and 0.224, respectively.

*Ihor Stepanov,Mykhailo Shtopko,Dmytro Vodianytskyi,Oleksandr Lukashov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GLiNER-bi-Encoder is a novel bi-encoder NER architecture that improves efficiency and scalability while maintaining zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the quadratic complexity issue of joint-encoding NER models, which limits scalability for large label sets.

Method: Uses a bi-encoder design with separate label and context encoders to decouple and streamline the NER process.

Result: Achieves 61.5% Micro-F1 on CrossNER and up to 130x throughput improvement at 1024 labels.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture enables efficient, scalable NER and extends to modular entity linking (GLiNKER) for large knowledge bases.

Abstract: This paper introduces GLiNER-bi-Encoder, a novel architecture for Named Entity Recognition (NER) that harmonizes zero-shot flexibility with industrial-scale efficiency. While the original GLiNER framework offers strong generalization, its joint-encoding approach suffers from quadratic complexity as the number of entity labels increases. Our proposed bi-encoder design decouples the process into a dedicated label encoder and a context encoder, effectively removing the context-window bottleneck. This architecture enables the simultaneous recognition of thousands, and potentially millions, of entity types with minimal overhead. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, achieving 61.5 percent Micro-F1 on the CrossNER benchmark. Crucially, by leveraging pre-computed label embeddings, GLiNER-bi-Encoder achieves up to a 130 times throughput improvement at 1024 labels compared to its uni-encoder predecessors. Furthermore, we introduce GLiNKER, a modular framework that leverages this architecture for high-performance entity linking across massive knowledge bases such as Wikidata.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Luna-2 is a deterministic, cost-efficient evaluation model using small language models (SLMs) to replace slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge (LLMAJ) systems, achieving comparable or better accuracy with significant cost and latency reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMAJ systems are slow, expensive, and nondeterministic, creating a need for a more efficient and reliable solution for real-time guardrails in AI applications.

Method: Luna-2 employs decoder-only SLMs with lightweight LoRA/PEFT heads for specialized metrics, enabling concurrent evaluations on a single GPU while ensuring privacy and low latency.

Result: Luna-2 matches LLMAJ accuracy in benchmarks, reduces inference cost by 80x and latency by 20x, and processes 100B+ tokens monthly in production with $30M annual savings.

Conclusion: Luna-2 successfully addresses the limitations of LLMAJ, offering a scalable, cost-effective, and high-performance solution for real-time AI evaluation.

Abstract: Real-time guardrails require evaluation that is accurate, cheap, and fast - yet today's default, LLM-as-a-judge (LLMAJ), is slow, expensive, and operationally non-deterministic due to multi-token generation. We present Luna-2, a novel architecture that leverages decoder-only small language models (SLMs) into a deterministic evaluation model to reliably compute complex task-specific LLMAJ metrics (e.g. toxicity, hallucination, tool selection quality, etc.) at an accuracy at par or higher than LLMAJ using frontier LLMs while drastically reducing the cost and latency of computation. Each metric is implemented as a lightweight LoRA/PEFT head on top of a shared SLM backbone, enabling hundreds of specialized metrics to run concurrently on a single GPU, deployable locally next to AI systems in a privacy-preserving and latency optimizing manner. Across content safety and hallucination benchmarks, Luna-2 matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLM-based evaluators while reducing inference cost by over 80x and latency by over 20x.
  In this paper, we outline the model architecture, training methodology and report real-world empirical results on accuracy, latency, and throughput results. In production, Luna-2 is protecting 100M+ AI sessions and processing over 100B tokens per month for our customers with eval cost savings of over $30M annually.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DP-RFT is an online reinforcement learning method for generating high-quality DP synthetic data without direct access to private examples, closing the gap between privacy and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generate high-quality synthetic data for LLMs without exposing private examples, addressing the trade-off between privacy and domain fidelity.

Method: Uses DP-protected nearest-neighbor votes as rewards for synthetic samples, training the LLM via PPO to maximize DP votes iteratively.

Result: DP-RFT improves fidelity and utility of synthetic data, matching DP finetuning methods while respecting privacy boundaries.

Conclusion: DP-RFT effectively balances privacy and quality in synthetic data generation, offering a practical solution for private LLM training.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation plays a pivotal role in developing large language models (LLMs) on private data, where data owners cannot provide eyes-on access to individual examples. Generating DP synthetic data typically involves a difficult trade-off. On one hand, DP finetuning methods train an LLM as a synthetic data generator with formal privacy guarantees, yet it still requires the raw content of private examples for model training. However, methods that avoid direct exposure to private data are bounded by an off-the-shelf, un-finetuned model, whose outputs often lack domain fidelity. Can we train an LLM to generate high-quality synthetic text without eyes-on access to individual private examples? In this work, we introduce Differentially Private Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (DP-RFT), an online reinforcement learning algorithm for synthetic data generation with LLMs. DP-RFT leverages DP-protected nearest-neighbor votes from an eyes-off private corpus as a reward signal for on-policy synthetic samples generated by an LLM. The LLM iteratively learns to generate synthetic data to maximize the expected DP votes through Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We evaluate DP-RFT for long-form and domain-specific synthetic data generation, such as news articles, meeting transcripts, and medical article abstracts. Our experiments show that DP-RFT closes the gap between private evolution and DP finetuning methods in terms of the fidelity and downstream utility of the generated synthetic data, while respecting the private data boundary.

*Ian Steenstra,Paola Pedrelli,Weiyan Shi,Stacy Marsella,Timothy W. Bickmore*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates AI psychotherapists using simulated patient agents and identifies safety risks in AI-provided mental health support, emphasizing the need for simulation-based testing before deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety benchmarks for LLMs in mental health support fail to address complex risks in therapeutic dialogue, necessitating a better evaluation framework.

Method: The study introduces a framework pairing AI therapists with simulated patient agents, using dynamic cognitive-affective models and assessing sessions against a quality of care ontology. Six AI agents, including ChatGPT and Gemini, were evaluated using 15 clinically-validated patient personas.

Result: Large-scale simulations revealed safety gaps like validation of patient delusions and failure to manage suicide risk. Stakeholders validated an interactive dashboard for auditing AI psychotherapy.

Conclusion: The findings highlight critical safety risks in AI mental health support and advocate for simulation-based clinical red teaming before deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized for mental health support; however, current safety benchmarks often fail to detect the complex, longitudinal risks inherent in therapeutic dialogue. We introduce an evaluation framework that pairs AI psychotherapists with simulated patient agents equipped with dynamic cognitive-affective models and assesses therapy session simulations against a comprehensive quality of care and risk ontology. We apply this framework to a high-impact test case, Alcohol Use Disorder, evaluating six AI agents (including ChatGPT, Gemini, and Character.AI) against a clinically-validated cohort of 15 patient personas representing diverse clinical phenotypes.
  Our large-scale simulation (N=369 sessions) reveals critical safety gaps in the use of AI for mental health support. We identify specific iatrogenic risks, including the validation of patient delusions ("AI Psychosis") and failure to de-escalate suicide risk. Finally, we validate an interactive data visualization dashboard with diverse stakeholders, including AI engineers and red teamers, mental health professionals, and policy experts (N=9), demonstrating that this framework effectively enables stakeholders to audit the "black box" of AI psychotherapy. These findings underscore the critical safety risks of AI-provided mental health support and the necessity of simulation-based clinical red teaming before deployment.

*Nina Hosseini-Kivanani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PolyFrame improves idiom disambiguation in multimodal contexts using lightweight modules without fine-tuning large encoders, achieving strong performance across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models struggle with idiomatic expressions, especially in multilingual settings, prompting the need for effective disambiguation methods.

Method: PolyFrame uses frozen CLIP-style encoders and lightweight modules like logistic regression, LLM-based predictors, idiom substitution, and Borda rank fusion.

Result: Achieved 60.0% Top-1 accuracy in English and Portuguese, with robust performance on multilingual blind tests (0.35 Top-1 for Subtask A, 0.32 for Subtask B).

Conclusion: Lightweight modules and idiom-aware rewriting effectively address idiom disambiguation without large encoder fine-tuning.

Abstract: Multimodal models struggle with idiomatic expressions due to their non-compositional meanings, a challenge amplified in multilingual settings. We introduced PolyFrame, our system for the MWE-2026 AdMIRe2 shared task on multimodal idiom disambiguation, featuring a unified pipeline for both image+text ranking (Subtask A) and text-only caption ranking (Subtask B). All model variants retain frozen CLIP-style vision--language encoders and the multilingual BGE M3 encoder, training only lightweight modules: a logistic regression and LLM-based sentence-type predictor, idiom synonym substitution, distractor-aware scoring, and Borda rank fusion. Starting from a CLIP baseline (26.7% Top-1 on English dev, 6.7% on English test), adding idiom-aware paraphrasing and explicit sentence-type classification increased performance to 60.0% Top-1 on English and 60.0% Top-1 (0.822 NDCG@5) in zero-shot transfer to Portuguese. On the multilingual blind test, our systems achieved average Top-1/NDCG scores of 0.35/0.73 for Subtask A and 0.32/0.71 for Subtask B across 15 languages. Ablation results highlight idiom-aware rewriting as the main contributor to performance, while sentence-type prediction and multimodal fusion enhance robustness. These findings suggest that effective idiom disambiguation is feasible without fine-tuning large multimodal encoders.

*Saif M. Mohammad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first large-scale lexicon for multiword expressions (MWEs) associated with anxiety, providing reliable data for research across psychology, NLP, public health, and social sciences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of anxiety-related work on larger text units like MWEs by creating a reliable lexicon for anxiety associations.

Method: Developed a large-scale lexicon capturing anxiety associations for over 20k English MWEs, analyzing reliability, prevalence, and compositionality.

Result: The anxiety associations are highly reliable, and the lexicon reveals patterns in prevalence and compositionality of MWEs across different word sequences.

Conclusion: The lexicon supports diverse anxiety-related research and is freely available for use.

Abstract: Anxiety is the unease about a possible future negative outcome. In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding how anxiety relates to our health, well-being, body, mind, and behaviour. This includes work on lexical resources for word-anxiety association. However, there is very little anxiety-related work on larger units of text such as multiword expressions (MWE). Here, we introduce the first large-scale lexicon capturing descriptive norms of anxiety associations for more than 20k English MWEs. We show that the anxiety associations are highly reliable. We use the lexicon to study prevalence of different types of anxiety- and calmness-associated MWEs; and how that varies across two-, three-, and four-word sequences. We also study the extent to which the anxiety association of MWEs is compositional (due to its constituent words). The lexicon enables a wide variety of anxiety-related research in psychology, NLP, public health, and social sciences. The lexicon is freely available: https://saifmohammad.com/worrylex.html

### [217] [Contradiction to Consensus: Dual Perspective, Multi Source Retrieval Based Claim Verification with Source Level Disagreement using LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18693)
*Md Badsha Biswas,Ozlem Uzuner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an open-domain claim verification system using LLMs, multi-perspective evidence retrieval, and cross-source disagreement analysis to improve accuracy and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing claim verification systems rely on single knowledge sources, limiting coverage and transparency due to ignored disagreements.

Method: Proposes ODCV with evidence retrieval for original and negated claims, filtering, deduplication, aggregation from Wikipedia, PubMed, and Google, and LLM-based verification.

Result: Knowledge aggregation improves verification and highlights source-specific reasoning differences.

Conclusion: Embracing diverse, contradictory, and aggregated evidence enhances reliability and transparency in claim verification systems.

Abstract: The spread of misinformation across digital platforms can pose significant societal risks. Claim verification, a.k.a. fact-checking, systems can help identify potential misinformation. However, their efficacy is limited by the knowledge sources that they rely on. Most automated claim verification systems depend on a single knowledge source and utilize the supporting evidence from that source; they ignore the disagreement of their source with others. This limits their knowledge coverage and transparency. To address these limitations, we present a novel system for open-domain claim verification (ODCV) that leverages large language models (LLMs), multi-perspective evidence retrieval, and cross-source disagreement analysis. Our approach introduces a novel retrieval strategy that collects evidence for both the original and the negated forms of a claim, enabling the system to capture supporting and contradicting information from diverse sources: Wikipedia, PubMed, and Google. These evidence sets are filtered, deduplicated, and aggregated across sources to form a unified and enriched knowledge base that better reflects the complexity of real-world information. This aggregated evidence is then used for claim verification using LLMs. We further enhance interpretability by analyzing model confidence scores to quantify and visualize inter-source disagreement. Through extensive evaluation on four benchmark datasets with five LLMs, we show that knowledge aggregation not only improves claim verification but also reveals differences in source-specific reasoning. Our findings underscore the importance of embracing diversity, contradiction, and aggregation in evidence for building reliable and transparent claim verification systems

### [218] [Semantic Substrate Theory: An Operator-Theoretic Framework for Geometric Semantic Drift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18699)
*Stephen Russell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework for semantic drift signals, combining embedding geometry and diffusion, introducing measures like node-level neighborhood drift and bridge mass, with empirical validation left for future work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a shared explanatory theory linking various semantic drift signals, such as embedding displacement and neighbor changes.

Method: Introduces a time-indexed substrate combining embedding geometry with local diffusion, measures like neighborhood drift, coarse Ricci curvature, and recursive drift, and proposes bridge mass as a predictor.

Result: The paper formalizes the model, assumptions, and tests but defers empirical performance evaluation to later studies.

Conclusion: The framework provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing semantic drift, with practical validation pending.

Abstract: Most semantic drift studies report multiple signals e.g., embedding displacement, neighbor changes, distributional divergence, and recursive trajectory instability, without a shared explanatory theory that relates them. This paper proposes a formalization of these signals in one time-indexed substrate, $S_t=(X,d_t,P_t)$, combining embedding geometry with local diffusion. Within this substrate, node-level neighborhood drift measures changes in local conditional distributions, coarse Ricci curvature measures local contractivity of semantic diffusion, and recursive drift probes stability of iterated semantic operators. This manuscript specifies the formal model, assumptions, and tests that can refute the model. Herein, the paper introduces bridge mass, a node-level aggregate of incident negative curvature, as a predictor of future neighborhood rewiring. This paper provides the theory and test contracts; empirical performance is deferred to subsequent studies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReHear is a framework integrating a large language model (LLM) into semi-supervised ASR training to refine noisy pseudo-labels using audio and text, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address confirmation bias and error accumulation in pseudo-labeling for ASR by leveraging audio-aware LLMs.

Method: Iterative pseudo-label refinement using an instruction-tuned, audio-aware LLM conditioned on ASR hypotheses and source audio.

Result: ReHear reduces error propagation and consistently outperforms supervised and pseudo-labeling baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves ASR performance by refining pseudo-labels iteratively.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning in automatic speech recognition (ASR) typically relies on pseudo-labeling, which often suffers from confirmation bias and error accumulation due to noisy supervision. To address this limitation, we propose ReHear, a framework for iterative pseudo-label refinement that integrates an instruction-tuned, audio-aware large language model (LLM) into the self-training loop. Unlike conventional text-based correctors, our approach conditions the LLM on both the ASR hypothesis and the source audio, allowing it to recover phonetically accurate transcripts even from severe recognition errors. These refined pseudo-labels serve as high-fidelity targets for fine-tuning the ASR model in an iterative cycle. Experimental results across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ReHear effectively mitigates error propagation, consistently outperforming both supervised and pseudo-labeling baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoRAG reformulates RAG as a cooperative multi-agent system, improving generation stability and performance without heavy reliance on reranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the asymmetric dependency in RAG systems where generation quality heavily relies on reranking results.

Method: Proposes CoRAG, a framework where the reranker and generator cooperate as peer decision-makers, jointly optimized for a shared task objective.

Result: CoRAG shows good generalization and improved generation stability, even with limited training data (10K PopQA samples).

Conclusion: CoRAG effectively overcomes the limitations of traditional RAG systems by fostering cooperation between the reranker and generator.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in knowledge-intensive tasks by grounding language generation in external evidence. Despite its success, many existing RAG systems are built based on a ranking-centric, asymmetric dependency paradigm, where the generation quality of the generator is highly dependent on reranking results of the reranker. To overcome this limitation, we reformulate RAG as a cooperative multi-agent decision-making problem and propose Cooperative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CoRAG), a framework in which the reranker and the generator act as peer decision-makers rather than being connected through an asymmetric dependency pipeline. By jointly optimizing their behaviors toward a shared task objective, the reranker and generator are encouraged to cooperate, ensuring that document reranking and generation work in concert to improve the final response. Experimental results demonstrate good generalization and improved generation stability of CoRAG, even when the model is trained on only around 10K PopQA samples. Our model released in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CoRAG-D63F

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ArabicNumBench evaluates 71 language models on Arabic number reading tasks, revealing performance variations and the effectiveness of few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess large language models' ability to handle Arabic number reading tasks across different numeral systems and contexts.

Method: Evaluation of 71 models using four prompting strategies (zero-shot, zero-shot CoT, few-shot, few-shot CoT) on 210 tasks covering six categories.

Result: Accuracy ranges from 14.29% to 99.05%, with few-shot CoT outperforming zero-shot (80.06% vs 28.76%). Most high-accuracy models lack structured output.

Conclusion: Numerical accuracy and instruction-following are distinct capabilities. Benchmarks guide model selection for Arabic NLP systems.

Abstract: We present ArabicNumBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language models on Arabic number reading tasks across Eastern Arabic-Indic numerals (0-9 in Arabic script) and Western Arabic numerals (0-9). We evaluate 71 models from 10 providers using four prompting strategies (zero-shot, zero-shot CoT, few-shot, few-shot CoT) on 210 number reading tasks spanning six contextual categories: pure numerals, addresses, dates, quantities, and prices. Our evaluation comprises 59,010 individual test cases and tracks extraction methods to measure structured output generation. Evaluation reveals substantial performance variation, with accuracy ranging from 14.29\% to 99.05\% across models and strategies. Few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting achieves 2.8x higher accuracy than zero-shot approaches (80.06\% vs 28.76\%). A striking finding emerges: models achieving elite accuracy (98-99\%) often produce predominantly unstructured output, with most responses lacking Arabic CoT markers. Only 6 models consistently generate structured output across all test cases, while the majority require fallback extraction methods despite high numerical accuracy. Comprehensive evaluation of 281 model-strategy combinations demonstrates that numerical accuracy and instruction-following represent distinct capabilities, establishing baselines for Arabic number comprehension and providing actionable guidance for model selection in production Arabic NLP systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BURMESE-SAN is the first benchmark evaluating LLMs for Burmese across NLU, NLR, and NLG, with seven subtasks. It ensures linguistic quality via native-speaker input and highlights challenges like morphology and limited pretraining. Results show architectural design and regional tuning matter more than scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of systematic evaluation benchmarks for Burmese LLMs, BURMESE-SAN aims to fill gaps in understanding, reasoning, and generation tasks for low-resource languages.

Method: Constructed through native-speaker-driven processes, BURMESE-SAN includes seven subtasks (e.g., QA, sentiment analysis). Evaluates open-weight and commercial LLMs, focusing on linguistic and cultural authenticity.

Result: Burmese performance hinges on architecture, language representation, and instruction tuning, not just model scale. Regional fine-tuning and newer models show significant improvements.

Conclusion: BURMESE-SAN provides a robust benchmark for Burmese LLMs, emphasizing the need for localized approaches and released as a public leaderboard to foster progress in low-resource languages.

Abstract: We introduce BURMESE-SAN, the first holistic benchmark that systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) for Burmese across three core NLP competencies: understanding (NLU), reasoning (NLR), and generation (NLG). BURMESE-SAN consolidates seven subtasks spanning these competencies, including Question Answering, Sentiment Analysis, Toxicity Detection, Causal Reasoning, Natural Language Inference, Abstractive Summarization, and Machine Translation, several of which were previously unavailable for Burmese. The benchmark is constructed through a rigorous native-speaker-driven process to ensure linguistic naturalness, fluency, and cultural authenticity while minimizing translation-induced artifacts. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of both open-weight and commercial LLMs to examine challenges in Burmese modeling arising from limited pretraining coverage, rich morphology, and syntactic variation. Our results show that Burmese performance depends more on architectural design, language representation, and instruction tuning than on model scale alone. In particular, Southeast Asia regional fine-tuning and newer model generations yield substantial gains. Finally, we release BURMESE-SAN as a public leaderboard to support systematic evaluation and sustained progress in Burmese and other low-resource languages. https://leaderboard.sea-lion.ai/detailed/MY

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EvalSense is a flexible framework for evaluating LLMs, offering tools to simplify method selection and assess reliability, demonstrated in a clinical note generation case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics fail for open-ended LLM tasks, and LLM-based evaluations are complex and prone to bias. EvalSense addresses these challenges.

Method: EvalSense includes an interactive guide for method selection and automated meta-evaluation tools using perturbed data.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in clinical note generation from dialogues, with open-source availability.

Conclusion: EvalSense provides a robust, adaptable solution for domain-specific LLM evaluation.

Abstract: Robust and comprehensive evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is essential for identifying effective LLM system configurations and mitigating risks associated with deploying LLMs in sensitive domains. However, traditional statistical metrics are poorly suited to open-ended generation tasks, leading to growing reliance on LLM-based evaluation methods. These methods, while often more flexible, introduce additional complexity: they depend on carefully chosen models, prompts, parameters, and evaluation strategies, making the evaluation process prone to misconfiguration and bias. In this work, we present EvalSense, a flexible, extensible framework for constructing domain-specific evaluation suites for LLMs. EvalSense provides out-of-the-box support for a broad range of model providers and evaluation strategies, and assists users in selecting and deploying suitable evaluation methods for their specific use-cases. This is achieved through two unique components: (1) an interactive guide aiding users in evaluation method selection and (2) automated meta-evaluation tools that assess the reliability of different evaluation approaches using perturbed data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EvalSense in a case study involving the generation of clinical notes from unstructured doctor-patient dialogues, using a popular open dataset. All code, documentation, and assets associated with EvalSense are open-source and publicly available at https://github.com/nhsengland/evalsense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches for scientific discovery lack systematic training; DeepInnovator aims to systematically trigger innovative capability.

Method: Uses automated data extraction from scientific literature and a 'Next Idea Prediction' training paradigm for iterative idea refinement.

Result: DeepInnovator-14B achieves win rates of 80.53%-93.81%, performing comparably to leading LLMs.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable training pathway for research agents with genuine innovative capability, with plans to open-source data.

Abstract: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in accelerating scientific discovery has garnered increasing attention, with a key focus on constructing research agents endowed with innovative capability, i.e., the ability to autonomously generate novel and significant research ideas. Existing approaches predominantly rely on sophisticated prompt engineering and lack a systematic training paradigm. To address this, we propose DeepInnovator, a training framework designed to trigger the innovative capability of LLMs. Our approach comprises two core components. (1) ``Standing on the shoulders of giants''. We construct an automated data extraction pipeline to extract and organize structured research knowledge from a vast corpus of unlabeled scientific literature. (2) ``Conjectures and refutations''. We introduce a ``Next Idea Prediction'' training paradigm, which models the generation of research ideas as an iterative process of continuously predicting, evaluating, and refining plausible and novel next idea. Both automatic and expert evaluations demonstrate that our DeepInnovator-14B significantly outperforms untrained baselines, achieving win rates of 80.53\%-93.81\%, and attains performance comparable to that of current leading LLMs. This work provides a scalable training pathway toward building research agents with genuine, originative innovative capability, and will open-source the dataset to foster community advancement.

*Abhinaba Basu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights the inefficiency of existing caching methods for personal AI agents, introducing a new framework (W5H2) and dataset (NyayaBench v2) to improve cache-key evaluation, achieving significant cost reductions and accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing caching methods for personal AI agents are ineffective, with low accuracy benchmarks (e.g., GPTCache: 37.9%, APC: 0-12%). The root issue is optimizing for classification accuracy instead of key consistency and precision.

Method: Proposes W5H2, a structured intent decomposition framework, and uses SetFit with minimal examples per class (~8) for efficient cache-key evaluation. Evaluates on datasets like MASSIVE, BANKING77, CLINC150, and NyayaBench v2.

Result: Achieves 91.1%+/-1.7% accuracy on MASSIVE (~2ms), outperforming GPTCache (37.9%) and large LLMs (68.8% at 3,447ms). Handles 85% interactions locally, projecting 97.5% cost reduction.

Conclusion: W5H2 and SetFit significantly improve cache-key evaluation, enabling cost-effective and accurate AI agent interactions with risk-controlled guarantees.

Abstract: Personal AI agents incur substantial cost via repeated LLM calls. We show existing caching methods fail: GPTCache achieves 37.9% accuracy on real benchmarks; APC achieves 0-12%. The root cause is optimizing for the wrong property -- cache effectiveness requires key consistency and precision,
  not classification accuracy. We observe cache-key evaluation reduces to clustering evaluation and apply V-measure decomposition to separate these on n=8,682 points across MASSIVE, BANKING77, CLINC150, and NyayaBench v2, our new 8,514-entry multilingual agentic dataset (528 intents, 20 W5H2 classes, 63 languages). We introduce W5H2, a structured intent decomposition framework. Using SetFit with 8 examples per class, W5H2 achieves 91.1%+/-1.7% on MASSIVE in ~2ms -- vs 37.9% for
  GPTCache and 68.8% for a 20B-parameter LLM at 3,447ms. On NyayaBench v2 (20 classes), SetFit achieves 55.3%, with cross-lingual transfer across 30 languages. Our five-tier cascade handles 85% of interactions locally, projecting 97.5% cost reduction. We provide risk-controlled selective prediction guarantees via RCPS with nine bound families.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of sarcasm detection in low-resource languages like Yorùbá, where annotated datasets are scarce, and emphasize the need for culturally informed NLP.

Method: Developed Yor-Sarc, a dataset of 436 instances annotated by three native Yorùbá speakers using a culture-specific protocol, analyzed inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' κ and Cohen's κ), and preserved soft labels for uncertainty-aware modeling.

Result: Achieved substantial to almost perfect inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' κ = 0.7660, pairwise Cohen's κ = 0.6732--0.8743), with 83.3% unanimous consensus and 93.8% raw agreement for one annotator pair.

Conclusion: Yor-Sarc facilitates semantic interpretation and culturally informed NLP research for low-resource African languages, setting a benchmark for sarcasm detection in Yorùbá.

Abstract: Sarcasm detection poses a fundamental challenge in computational semantics, requiring models to resolve disparities between literal and intended meaning. The challenge is amplified in low-resource languages where annotated datasets are scarce or nonexistent. We present \textbf{Yor-Sarc}, the first gold-standard dataset for sarcasm detection in Yorùbá, a tonal Niger-Congo language spoken by over $50$ million people. The dataset comprises 436 instances annotated by three native speakers from diverse dialectal backgrounds using an annotation protocol specifically designed for Yorùbá sarcasm by taking culture into account. This protocol incorporates context-sensitive interpretation and community-informed guidelines and is accompanied by a comprehensive analysis of inter-annotator agreement to support replication in other African languages. Substantial to almost perfect agreement was achieved (Fleiss' $κ= 0.7660$; pairwise Cohen's $κ= 0.6732$--$0.8743$), with $83.3\%$ unanimous consensus. One annotator pair achieved almost perfect agreement ($κ= 0.8743$; $93.8\%$ raw agreement), exceeding a number of reported benchmarks for English sarcasm research works. The remaining $16.7\%$ majority-agreement cases are preserved as soft labels for uncertainty-aware modelling. Yor-Sarc\footnote{https://github.com/toheebadura/yor-sarc} is expected to facilitate research on semantic interpretation and culturally informed NLP for low-resource African languages.

Method: A pipeline with specialized LLM agents identifies domain context, named entities, and jargon, then generates prompts to guide Whisper's decoder without retraining.

Result: The pipeline achieved a 17.0% relative WER reduction (from 0.217 to 0.180) on NBA commentary, with improvements in 40.1% of segments and degradation in only 7.1%.

Conclusion: Prompt-based augmentation offers a practical, scalable alternative to costly fine-tuning for domain adaptation in ASR systems.

Abstract: Domain-specific speech remains a persistent challenge for automatic speech recognition (ASR), even for state-of-the-art systems like OpenAI's Whisper. We introduce Whisper: Courtside Edition, a novel multi-agent large language model (LLM) pipeline that enhances Whisper transcriptions without retraining. The pipeline intercepts Whisper's initial transcript, applies specialized LLM agents for domain context identification, named entity recognition, and jargon detection, and generates compact prompts that guide Whisper's decoder. Evaluated on 421 NBA basketball commentary segments (a domain characterized by dense proper nouns and technical terminology) our best pipeline achieves a statistically significant 17.0% relative reduction in word error rate (WER; from 0.217 to 0.180, p<0.001). Improvements are observed in 40.1% of segments with degradation in only 7.1%, substantially outperforming direct transcript post-editing. These results demonstrate that prompt-based augmentation can deliver scalable domain adaptation for ASR, offering a practical alternative to costly model fine-tuning.

### [228] [Capable but Unreliable: Canonical Path Deviation as a Causal Mechanism of Agent Failure in Long-Horizon Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19008)
*Wilson Y. Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language agents often fail not due to lack of capability but because of stochastic drift from canonical solution paths. Analyzing Toolathlon data shows successful runs adhere more to these paths, suggesting reliability improvements via monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why capable language agents fail on tasks they can solve, focusing on reliability rather than capability failures.

Method: Analyzed 515 model×task units from Toolathlon benchmark, comparing adherence to canonical solution paths between successful and failed runs using Jaccard similarity and robustness checks.

Result: Successful runs adhere more to canonical paths (+0.060 Jaccard, p<0.0001). Off-canonical calls increase likelihood of further deviations (+22.7 percentage points). A monitoring intervention improved success rates by +8.8 points.

Conclusion: Reliability failures stem from stochastic drift; monitoring mid-trajectory adherence offers actionable improvement without capability scaling.

Abstract: Why do language agents fail on tasks they are capable of solving? We argue that many such failures are reliability failures caused by stochastic drift from a task's latent solution structure, not capability failures. Every well-defined tool-use task imposes a canonical solution path (i.e., a convergent set of tool invocations shared across successful runs) and agent success depends critically on whether a trajectory stays within this path's operating envelope. We establish this causally using a natural experiment that holds model capability and task difficulty fixed by construction. We analyze trajectories from the Toolathlon benchmark: 22 frontier models each attempt 108 real-world tool-use tasks across 3 independent runs, yielding 515 model$\times$task units where the same model succeeds on some runs and fails on others due to LLM sampling stochasticity alone. Within these units, successful runs adhere significantly more closely to the canonical solution path than failed runs ($+$0.060 Jaccard, $p<0.0001$, $n=488$ units, 95% CI [+0.043, +0.077]). This result survives six robustness checks including cross-model-family leave-one-out validation. Critically, the causal mechanism is gradual and self-reinforcing: the adherence gap is statistically indistinguishable from zero through the first 50% of the trajectory, ruling out early-branching selection bias, and each off-canonical tool call raises the probability that the next call is also off-canonical by 22.7 percentage points ($\hatβ=+0.227$, $p<0.0001$), more than doubling the baseline rate. These findings imply that agent reliability cannot be improved by capability scaling alone, but offer a highly actionable intervention: a simple monitor that restarts the bottom tercile of runs based on mid-trajectory canonical adherence lifts success rates by $+$8.8 percentage points among intervened runs.

*Zisheng Zhou,Mengqi Zhang,Shiguang Wu,Xiaotian Ye,Chi Zhang,Zhumin Chen,Pengjie Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COIN framework reduces Context Reliance in LLMs, improving editing success by avoiding contextual binding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for robust unstructured editing in LLMs to correct and update parametric knowledge.

Method: Proposes COIN framework to mitigate Context Reliance by focusing on local knowledge scope.

Result: COIN reduces Context Reliance by 45.2% and boosts editing success rate by 23.6%.

Conclusion: Mitigating Context Reliance is crucial for effective unstructured editing in LLMs.

Abstract: Editing Large language models (LLMs) with real-world, unstructured knowledge is essential for correcting and updating their internal parametric knowledge. In this work, we revisit the fundamental next-token prediction (NTP) as a candidate paradigm for unstructured editing. We identify Context Reliance as a critical failure mode of NTP-based approaches, where knowledge acquired from edited text becomes highly dependent on its preceding context, leading to recall failures when that context is absent during inference. This hypothesis is supported by our empirical validation that prepending context during inference recovers knowledge recall. We further theoretically demonstrate that Context Reliance is an inherent consequence of gradient-based optimization, which tends to bind acquired knowledge to a specific aggregated contextual representation. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective COntext-INdependent editing framework (COIN), encouraging model to focus on knowledge within local scope rather than memorizing contextual patterns. Evaluations show that COIN reduces Context Reliance by 45.2% and outperforms strong baselines by 23.6% in editing success rate, highlighting the vital role of mitigating Context Reliance for robust editing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IAPO is a token-efficient post-training framework that uses token-wise advantages based on conditional mutual information to improve reasoning accuracy while reducing verbosity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequence-level reward-shaping methods lack control over reasoning effort allocation across tokens, leading to inefficiency.

Method: Proposes IAPO, which assigns token-wise advantages using conditional mutual information (MI) with the final answer to identify informative steps and suppress low-utility exploration.

Result: IAPO reduces reasoning length by up to 36% while improving accuracy, outperforming existing token-efficient RL methods.

Conclusion: Information-aware advantage shaping is a powerful and general approach for token-efficient post-training.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly rely on long chains of thought to improve accuracy, yet such gains come with substantial inference-time costs. We revisit token-efficient post-training and argue that existing sequence-level reward-shaping methods offer limited control over how reasoning effort is allocated across tokens. To bridge the gap, we propose IAPO, an information-theoretic post-training framework that assigns token-wise advantages based on each token's conditional mutual information (MI) with the final answer. This yields an explicit, principled mechanism for identifying informative reasoning steps and suppressing low-utility exploration. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that our IAPO can induce monotonic reductions in reasoning verbosity without harming correctness. Empirically, IAPO consistently improves reasoning accuracy while reducing reasoning length by up to 36%, outperforming existing token-efficient RL methods across various reasoning datasets. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that information-aware advantage shaping is a powerful and general direction for token-efficient post-training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LVLMs lag behind LLMs in multi-step inference tasks. The paper finds shared neurons between them, proposes SNRF to transfer LLM inference abilities to LVLMs efficiently, and shows improved performance without extensive fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LVLMs and LLMs share internal computations for multi-step inference and leverage this overlap to enhance LVLM performance.

Method: Identifies shared neurons between LLMs and LVLMs, uses causal probing, and introduces SNRF—a low-rank fusion framework—to transfer inference capabilities.

Result: SNRF improves LVLM inference performance on math and perception benchmarks while maintaining perceptual abilities, with minimal parameter changes.

Conclusion: Shared neurons enable efficient transfer of inference skills between LLMs and LVLMs, offering a low-cost way to enhance multimodal models.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly advanced across various domains, yet they still lag behind strong text-only large language models (LLMs) on tasks that require multi-step inference and compositional decision-making. Motivated by their shared transformer architectures, we investigate whether the two model families rely on common internal computation for such inference. At the neuron level, we uncover a surprisingly large overlap: more than half of the top-activated units during multi-step inference are shared between representative LLMs and LVLMs, revealing a modality-invariant inference subspace.
  Through causal probing via activation amplification, we further show that these shared neurons encode consistent and interpretable concept-level effects, demonstrating their functional contribution to inference. Building on this insight, we propose Shared Neuron Low-Rank Fusion (SNRF), a parameter-efficient framework that transfers mature inference circuitry from LLMs to LVLMs. SNRF profiles cross-model activations to identify shared neurons, computes a low-rank approximation of inter-model weight differences, and injects these updates selectively within the shared-neuron subspace. This mechanism strengthens multimodal inference performance with minimal parameter changes and requires no large-scale multimodal fine-tuning.
  Across diverse mathematics and perception benchmarks, SNRF consistently enhances LVLM inference performance while preserving perceptual capabilities. Our results demonstrate that shared neurons form an interpretable bridge between LLMs and LVLMs, enabling low-cost transfer of inference ability into multimodal models.

*Roman Egger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TriTopic is a tri-modal graph framework for topic modeling, addressing limitations like instability and lexical precision loss in BERTopic. It outperforms benchmarks with higher NMI and 100% corpus coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome stochastic instability, Embedding Blur, and single-data-perspective reliance in existing topic modeling approaches.

Method: TriTopic uses a tri-modal graph (semantic embeddings, TF-IDF, metadata), hybrid graph construction, Consensus Leiden Clustering, and Iterative Refinement.

Result: Achieves highest NMI (0.575 vs. 0.513 for BERTopic), 100% corpus coverage, and 0% outliers.

Conclusion: TriTopic is a robust, open-source alternative outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Topic modeling extracts latent themes from large text collections, but leading approaches like BERTopic face critical limitations: stochastic instability, loss of lexical precision ("Embedding Blur"), and reliance on a single data perspective.
  We present TriTopic, a framework that addresses these weaknesses through a tri-modal graph fusing semantic embeddings, TF-IDF, and metadata. Three core innovations drive its performance: hybrid graph construction via Mutual kNN and Shared Nearest Neighbors to eliminate noise and combat the curse of dimensionality; Consensus Leiden Clustering for reproducible, stable partitions; and Iterative Refinement that sharpens embeddings through dynamic centroid-pulling. TriTopic also replaces the "average document" concept with archetype-based topic representations defined by boundary cases rather than centers alone.
  In benchmarks across 20 Newsgroups, BBC News, AG News, and Arxiv, TriTopic achieves the highest NMI on every dataset (mean NMI 0.575 vs. 0.513 for BERTopic, 0.416 for NMF, 0.299 for LDA), guarantees 100% corpus coverage with 0% outliers, and is available as an open-source PyPI library.

*Seong Hah Cho,Junyi Li,Anna Leshinskaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether LLMs distinguish moral, grammatical, and economic values, finding pervasive entanglement, especially moral influence on other values, which is corrected by targeted ablation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically measure how LLMs represent values and determine if they differentiate between moral, grammatical, and economic values, as humans do.

Method: Probing model behavior, embeddings, and residual stream activations; using selective ablation of activation vectors to address value entanglement.

Result: LLMs conflate moral, grammatical, and economic values, with moral values overly influencing the others. Selective ablation reduces this entanglement.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit value entanglement, but targeted interventions can improve their differentiation of value types.

Abstract: Value alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires us to empirically measure these models' actual, acquired representation of value. Among the characteristics of value representation in humans is that they distinguish among value of different kinds. We investigate whether LLMs likewise distinguish three different kinds of good: moral, grammatical, and economic. By probing model behavior, embeddings, and residual stream activations, we report pervasive cases of value entanglement: a conflation between these distinct representations of value. Specifically, both grammatical and economic valuation was found to be overly influenced by moral value, relative to human norms. This conflation was repaired by selective ablation of the activation vectors associated with morality.

*Kainan Liu,Yong Zhang,Ning Cheng,Yun Zhu,Yanmeng Wang,Shaojun Wang,Jing Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Astra is a novel PEFT method that uses tail eigenvectors of model output activations to improve fine-tuning efficiency and performance, surpassing existing methods and full fine-tuning in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods like LoRA under-utilize activation subspaces for tail eigenvectors, leading to suboptimal performance. Astra aims to address this gap.

Method: Astra constructs task-adaptive low-rank adapters using tail eigenvectors from model output activations, estimated from a small calibration set, to constrain updates.

Result: Astra achieves faster convergence and better performance with fewer parameters, outperforming PEFT baselines and full fine-tuning in 16 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Astra effectively leverages tail eigenvectors for efficient and superior fine-tuning, demonstrating broad applicability in NLU and NLG tasks.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, especially LoRA, are widely used for adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks due to their computational and storage efficiency. However, in the context of LoRA and its variants, the potential of activation subspaces corresponding to tail eigenvectors remains substantially under-exploited, which may lead to suboptimal fine-tuning performance. In this work, we propose Astra (Activation-Space Tail-Eigenvector Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel PEFT method that leverages the tail eigenvectors of the model output activations-estimated from a small task-specific calibration set-to construct task-adaptive low-rank adapters. By constraining updates to the subspace spanned by these tail eigenvectors, Astra achieves faster convergence and improved downstream performance with a significantly reduced parameter budget. Extensive experiments across natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks demonstrate that Astra consistently outperforms existing PEFT baselines across 16 benchmarks and even surpasses full fine-tuning (FFT) in certain scenarios.

*Michael McCoubrey,Angelo Salatino,Francesco Osborne,Enrico Motta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs encode scientific quality using sparse autoencoders to extract features, identifying four key aspects related to research methodologies, publication types, impact fields, and scientific jargon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms by which LLMs evaluate scientific quality, which remains poorly understood despite their growing use in assessing and generating research.

Method: The study employs sparse autoencoders to extract monosemantic features from LLMs and assesses their predictive power across tasks like predicting citation counts, journal SJR, and h-index.

Result: LLMs encode features tied to four dimensions of scientific quality: research methodologies, publication types (e.g., literature reviews), high-impact fields, and scientific jargon.

Conclusion: This work advances understanding of how LLMs represent research quality, identifying recurring feature types that capture key aspects of scientific impact.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing use of generative AI, and large language models (LLMs) in particular, to support both the assessment and generation of scientific work. Although some studies have shown that LLMs can, to a certain extent, evaluate research according to perceived quality, our understanding of the internal mechanisms that enable this capability remains limited. This paper presents the first study that investigates how LLMs encode the concept of scientific quality through relevant monosemantic features extracted using sparse autoencoders. We derive such features under different experimental settings and assess their ability to serve as predictors across three tasks related to research quality: predicting citation count, journal SJR, and journal h-index. The results indicate that LLMs encode features associated with multiple dimensions of scientific quality. In particular, we identify four recurring types of features that capture key aspects of how research quality is represented: 1) features reflecting research methodologies; 2) features related to publication type, with literature reviews typically exhibiting higher impact; 3) features associated with high-impact research fields and technologies; and 4) features corresponding to specific scientific jargons. These findings represent an important step toward understanding how LLMs encapsulate concepts related to research quality.

*Qijie You,Wenkai Yu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgenticRAGTracer, an automatically constructed benchmark for Agentic RAG, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks by enabling step-by-step validation and revealing poor performance of top models like GPT-5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack intermediate hop-level questions, limiting failure analysis and fine-grained evaluation, and are manually constructed, restricting scalability.

Method: AgenticRAGTracer is automatically built by large language models, spans multiple domains, and includes 1,305 data points without overlap with existing benchmarks.

Result: Even top models like GPT-5 perform poorly (22.6% EM accuracy on the hardest part), with failures linked to distorted reasoning chains.

Conclusion: AgenticRAGTracer provides a diagnostic tool missing in traditional evaluations, facilitating research and progress in Agentic RAG.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of agent-based methods in recent years, Agentic RAG has undoubtedly become an important research direction. Multi-hop reasoning, which requires models to engage in deliberate thinking and multi-step interaction, serves as a critical testbed for assessing such capabilities. However, existing benchmarks typically provide only final questions and answers, while lacking the intermediate hop-level questions that gradually connect atomic questions to the final multi-hop query. This limitation prevents researchers from analyzing at which step an agent fails and restricts more fine-grained evaluation of model capabilities. Moreover, most current benchmarks are manually constructed, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, while also limiting scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticRAGTracer, the first Agentic RAG benchmark that is primarily constructed automatically by large language models and designed to support step-by-step validation. Our benchmark spans multiple domains, contains 1,305 data points, and has no overlap with existing mainstream benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that even the best large language models perform poorly on our dataset. For instance, GPT-5 attains merely 22.6\% EM accuracy on the hardest portion of our dataset. Hop-aware diagnosis reveals that failures are primarily driven by distorted reasoning chains -- either collapsing prematurely or wandering into over-extension. This highlights a critical inability to allocate steps consistent with the task's logical structure, providing a diagnostic dimension missing in traditional evaluations. We believe our work will facilitate research in Agentic RAG and inspire further meaningful progress in this area. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/YqjMartin/AgenticRAGTracer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a structured dataset for fine-grained analysis of art-historical texts, supporting tasks like NER, RE, and NEL for downstream applications.

Method: Descriptions were gathered from diverse sources, filtered for focus on single artworks, and annotated in three layers with 37 entity types and typed RE links.

Result: FRAME offers a comprehensive dataset with UIMA XMI CAS files, images, and metadata, suitable for benchmarking and fine-tuning NER/RE systems, including LLMs.

Conclusion: FRAME bridges gaps in art-historical data analysis, enabling advanced NLP tasks and knowledge-graph construction.

Abstract: This paper introduces FRAME (Fine-grained Recognition of Art-historical Metadata and Entities), a manually annotated dataset of art-historical image descriptions for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE). Descriptions were collected from museum catalogs, auction listings, open-access platforms, and scholarly databases, then filtered to ensure that each text focuses on a single artwork and contains explicit statements about its material, composition, or iconography. FRAME provides stand-off annotations in three layers: a metadata layer for object-level properties, a content layer for depicted subjects and motifs, and a co-reference layer linking repeated mentions. Across layers, entity spans are labeled with 37 types and connected by typed RE links between mentions. Entity types are aligned with Wikidata to support Named Entity Linking (NEL) and downstream knowledge-graph construction. The dataset is released as UIMA XMI Common Analysis Structure (CAS) files with accompanying images and bibliographic metadata, and can be used to benchmark and fine-tune NER and RE systems, including zero- and few-shot setups with Large Language Models (LLMs).

*Wenqiu Tang,Zhen Wan,Takahiro Komamizu,Ichiro Ide*

TL;DR: The paper introduces a contrastive Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE) framework for precise personality control in Role-Playing Agents, outperforming existing methods like Contrastive Activation Addition and prompt-only baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for personality control in RPAs, such as supervised fine-tuning or prompt-based approaches, face limitations like inflexibility or inconsistency in long dialogues. The study aims to address these issues with a more stable and interpretable solution.

Method: A contrastive SAE framework learns facet-level personality control vectors aligned with the Big Five model. These vectors are integrated into the model's residual space and dynamically selected by a trait-activated routing module. A new 15,000-sample corpus ensures balanced supervision.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the SAE framework maintains stable character fidelity and output quality, outperforming baseline methods. The SAE+Prompt combination achieves the best performance.

Conclusion: The proposed SAE framework enhances persona control while preserving dialogue coherence, offering a more precise and flexible solution compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Personality control in Role-Playing Agents (RPAs) is commonly achieved via training-free methods that inject persona descriptions and memory through prompts or retrieval-augmented generation, or via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on persona-specific corpora. While SFT can be effective, it requires persona-labeled data and retraining for new roles, limiting flexibility. In contrast, prompt- and RAG-based signals are easy to apply but can be diluted in long dialogues, leading to drifting and sometimes inconsistent persona behavior. To address this, we propose a contrastive Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE) framework that learns facet-level personality control vectors aligned with the Big Five 30-facet model. A new 15,000-sample leakage-controlled corpus is constructed to provide balanced supervision for each facet. The learned vectors are integrated into the model's residual space and dynamically selected by a trait-activated routing module, enabling precise and interpretable personality steering. Experiments on Large Language Models (LLMs) show that the proposed method maintains stable character fidelity and output quality across contextualized settings, outperforming Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and prompt-only baselines. The combined SAE+Prompt configuration achieves the best overall performance, confirming that contrastively trained latent vectors can enhance persona control while preserving dialogue coherence.

TL;DR: The paper critiques the uncritical use of LLMs in social science research, proposing a history-conditioned task to evaluate linguistic discrepancies between LLM and human outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the methodological risks posed by naive LLM use in social science, emphasizing the need for authenticity in synthetic data.

Method: A history-conditioned reply prediction task on Twitter data is introduced, comparing LLM and human outputs using stylistic and content-based metrics.

Result: Significant linguistic discrepancies are found, underscoring the need for better prompting and specialized datasets.

Conclusion: Sophisticated techniques and tailored datasets are essential for accurate LLM use in computational social science.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as proxies for human participants in social science research presents a promising, yet methodologically risky, paradigm shift. While LLMs offer scalability and cost-efficiency, their "naive" application, where they are prompted to generate content without explicit behavioral constraints, introduces significant linguistic discrepancies that challenge the validity of research findings. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a novel, history-conditioned reply prediction task on authentic X (formerly Twitter) data, to create a dataset designed to evaluate the linguistic output of LLMs against human-generated content. We analyze these discrepancies using stylistic and content-based metrics, providing a quantitative framework for researchers to assess the quality and authenticity of synthetic data. Our findings highlight the need for more sophisticated prompting techniques and specialized datasets to ensure that LLM-generated content accurately reflects the complex linguistic patterns of human communication, thereby improving the validity of computational social science studies.

*Raihan Tanvir,Md. Golam Rabiul Alam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhanced framework (xDORA) for detecting hateful memes in Bengali, addressing data scarcity and code-mixing challenges through dataset augmentation and multimodal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hateful multimodal memes pose detection challenges in low-resource languages like Bengali due to limited annotated data, class imbalance, and code-mixing.

Method: The authors augment the Bengali Hateful Memes dataset, propose xDORA (integrating vision and text encoders), and introduce FAISS-based classifiers and RAG-Fused DORA for retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Result: xDORA achieves F1-scores of 0.78 (hateful meme identification) and 0.71 (target entity detection), with RAG-Fused DORA improving to 0.79 and 0.74. FAISS-based classifiers show robustness, while LLaVA performs poorly without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Supervised, retrieval-augmented, and non-parametric frameworks effectively address linguistic and cultural complexities in low-resource hate speech detection.

Abstract: Hateful content on social media increasingly appears as multimodal memes that combine images and text to convey harmful narratives. In low-resource languages such as Bengali, automated detection remains challenging due to limited annotated data, class imbalance, and pervasive code-mixing. To address these issues, we augment the Bengali Hateful Memes (BHM) dataset with semantically aligned samples from the Multimodal Aggression Dataset in Bengali (MIMOSA), improving both class balance and semantic diversity. We propose the Enhanced Dual Co-attention Framework (xDORA), integrating vision encoders (CLIP, DINOv2) and multilingual text encoders (XGLM, XLM-R) via weighted attention pooling to learn robust cross-modal representations. Building on these embeddings, we develop a FAISS-based k-nearest neighbor classifier for non-parametric inference and introduce RAG-Fused DORA, which incorporates retrieval-driven contextual reasoning. We further evaluate LLaVA under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented prompting settings. Experiments on the extended dataset show that xDORA (CLIP + XLM-R) achieves macro-average F1-scores of 0.78 for hateful meme identification and 0.71 for target entity detection, while RAG-Fused DORA improves performance to 0.79 and 0.74, yielding gains over the DORA baseline. The FAISS-based classifier performs competitively and demonstrates robustness for rare classes through semantic similarity modeling. In contrast, LLaVA exhibits limited effectiveness in few-shot settings, with only modest improvements under retrieval augmentation, highlighting constraints of pretrained vision-language models for code-mixed Bengali content without fine-tuning. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of supervised, retrieval-augmented, and non-parametric multimodal frameworks for addressing linguistic and cultural complexities in low-resource hate speech detection.

Conclusion: PR2 effectively enhances personalized QA by leveraging adaptive retrieval-reasoning policies, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Personalization in Question Answering (QA) requires answers that are both accurate and aligned with users' background, preferences, and historical context. Existing state-of-the-art methods primarily rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) solutions that construct personal context by retrieving relevant items from the user's profile. Existing methods use the user's query directly to retrieve personal documents, and such strategies often lead to surface-level personalization. We propose PR2 (Personalized Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning), a reinforcement learning framework that integrates reasoning and retrieval from personal context for personalization. PR2 learns adaptive retrieval-reasoning policies, determining when to retrieve, what evidence to retrieve from user profiles, and how to incorporate it into intermediate reasoning steps. By optimizing multi-turn reasoning trajectories under a personalized reward function, the framework reinforces reasoning paths that better align with user-specific preferences and contextual signals reflected by the reward model. Extensive experiments on the LaMP-QA benchmark using three LLMs show that PR2 consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 8.8%-12% in personalized QA.

*Dongming Jiang,Yi Li,Songtao Wei,Jinxin Yang,Ayushi Kishore,Alysa Zhao,Dingyi Kang,Xu Hu,Feng Chen,Qiannan Li,Bingzhe Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey analyzes agentic memory systems in LLM agents, highlighting their potential for long-term reasoning but pointing out fragile empirical foundations, misaligned metrics, and overlooked costs. It proposes a taxonomy and identifies key challenges for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of agentic memory systems in LLMs, which currently suffer from empirical weaknesses, misaligned metrics, and overlooked system costs.

Method: The survey introduces a taxonomy of MAG systems based on four memory structures and analyzes limitations like benchmark saturation, metric validity, backbone dependence, and overhead costs.

Result: The survey reveals that current agentic memory systems often underperform due to empirical limitations, misaligned evaluation practices, and system inefficiencies.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that addressing the identified issues—like benchmark design, metric alignment, and system costs—can lead to more reliable evaluation and scalable agentic memory systems.

Abstract: Agentic memory systems enable large language model (LLM) agents to maintain state across long interactions, supporting long-horizon reasoning and personalization beyond fixed context windows. Despite rapid architectural development, the empirical foundations of these systems remain fragile: existing benchmarks are often underscaled, evaluation metrics are misaligned with semantic utility, performance varies significantly across backbone models, and system-level costs are frequently overlooked. This survey presents a structured analysis of agentic memory from both architectural and system perspectives. We first introduce a concise taxonomy of MAG systems based on four memory structures. Then, we analyze key pain points limiting current systems, including benchmark saturation effects, metric validity and judge sensitivity, backbone-dependent accuracy, and the latency and throughput overhead introduced by memory maintenance. By connecting the memory structure to empirical limitations, this survey clarifies why current agentic memory systems often underperform their theoretical promise and outlines directions for more reliable evaluation and scalable system design.

*Isun Chehreh,Ebrahim Ansari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a balanced Persian social media dataset (36,000 posts across 9 categories) and benchmarks various models, showing transformer-based models (especially TookaBERT-Large) outperform traditional ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of comprehensive Persian social media datasets for text classification.

Method: Data collection from Persian platforms, preprocessing, hybrid annotation (ChatGPT + human), undersampling, data augmentation, and benchmarking multiple models (BiLSTM, XLM-RoBERTa, FaBERT, SBERT, TookaBERT).

Result: Transformer models performed best, with TookaBERT-Large achieving highest scores (Precision: 0.9622, Recall: 0.9621, F1-score: 0.9621). Social/political texts had slightly lower scores due to ambiguity.

Conclusion: The dataset and model evaluations provide a foundation for Persian NLP advancements, supporting trend analysis and social behavior modeling. Dataset is publicly available.

Abstract: This research introduces the first large-scale, well-balanced Persian social media text classification dataset, specifically designed to address the lack of comprehensive resources in this domain. The dataset comprises 36,000 posts across nine categories (Economic, Artistic, Sports, Political, Social, Health, Psychological, Historical, and Science & Technology), each containing 4,000 samples to ensure balanced class distribution. Data collection involved 60,000 raw posts from various Persian social media platforms, followed by rigorous preprocessing and hybrid annotation combining ChatGPT-based few-shot prompting with human verification. To mitigate class imbalance, we employed undersampling with semantic redundancy removal and advanced data augmentation strategies integrating lexical replacement and generative prompting. We benchmarked several models, including BiLSTM, XLM-RoBERTa (with LoRA and AdaLoRA adaptations), FaBERT, SBERT-based architectures, and the Persian-specific TookaBERT (Base and Large). Experimental results show that transformer-based models consistently outperform traditional neural networks, with TookaBERT-Large achieving the best performance (Precision: 0.9622, Recall: 0.9621, F1- score: 0.9621). Class-wise evaluation further confirms robust performance across all categories, though social and political texts exhibited slightly lower scores due to inherent ambiguity. This research presents a new high-quality dataset and provides comprehensive evaluations of cutting-edge models, establishing a solid foundation for further developments in Persian NLP, including trend analysis, social behavior modeling, and user classification. The dataset is publicly available to support future research endeavors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates LLMs' ability to predict perceived message effectiveness (PME) for smoking cessation messages, finding that LLM-based digital twins outperform other models by incorporating personal characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve personalized smoking cessation interventions by accurately predicting PME for messages delivered via mHealth platforms.

Method: Compared supervised learning, zero/few-shot LLMs, and LLM-based digital twins for PME prediction across content quality, coping support, and quitting support domains using a dataset of 3010 message ratings from young adult smokers.

Result: Digital twins outperformed other models (12-13% higher accuracy), achieving accuracies of 0.49–0.45 and directional accuracies of 0.75–0.66 on a simplified scale, with improved sensitivity to individual differences.

Conclusion: LLM-based digital twins, integrating personal profiles, offer superior PME prediction, enabling more tailored mHealth interventions for smoking cessation and other health behaviors.

Abstract: Perceived message effectiveness (PME) by potential intervention end-users is important for selecting and optimizing personalized smoking cessation intervention messages for mobile health (mHealth) platform delivery. This study evaluates whether large language models (LLMs) can accurately predict PME for smoking cessation messages.
  We evaluated multiple models for predicting PME across three domains: content quality, coping support, and quitting support. The dataset comprised 3010 message ratings (5-point Likert scale) from 301 young adult smokers. We compared (1) supervised learning models trained on labeled data, (2) zero and few-shot LLMs prompted without task-specific fine-tuning, and (3) LLM-based digital twins that incorporate individual characteristics and prior PME histories to generate personalized predictions. Model performance was assessed on three held-out messages per participant using accuracy, Cohen's kappa, and F1.
  LLM-based digital twins outperformed zero and few-shot LLMs (12 percentage points on average) and supervised baselines (13 percentage points), achieving accuracies of 0.49 (content), 0.45 (coping), and 0.49 (quitting), with directional accuracies of 0.75, 0.66, and 0.70 on a simplified 3-point scale. Digital twin predictions showed greater dispersion across rating categories, indicating improved sensitivity to individual differences.
  Integrating personal profiles with LLMs captures person-specific differences in PME and outperforms supervised and zero and few-shot approaches. Improved PME prediction may enable more tailored intervention content in mHealth. LLM-based digital twins show potential for supporting personalization of mobile smoking cessation and other health behavior change interventions.

### [246] [How to Train Your Deep Research Agent? Prompt, Reward, and Policy Optimization in Search-R1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19526)
*Yinuo Xu,Shuo Lu,Jianjie Cheng,Meng Wang,Qianlong Xie,Xingxing Wang,Ran He,Jian Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the role of reinforcement learning (RL) in Deep Research agents by analyzing prompt templates, reward functions, and policy optimization. Key findings include the superiority of the Fast Thinking template, the drawbacks of F1-based rewards, and the effectiveness of REINFORCE over PPO. The study introduces Search-R1++, improving performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to systematically understand how RL enhances Deep Research agents, addressing gaps in prior work by examining specific dimensions like prompt templates and reward functions.

Method: The research decouples RL contributions into three dimensions: prompt template (Fast vs. Slow Thinking), reward function (F1 vs. EM with action-level penalties), and policy optimization (REINFORCE, PPO, GRPO).

Result: Findings show the Fast Thinking template is more stable, EM outperforms F1 when combined with penalties, and REINFORCE is superior to PPO. Search-R1++ improves performance markedly (e.g., 0.403 to 0.442 for Qwen2.5-7B).

Conclusion: The study provides insights for more principled RL training in Deep Research systems, introducing Search-R1++ as a strong baseline. The findings aim to enhance the reliability and performance of such systems.

Abstract: Deep Research agents tackle knowledge-intensive tasks through multi-round retrieval and decision-oriented generation. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to improve performance in this paradigm, its contributions remain underexplored. To fully understand the role of RL, we conduct a systematic study along three decoupled dimensions: prompt template, reward function, and policy optimization. Our study reveals that: 1) the Fast Thinking template yields greater stability and better performance than the Slow Thinking template used in prior work; 2) the F1-based reward underperforms the EM due to training collapse driven by answer avoidance; this can be mitigated by incorporating action-level penalties, ultimately surpassing EM; 3) REINFORCE outperforms PPO while requiring fewer search actions, whereas GRPO shows the poorest stability among policy optimization methods. Building on these insights, we then introduce Search-R1++, a strong baseline that improves the performance of Search-R1 from 0.403 to 0.442 (Qwen2.5-7B) and 0.289 to 0.331 (Qwen2.5-3B). We hope that our findings can pave the way for more principled and reliable RL training strategies in Deep Research systems.

### [247] [Hyper-KGGen: A Skill-Driven Knowledge Extractor for High-Quality Knowledge Hypergraph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19543)
*Rizhuo Huang,Yifan Feng,Rundong Xue,Shihui Ying,Jun-Hai Yong,Chuan Shi,Shaoyi Du,Yue Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hyper-KGGen is a skill-driven framework for constructing high-quality knowledge hypergraphs by dynamically evolving extraction skills. It outperforms baselines and introduces HyperDocRED, a benchmark for document-level extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional knowledge graphs lack the ability to represent complex n-ary facts, and existing hypergraph construction methods struggle with domain-specific jargon and balancing structure with detail.

Method: Hyper-KGGen uses a coarse-to-fine mechanism and adaptive skill acquisition module to distill domain expertise into a Global Skill Library, leveraging stability-based feedback for quality.

Result: Hyper-KGGen significantly outperforms baselines, showing that dynamic skill evolution provides richer guidance than static examples.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the scenario gap in hypergraph construction, offering a scalable solution for diverse domains.

Abstract: Knowledge hypergraphs surpass traditional binary knowledge graphs by encapsulating complex $n$-ary atomic facts, providing a more comprehensive paradigm for semantic representation. However, constructing high-quality hypergraphs remains challenging due to the \textit{scenario gap}: generic extractors struggle to generalize across diverse domains with specific jargon, while existing methods often fail to balance structural skeletons with fine-grained details. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Hyper-KGGen}, a skill-driven framework that reformulates extraction as a dynamic skill-evolving process. First, Hyper-KGGen employs a \textit{coarse-to-fine} mechanism to systematically decompose documents, ensuring full-dimensional coverage from binary links to complex hyperedges. Crucially, it incorporates an \textit{adaptive skill acquisition} module that actively distills domain expertise into a Global Skill Library. This is achieved via a stability-based feedback loop, where extraction stability serves as a relative reward signal to induce high-quality skills from unstable traces and missed predictions. Additionally, we present \textbf{HyperDocRED}, a rigorously annotated benchmark for document-level knowledge hypergraph extraction. Experiments demonstrate that Hyper-KGGen significantly outperforms strong baselines, validating that evolved skills provide substantially richer guidance than static few-shot examples in multi-scenario settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using diverse HTML text extractors improves token yield and downstream task performance compared to fixed extractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pretraining datasets use a single fixed extractor for all webpages, potentially limiting data utilization.

Method: Investigates the impact of extractor variety, comparing fixed and diverse extractors on token yield and task performance.

Result: Union of extractors boosts token yield by 71% without harming benchmark performance; extractor choice affects structured content tasks (up to 10 p.p. difference).

Conclusion: Diverse extractors enhance coverage and performance, suggesting flexibility in preprocessing improves LLM datasets.

Abstract: One of the first pre-processing steps for constructing web-scale LLM pretraining datasets involves extracting text from HTML. Despite the immense diversity of web content, existing open-source datasets predominantly apply a single fixed extractor to all webpages. In this work, we investigate whether this practice leads to suboptimal coverage and utilization of Internet data. We first show that while different extractors may lead to similar model performance on standard language understanding tasks, the pages surviving a fixed filtering pipeline can differ substantially. This suggests a simple intervention: by taking a Union over different extractors, we can increase the token yield of DCLM-Baseline by up to 71% while maintaining benchmark performance. We further show that for structured content such as tables and code blocks, extractor choice can significantly impact downstream task performance, with differences of up to 10 percentage points (p.p.) on WikiTQ and 3 p.p. on HumanEval.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prune-then-Merge, a novel two-stage framework for Visual Document Retrieval, combines adaptive pruning and hierarchical merging to achieve near-lossless compression and robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-vector methods in VDR suffer from high overhead, and current efficiency techniques like pruning and merging alone create a trade-off between compression and feature fidelity.

Method: The proposed framework first prunes low-information patches adaptively, then hierarchically merges the remaining high-signal embeddings.

Result: Experiments on 29 datasets show the framework outperforms existing methods, achieving near-lossless compression and robust performance at high ratios.

Conclusion: Prune-then-Merge effectively balances compression and feature fidelity, advancing VDR performance.

Abstract: Visual Document Retrieval (VDR), which aims to retrieve relevant pages within vast corpora of visually-rich documents, is of significance in current multimodal retrieval applications. The state-of-the-art multi-vector paradigm excels in performance but suffers from prohibitive overhead, a problem that current efficiency methods like pruning and merging address imperfectly, creating a difficult trade-off between compression rate and feature fidelity. To overcome this dilemma, we introduce Prune-then-Merge, a novel two-stage framework that synergizes these complementary approaches. Our method first employs an adaptive pruning stage to filter out low-information patches, creating a refined, high-signal set of embeddings. Subsequently, a hierarchical merging stage compresses this pre-filtered set, effectively summarizing semantic content without the noise-induced feature dilution seen in single-stage methods. Extensive experiments on 29 VDR datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, significantly extending the near-lossless compression range and providing robust performance at high compression ratios.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for TKGQA addressing temporal constraints, multi-hop reasoning, and representation fusion, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TKGQA methods struggle with weak temporal constraint incorporation, limited multi-hop reasoning, and suboptimal fusion of language and graph representations.

Method: The framework includes temporal-aware question encoding, multi-hop graph reasoning via a temporal-aware GNN, and multi-view heterogeneous information fusion.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements over baselines on multiple TKGQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses key challenges in TKGQA, enhancing performance.

Abstract: Question Answering over Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGQA) has attracted growing interest for handling time-sensitive queries. However, existing methods still struggle with: 1) weak incorporation of temporal constraints in question representation, causing biased reasoning; 2) limited ability to perform explicit multi-hop reasoning; and 3) suboptimal fusion of language and graph representations. We propose a novel framework with temporal-aware question encoding, multi-hop graph reasoning, and multi-view heterogeneous information fusion. Specifically, our approach introduces: 1) a constraint-aware question representation that combines semantic cues from language models with temporal entity dynamics; 2) a temporal-aware graph neural network for explicit multi-hop reasoning via time-aware message passing; and 3) a multi-view attention mechanism for more effective fusion of question context and temporal graph knowledge. Experiments on multiple TKGQA benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over multiple baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comparative evaluation of systems is crucial for research decisions and competitive challenges, requiring automation for efficiency and clarity.

Method: DEEP automates execution and scoring, supports dockerized systems, and uses clustering based on statistical significance of results.

Result: Evaluators gain insights into model performance clusters and significance of differences, aided by a visualization web-app.

Conclusion: DEEP enhances system evaluation efficiency and clarity, demonstrated through an exemplary use case.

Abstract: Comparative evaluation of several systems is a recurrent task in researching. It is a key step before deciding which system to use for our work, or, once our research has been conducted, to demonstrate the potential of the resulting model. Furthermore, it is the main task of competitive, public challenges evaluation. Our proposed software (DEEP) automates both the execution and scoring of machine translation and optical character recognition models. Furthermore, it is easily extensible to other tasks. DEEP is prepared to receive dockerized systems, run them (extracting information at that same time), and assess hypothesis against some references. With this approach, evaluators can achieve a better understanding of the performance of each model. Moreover, the software uses a clustering algorithm based on a statistical analysis of the significance of the results yielded by each model, according to the evaluation metrics. As a result, evaluators are able to identify clusters of performance among the swarm of proposals and have a better understanding of the significance of their differences. Additionally, we offer a visualization web-app to ensure that the results can be adequately understood and interpreted. Finally, we present an exemplary case of use of DEEP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eye-tracking datasets are valuable but lack interoperability and transparency across disciplines, hindering reuse and standardization.

Method: The authors compile an extensive overview of datasets, create a living online resource, and integrate datasets into a Python package (pymovements).

Result: The work enhances transparency and simplifies data sharing, promoting FAIR principles and good scientific practices.

Conclusion: This initiative supports reproducibility and replication in eye-tracking research by improving dataset accessibility and standardization.

Abstract: Eye-tracking-while-reading corpora are a valuable resource for many different disciplines and use cases. Use cases range from studying the cognitive processes underlying reading to machine-learning-based applications, such as gaze-based assessments of reading comprehension. The past decades have seen an increase in the number and size of eye-tracking-while-reading datasets as well as increasing diversity with regard to the stimulus languages covered, the linguistic background of the participants, or accompanying psychometric or demographic data. The spread of data across different disciplines and the lack of data sharing standards across the communities lead to many existing datasets that cannot be easily reused due to a lack of interoperability. In this work, we aim at creating more transparency and clarity with regards to existing datasets and their features across different disciplines by i) presenting an extensive overview of existing datasets, ii) simplifying the sharing of newly created datasets by publishing a living overview online, https://dili-lab.github.io/datasets.html, presenting over 45 features for each dataset, and iii) integrating all publicly available datasets into the Python package pymovements which offers an eye-tracking datasets library. By doing so, we aim to strengthen the FAIR principles in eye-tracking-while-reading research and promote good scientific practices, such as reproducing and replicating studies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DUAL, a benchmark for evaluating machine unlearning in LLMs, highlighting differences in unlearning responses between pretrained and SFT models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked differences in forgettability of facts from pretraining versus SFT in machine unlearning for LLMs.

Method: Develops DUAL, a benchmark with 28.6k Wikidata triplets annotated for fact popularity, and compares unlearning in pretrained and SFT models.

Result: SFT models show smoother forgetting, stable tuning, and higher retention, while pretrained models are unstable and prone to relearning or catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: DUAL provides a nuanced evaluation of unlearning, revealing the impact of training stages on forgetting effectiveness.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to remove unsafe or outdated information. However, existing work assumes that all facts are equally forgettable and largely ignores whether the forgotten knowledge originates from pretraining or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this paper, we introduce DUAL (Dual Unlearning Evaluation across Training Stages), a benchmark of 28.6k Wikidata-derived triplets annotated with fact popularity using Wikipedia link counts and LLM-based salience scores. Our experiments show that pretrained and SFT models respond differently to unlearning. An SFT step on the forget data yields smoother forgetting, more stable tuning, and 10-50% higher retention, while direct unlearning on pretrained models remains unstable and prone to relearning or catastrophic forgetting.

TL;DR: KGHaluBench is a new benchmark using Knowledge Graphs to dynamically assess LLM hallucinations comprehensively, addressing biases and providing interpretable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM truthfulness are static and narrow, leading to limited coverage and misleading evaluations.

Method: KGHaluBench dynamically constructs multifaceted questions from Knowledge Graphs, statistically estimates difficulty, and uses an automated verification pipeline to detect hallucinations.

Result: Evaluation of 25 frontier models shows interpretable insights into knowledge factors causing hallucinations across different model sizes.

Conclusion: KGHaluBench offers a fairer, comprehensive, and publicly available tool for assessing LLM truthfulness and hallucination mitigation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess a remarkable capacity to generate persuasive and intelligible language. However, coherence does not equate to truthfulness, as the responses often contain subtle hallucinations. Existing benchmarks are limited by static and narrow questions, leading to limited coverage and misleading evaluations. We present KGHaluBench, a Knowledge Graph-based hallucination benchmark that assesses LLMs across the breadth and depth of their knowledge, providing a fairer and more comprehensive insight into LLM truthfulness. Our framework utilises the KG to dynamically construct challenging, multifaceted questions, whose difficulty is then statistically estimated to address popularity bias. Our automated verification pipeline detects abstentions and verifies the LLM's response at both conceptual and correctness levels to identify different types of hallucinations. We evaluate 25 frontier models, using novel accuracy and hallucination metrics. The results provide a more interpretable insight into the knowledge factors that cause hallucinations across different model sizes. KGHaluBench is publicly available to support future developments in hallucination mitigation.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a mobile and desktop keyboard suite for Idu Mishmi, an endangered Trans-Himalayan language spoken by approximately 11,000 people in Arunachal Pradesh, India. Although a Latin-based orthography was developed in 2018, no digital input tools existed to use it, forcing speakers into ad-hoc romanizations that cannot represent the full writing system. Our keyboards comprise two tools: (1) an Android mobile keyboard, published on the Google Play Store and actively used in teacher training programs, and (2) a Windows desktop keyboard currently undergoing community testing. Both tools support the complete Idu Mishmi character inventory, including schwa, retracted schwa, nasalized vowels, and accented forms. Both operate fully offline with zero network permissions, addressing connectivity constraints and data sovereignty concerns. We describe the design, implementation, and deployment as a replicable model for other endangered language communities.

*Jingzhuo Wu,Jiajun Zhang,Keyan Jin,Dehua Ma,Junbo Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAMAS introduces a dynamic multi-agent system to preserve literary style in translations by quantifying and adapting to stylistic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with preserving unique literary styles in translations, producing generic outputs despite semantic correctness.

Method: SAMAS uses wavelet packet transform to quantify style into Stylistic Feature Spectrum (SFS) and dynamically assembles specialized translation agents.

Result: SAMAS outperforms baselines in style fidelity while maintaining competitive semantic accuracy.

Conclusion: SAMAS effectively preserves literary style in translations through dynamic adaptation.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent and faithful translations. However, they struggle to preserve an author's unique literary style, often producing semantically correct but generic outputs. This limitation stems from the inability of current single-model and static multi-agent systems to perceive and adapt to stylistic variations. To address this, we introduce the Style-Adaptive Multi-Agent System (SAMAS), a novel framework that treats style preservation as a signal processing task. Specifically, our method quantifies literary style into a Stylistic Feature Spectrum (SFS) using the wavelet packet transform. This SFS serves as a control signal to dynamically assemble a tailored workflow of specialized translation agents based on the source text's structural patterns. Extensive experiments on translation benchmarks show that SAMAS achieves competitive semantic accuracy against strong baselines, primarily by leveraging its statistically significant advantage in style fidelity.

TL;DR: SHIELD is a new method for automated safety signal detection in clinical trials by combining disproportionality analysis with semantic clustering of adverse events, using MedDRA embeddings and large language models for interpretable summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance safety assessment and causal interpretation in clinical trials by integrating statistical signal detection with NLP techniques.

Method: SHIELD uses disproportionality analysis (Information Component), semantic clustering of AE terms via MedDRA embeddings, empirical Bayesian shrinkage, and spectral embedding/clustering. It also employs large language models for annotation.

Result: SHIELD successfully recovers known safety signals and produces interpretable, cluster-based summaries in clinical trials.

Conclusion: SHIELD bridges statistical methods and NLP to improve safety signal detection and interpretation in clinical trials.

Abstract: We present SHIELD, a novel methodology for automated and integrated safety signal detection in clinical trials. SHIELD combines disproportionality analysis with semantic clustering of adverse event (AE) terms applied to MedDRA term embeddings. For each AE, the pipeline computes an information-theoretic disproportionality measure (Information Component) with effect size derived via empirical Bayesian shrinkage. A utility matrix is constructed by weighting semantic term-term similarities by signal magnitude, followed by spectral embedding and clustering to identify groups of related AEs. Resulting clusters are annotated with syndrome-level summary labels using large language models, yielding a coherent, data-driven representation of treatment-associated safety profiles in the form of a network graph and hierarchical tree. We implement the SHIELD framework in the context of a single-arm incidence summary, to compare two treatment arms or for the detection of any treatment effect in a multi-arm trial. We illustrate its ability to recover known safety signals and generate interpretable, cluster-based summaries in a real clinical trial example. This work bridges statistical signal detection with modern natural language processing to enhance safety assessment and causal interpretation in clinical trials.

Conclusion: Janus-Q provides consistent, interpretable, and profitable trading decisions by leveraging financial news events effectively.

Abstract: Financial market movements are often driven by discrete financial events conveyed through news, whose impacts are heterogeneous, abrupt, and difficult to capture under purely numerical prediction objectives. These limitations have motivated growing interest in using textual information as the primary source of trading signals in learning-based systems. Two key challenges hinder existing approaches: (1) the absence of large-scale, event-centric datasets that jointly model news semantics and statistically grounded market reactions, and (2) the misalignment between language model reasoning and financially valid trading behavior under dynamic market conditions. To address these challenges, we propose Janus-Q, an end-to-end event-driven trading framework that elevates financial news events from auxiliary signals to primary decision units. Janus-Q unifies event-centric data construction and model optimization under a two-stage paradigm. Stage I focuses on event-centric data construction, building a large-scale financial news event dataset comprising 62,400 articles annotated with 10 fine-grained event types, associated stocks, sentiment labels, and event-driven cumulative abnormal return (CAR). Stage II performs decision-oriented fine-tuning, combining supervised learning with reinforcement learning guided by a Hierarchical Gated Reward Model (HGRM), which explicitly captures trade-offs among multiple trading objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Janus-Q achieves more consistent, interpretable, and profitable trading decisions than market indices and LLM baselines, improving the Sharpe Ratio by up to 102.0% while increasing direction accuracy by over 17.5% compared to the strongest competing strategies.

*Yibo Yan,Jiahao Huo,Guanbo Feng,Mingdong Ou,Yi Cao,Xin Zou,Shuliang Liu,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Yu Huang,Jungang Li,Kening Zheng,Xu Zheng,Philip S. Yu,James Kwok,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey explores Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) in the era of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), focusing on benchmarks, methods (embedding, reranker, and RAG/Agentic systems), and future challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in understanding how visually rich documents, with dense text and complex layouts, can be effectively retrieved using multimodal approaches.

Method: Analyzes VDR through MLLMs, categorizing methods into multimodal embedding, reranker models, and integrating RAG/Agentic systems.

Result: Provides a structured overview of VDR methodologies and benchmarks, highlighting advancements and gaps.

Conclusion: Identifies challenges and future directions to guide progress in multimodal document intelligence.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of multimodal information, Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) has emerged as a critical frontier in bridging the gap between unstructured visually rich data and precise information acquisition. Unlike traditional natural image retrieval, visual documents exhibit unique characteristics defined by dense textual content, intricate layouts, and fine-grained semantic dependencies. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of the VDR landscape, specifically through the lens of the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) era. We begin by examining the benchmark landscape, and subsequently dive into the methodological evolution, categorizing approaches into three primary aspects: multimodal embedding models, multimodal reranker models, and the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic systems for complex document intelligence. Finally, we identify persistent challenges and outline promising future directions, aiming to provide a clear roadmap for future multimodal document intelligence.

### [260] [ReAttn: Improving Attention-based Re-ranking via Attention Re-weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19969)
*Yuxing Tian,Fengran Mo,Weixu Zhang,Yiyan Qi,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReAttn is a post-hoc re-weighting strategy for attention-based re-ranking in LLMs, addressing over-concentration and lexical bias by using cross-document IDF weighting and entropy-based regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention-based re-ranking in LLMs has limitations: overly concentrated attention signals and bias toward lexically similar but irrelevant documents.

Method: ReAttn uses cross-document IDF weighting to reduce lexical bias and entropy-based regularization to balance attention distribution.

Result: The method effectively improves re-ranking by mitigating biases and balancing attention without additional training.

Conclusion: ReAttn enhances attention-based re-ranking by addressing key limitations, offering a practical and efficient solution.

Abstract: The strong capabilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have made them highly effective for zero-shot re-ranking task. Attention-based re-ranking methods, which derive relevance scores directly from attention weights, offer an efficient and interpretable alternative to generation-based re-ranking methods. However, they still face two major limitations. First, attention signals are highly concentrated a small subset of tokens within a few documents, making others indistinguishable. Second, attention often overemphasizes phrases lexically similar to the query, yielding biased rankings that irrelevant documents with mere lexical resemblance are regarded as relevant. In this paper, we propose \textbf{ReAttn}, a post-hoc re-weighting strategy for attention-based re-ranking methods. It first compute the cross-document IDF weighting to down-weight attention on query-overlapping tokens that frequently appear across the candidate documents, reducing lexical bias and emphasizing distinctive terms. It then employs entropy-based regularization to mitigate over-concentrated attention, encouraging a more balanced distribution across informative tokens. Both adjustments operate directly on existing attention weights without additional training or supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

*Yaya Sy,Dioula Doucouré,Christophe Cerisara,Irina Illina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A bilingual speech-text embedding model bridges French and Wolof, enabling efficient retrieval of French text from Wolof speech without costly pipelines, and shows generalization to other tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome language and modality barriers for underrepresented languages like Wolof by enabling direct cross-modal retrieval between speech and text.

Method: Train a bilingual speech-text Matryoshka embedding model, introduce data pipelines and benchmarks, and compare modeling strategies.

Result: Modality fusion within a frozen text Matryoshka model performs best, generalizing to tasks like speech intent detection and showing concentrated information in few components.

Conclusion: The model efficiently bridges speech and text modalities, offering potential for cost-effective improvements in cross-modal retrieval and semantic learning.

Abstract: Speakers of under-represented languages face both a language barrier, as most online knowledge is in a few dominant languages, and a modality barrier, since information is largely text-based while many languages are primarily oral. We address this for French-Wolof by training the first bilingual speech-text Matryoshka embedding model, enabling efficient retrieval of French text from Wolof speech queries without relying on a costly ASR-translation pipelines. We introduce large-scale data curation pipelines and new benchmarks, compare modeling strategies, and show that modality fusion within a frozen text Matryoshka model performs best. Although trained only for retrieval, the model generalizes well to other tasks, such as speech intent detection, indicating the learning of general semantic representations. Finally, we analyze cost-accuracy trade-offs across Matryoshka dimensions and ranks, showing that information is concentrated only in a few components, suggesting potential for efficiency improvements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QuIeTT is a query-independent table transformation framework that preprocesses raw tables into SQL-ready canonical forms, improving reliability and efficiency in downstream tasks without modifying models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world tables often have irregular schemas and heterogeneous formats, degrading reasoning and question answering reliability. Existing methods entangle cleanup with reasoning, limiting generalization.

Method: QuIeTT performs lossless schema and value normalization, exposes implicit relations, and preserves full provenance via raw table snapshots, decoupling transformation from reasoning.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks show consistent gains across models and reasoning paradigms, with strong improvements on structurally diverse, unseen questions.

Conclusion: QuIeTT provides a reliable and efficient solution for table transformation, enhancing downstream tasks without model modifications.

Abstract: Real-world tables often exhibit irregular schemas, heterogeneous value formats, and implicit relational structure, which degrade the reliability of downstream table reasoning and question answering. Most existing approaches address these issues in a query-dependent manner, entangling table cleanup with reasoning and thus limiting generalization. We introduce QuIeTT, a query-independent table transformation framework that preprocesses raw tables into a single SQL-ready canonical representation before any test-time queries are observed. QuIeTT performs lossless schema and value normalization, exposes implicit relations, and preserves full provenance via raw table snapshots. By decoupling table transformation from reasoning, QuIeTT enables cleaner, more reliable, and highly efficient querying without modifying downstream models. Experiments on four benchmarks, WikiTQ, HiTab, NQ-Table, and SequentialQA show consistent gains across models and reasoning paradigms, with particularly strong improvements on a challenge set of structurally diverse, unseen questions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GENCAT is a new CAT framework using LLMs to analyze open-ended responses, improving adaptability and accuracy in early testing stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAT frameworks miss textual insights from questions and responses, especially for open-ended ones. GENCAT aims to fill this gap.

Method: Uses Generative Item Response Theory (GIRT) trained via fine-tuning and preference optimization. Introduces three question selection algorithms based on uncertainty, diversity, and information.

Result: Outperforms baselines with up to 4.32% AUC improvement in early testing stages on programming datasets.

Conclusion: GENCAT effectively leverages LLMs for better CAT performance, especially in handling open-ended responses.

Abstract: Existing computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) frameworks are typically built on predicting the correctness of a student response to a question. Although effective, this approach fails to leverage textual information in questions and responses, especially for open-ended questions. In this work, we propose GENCAT (\textbf{GEN}erative \textbf{CAT}), a novel CAT framework that leverages Large Language Models for knowledge estimate and question selection. First, we develop a Generative Item Response Theory (GIRT) model that enables us to estimate student knowledge from their open-ended responses and predict responses to unseen questions. We train the model in a two-step process, first via Supervised Fine-Tuning and then via preference optimization for knowledge-response alignment. Second, we introduce three question selection algorithms that leverage the generative capabilities of the GIRT model, based on the uncertainty, linguistic diversity, and information of sampled student responses. Third, we conduct experiments on two real-world programming datasets and demonstrate that GENCAT outperforms existing CAT baselines, achieving an AUC improvement of up to 4.32\% in the key early testing stages.

*Fahmida Liza Piya,Rahmatollah Beheshti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgenticSum is an agentic framework for clinical text summarization using LLMs, reducing hallucinations through structured stages like context selection, generation, verification, and correction. It outperforms vanilla LLMs and baselines in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical text summarization with LLMs faces challenges like factual inconsistency due to document length and noise. AgenticSum aims to address this by improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations.

Method: AgenticSum uses a multi-stage framework: context selection, draft generation, verification via attention signals, and targeted correction under supervision.

Result: Evaluated on public datasets, AgenticSum showed consistent improvements over vanilla LLMs and baselines across reference-based metrics, LLM-as-a-judge, and human evaluation.

Conclusion: Structured, agentic frameworks like AgenticSum with targeted correction effectively enhance clinical summarization accuracy in inference-time applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer substantial promise for automating clinical text summarization, yet maintaining factual consistency remains challenging due to the length, noise, and heterogeneity of clinical documentation. We present AgenticSum, an inference-time, agentic framework that separates context selection, generation, verification, and targeted correction to reduce hallucinated content. The framework decomposes summarization into coordinated stages that compress task-relevant context, generate an initial draft, identify weakly supported spans using internal attention grounding signals, and selectively revise flagged content under supervisory control. We evaluate AgenticSum on two public datasets, using reference-based metrics, LLM-as-a-judge assessment, and human evaluation. Across various measures, AgenticSum demonstrates consistent improvements compared to vanilla LLMs and other strong baselines. Our results indicate that structured, agentic design with targeted correction offers an effective inference time solution to improve clinical note summarization using LLMs.

### [265] [Position: General Alignment Has Hit a Ceiling; Edge Alignment Must Be Taken Seriously](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20042)
*Han Bao,Yue Huang,Xiaoda Wang,Zheyuan Zhang,Yujun Zhou,Carl Yang,Xiangliang Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques current alignment practices for large language models, highlighting flaws in the dominant General Alignment approach. It proposes Edge Alignment as an alternative, emphasizing multi-dimensional values, plural representation, and epistemic mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of General Alignment in handling conflicting values, plural stakeholders, and uncertainty, leading to structural and cognitive issues.

Method: The paper introduces Edge Alignment, structured around seven interdependent pillars divided into three phases, focusing on preserving value structure, democratic representation, and epistemic mechanisms.

Result: The result is a reframing of alignment as a dynamic normative governance problem, addressing challenges in data collection, training, and evaluation.

Conclusion: Edge Alignment offers a more robust framework for aligning language models in complex socio-technical systems, moving beyond scalar reward optimization.

Abstract: Large language models are being deployed in complex socio-technical systems, which exposes limits in current alignment practice. We take the position that the dominant paradigm of General Alignment, which compresses diverse human values into a single scalar reward, reaches a structural ceiling in settings with conflicting values, plural stakeholders, and irreducible uncertainty. These failures follow from the mathematics and incentives of scalarization and lead to \textbf{structural} value flattening, \textbf{normative} representation loss, and \textbf{cognitive} uncertainty blindness. We introduce Edge Alignment as a distinct approach in which systems preserve multi dimensional value structure, support plural and democratic representation, and incorporate epistemic mechanisms for interaction and clarification. To make this approach practical, we propose seven interdependent pillars organized into three phases. We identify key challenges in data collection, training objectives, and evaluation, outlining complementary technical and governance directions. Taken together, these measures reframe alignment as a lifecycle problem of dynamic normative governance rather than as a single instance optimization task.

### [266] [Entropy in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20052)
*Marco Scharringhausen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study compares the word entropy of large language models (LLMs) with that of natural language, finding LLMs have lower entropy. It aims to formalize information uncertainty in LLM training, especially when using LLM-generated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the entropy differences between LLM outputs and natural language, and assess the implications of training LLMs on LLM-generated data.

Method: Analyzed word entropy of LLMs (assumed stationary with constant random distribution) and compared it to natural language from the Open American National Corpus (OANC).

Result: LLMs exhibit lower word entropy than natural language in both written and spoken forms.

Conclusion: Formalizing entropy differences can help evaluate the impact of training LLMs on their own generated data, particularly from web sources.

Abstract: In this study, the output of large language models (LLM) is considered an information source generating an unlimited sequence of symbols drawn from a finite alphabet. Given the probabilistic nature of modern LLMs, we assume a probabilistic model for these LLMs, following a constant random distribution and the source itself thus being stationary. We compare this source entropy (per word) to that of natural language (written or spoken) as represented by the Open American National Corpus (OANC). Our results indicate that the word entropy of such LLMs is lower than the word entropy of natural speech both in written or spoken form. The long-term goal of such studies is to formalize the intuitions of information and uncertainty in large language training to assess the impact of training an LLM from LLM generated training data. This refers to texts from the world wide web in particular.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLM comprehension across diverse languages, finding no consistent advantage for English and highlighting performance gaps compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limited understanding of LLMs' comprehension abilities beyond English and WEIRD languages.

Method: Prompted 3 popular LLMs on a language comprehension task across 12 languages from diverse families.

Result: Models showed high accuracy across languages but lagged behind human baselines; English was outperformed by some Romance languages.

Conclusion: LLM performance varies by factors like tokenization and language distance, challenging assumptions about English dominance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) play a critical role in how humans access information. While their core use relies on comprehending written requests, our understanding of this ability is currently limited, because most benchmarks evaluate LLMs in high-resource languages predominantly spoken by Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) communities. The default assumption is that English is the best-performing language for LLMs, while smaller, low-resource languages are linked to less reliable outputs, even in multilingual, state-of-the-art models. To track variation in the comprehension abilities of LLMs, we prompt 3 popular models on a language comprehension task across 12 languages, representing the Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, Turkic, Sino-Tibetan, and Japonic language families. Our results suggest that the models exhibit remarkable linguistic accuracy across typologically diverse languages, yet they fall behind human baselines in all of them, albeit to different degrees. Contrary to what was expected, English is not the best-performing language, as it was systematically outperformed by several Romance languages, even lower-resource ones. We frame the results by discussing the role of several factors that drive LLM performance, such as tokenization, language distance from Spanish and English, size of training data, and data origin in high- vs. low-resource languages and WEIRD vs. non-WEIRD communities.

### [268] [How Retrieved Context Shapes Internal Representations in RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20091)
*Samuel Yeh,Sharon Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how retrieved documents affect the internal representations in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, revealing insights into LLM behavior and system design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how retrieved documents of varying relevance influence the internal representations of LLMs in RAG systems, filling a gap in prior work focused on output behavior.

Method: The study systematically analyzes hidden states of LLMs under controlled single- and multi-document settings across four QA datasets and three LLMs.

Result: Findings show how context relevancy and layer-wise processing impact internal representations, explaining output behaviors and offering design insights.

Conclusion: The work provides a deeper understanding of RAG systems' internal mechanics, aiding in their optimization and design.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by conditioning generation on retrieved external documents, but the effect of retrieved context is often non-trivial. In realistic retrieval settings, the retrieved document set often contains a mixture of documents that vary in relevance and usefulness. While prior work has largely examined these phenomena through output behavior, little is known about how retrieved context shapes the internal representations that mediate information integration in RAG. In this work, we study RAG through the lens of latent representations. We systematically analyze how different types of retrieved documents affect the hidden states of LLMs, and how these internal representation shifts relate to downstream generation behavior. Across four question-answering datasets and three LLMs, we analyze internal representations under controlled single- and multi-document settings. Our results reveal how context relevancy and layer-wise processing influence internal representations, providing explanations on LLMs output behaviors and insights for RAG system design.

*Lingwei Gu,Nour Jedidi,Jimmy Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how knowledge is encoded in large language models (LLMs) using nanochat models with fully open pre-training data. It introduces NanoKnow, a benchmark dataset to disentangle sources of knowledge LLMs rely on, revealing insights about closed-book accuracy, external evidence, and the impact of non-relevant information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs encode knowledge by leveraging transparent pre-training data from nanochat models.

Method: Release of NanoKnow, a benchmark dataset partitioning questions based on answer presence in pre-training data, and experiments with eight nanochat checkpoints.

Result: Findings include: closed-book accuracy depends on answer frequency; external evidence mitigates frequency dependence; parametric and external knowledge are complementary; non-relevant information harms accuracy.

Conclusion: NanoKnow provides a transparent tool to study LLM knowledge encoding, showing the interplay between parametric and external knowledge and highlighting the impact of non-relevant data.

Abstract: How do large language models (LLMs) know what they know? Answering this question has been difficult because pre-training data is often a "black box" -- unknown or inaccessible. The recent release of nanochat -- a family of small LLMs with fully open pre-training data -- addresses this as it provides a transparent view into where a model's parametric knowledge comes from. Towards the goal of understanding how knowledge is encoded by LLMs, we release NanoKnow, a benchmark dataset that partitions questions from Natural Questions and SQuAD into splits based on whether their answers are present in nanochat's pre-training corpus. Using these splits, we can now properly disentangle the sources of knowledge that LLMs rely on when producing an output. To demonstrate NanoKnow's utility, we conduct experiments using eight nanochat checkpoints. Our findings show: (1) closed-book accuracy is strongly influenced by answer frequency in the pre-training data, (2) providing external evidence can mitigate this frequency dependence, (3) even with external evidence, models are more accurate when answers were seen during pre-training, demonstrating that parametric and external knowledge are complementary, and (4) non-relevant information is harmful, with accuracy decreasing based on both the position and the number of non-relevant contexts. We release all NanoKnow artifacts at https://github.com/castorini/NanoKnow.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KNIGHT is an LLM-based framework that generates high-quality MCQ datasets efficiently using reusable knowledge graphs, evaluated across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the bottleneck in evaluating LLMs by reducing the time and cost of creating specialized assessment datasets.

Method: KNIGHT constructs a topic-specific knowledge graph from external sources to generate MCQs with controlled difficulty levels, avoiding repeated full-text processing.

Result: KNIGHT produces six MCQ datasets in History, Biology, and Mathematics, achieving high quality in fluency, unambiguity, relevance, uniqueness, and answerability.

Conclusion: KNIGHT efficiently generates reusable MCQ datasets, aligns with benchmarks, and supports topic-specific, difficulty-controlled evaluation.

Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), they have become instrumental in applications such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Yet evaluating these systems remains bottlenecked by the time and cost of building specialized assessment datasets. We introduce KNIGHT, an LLM-based, knowledge-graph-driven framework for generating multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets from external sources. KNIGHT constructs a topic-specific knowledge graph, a structured and parsimonious summary of entities and relations, that can be reused to generate instructor-controlled difficulty levels, including multi-hop questions, without repeatedly re-feeding the full source text. This knowledge graph acts as a compressed, reusable state, making question generation a cheap read over the graph. We instantiate KNIGHT on Wikipedia/Wikidata while keeping the framework domain- and ontology-agnostic. As a case study, KNIGHT produces six MCQ datasets in History, Biology, and Mathematics. We evaluate quality on five criteria: fluency, unambiguity (single correct answer), topic relevance, option uniqueness, and answerability given the provided sources (as a proxy for hallucination). Results show that KNIGHT enables token- and cost-efficient generation from a reusable graph representation, achieves high quality across these criteria, and yields model rankings aligned with MMLU-style benchmarks, while supporting topic-specific and difficulty-controlled evaluation.

*Sanjeev Panta,Xu Yuan,Li Chen,Nian-Feng Tzeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancing time series forecasting by decomposing components (trend and seasonal) and addressing them separately, reducing errors and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multivariate time series forecasting by tackling trend and seasonal components individually for better accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: Decomposes time series into trend and seasonal components, applying reversible instance normalization for trend and backbone models directly for seasonal, and introducing dual-MLP models.

Result: Achieves ~10% MSE reduction across benchmarks and significant improvements on USGS hydrological data with linear time complexity.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances forecasting accuracy and efficiency, validated by benchmark and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Time series forecasting presents significant challenges in real-world applications across various domains. Building upon the decomposition of the time series, we enhance the architecture of machine learning models for better multivariate time series forecasting. To achieve this, we focus on the trend and seasonal components individually and investigate solutions to predict them with less errors. Recognizing that reversible instance normalization is effective only for the trend component, we take a different approach with the seasonal component by directly applying backbone models without any normalization or scaling procedures. Through these strategies, we successfully reduce error values of the existing state-of-the-art models and finally introduce dual-MLP models as more computationally efficient solutions. Furthermore, our approach consistently yields positive results with around 10% MSE average reduction across four state-of-the-art baselines on the benchmark datasets. We also evaluate our approach on a hydrological dataset extracted from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) river stations, where our models achieve significant improvements while maintaining linear time complexity, demonstrating real-world effectiveness.

*Shunqi Liu,Han Qiu,Tong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) framework combining mechanistic rigor and data-driven flexibility to address challenges in PBPK modeling, with three novel contributions improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PBPK modeling's adoption is limited by computational costs, parameter identification difficulties, and interspecies extrapolation uncertainties, prompting a need for innovative solutions.

Method: A SciML framework introduces Foundation PBPK Transformers, Physiologically Constrained Diffusion Models (PCDM), and Neural Allometry to enhance pharmacokinetic forecasting and simulation.

Result: The framework reduces physiological violation rates from 2.00% to 0.50% and offers faster simulation in synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed SciML framework effectively addresses PBPK modeling challenges, improving accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.

Abstract: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a cornerstone of model-informed drug development (MIDD), providing a mechanistic framework to predict drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Despite its utility, adoption is hindered by high computational costs for large-scale simulations, difficulty in parameter identification for complex biological systems, and uncertainty in interspecies extrapolation. In this work, we propose a unified Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) framework that bridges mechanistic rigor and data-driven flexibility. We introduce three contributions: (1) Foundation PBPK Transformers, which treat pharmacokinetic forecasting as a sequence modeling task; (2) Physiologically Constrained Diffusion Models (PCDM), a generative approach that uses a physics-informed loss to synthesize biologically compliant virtual patient populations; and (3) Neural Allometry, a hybrid architecture combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Neural ODEs to learn continuous cross-species scaling laws. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that the framework reduces physiological violation rates from 2.00% to 0.50% under constraints while offering a path to faster simulation.

### [274] [Decentralized Attention Fails Centralized Signals: Rethinking Transformers for Medical Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18473)
*Guoqi Yu,Juncheng Wang,Chen Yang,Jing Qin,Angelica I. Aviles-Rivero,Shujun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoTAR, a centralized MLP-based module for medical time series analysis, addressing limitations of Transformer models in capturing channel dependencies, reducing computational complexity, and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical time series (MedTS) data, like EEG and ECG, are crucial for diagnosing diseases but existing Transformer models struggle with channel dependencies due to structural mismatch.

Method: CoTAR replaces decentralized attention with a centralized MLP-based module using a global core token for efficient inter-token interactions.

Result: CoTAR achieves up to 12.13% performance improvement, uses 33% less memory, and reduces inference time by 20% compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: CoTAR efficiently captures MedTS patterns with lower computational costs, validated by benchmarks, and offers code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Accurate analysis of medical time series (MedTS) data, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG), plays a pivotal role in healthcare applications, including the diagnosis of brain and heart diseases. MedTS data typically exhibit two critical patterns: temporal dependencies within individual channels and channel dependencies across multiple channels. While recent advances in deep learning have leveraged Transformer-based models to effectively capture temporal dependencies, they often struggle with modeling channel dependencies. This limitation stems from a structural mismatch: MedTS signals are inherently centralized, whereas the Transformer's attention mechanism is decentralized, making it less effective at capturing global synchronization and unified waveform patterns. To address this mismatch, we propose CoTAR (Core Token Aggregation-Redistribution), a centralized MLP-based module designed to replace decentralized attention. Instead of allowing all tokens to interact directly, as in standard attention, CoTAR introduces a global core token that serves as a proxy to facilitate inter-token interactions, thereby enforcing a centralized aggregation and redistribution strategy. This design not only better aligns with the centralized nature of MedTS signals but also reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Experiments on five benchmarks validate the superiority of our method in both effectiveness and efficiency, achieving up to a 12.13% improvement on the APAVA dataset, while using only 33% of the memory and 20% of the inference time compared to the previous state of the art.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using SVDD and Deep SVDD for radar target detection, proposing two new algorithms to handle clutter and noise better than traditional covariance-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional radar detection methods degrade in non-Gaussian clutter environments. Robust covariance estimators like M-estimators or Tyler's estimator still struggle with combined thermal noise and clutter.

Method: The authors propose two novel SVDD-based detection algorithms, leveraging one-class learning to avoid direct noise covariance estimation.

Result: The new SVDD-based algorithms demonstrate effectiveness on simulated radar data.

Conclusion: SVDD and Deep SVDD offer promising alternatives to classical radar detection techniques, especially in challenging clutter and noise conditions.

Abstract: Classical radar detection techniques rely on adaptive detectors that estimate the noise covariance matrix from target-free secondary data. While effective in Gaussian environments, these methods degrade in the presence of clutter, which is better modeled by heavy-tailed distributions such as the Complex Elliptically Symmetric (CES) and Compound-Gaussian (CGD) families. Robust covariance estimators like M-estimators or Tyler's estimator address this issue, but still struggle when thermal noise combines with clutter. To overcome these challenges, we investigate the use of Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) and its deep extension, Deep SVDD, for target detection. These one-class learning methods avoid direct noise covariance estimation and are adapted here as CFAR detectors. We propose two novel SVDD-based detection algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness on simulated radar data.

TL;DR: UMA introduces an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework for proactive memory management in LLMs, outperforming traditional passive systems like RAG and long-context models in dynamic reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems passively handle information, making them brittle for ultra-long streams with frequent updates. UMA addresses this by unifying memory operations and question answering.

Method: UMA uses a dual memory representation (core summary and structured Memory Bank) with explicit CRUD operations and end-to-end reinforcement learning for proactive consolidation.

Result: UMA outperforms baselines in dynamic reasoning and learning tasks across 13 datasets, including Ledger-QA, Test-Time Learning, and Accurate Retrieval.

Conclusion: UMA demonstrates the value of learned, end-to-end memory management for handling long-horizon tasks effectively.

Abstract: Long-context LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems process information passively, deferring state tracking, contradiction resolution, and evidence aggregation to query time, which becomes brittle under ultra long streams with frequent updates. We propose the Unified Memory Agent (UMA), an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that unifies memory operations and question answering within a single policy. UMA maintains a dual memory representation: a compact core summary for global context and a structured Memory Bank that supports explicit CRUD (create, update, delete, reorganize) over key value entries, enabling proactive consolidation during streaming. To evaluate long-horizon memory behavior, we introduce Ledger-QA, a diagnostic benchmark for continuous state tracking where answers are latent values derived from accumulated updates rather than lo cal span retrieval. Across 13 datasets spanning Ledger-QA, Test-Time Learning, and Accurate Retrieval, UMA substantially outperforms long-context and RAG baselines on dynamic reasoning and learning tasks while remaining competitive on standard retrieval benchmarks, underscoring the importance of learned, end-to-end memory management.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weak-form evolutionary Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to address scalability and stability issues in solving PDEs using strong-form evolutionary neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strong-form evolutionary neural networks suffer from ill-conditioned linear systems and poor scalability due to pointwise residual discretization and high computational costs with large training samples.

Method: The authors propose a weak-form evolutionary KAN that decouples the linear system size from training samples and rigorously enforces boundary conditions using boundary-constrained KANs and derivative conditions in the weak formulation.

Result: The proposed framework improves scalability and stability compared to strong-form approaches, enabling accurate prediction of PDE solutions.

Conclusion: The weak-form evolutionary KAN offers a stable and scalable solution for PDEs, advancing scientific machine learning with potential engineering applications.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form a central component of scientific computing. Among recent advances in deep learning, evolutionary neural networks have been developed to successively capture the temporal dynamics of time-dependent PDEs via parameter evolution. The parameter updates are obtained by solving a linear system derived from the governing equation residuals at each time step. However, strong-form evolutionary approaches can yield ill-conditioned linear systems due to pointwise residual discretization, and their computational cost scales unfavorably with the number of training samples. To address these limitations, we propose a weak-form evolutionary Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the scalable and accurate prediction of PDE solutions. We decouple the linear system size from the number of training samples through the weak formulation, leading to improved scalability compared to strong-form approaches. We also rigorously enforce boundary conditions by constructing the trial space with boundary-constrained KANs to satisfy Dirichlet and periodic conditions, and by incorporating derivative boundary conditions directly into the weak formulation for Neumann conditions. In conclusion, the proposed weak-form evolutionary KAN framework provides a stable and scalable approach for PDEs and contributes to scientific machine learning with potential relevance to future engineering applications.

### [278] [Measuring the Prevalence of Policy Violating Content with ML Assisted Sampling and LLM Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18518)
*Attila Dobi,Aravindh Manickavasagam,Benjamin Thompson,Xiaohan Yang,Faisal Farooq*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a system for measuring the prevalence of policy-violating content in user impressions using ML-assisted sampling, multimodal LLM labeling, and design-based estimation to ensure accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with accurately measuring the prevalence of rare content violations due to high labeling costs and slow processes. The goal is to provide metrics that reflect actual user experiences.

Method: The system (i) uses ML-assisted weighted sampling to focus labels on high-risk content while maintaining unbiasedness, (ii) labels samples with a multimodal LLM guided by policy prompts, and (iii) produces prevalence estimates with confidence intervals and dashboards.

Result: The approach enables efficient, platform-representative prevalence measurement with the flexibility to analyze data by various segments (e.g., geography, content age) using a single global sample.

Conclusion: This design-based measurement system offers a scalable and accurate solution for monitoring content safety, addressing the challenges of rare violations and costly labeling.

Abstract: Content safety teams need metrics that reflect what users actually experience, not only what is reported. We study prevalence: the fraction of user views (impressions) that went to content violating a given policy on a given day. Accurate prevalence measurement is challenging because violations are often rare and human labeling is costly, making frequent, platform-representative studies slow. We present a design-based measurement system that (i) draws daily probability samples from the impression stream using ML-assisted weights to concentrate label budget on high-exposure and high-risk content while preserving unbiasedness, (ii) labels sampled items with a multimodal LLM governed by policy prompts and gold-set validation, and (iii) produces design-consistent prevalence estimates with confidence intervals and dashboard drilldowns. A key design goal is one global sample with many pivots: the same daily sample supports prevalence by surface, viewer geography, content age, and other segments through post-stratified estimation. We describe the statistical estimators, variance and confidence interval construction, label-quality monitoring, and an engineering workflow that makes the system configurable across policies.

*Joris Bekkers*

TL;DR: A novel continuous stochastic vision layer quantifies soccer players' visual perception using pose-enhanced tracking, overcoming biases and limitations of traditional VEAs, and integrates with existing analytics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual exploratory behavior methods in soccer are biased, binary, and incompatible with analytics models like pitch control, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: Uses probabilistic field-of-view and occlusion models with head/shoulder rotation angles to create speed-dependent vision maps, combined with pitch control and value surfaces.

Result: Aggregated visual metrics predict controlled pitch value gained during dribbling, validated with 32 games of tracking data from the 2024 Copa America.

Conclusion: The new method is position-agnostic, eliminates manual annotation, and integrates seamlessly into soccer analytics frameworks, with open-sourced tools for adoption.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to measuring visual exploratory behavior in soccer rely on counting visual exploratory actions (VEAs) based on rapid head movements exceeding 125°/s, but this method suffer from player position bias (i.e., a focus on central midfielders), annotation challenges, binary measurement constraints (i.e., a player is scanning, or not), lack the power to predict relevant short-term in-game future success, and are incompatible with fundamental soccer analytics models such as pitch control. This research introduces a novel formulaic continuous stochastic vision layer to quantify players' visual perception from pose-enhanced spatiotemporal tracking. Our probabilistic field-of-view and occlusion models incorporate head and shoulder rotation angles to create speed-dependent vision maps for individual players in a two-dimensional top-down plane. We combine these vision maps with pitch control and pitch value surfaces to analyze the awaiting phase (when a player is awaiting the ball to arrive after a pass for a teammate) and their subsequent on-ball phase. We demonstrate that aggregated visual metrics - such as the percentage of defended area observed while awaiting a pass - are predictive of controlled pitch value gained at the end of dribbling actions using 32 games of synchronized pose-enhanced tracking data and on-ball event data from the 2024 Copa America. This methodology works regardless of player position, eliminates manual annotation requirements, and provides continuous measurements that seamlessly integrate into existing soccer analytics frameworks. To further support the integration with existing soccer analytics frameworks we open-source the tools required to make these calculations.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an explainable, individualized stress prediction model using smartwatch data, outperforming existing methods with personalized insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable continuous stress forecasting for lifestyle interventions using consumer-grade wearables.

Method: Developed a time series forecasting model leveraging heart rate variability, activity patterns, and sleep metrics across multiple temporal horizons.

Result: Achieved MSE of 0.053, MAE of 0.190, and RMSE of 0.226, outperforming baselines by up to 36.9%. Sleep metrics were most predictive.

Conclusion: Consumer wearables with adaptive deep learning can provide scalable, personalized stress monitoring.

Abstract: Continuous stress forecasting could potentially contribute to lifestyle interventions. This paper presents a novel, explainable, and individualized approach for stress prediction using physiological data from consumer-grade smartwatches. We develop a time series forecasting model that leverages multivariate features, including heart rate variability, activity patterns, and sleep metrics, to predict stress levels across 16 temporal horizons (History window: 3, 5, 7, 9 days; forecasting window: 1, 3, 5, 7 days). Our evaluation involves 16 participants monitored for 10-15 weeks. We evaluate our approach across 16 participants, comparing against state-of-the-art time series models (Informer, TimesNet, PatchTST) and traditional baselines (CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM) across multiple temporal horizons. Our model achieved performance with an MSE of 0.053, MAE of 0.190, and RMSE of 0.226 in optimal settings (5-day input, 1-day prediction). A comparison with the baseline models shows that our model outperforms TimesNet, PatchTST, CNN-LSTM, LSTM, and CNN under all conditions, representing improvements of 36.9%, 25.5%, and 21.5% over the best baseline. According to the explanability analysis, sleep metrics are the most dominant and consistent stress predictors (importance: 1.1, consistency: 0.9-1.0), while activity features exhibit high inter-participant variability (0.1-0.2). Most notably, the model captures individual-specific patterns where identical features can have opposing effects across users, validating its personalization capabilities. These findings establish that consumer wearables, combined with adaptive and interpretable deep learning, can deliver relevant stress assessment adapted to individual physiological responses, providing a foundation for scalable, continuous, explainable mental health monitoring in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores grokking in multi-task modular arithmetic, revealing consistent phenomena like staggered grokking order, universal integrability, and weight decay phase structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how grokking transitions occur in multi-task settings, extending beyond single-task studies.

Method: Training shared-trunk Transformers on dual-task (mod-add + mod-mul) and tri-task (mod-add + mod-mul + mod-sq) objectives with systematic weight decay sweeps.

Result: Five consistent phenomena emerged, including staggered grokking order, universal integrability, and holographic incompressibility.

Conclusion: Multi-task grokking constructs a compact superposition subspace, with weight decay compressing and excess parameters providing geometric redundancy.

Abstract: Grokking -- the abrupt transition from memorization to generalization long after near-zero training loss -- has been studied mainly in single-task settings. We extend geometric analysis to multi-task modular arithmetic, training shared-trunk Transformers on dual-task (mod-add + mod-mul) and tri-task (mod-add + mod-mul + mod-sq) objectives across a systematic weight decay sweep. Five consistent phenomena emerge. (1) Staggered grokking order: multiplication generalizes first, followed by squaring, then addition, with consistent delays across seeds. (2) Universal integrability: optimization trajectories remain confined to an empirically invariant low-dimensional execution manifold; commutator defects orthogonal to this manifold reliably precede generalization. (3) Weight decay phase structure: grokking timescale, curvature depth, reconstruction threshold, and defect lead covary systematically with weight decay, revealing distinct dynamical regimes and a sharp no-decay failure mode. (4) Holographic incompressibility: final solutions occupy only 4--8 principal trajectory directions yet are distributed across full-rank weights and destroyed by minimal perturbations; SVD truncation, magnitude pruning, and uniform scaling all fail to preserve performance. (5) Transverse fragility and redundancy: removing less than 10% of orthogonal gradient components eliminates grokking, yet dual-task models exhibit partial recovery under extreme deletion, suggesting redundant center manifolds enabled by overparameterization. Together, these results support a dynamical picture in which multi-task grokking constructs a compact superposition subspace in parameter space, with weight decay acting as compression pressure and excess parameters supplying geometric redundancy in optimization pathways.

*Sarthak Kumar Maharana,Akshay Mehra,Bhavya Ramakrishna,Yunhui Guo,Guan-Ming Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AV-CTTA, a method for audio-visual continual test-time adaptation that selectively retrieves and adapts fusion layer parameters to improve performance across domains without catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting during continual adaptation, leading to poor accuracy. The authors aim to enhance cross-modal learning by adapting only the fusion layer.

Method: Proposes AV-CTTA, which dynamically retrieves and updates the best fusion layer parameters from a buffer using test data, avoiding source data dependency.

Result: Extensive experiments show AV-CTTA outperforms existing methods and minimizes catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: Adapting the fusion layer selectively improves performance across domains and reduces catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Audio-visual continual test-time adaptation involves continually adapting a source audio-visual model at test-time, to unlabeled non-stationary domains, where either or both modalities can be distributionally shifted, which hampers online cross-modal learning and eventually leads to poor accuracy. While previous works have tackled this problem, we find that SOTA methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where the model's performance drops well below the source model due to continual parameter updates at test-time. In this work, we first show that adapting only the modality fusion layer to a target domain not only improves performance on that domain but can also enhance performance on subsequent domains. Based on this strong cross-task transferability of the fusion layer's parameters, we propose a method, $\texttt{AV-CTTA}$, that improves test-time performance of the models without access to any source data. Our approach works by using a selective parameter retrieval mechanism that dynamically retrieves the best fusion layer parameters from a buffer using only a small batch of test data. These parameters are then integrated into the model, adapted to the current test distribution, and saved back for future use. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets involving unimodal and bimodal corruptions show our proposed $\texttt{AV-CTTA}$ significantly outperforms existing methods while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.

TL;DR: PINNs enhance RL policy learning for smart grid energy management by replacing costly simulators, accelerating training by 50% and achieving strong policies without true simulator samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the complexity and computational inefficiency of RL-based solutions for Optimal Power Flow problems in smart grids.

Method: Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as surrogate models to replace expensive simulators and enhance RL policy learning.

Result: PINN surrogates accelerate RL training by 50% and achieve performance similar to the original simulator, even without its samples.

Conclusion: PINNs offer an efficient and effective solution for RL-based smart grid energy management, outperforming other surrogate models.

Abstract: The energy management problem in the context of smart grids is inherently complex due to the interdependencies among diverse system components. Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been proposed for solving Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, the requirement for iterative interaction with an environment often necessitates computationally expensive simulators, leading to significant sample inefficiency. In this study, these challenges are addressed through the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which can replace conventional and costly smart grid simulators. The RL policy learning process is enhanced so that convergence can be achieved in a fraction of the time required by the original environment. The PINN-based surrogate is compared with other benchmark data-driven surrogate models. By incorporating knowledge of the underlying physical laws, the results show that the PINN surrogate is the only approach considered in this context that can obtain a strong RL policy even without access to samples from the true simulator. The results demonstrate that using PINN surrogates can accelerate training by 50% compared to RL training without a surrogate. This approach enables the rapid generation of performance scores similar to those produced by the original simulator.

*Baris Arat,Hasan Fehmi Ates,Emre Sefer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores forecasting sub-city real estate prices weekly by combining satellite radar data and news sentiment, demonstrating improved accuracy at longer horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current city-level, low-frequency real estate price indicators are inadequate for neighborhood-scale monitoring and long-term planning.

Method: The study constructs weekly price indices for 19 sub-city regions using transaction data, Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter, news sentiment (lexical tone and semantic embeddings), and macroeconomic context, evaluating forecasts from 2 to 34 weeks ahead.

Result: At horizons beyond 14 weeks, sentiment and SAR data significantly improve forecasts, reducing mean absolute error by 35% at 26-34 weeks. Nonparametric learners outperform deep architectures.

Conclusion: Combining remote sensing and news sentiment enhances predictability of sub-city real estate prices at strategically relevant long horizons.

Abstract: Reliable real estate price indicators are typically published at city level and low frequency, limiting their use for neighborhood-scale monitoring and long-horizon planning. We study whether sub-city price indices can be forecasted at weekly frequency by combining physical development signals from satellite radar with market narratives from news text. Using over 350,000 transactions from Dubai Land Department (2015-2025), we construct weekly price indices for 19 sub-city regions and evaluate forecasts from 2 to 34 weeks ahead. Our framework fuses regional transaction history with Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter, news sentiment combining lexical tone and semantic embeddings, and macroeconomic context. Results are strongly horizon dependent: at horizons up to 10 weeks, price history alone matches multimodal configurations, but beyond 14 weeks sentiment and SAR become critical. At long horizons (26-34 weeks), the full multimodal model reduces mean absolute error from 4.48 to 2.93 (35% reduction), with gains statistically significant across regions. Nonparametric learners consistently outperform deep architectures in this data regime. These findings establish benchmarks for weekly sub-city index forecasting and demonstrate that remote sensing and news sentiment materially improve predictability at strategically relevant horizons.

*Sheng Ran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for autonomous learning without explicit objectives, using intrinsic dynamics to self-regulate structural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning relies on fixed objectives, which limits autonomy in evolving contexts. The paper seeks to address how systems can self-assess and adapt without external goals.

Method: A two-timescale architecture separates fast state evolution from slow structural adaptation, using an internally generated stress variable to trigger structural changes based on dynamical health.

Result: A toy model demonstrates that stress-regulated learning produces self-organized, segmented learning episodes without external goals.

Conclusion: The framework offers a potential path toward autonomous systems capable of self-assessment and internally driven structural reorganization.

Abstract: Despite their apparent diversity, modern machine learning methods can be reduced to a remarkably simple core principle: learning is achieved by continuously optimizing parameters to minimize or maximize a scalar objective function. This paradigm has been extraordinarily successful for well-defined tasks where goals are fixed and evaluation criteria are explicit. However, if artificial systems are to move toward true autonomy-operating over long horizons and across evolving contexts-objectives may become ill-defined, shifting, or entirely absent. In such settings, a fundamental question emerges: in the absence of an explicit objective function, how can a system determine whether its ongoing internal dynamics are productive or pathological? And how should it regulate structural change without external supervision? In this work, we propose a dynamical framework for learning without an explicit objective. Instead of minimizing external error signals, the system evaluates the intrinsic health of its own internal dynamics and regulates structural plasticity accordingly. We introduce a two-timescale architecture that separates fast state evolution from slow structural adaptation, coupled through an internally generated stress variable that accumulates evidence of persistent dynamical dysfunction. Structural modification is then triggered not continuously, but as a state-dependent event. Through a minimal toy model, we demonstrate that this stress-regulated mechanism produces temporally segmented, self-organized learning episodes without reliance on externally defined goals. Our results suggest a possible route toward autonomous learning systems capable of self-assessment and internally regulated structural reorganization.

TL;DR: GIST leverages subspace alignment for efficient data selection in PEFT, outperforming baselines with minimal storage and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in targeted data selection for instruction tuning, especially in PEFT methods like LoRA, where traditional assumptions break down due to cross-parameter coupling.

Method: Proposed GIST: identifies a task-specific subspace via SVD, projects training gradients into this subspace, and scores examples by alignment with target directions.

Result: GIST matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines using only 0.29% storage and 25% computational time.

Conclusion: GIST offers a scalable and effective solution for data selection in PEFT by addressing geometric mismatches.

Abstract: Targeted data selection has emerged as a crucial paradigm for efficient instruction tuning, aiming to identify a small yet influential subset of training examples for a specific target task. In practice, influence is often measured through the effect of an example on parameter updates. To make selection scalable, many approaches leverage optimizer statistics (e.g., Adam states) as an axis-aligned surrogate for update geometry (i.e., diagonal precondition), implicitly treating parameters as coordinate-wise independent. We show that this assumption breaks down in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA. In this setting, the induced optimization geometry exhibits strong cross-parameter coupling with non-trivial off-diagonal interactions, while the task-relevant update directions are confined to a low-dimensional subspace. Motivated by this mismatch, we propose GIST (Gradient Isometric Subspace Transformation), a simple yet principled alternative that replaces axis-aligned scaling with robust subspace alignment. GIST recovers a task-specific subspace from validation gradients via spectral filtering (SVD), projects training gradients into this coupled subspace, and scores examples by their alignment with target directions.Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GIST matches or outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline with only 0.29% of the storage and 25% of the computational time under the same selection budget.

TL;DR: ETAP predicts multi-task learning performance gains using gradient-based affinity scores and nonlinear predictors, improving task grouping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently identifying beneficial task groups in multi-task learning without exhaustive training.

Method: ETAP combines linear gradient-based affinity scores with nonlinear predictors trained on limited task groups.

Result: ETAP outperforms baselines in predicting MTL gains and improves task grouping effectiveness.

Conclusion: ETAP offers a scalable solution for effective task grouping in multi-task learning.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in multi-task learning (MTL) is identifying groups of tasks that should be learned together. Since training MTL models for all possible combinations of tasks is prohibitively expensive for large task sets, a crucial component of efficient and effective task grouping is predicting whether a group of tasks would benefit from learning together, measured as per-task performance gain over single-task learning. In this paper, we propose ETAP (Ensemble Task Affinity Predictor), a scalable framework that integrates principled and data-driven estimators to predict MTL performance gains. First, we consider the gradient-based updates of shared parameters in an MTL model to measure the affinity between a pair of tasks as the similarity between the parameter updates based on these tasks. This linear estimator, which we call affinity score, naturally extends to estimating affinity within a group of tasks. Second, to refine these estimates, we train predictors that apply non-linear transformations and correct residual errors, capturing complex and non-linear task relationships. We train these predictors on a limited number of task groups for which we obtain ground-truth gain values via multi-task learning for each group. We demonstrate on benchmark datasets that ETAP improves MTL gain prediction and enables more effective task grouping, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across diverse application domains.

TL;DR: MapTab is a multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate constrained reasoning in MLLMs using route planning tasks, revealing significant challenges in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are insufficient for assessing constrained reasoning in MLLMs, necessitating a more rigorous evaluation tool like MapTab.

Method: MapTab uses route planning tasks involving map images and tabular data, with two scenarios (Metromap and Travelmap) and 4 key constraints.

Result: Current MLLMs struggle with constrained multimodal reasoning, especially when visual perception is limited.

Conclusion: MapTab offers a challenging testbed to improve the systematic evaluation of MLLMs.

Abstract: Systematic evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is crucial for advancing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, existing benchmarks remain insufficient for rigorously assessing their constrained reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MapTab, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate constrained reasoning in MLLMs via route planning tasks. MapTab requires MLLMs to perceive and ground visual cues from map images alongside route attributes (e.g., Time, Price) from structured tabular data. The benchmark encompasses two scenarios: Metromap, covering metro networks in 160 cities across 52 countries, and Travelmap, depicting 168 representative tourist attractions from 19 countries. In total, MapTab comprises 328 images, 196,800 route planning queries, and 3,936 QA queries, all incorporating 4 key constraints: Time, Price, Comfort, and Reliability. Extensive evaluations across 15 representative MLLMs reveal that current models face substantial challenges in constrained multimodal reasoning. Notably, under conditions of limited visual perception, multimodal collaboration often underperforms compared to unimodal approaches. We believe MapTab provides a challenging and realistic testbed to advance the systematic evaluation of MLLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a controlled diagnostic to isolate reranking behavior by using fixed evidence pools, revealing how different models diverge in redundancy and lexical coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To decouple ranking behavior from retrieval quality and isolate the impact of ranking policies.

Method: Used Multi-News clusters as fixed evidence pools (8 documents each) and compared rerankers (BM25, MMR, LLMs) on lexical coverage and redundancy.

Result: LLMs showed varying redundancy patterns and underperformed on lexical coverage at small selection budgets, diverging from baselines.

Conclusion: The diagnostic isolates ranking policy effects, making it model-agnostic and applicable to any ranker.

Abstract: Standard reranking evaluations study how a reranker orders candidates returned by an upstream retriever. This setup couples ranking behavior with retrieval quality, so differences in output cannot be attributed to the ranking policy alone. We introduce a controlled diagnostic that isolates reranking by using Multi-News clusters as fixed evidence pools. We limit each pool to exactly eight documents and pass identical inputs to all rankers. Within this setup, BM25 and MMR serve as interpretable reference points for lexical matching and diversity optimization. Across 345 clusters, we find that redundancy patterns vary by model: one LLM implicitly diversifies at larger selection budgets, while another increases redundancy. In contrast, LLMs underperform on lexical coverage at small selection budgets. As a result, LLM rankings diverge substantially from both baselines rather than consistently approximating either strategy. By eliminating retrieval variance, we can attribute these differences directly to the ranking policy. This diagnostic is model-agnostic and applicable to any ranker, including open source systems and proprietary APIs.

Motivation: The paper addresses the long-standing issue of catastrophic forgetting in large language models, where updating weights for new tasks degrades prior knowledge. Existing solutions lack structural guarantees against forgetting.

Method: The proposed NIWF framework replaces fixed weights with a learned function that dynamically generates weight configurations from a continuous capability coordinate space. After training, specific coordinate regions are 'committed' by snapshotting outputs to prevent interference during future training.

Result: NIWF was tested on sequential instruction-following and code generation tasks using Mistral-7B, showing zero forgetting on committed tasks while achieving competitive perplexity on new tasks.

Conclusion: NIWF enables software-like versioning for neural networks, allowing capabilities to be committed, extended, composed, and rolled back without retraining, providing a structural solution to catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Large language models store all learned knowledge in a single, fixed weight vector. Teaching a model new capabilities requires modifying those same weights, inevitably degrading previously acquired knowledge. This fundamental limitation, known as catastrophic forgetting, has resisted principled solutions for decades. Existing approaches treat weights as immutable artifacts that must be protected through techniques like regularization heuristics, replay buffers, or isolated adapter modules. The problem is none of these provide a structural guarantee against forgetting. In this work, we propose Non-Interfering Weight Fields (NIWF), a framework that replaces the fixed weight paradigm with a learned function that generates weight configurations on demand from a continuous capability coordinate space. After training on a task, we commit the occupied coordinate region by snapshotting the fields outputs on anchor points to enforce a functional lock during all future training. We validate NIWF on sequential instructionfollowing and code generation tasks using Mistral-7B, demonstrating zero forgetting on committed tasks with competitive perplexity on new tasks. The framework introduces the notion of software-like versioning for neural network intelligence, where capabilities can be committed, extended, composed, and rolled back without retraining.

*Alejandro de Miguel,Nelson Totah,Uri Maoz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Non-invasive EEG-based decoding of self-paced locomotion speed in rats using RNNs achieves high accuracy and generalizes across sessions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancing rehabilitation, prosthetic control, and understanding neural correlates of action by decoding locomotion speed in natural, self-paced contexts without invasive implants.

Method: An asynchronous BCI processes 32-electrode skull-surface EEG data (0.01–45 Hz) using recurrent neural networks to decode instantaneous speed from a non-motorized treadmill in head-fixed rats.

Result: Decoding achieved a correlation of 0.88 (R² = 0.78) for speed, driven by visual cortex electrodes and low-frequency oscillations (<8 Hz). Pre-training on one session allowed decoding in others for the same rat, with neural signatures not transferring across animals.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates accurate, continuous decoding of self-paced locomotion speed from non-invasive EEG, offering a framework for high-performing BCIs and insights into neural action dynamics.

Abstract: $\textit{Objective.}$ Accurate neural decoding of locomotion holds promise for advancing rehabilitation, prosthetic control, and understanding neural correlates of action. Recent studies have demonstrated decoding of locomotion kinematics across species on motorized treadmills. However, efforts to decode locomotion speed in more natural contexts$-$where pace is self-selected rather than externally imposed$-$are scarce, generally achieve only modest accuracy, and require intracranial implants. Here, we aim to decode self-paced locomotion speed non-invasively and continuously using cortex-wide EEG recordings from rats. $\textit{Approach.}$ We introduce an asynchronous brain$-$computer interface (BCI) that processes a stream of 32-electrode skull-surface EEG (0.01$-$45 Hz) to decode instantaneous speed from a non-motorized treadmill during self-paced locomotion in head-fixed rats. Using recurrent neural networks and a dataset of over 133 h of recordings, we trained decoders to map ongoing EEG activity to treadmill speed. $\textit{Main results.}$ Our decoding achieves a correlation of 0.88 ($R^2$ = 0.78) for speed, primarily driven by visual cortex electrodes and low-frequency ($< 8$ Hz) oscillations. Moreover, pre-training on a single session permitted decoding on other sessions from the same rat, suggesting uniform neural signatures that generalize across sessions but fail to transfer across animals. Finally, we found that cortical states not only carry information about current speed, but also about future and past dynamics, extending up to 1000 ms. $\textit{Significance.}$ These findings demonstrate that self-paced locomotion speed can be decoded accurately and continuously from non-invasive, cortex-wide EEG. Our approach provides a framework for developing high-performing, non-invasive BCI systems and contributes to understanding distributed neural representations of action dynamics.

*Leonardo F. Toso,Davit Shadunts,Yunyang Lu,Nihal Sharma,Donglin Zhan,Nam H. Nguyen,James Anderson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bisimulation encoder to improve robustness in latent predictive models by addressing sensitivity to irrelevant visual variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent predictive models degrade in robustness due to sensitivity to irrelevant visual changes (slow features) like background shifts.

Method: A bisimulation encoder is added to the predictive objective, ensuring control-relevant state equivalence and reducing slow feature impact.

Result: The model improves robustness to slow features and operates in a latent space up to 10x smaller than DINO-WM.

Conclusion: The approach is effective, agnostic to pretrained encoders, and maintains robustness across various benchmarks.

Abstract: World models learned from high-dimensional visual observations allow agents to make decisions and plan directly in latent space, avoiding pixel-level reconstruction. However, recent latent predictive architectures (JEPAs), including the DINO world model (DINO-WM), display a degradation in test time robustness due to their sensitivity to "slow features". These include visual variations such as background changes and distractors that are irrelevant to the task being solved. We address this limitation by augmenting the predictive objective with a bisimulation encoder that enforces control-relevant state equivalence, mapping states with similar transition dynamics to nearby latent states while limiting contributions from slow features. We evaluate our model on a simple navigation task under different test-time background changes and visual distractors. Across all benchmarks, our model consistently improves robustness to slow features while operating in a reduced latent space, up to 10x smaller than that of DINO-WM. Moreover, our model is agnostic to the choice of pretrained visual encoder and maintains robustness when paired with DINOv2, SimDINOv2, and iBOT features.

### [293] [Adaptive Time Series Reasoning via Segment Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18645)
*Shvat Messica,Jiawen Zhang,Kevin Li,Theodoros Tsiligkaridis,Marinka Zitnik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARTIST introduces a sequential decision-making approach for time-series reasoning, using adaptive segment selection and reinforcement learning to improve accuracy over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods encode entire time series into fixed representations, often irrelevant to the task. ARTIST aims to dynamically select relevant segments for targeted analysis.

Method: ARTIST uses a controller-reasoner architecture with reinforcement learning. The controller selects informative segments, while the reasoner generates segment-conditioned reasoning traces and answers.

Result: ARTIST improves average accuracy by 6.46 percentage points over baselines, with notable gains in rare event localization and multi-segment reasoning.

Conclusion: Selective data use through adaptive segment selection enhances time-series reasoning, outperforming static methods.

Abstract: Time series reasoning tasks often start with a natural language question and require targeted analysis of a time series. Evidence may span the full series or appear in a few short intervals, so the model must decide what to inspect. Most existing approaches encode the entire time series into a fixed representation before inference, regardless of whether or not the entire sequence is relevant. We introduce ARTIST, which formulates time-series reasoning as a sequential decision problem. ARTIST interleaves reasoning with adaptive temporal segment selection. It adopts a controller-reasoner architecture and uses reinforcement learning to train the controller role to select informative segments and the reasoner role to generate segment-conditioned reasoning traces and final answers. During inference, the model actively acquires task-relevant information instead of relying on a static summary of the full sequence. We use a novel hierarchical policy optimization approach for post-training that allows the model to excel in both segment selection and question-answering behavior. We evaluate ARTIST on six time-series reasoning benchmarks and compare it with large language models, vision-language models, and prior time-series reasoning systems. ARTIST improves average accuracy by 6.46 absolute percentage points over the strongest baseline. The largest gains appear on rare event localization and multi-segment reasoning tasks. Supervised fine-tuning improves performance, and reinforcement learning provides additional gains by optimizing question-adaptive segment selection. These results show that selective data use drives effective time-series reasoning.

### [294] [Information-Guided Noise Allocation for Efficient Diffusion Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18647)
*Gabriel Raya,Bac Nguyen,Georgios Batzolis,Yuhta Takida,Dejan Stancevic,Naoki Murata,Chieh-Hsin Lai,Yuki Mitsufuji,Luca Ambrogioni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces InfoNoise, a data-adaptive noise schedule for diffusion models, replacing manual tuning with an information-theoretic approach for more efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual noise schedules in diffusion models are inefficient and limit transferability across datasets and domains. The authors aim to optimize noise allocation using information theory.

Method: The authors propose using the conditional entropy rate of the forward process to diagnose suboptimal noise allocation. InfoNoise, their solution, derives a noise sampling distribution from entropy-reduction rates computed during training.

Result: InfoNoise matches or outperforms manual schedules on natural-image benchmarks (e.g., 1.4× speedup on CIFAR-10) and achieves superior quality on discrete datasets with up to 3× fewer steps.

Conclusion: InfoNoise reduces the need for per-dataset schedule tuning, making diffusion model training more efficient and scalable across domains.

Abstract: Training diffusion models typically relies on manually tuned noise schedules, which can waste computation on weakly informative noise regions and limit transfer across datasets, resolutions, and representations. We revisit noise schedule allocation through an information-theoretic lens and propose the conditional entropy rate of the forward process as a theoretically grounded, data-dependent diagnostic for identifying suboptimal noise-level allocation in existing schedules. Based on these insight, we introduce InfoNoise, a principled data-adaptive training noise schedule that replaces heuristic schedule design with an information-guided noise sampling distribution derived from entropy-reduction rates estimated from denoising losses already computed during training. Across natural-image benchmarks, InfoNoise matches or surpasses tuned EDM-style schedules, in some cases with a substantial training speedup (about $1.4\times$ on CIFAR-10). On discrete datasets, where standard image-tuned schedules exhibit significant mismatch, it reaches superior quality in up to $3\times$ fewer training steps. Overall, InfoNoise makes noise scheduling data-adaptive, reducing the need for per-dataset schedule design as diffusion models expand across domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores grokking in neural networks, revealing that solutions emerge from globally low-dimensional learning trajectories despite locally high-dimensional parameter spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how low-dimensional learning dynamics in high-dimensional spaces lead to solutions resistant to low-dimensional compression.

Method: Analyzed grokking in shared-trunk Transformers trained on modular arithmetic tasks using SVD and trajectory PCA reconstructions.

Result: Grokking trajectories occupy low-dimensional subspaces (2--6 dimensions), while weight matrices remain full-rank; trajectory PCA outperforms SVD reconstructions.

Conclusion: Grokked solutions are globally low-rank in learning directions but locally full-rank, suggesting holographic encoding of algorithms through coordinated updates.

Abstract: Grokking -- the abrupt transition from memorization to generalization after extended training -- has been linked to the emergence of low-dimensional structure in learning dynamics. Yet neural network parameters inhabit extremely high-dimensional spaces. How can a low-dimensional learning process produce solutions that resist low-dimensional compression?
  We investigate this question in multi-task modular arithmetic, training shared-trunk Transformers with separate heads for addition, multiplication, and a quadratic operation modulo 97. Across three model scales (315K--2.2M parameters) and five weight decay settings, we compare three reconstruction methods: per-matrix SVD, joint cross-matrix SVD, and trajectory PCA.
  Across all conditions, grokking trajectories are confined to a 2--6 dimensional global subspace, while individual weight matrices remain effectively full-rank. Reconstruction from 3--5 trajectory PCs recovers over 95\% of final accuracy, whereas both per-matrix and joint SVD fail at sub-full rank. Even when static decompositions capture most spectral energy, they destroy task-relevant structure.
  These results show that learned algorithms are encoded through dynamically coordinated updates spanning all matrices, rather than localized low-rank components. We term this the holographic encoding principle: grokked solutions are globally low-rank in the space of learning directions but locally full-rank in parameter space, with implications for compression, interpretability, and understanding how neural networks encode computation.

*Yinan Zou,Md Kamran Chowdhury Shisher,Christopher G. Brinton,Vishrant Tripathi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Potara is a principled framework for federated personalization that merges a federated model (general knowledge) and a local model (personalized knowledge) using optimal mixing weights derived from linear mode connectivity, improving performance while reducing communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated personalization methods rely on heuristic mixing rules and lack efficiency, especially under task-level heterogeneity.

Method: Potara merges a federated model and a local model using closed-form optimal mixing weights derived from minimizing a variance trace upper bound.

Result: Experiments show Potara improves personalization and reduces communication, achieving a strong performance-communication trade-off.

Conclusion: Potara provides a theoretically justified and efficient solution for federated personalization.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as LoRA, offer a practical way to adapt large vision and language models to client tasks. However, this becomes particularly challenging under task-level heterogeneity in federated deployments. In this regime, personalization requires balancing general knowledge with personalized knowledge, yet existing approaches largely rely on heuristic mixing rules and lack theoretical justification. Moreover, prior model merging approaches are also computation and communication intensive, making the process inefficient in federated settings. In this work, we propose Potara, a principled framework for federated personalization that constructs a personalized model for each client by merging two complementary models: (i) a federated model capturing general knowledge, and (ii) a local model capturing personalized knowledge. Through the construct of linear mode connectivity, we show that the expected task loss admits a variance trace upper bound, whose minimization yields closed-form optimal mixing weights that guarantee a tighter bound for the merged model than for either the federated or local model alone. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that Potara consistently improves personalization while reducing communication, leading to a strong performance-communication trade-off.

TL;DR: Proposes a framework for large causal models (LCMs) for temporal causal discovery, combining synthetic and realistic data to improve scalability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal discovery methods are dataset-specific and limited in scalability. LCMs aim to enable multi-dataset pretraining and better generalization.

Method: Combines diverse synthetic generators with realistic time-series datasets for training LCMs, focusing on scalability and deeper architectures.

Result: LCMs scale effectively to higher variable counts and deeper architectures, outperforming classical and neural baselines, especially in out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: LCMs represent a promising foundation-model paradigm for temporal causal discovery, offering fast inference and strong performance.

Abstract: Causal discovery for both cross-sectional and temporal data has traditionally followed a dataset-specific paradigm, where a new model is fitted for each individual dataset. Such an approach limits the potential of multi-dataset pretraining. The concept of large causal models (LCMs) envisions a class of pre-trained neural architectures specifically designed for temporal causal discovery. Prior approaches are constrained to small variable counts, degrade with larger inputs, and rely heavily on synthetic data, limiting generalization. We propose a principled framework for LCMs, combining diverse synthetic generators with realistic time-series datasets, allowing learning at scale. Extensive experiments on synthetic, semi-synthetic and realistic benchmarks show that LCMs scale effectively to higher variable counts and deeper architectures while maintaining strong performance. Trained models achieve competitive or superior accuracy compared to classical and neural baselines, particularly in out-of-distribution settings, while enabling fast, single-pass inference. Results demonstrate LCMs as a promising foundation-model paradigm for temporal causal discovery. Experiments and model weights are available at https://github.com/kougioulis/LCM-paper/.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand and quantify the probability of misclassification due to small random perturbations in network inputs.

Method: Theoretical analysis focusing on local robustness, specifically for deep networks with rectified linear units (ReLU).

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical insights into the robustness of ReLU-based networks against random input perturbations.

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the robustness of parameterized networks to random input perturbations. Specifically, we analyze local robustness at a given network input by quantifying the probability that a small additive random perturbation of the input leads to misclassification.

*Anthony Bao,Jeffrey Lai,William Gilpin*

TL;DR: A study explores how small transformers trained on one dynamical system can forecast another without retraining, identifying a tradeoff in training performance and revealing attention-based models' use of transfer-operator strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how foundation models adapt to unseen physical settings, specifically focusing on in-context learning in dynamical systems.

Method: A two-layer, single-head transformer is trained to forecast one dynamical system and then tested on another without retraining, analyzing performance tradeoffs and attention mechanisms.

Result: The model exhibits an early tradeoff in training performance and uses delay embedding and invariant sets for forecasting unseen systems.

Conclusion: Attention-based models effectively leverage global attractor information for short-term forecasts, explaining their ability to adapt to unseen physical systems.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for scientific machine learning adapt to physical settings unseen during training, such as zero-shot transfer between turbulent scales. This phenomenon, in-context learning, challenges conventional understanding of learning and adaptation in physical systems. Here, we study in-context learning of dynamical systems in a minimal setting: we train a small two-layer, single-head transformer to forecast one dynamical system, and then evaluate its ability to forecast a different dynamical system without retraining. We discover an early tradeoff in training between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance, which manifests as a secondary double descent phenomenon. We discover that attention-based models apply a transfer-operator forecasting strategy in-context. They (1) lift low-dimensional time series using delay embedding, to detect the system's higher-dimensional dynamical manifold, and (2) identify and forecast long-lived invariant sets that characterize the global flow on this manifold. Our results clarify the mechanism enabling large pretrained models to forecast unseen physical systems at test without retraining, and they illustrate the unique ability of attention-based models to leverage global attractor information in service of short-term forecasts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: I-TAP combines offline RL with in-context planning using learned temporal abstractions for efficient control in partially observable environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses planning challenges in continuous control due to long horizons and partial observability.

Method: Learns a residual-quantization VAE and temporal Transformer for token-based planning and adaptation.

Result: Outperforms baselines in deterministic/stochastic environments, including partial observability.

Conclusion: I-TAP enables robust, efficient planning under stochastic dynamics and partial observability.

Abstract: Planning-based reinforcement learning for continuous control is bottlenecked by two practical issues: planning at primitive time scales leads to prohibitive branching and long horizons, while real environments are frequently partially observable and exhibit regime shifts that invalidate stationary, fully observed dynamics assumptions. We introduce I-TAP (In-Context Latent Temporal-Abstraction Planner), an offline RL framework that unifies in-context adaptation with online planning in a learned discrete temporal-abstraction space. From offline trajectories, I-TAP learns an observation-conditioned residual-quantization VAE that compresses each observation-macro-action segment into a coarse-to-fine stack of discrete residual tokens, and a temporal Transformer that autoregressively predicts these token stacks from a short recent history. The resulting sequence model acts simultaneously as a context-conditioned prior over abstract actions and a latent dynamics model. At test time, I-TAP performs Monte Carlo Tree Search directly in token space, using short histories for implicit adaptation without gradient update, and decodes selected token stacks into executable actions. Across deterministic MuJoCo, stochastic MuJoCo with per-episode latent dynamics regimes, and high-dimensional Adroit manipulation, including partially observable variants, I-TAP consistently matches or outperforms strong model-free and model-based offline baselines, demonstrating efficient and robust in-context planning under stochastic dynamics and partial observability.

*Dhruvesh Patel,Benjamin Rozonoyer,Gaurav Pandey,Tahira Naseem,Ramón Fernandez Astudillo,Andrew McCallum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve insertion-based sequence generation by incorporating trainable order dynamics into target rates for discrete flow matching, enhancing flexibility and generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models (ARMs) face challenges due to limited flexibility in sequence generation. Insertion models offer greater flexibility but have larger action spaces, complicating learning. The paper aims to address these challenges.

Method: The authors use a variable-length masked diffusion model that generates sequences by inserting and filling mask tokens. They incorporate trainable order dynamics into target rates for discrete flow matching, enabling joint training without numerical simulation.

Result: Experiments on graph traversal tasks and de novo small molecule generation show that the learned order dynamics improve generation quality and the number of valid molecules compared to uniform order dynamics.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully balances flexibility, training stability, and generation quality, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: In many domains generating variable length sequences through insertions provides greater flexibility over autoregressive models. However, the action space of insertion models is much larger than that of autoregressive models (ARMs) making the learning challenging. To address this, we incorporate trainable order dynamics into the target rates for discrete flow matching, and show that with suitable choices of parameterizations, joint training of the target order dynamics and the generator is tractable without the need for numerical simulation. As the generative insertion model, we use a variable length masked diffusion model, which generates by inserting and filling mask tokens. On graph traversal tasks for which a locally optimal insertion order is known, we explore the choices of parameterization empirically and demonstrate the trade-offs between flexibility, training stability and generation quality. On de novo small molecule generation, we find that the learned order dynamics leads to an increase in the number of valid molecules generated and improved quality, when compared to uniform order dynamics.

TL;DR: Proposes Phase-Consistent Magnetic Spectral Learning for unsupervised multi-view clustering, addressing challenges like view discrepancy and noise by modeling directional agreement as a phase term combined with nonnegative magnitude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address instability in existing multi-view clustering methods caused by contradictory directional tendencies between views, which distort spectral geometry and degrade clustering performance.

Method: Introduces a complex-valued magnetic affinity modeling cross-view directional agreement as a phase term, uses Hermitian magnetic Laplacian for spectral signal extraction, and employs anchor-based high-order consensus modeling for robust inputs.

Result: Demonstrates consistent outperformance over strong baselines across multiple public multi-view benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively leverages cross-view directional agreement and robust spectral learning to improve unsupervised multi-view clustering.

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to partition data into meaningful groups by leveraging complementary information from multiple views without labels, yet a central challenge is to obtain a reliable shared structural signal to guide representation learning and cross-view alignment under view discrepancy and noise. Existing approaches often rely on magnitude-only affinities or early pseudo targets, which can be unstable when different views induce relations with comparable strengths but contradictory directional tendencies, thereby distorting the global spectral geometry and degrading clustering. In this paper, we propose \emph{Phase-Consistent Magnetic Spectral Learning} for MVC: we explicitly model cross-view directional agreement as a phase term and combine it with a nonnegative magnitude backbone to form a complex-valued magnetic affinity, extract a stable shared spectral signal via a Hermitian magnetic Laplacian, and use it as structured self-supervision to guide unsupervised multi-view representation learning and clustering. To obtain robust inputs for spectral extraction at scale, we construct a compact shared structure with anchor-based high-order consensus modeling and apply a lightweight refinement to suppress noisy or inconsistent relations. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prior-Aware Memorization is introduced as a lightweight, training-free method to distinguish genuine memorization in LLMs from common statistical patterns, showing many sequences previously labeled as memorized are actually common.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of distinguishing genuine memorization from statistically common sequences in LLMs to mitigate privacy, security, and copyright risks.

Method: Proposes Prior-Aware Memorization, evaluating if a suffix is uniquely tied to its training prefix or appears commonly across prompts, tested on LLaMA and OPT models.

Result: Found 55%-90% of labeled memorized sequences are statistically common; similar results for SATML dataset, showing low frequency isn't sufficient proof of memorization.

Conclusion: Highlights the need to consider model priors to accurately assess data leakage, emphasizing the inadequacy of low frequency as evidence of memorization.

Abstract: Training data leakage from Large Language Models (LLMs) raises serious concerns related to privacy, security, and copyright compliance. A central challenge in assessing this risk is distinguishing genuine memorization of training data from the generation of statistically common sequences. Existing approaches to measuring memorization often conflate these phenomena, labeling outputs as memorized even when they arise from generalization over common patterns. Counterfactual Memorization provides a principled solution by comparing models trained with and without a target sequence, but its reliance on retraining multiple baseline models makes it computationally expensive and impractical at scale.
  This work introduces Prior-Aware Memorization, a theoretically grounded, lightweight and training-free criterion for identifying genuine memorization in LLMs. The key idea is to evaluate whether a candidate suffix is strongly associated with its specific training prefix or whether it appears with high probability across many unrelated prompts due to statistical commonality.
  We evaluate this metric on text from the training corpora of two pre-trained models, LLaMA and OPT, using both long sequences (to simulate copyright risks) and named entities (to simulate PII leakage). Our results show that between 55% and 90% of sequences previously labeled as memorized are in fact statistically common. Similar findings hold for the SATML training data extraction challenge dataset, where roughly 40% of sequences exhibit common-pattern behavior despite appearing only once in the training data. These results demonstrate that low frequency alone is insufficient evidence of memorization and highlight the importance of accounting for model priors when assessing leakage.

TL;DR: PhysCond-WMA is a white-box attack on generative world models, perturbing physical-condition channels to cause distortions while maintaining perceptual quality, achieving notable success rates and impacting downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose and quantify security vulnerabilities in generative world models by demonstrating how perturbations in physical-condition channels can lead to semantic or decision-level distortions.

Method: A two-stage attack: (1) quality-preserving guidance constrains reverse-diffusion loss, and (2) momentum-guided denoising accumulates gradients for stable semantic shifts.

Result: Increases FID by ~9% and FVD by ~3.9%, with a 0.55 attack success rate. Downstream tasks showed reduced 3D detection (~4%) and worsened planning (~20%).

Conclusion: The study highlights significant security risks in generative world models, prompting the need for more robust security measures.

Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) are increasingly used to synthesize controllable, sensor-conditioned driving videos, yet their reliance on physical priors exposes novel attack surfaces. In this paper, we present Physical-Conditioned World Model Attack (PhysCond-WMA), the first white-box world model attack that perturbs physical-condition channels, such as HDMap embeddings and 3D-box features, to induce semantic, logic, or decision-level distortion while preserving perceptual fidelity. PhysCond-WMA is optimized in two stages: (1) a quality-preserving guidance stage that constrains reverse-diffusion loss below a calibrated threshold, and (2) a momentum-guided denoising stage that accumulates target-aligned gradients along the denoising trajectory for stable, temporally coherent semantic shifts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach remains effective while increasing FID by about 9% on average and FVD by about 3.9% on average. Under the targeted attack setting, the attack success rate (ASR) reaches 0.55. Downstream studies further show tangible risk, which using attacked videos for training decreases 3D detection performance by about 4%, and worsens open-loop planning performance by about 20%. These findings has for the first time revealed and quantified security vulnerabilities in generative world models, driving more comprehensive security checkers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance network efficiency and reduce energy consumption in mixed traffic scenarios with HVs and CAVs.

Method: Decentralized MARL with VDN manages traffic signals; MLTPA guides CAV eco-driving. Evaluated under varying CAV proportions and powertrains.

Result: MARL-based TSC outperforms baseline in speed (7.67%), fuel (10.23%), and idling (45.83%). MLTPA further boosts energy savings.

Conclusion: Framework effectively integrates vehicle-level and intersection-level controls, improving mobility and energy performance in mixed traffic.

Abstract: This study presents a hierarchical, network-level traffic flow control framework for mixed traffic consisting of Human-driven Vehicles (HVs), Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). The framework jointly optimizes vehicle-level eco-driving behaviors and intersection-level traffic signal control to enhance overall network efficiency and decrease energy consumption. A decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach by Value Decomposition Network (VDN) manages cycle-based traffic signal control (TSC) at intersections, while an innovative Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) prediction method integrates a Machine Learning-based Trajectory Planning Algorithm (MLTPA) to guide CAVs in executing Eco-Approach and Departure (EAD) maneuvers. The framework is evaluated across varying CAV proportions and powertrain types to assess its effects on mobility and energy performance. Experimental results conducted in a 4*4 real-world network demonstrate that the MARL-based TSC method outperforms the baseline model (i.e., Webster method) in speed, fuel consumption, and idling time. In addition, with MLTPA, HONEST-CAV benefits the traffic system further in energy consumption and idling time. With a 60% CAV proportion, vehicle average speed, fuel consumption, and idling time can be improved/saved by 7.67%, 10.23%, and 45.83% compared with the baseline. Furthermore, discussions on CAV proportions and powertrain types are conducted to quantify the performance of the proposed method with the impact of automation and electrification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RadioGen3D is a novel framework for 3D radio map estimation using DL, addressing limitations of 2D approaches by generating synthetic 3D data and training a 3D U-Net model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL-based RME methods are limited to 2D scenarios and struggle with 3D propagation and polarization effects due to data scarcity and training challenges.

Method: Proposes RadioGen3D: synthesizes 3D radio map data (Radio3DMix) via parametric modeling and minimal real measurements, then trains a 3D U-Net using a cGAN-based scheme.

Result: Outperforms baselines in accuracy and speed; fine-tuning shows strong generalization through knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: RadioGen3D effectively addresses 3D RME challenges, offering improved accuracy and scalability for future networks.

Abstract: Radio maps are essential for efficient radio resource management in future 6G and low-altitude networks. While deep learning (DL) techniques have emerged as an efficient alternative to conventional ray-tracing for radio map estimation (RME), most existing DL approaches are confined to 2D near-ground scenarios. They often fail to capture essential 3D signal propagation characteristics and antenna polarization effects, primarily due to the scarcity of 3D data and training challenges. To address these limitations, we present the RadioGen3D framework. First, we propose an efficient data synthesis method to generate high-quality 3D radio map data. By establishing a parametric target model that captures 2D ray-tracing and 3D channel fading characteristics, we derive realistic coefficient combinations from minimal real measurements, enabling the construction of a large-scale synthetic dataset, Radio3DMix. Utilizing this dataset, we propose a 3D model training scheme based on a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), yielding a 3D U-Net capable of accurate RME under diverse input feature combinations. Experimental results demonstrate that RadioGen3D surpasses all baselines in both estimation accuracy and speed. Furthermore, fine-tuning experiments verify its strong generalization capability via successful knowledge transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for disease-gene association are labor-intensive and lack scalability, prompting the need for scalable machine learning approaches like GNNs.

Method: GLaDiGAtor uses an encoder-decoder GNN architecture, integrating heterogeneous biological graphs (gene-gene, disease-disease, gene-disease) and enriching nodes with contextual features from ProtT5 and BioBERT.

Result: The model outperforms 14 existing methods in predictive accuracy and generalization, with case studies confirming biologically relevant predictions.

Conclusion: GLaDiGAtor demonstrates the effectiveness of GNNs in biomedical informatics and holds potential for drug discovery by identifying new gene-disease links.

Abstract: Understanding disease-gene associations is essential for unravelling disease mechanisms and advancing diagnostics and therapeutics. Traditional approaches based on manual curation and literature review are labour-intensive and not scalable, prompting the use of machine learning on large biomedical data. In particular, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise for modelling complex biological relationships. To address limitations in existing models, we propose GLaDiGAtor (Graph Learning-bAsed DIsease-Gene AssociaTiOn pRediction), a novel GNN framework with an encoder-decoder architecture for disease-gene association prediction. GLaDiGAtor constructs a heterogeneous biological graph integrating gene-gene, disease-disease, and gene-disease interactions from curated databases, and enriches each node with contextual features from well-known language models (ProtT5 for protein sequences and BioBERT for disease text). In evaluations, our model achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalisation, outperforming 14 existing methods. Literature-supported case studies confirm the biological relevance of high-confidence novel predictions, highlighting GLaDiGAtor's potential to discover candidate disease genes. These results underscore the power of graph convolutional networks in biomedical informatics and may ultimately facilitate drug discovery by revealing new gene-disease links.

TL;DR: CaliCausalRank improves ad ranking by addressing score inconsistency and position bias via training-time calibration, constraint-based optimization, and robust counterfactual estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges like inconsistent score scales across traffic segments and position bias in click logs affecting offline-online metric alignment.

Method: Integrates scale calibration as a training objective, uses Lagrangian relaxation for constraints, and employs variance-reduced counterfactual estimators.

Result: Achieves 1.1% AUC improvement, 31.6% calibration error reduction, and 3.2% utility gain over PairRank.

Conclusion: CaliCausalRank outperforms baselines in accuracy, calibration, and utility while ensuring consistent performance across traffic segments.

Abstract: Ad ranking systems must simultaneously optimize multiple objectives including click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate (CVR), revenue, and user experience metrics. However, production systems face critical challenges: score scale inconsistency across traffic segments undermines threshold transferability, and position bias in click logs causes offline-online metric discrepancies. We propose CaliCausalRank, a unified framework that integrates training-time scale calibration, constraint-based multi-objective optimization, and robust counterfactual utility estimation. Our approach treats score calibration as a first-class training objective rather than post-hoc processing, employs Lagrangian relaxation for constraint satisfaction, and utilizes variance-reduced counterfactual estimators for reliable offline evaluation. Experiments on the Criteo and Avazu datasets demonstrate that CaliCausalRank achieves 1.1% relative AUC improvement, 31.6% calibration error reduction, and 3.2% utility gain compared to the best baseline (PairRank) while maintaining consistent performance across different traffic segments.

*Yixin Liu,Shiyuan Li,Yu Zheng,Qingfeng Chen,Chengqi Zhang,Philip S. Yu,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes ARC and ARC_zero, novel generalist methods for graph anomaly detection that work across multiple datasets with minimal retraining or labeled data, overcoming limitations of traditional one-model-per-dataset approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph anomaly detection methods require dataset-specific training, which is computationally expensive, lacks generalization, and struggles in privacy-sensitive scenarios with limited data access.

Method: ARC uses in-context learning with three modules: feature alignment, a residual GNN encoder, and cross-attentive in-context learning. ARC_zero extends this for zero-shot settings by using pseudo-normal nodes.

Result: Tests on 17 datasets show ARC and ARC_zero effectively detect anomalies, generalize well, and perform efficiently in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer a scalable, efficient, and privacy-preserving solution for generalist graph anomaly detection, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is critical for identifying abnormal nodes in graph-structured data from diverse domains, including cybersecurity and social networks. The existing GAD methods often focus on the learning paradigms of "one-model-for-one-dataset", requiring dataset-specific training for each dataset to achieve optimal performance. However, this paradigm suffers from significant limitations, such as high computational and data costs, limited generalization and transferability to new datasets, and challenges in privacy-sensitive scenarios where access to full datasets or sufficient labels is restricted. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalist GAD paradigm that aims to develop a unified model capable of detecting anomalies on multiple unseen datasets without extensive retraining/fine-tuning or dataset-specific customization. To this end, we propose ARC, a few-shot generalist GAD method that leverages in-context learning and requires only a few labeled normal samples at inference time. Specifically, ARC consists of three core modules: a feature Alignment module to unify and align features across datasets, a Residual GNN encoder to capture dataset-agnostic anomaly representations, and a cross-attentive in-Context learning module to score anomalies using few-shot normal context. Building on ARC, we further introduce ARC_zero for the zero-shot generalist GAD setting, which selects representative pseudo-normal nodes via a pseudo-context mechanism and thus enables fully label-free inference on unseen datasets. Extensive experiments on 17 real-world graph datasets demonstrate that both ARC and ARC_zero effectively detect anomalies, exhibit strong generalization ability, and perform efficiently under few-shot and zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LDTA generalizes LDA by replacing the Dirichlet prior with a Dirichlet-Tree distribution, enabling richer topic correlations and hierarchical relationships, while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Dirichlet prior in LDA limits representation of topic correlations and hierarchies, prompting the development of LDTA for more expressive modeling.

Method: LDTA introduces Dirichlet-Tree priors and employs mean-field variational inference and Expectation Propagation for tractable, GPU-accelerated inference.

Result: LDTA enhances LDA's modeling capacity significantly without sacrificing scalability or computational efficiency.

Conclusion: LDTA offers a flexible and efficient extension to LDA, supporting richer topic structures.

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a foundational model for discovering latent thematic structure in discrete data, but its Dirichlet prior cannot represent the rich correlations and hierarchical relationships often present among topics. We introduce the framework of Latent Dirichlet-Tree Allocation (LDTA), a generalization of LDA that replaces the Dirichlet prior with an arbitrary Dirichlet-Tree (DT) distribution. LDTA preserves LDA's generative structure but enables expressive, tree-structured priors over topic proportions. To perform inference, we develop universal mean-field variational inference and Expectation Propagation, providing tractable updates for all DT. We reveal the vectorized nature of the two inference methods through theoretical development, and perform fully vectorized, GPU-accelerated implementations. The resulting framework substantially expands the modeling capacity of LDA while maintaining scalability and computational efficiency.

*Jiayi Li,Zhaonan Wang,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGNO introduces a stable neural operator for PDEs using spectral methods, addressing errors and high-frequency feedback in autoregressive rollouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive rollouts in neural operators can become unstable due to error accumulation and high-frequency feedback.

Method: SGNO uses exponential time differencing in Fourier space with a nonpositive generator constraint and gated forcing for nonlinear dynamics.

Result: SGNO achieves lower long-horizon error and longer stable rollouts compared to baselines on APEBench.

Conclusion: SGNO's generator constraint, gating, and filtering contribute to stable and accurate PDE surrogate modeling.

Abstract: Neural operators provide fast PDE surrogates and often generalize across parameters and resolutions. However, in the short train long test setting, autoregressive rollouts can become unstable. This typically happens for two reasons: one step errors accumulate over time, and high frequency components feed back and grow.
  We introduce the Spectral Generator Neural Operator (SGNO), a residual time stepper that targets both effects. For the linear part, SGNO uses an exponential time differencing update in Fourier space with a learned diagonal generator. We constrain the real part of this generator to be nonpositive, so iterating the step does not amplify the linear dynamics. For nonlinear dynamics, SGNO adds a gated forcing term with channel mixing within each Fourier mode, which keeps the nonlinear update controlled. To further limit high frequency feedback, SGNO applies spectral truncation and an optional smooth mask on the forcing pathway.
  We derive a one step amplification bound and a finite horizon rollout error bound. The bound separates generator approximation error from nonlinear mismatch and gives sufficient conditions under which the latent $L^2$ norm does not grow across rollout steps. On APEBench spanning 1D, 2D, and 3D PDE families, SGNO achieves lower long horizon error and longer stable rollout lengths than strong neural operator baselines. Ablations confirm the roles of the generator constraint, gating, and filtering.The code is available at https://github.com/lijy32123-cloud/SGNO.

TL;DR: The paper explores the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), finding that sparse subnetworks (


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis holds in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and to identify characteristics of sparse subnetworks that can train to match or surpass the accuracy of dense BNNs, thereby reducing computational demands.

Method: Translated LTH experiments to a Bayesian setting using common computer vision models, investigated defining traits of Bayesian lottery tickets, and tested transplantation methods between BNNs and deterministic Lottery Tickets.

Result: The LTH holds in BNNs, with winning tickets (sparse subnetworks) achieving matching or higher accuracy regardless of model size, though performance degrades at very high sparsities. Pruning should prioritize magnitude, then standard deviation. Models depend variably on mask structures and weight initialization.

Conclusion: The study confirms the applicability of the LTH to BNNs, offering insights for developing sparse training algorithms and understanding training processes in Bayesian settings.

Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are a useful tool for uncertainty quantification, but require substantially more computational resources than conventional neural networks. For non-Bayesian networks, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) posits the existence of sparse subnetworks that can train to the same or even surpassing accuracy as the original dense network. Such sparse networks can lower the demand for computational resources at inference, and during training. The existence of the LTH and corresponding sparse subnetworks in BNNs could motivate the development of sparse training algorithms and provide valuable insights into the underlying training process. Towards this end, we translate the LTH experiments to a Bayesian setting using common computer vision models. We investigate the defining characteristics of Bayesian lottery tickets, and extend our study towards a transplantation method connecting BNNs with deterministic Lottery Tickets. We generally find that the LTH holds in BNNs, and winning tickets of matching and surpassing accuracy are present independent of model size, with degradation at very high sparsities. However, the pruning strategy should rely primarily on magnitude, secondly on standard deviation. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that models rely on mask structure and weight initialization to varying degrees.

*Samuel Fernández-Menduiña,Eduardo Pavez,Antonio Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces L2G-Net, a spectral GNN that processes subgraphs' spectral representations and combines them efficiently, avoiding costly eigendecompositions and improving long-range dependency modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral methods in GNNs are underused due to high computational costs and lack of locality. Existing methods struggle with long-range dependencies, motivating a new approach.

Method: L2G-Net uses a novel factorization of the GFT into subgraph operators combined via Cauchy matrices, avoiding full eigendecompositions and leveraging graph topology.

Result: L2G-Net outperforms existing spectral methods and competes with state-of-the-art GNNs on benchmarks, achieving this with far fewer parameters.

Conclusion: L2G-Net effectively bridges the gap between local and global spectral methods, offering scalable and efficient spectral GNN performance.

Abstract: Despite their theoretical advantages, spectral methods based on the graph Fourier transform (GFT) are seldom used in graph neural networks (GNNs) due to the cost of computing the eigenbasis and the lack of vertex-domain locality in spectral representations. As a result, most GNNs rely on local approximations such as polynomial Laplacian filters or message passing, which limit their ability to model long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce a novel factorization of the GFT into operators acting on subgraphs, which are then combined via a sequence of Cauchy matrices. We use this factorization to propose a new class of spectral GNNs, which we term L2G-Net (Local-to-Global Net). Unlike existing spectral methods, which are either fully global (when they use the GFT) or local (when they use polynomial filters), L2G-Net operates by processing the spectral representations of subgraphs and then combining them via structured matrices. Our algorithm avoids full eigendecompositions, exploiting graph topology to construct the factorization with quadratic complexity in the number of nodes, scaled by the subgraph interface size. Experiments on benchmarks stressing non-local dependencies show that L2G-Net outperforms existing spectral techniques and is competitive with the state-of-the-art with orders of magnitude fewer learnable parameters.

### [314] [Exact Attention Sensitivity and the Geometry of Transformer Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18849)
*Seyed Morteza Emadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the brittleness of transformer training by developing a stability theory. It explains pre-LayerNorm's success, DeepNorm's scaling, and the need for warmup, providing insights into gradient flow and attention dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are central to modern AI but are brittle during training. The paper aims to explain key training phenomena (pre-LayerNorm, DeepNorm scaling, warmup) from first principles.

Method: The study uses two pillars: (1) deriving the exact operator norm of the softmax Jacobian, and (2) introducing a block-∞/RMS geometry for Lipschitz bounds. These tools analyze gradient flow and attention sensitivity.

Result: Pre-LN preserves identity gradient paths, while post-LN compounds LayerNorm Jacobians exponentially. DeepNorm's N^{-1/4} scaling emerges from attention's quartic structure. Experiments show attention sensitivity remains high (θ(p) ≈ 1) throughout training.

Conclusion: Transformer stability stems from architectural gradient flow, not learned attention patterns. This shifts the focus to designing architectures that inherently manage sensitivity.

Abstract: Despite powering modern AI, transformers remain mysteriously brittle to train. We develop a stability theory that explains why pre-LayerNorm works, why DeepNorm uses $N^{-1/4}$ scaling, and why warmup is necessary, all from first principles. Our framework has two pillars: (1) We derive the \emph{exact} operator norm of the softmax Jacobian, $\|J_{softmax}(u/τ)\|_{\infty\to 1} = θ(p)/τ$, where the balanced-mass factor $θ(p)\in[0,1]$ quantifies attention sensitivity. (2) We introduce a block-$\infty$/RMS geometry aligned with tokenwise computation, yielding Lipschitz bounds independent of sequence length. Using this framework, we prove that pre-LN preserves identity gradient paths while post-LN compounds LayerNorm Jacobians exponentially with depth, and we show that DeepNorm's $N^{-1/4}$ emerges from the quartic structure of attention's four projection matrices. We validate our theory on 774M-parameter models and find that, contrary to the intuition that attention sharpens during training to reduce sensitivity, $θ(p) \approx 1$ persists throughout. Transformer stability arises entirely from architectural gradient flow, not from attention dynamics. This finding changes how we reason about training: the architecture itself must handle sensitivity, not learned attention patterns.

*Seyed Morteza Emadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a rank-aware concentration inequality for attention scores in transformers, providing tighter bounds for overflow risk in low-precision training. It proposes geometry-aware scale factors for FP8 training, improving reliability without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the overflow risk in low-precision transformer training by analyzing the concentration of attention scores, particularly focusing on rank-aware bounds.

Method: A rank-aware concentration inequality is derived for attention scores. Geometry-aware scale factors are developed using spectral norms and implicit power iteration, avoiding key expansion in grouped query attention.

Result: The method achieves 8--28× tighter concentration bounds than rank-agnostic approaches and eliminates overflows in FP8 training without impacting downstream accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed geometry-aware scaling offers principled overflow guarantees and compatibility with modern architectures, enhancing reliability in low-precision transformer training.

Abstract: Attention scores in transformers are bilinear forms $S_{ij} = x_i^\top M x_j / \sqrt{d_h}$ whose maximum magnitude governs overflow risk in low-precision training. We derive a \emph{rank-aware concentration inequality}: when the interaction matrix $M = W^Q W^{K\top}$ has rank $r \ll d$, tail probabilities for $\max_{i,j}|S_{ij}|$ decay as $\exp(-d^{2}α^{2}/(γr))$ rather than $\exp(-dα^{2})$, where $γ> 1$ is a typicality parameter. For transformer attention where $r = d_h$, this yields $8$--$28\times$ tighter concentration than rank-agnostic bounds in modern architectures. We apply this result to FP8 training, deriving \emph{geometry-aware scale factors} that provide principled overflow guarantees without observing activations. The method computes per-layer scales from the spectral norm $\|W^Q W^{K\top}\|_2$ via implicit power iteration, includes a grouped query attention formulation that avoids key expansion, and remains compatible with fused attention kernels. Across GPT-2 XL to Llama-2-70B, geometry-aware scaling eliminates overflows in transient scenarios where delayed scaling fails, while achieving comparable downstream MMLU accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates existing methods for measuring task complexity in reinforcement learning (RL) and finds contradictions with typical RL understanding, highlighting the need for better metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve methods for measuring task complexity in non-tabular RL domains, which is crucial for benchmarking and curriculum design.

Method: Evaluation of Random Weight Guessing (RWG), Policy Information Capacity (PIC), and Policy-Optimal Information Capacity (POIC) metrics using progressively difficult robotic manipulation tasks with dense and sparse rewards.

Result: PIC and POIC yield counterintuitive results, such as suggesting a two-link robotic arm is easier than a single-link setup, contradicting RL perspectives. POIC also indicates sparse-reward tasks are easier than dense-reward tasks.

Conclusion: Current RWG-based metrics are unreliable for capturing task complexity in non-tabular RL, emphasizing the need for better alternatives.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled major advances in fields such as robotics and natural language processing. A key challenge in RL is measuring task complexity, which is essential for creating meaningful benchmarks and designing effective curricula. While there are numerous well-established metrics for assessing task complexity in tabular settings, relatively few exist in non-tabular domains. These include (i) Statistical analysis of the performance of random policies via Random Weight Guessing (RWG), and (ii) information-theoretic metrics Policy Information Capacity (PIC) and Policy-Optimal Information Capacity (POIC), which are reliant on RWG. In this paper, we evaluate these methods using progressively difficult robotic manipulation setups, with known relative complexity, with both dense and sparse reward formulations. Our empirical results reveal that measuring complexity is still nuanced. Specifically, under the same reward formulation, PIC suggests that a two-link robotic arm setup is easier than a single-link setup - which contradicts the robotic control and empirical RL perspective whereby the two-link setup is inherently more complex. Likewise, for the same setup, POIC estimates that tasks with sparse rewards are easier than those with dense rewards. Thus, we show that both PIC and POIC contradict typical understanding and empirical results from RL. These findings highlight the need to move beyond RWG-based metrics towards better metrics that can more reliably capture task complexity in non-tabular RL with our task framework as a starting point.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving optimal exploration-exploitation trade-offs in reinforcement learning is challenging due to computational intractability. Existing methods are costly to train.

Method: Combines variational belief learning, sequential Monte-Carlo planning, and meta-reinforcement learning into VariBASeD.

Result: VariBASeD scales well with larger planning budgets, improving sample- and runtime-efficiency over prior methods.

Conclusion: VariBASeD offers a computationally efficient solution for Bayes-adaptive reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Optimally trading-off exploration and exploitation is the holy grail of reinforcement learning as it promises maximal data-efficiency for solving any task. Bayes-optimal agents achieve this, but obtaining the belief-state and performing planning are both typically intractable. Although deep learning methods can greatly help in scaling this computation, existing methods are still costly to train. To accelerate this, this paper proposes a variational framework for learning and planning in Bayes-adaptive Markov decision processes that coalesces variational belief learning, sequential Monte-Carlo planning, and meta-reinforcement learning. In a single-GPU setup, our new method VariBASeD exhibits favorable scaling to larger planning budgets, improving sample- and runtime-efficiency over prior methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Busemann-based hyperbolic layers (BMLR and BFC) for neural networks, offering compact parameters and improved performance in hierarchical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage hyperbolic geometry's advantages for hierarchical data representation, the authors aim to develop intrinsic neural network components operating directly in hyperbolic space.

Method: They lift MLR and FC layers into hyperbolic space using Busemann functions, creating BMLR (compact parameters, distance interpretation) and BFC (generalizes FC layers).

Result: Experiments show improved effectiveness and efficiency in tasks like image classification and link prediction compared to prior hyperbolic layers.

Conclusion: The Busemann-based layers provide a unified, efficient approach for hyperbolic neural networks, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Hyperbolic spaces provide a natural geometry for representing hierarchical and tree-structured data due to their exponential volume growth. To leverage these benefits, neural networks require intrinsic and efficient components that operate directly in hyperbolic space. In this work, we lift two core components of neural networks, Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) and Fully Connected (FC) layers, into hyperbolic space via Busemann functions, resulting in Busemann MLR (BMLR) and Busemann FC (BFC) layers with a unified mathematical interpretation. BMLR provides compact parameters, a point-to-horosphere distance interpretation, batch-efficient computation, and a Euclidean limit, while BFC generalizes FC and activation layers with comparable complexity. Experiments on image classification, genome sequence learning, node classification, and link prediction demonstrate improvements in effectiveness and efficiency over prior hyperbolic layers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores boosting in structured prediction, introducing $(α,β)$-boostability and geometric median aggregation to achieve strong guarantees under various divergences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the incomplete theoretical understanding of aggregation methods in structured prediction, particularly for vector-valued and conditional density prediction under general divergences.

Method: The authors formalize $(α,β)$-boostability and use geometric median aggregation to achieve strong guarantees. They analyze boostability under common divergences ($ℓ_1$, $ℓ_2$, TV, Hel) and propose the 	extsc{GeoMedBoost} framework combining exponential reweighting and geometric-median aggregation.

Result: Results show that geometric median aggregation achieves $(α,β)$-boostability for many divergences, with dimension-dependent tradeoffs. KL divergence requires indirect handling via Hellinger distance. The 	extsc{GeoMedBoost} framework achieves exponential error decay.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified geometric view of boosting for structured prediction, generalizing classical boosting algorithms and offering a theoretical foundation for aggregation methods.

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of boosting in structured prediction, a general theoretical understanding of aggregation beyond scalar losses remains incomplete. We study vector-valued and conditional density prediction under general divergences and identify stability conditions under which aggregation amplifies weak guarantees into strong ones.
  We formalize this stability property as \emph{$(α,β)$-boostability}. We show that geometric median aggregation achieves $(α,β)$-boostability for a broad class of divergences, with tradeoffs that depend on the underlying geometry. For vector-valued prediction and conditional density estimation, we characterize boostability under common divergences ($\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, $\TV$, and $\Hel$) with geometric median, revealing a sharp distinction between dimension-dependent and dimension-free regimes. We further show that while KL divergence is not directly boostable via geometric median aggregation, it can be handled indirectly through boostability under Hellinger distance.
  Building on these structural results, we propose a generic boosting framework \textsc{GeoMedBoost} based on exponential reweighting and geometric-median aggregation. Under a weak learner condition and $(α,β)$-boostability, we obtain exponential decay of the empirical divergence exceedance error. Our framework recovers classical algorithms such as \textsc{MedBoost}, \textsc{AdaBoost}, and \textsc{SAMME} as special cases, and provides a unified geometric view of boosting for structured prediction.

Graph Neural Network(GNN), is proven to be an effective KG embedding technique that enables various downstream tasks like link prediction, node classification, and graph classification. The focus of research in both KG embedding and GNNs has been mostly oriented towards simple graphs with binary relations. However, real-world knowledge bases have a significant share of complex and n-ary facts that cannot be represented by binary edges. More specifically, real-world knowledge bases are often a mix of two types of n-ary facts - (i) that require hyperedges and (ii) that require hyper-relational edges. Though there are research efforts catering to these n-ary fact types, they are pursued independently for each type. We propose $H$yper$E$dge $H$yper-$R$elational edge $GNN$(HEHRGNN), a unified embedding model for n-ary relational KGs with both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges. The two main components of the model are i)HEHR unified fact representation format, and ii)HEHRGNN encoder, a GNN-based encoder with a novel message propagation model capable of capturing complex graph structures comprising both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges. The experimental results of HEHRGNN on link prediction tasks show its effectiveness as a unified embedding model, with inductive prediction capability, for link prediction across real-world datasets having different types of n-ary facts. The model also shows improved link prediction performance over baseline models for hyperedge and hyper-relational datasets.

*Hao Lu,Onur C. Koyun,Yongxin Guo,Zhengjie Zhu,Abbas Alili,Metin Nafi Gurcan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PCA-VAE replaces vector quantization with an online PCA bottleneck, offering a simpler, differentiable, and bit-efficient alternative that outperforms VQ-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vector-quantized autoencoders have flaws like non-differentiability and collapse issues. PCA-VAE aims to address these by leveraging PCA.

Method: PCA-VAE uses an online PCA bottleneck trained via Oja's rule, eliminating codebooks and commitment losses.

Result: PCA-VAE outperforms VQ-GAN and SimVQ in reconstruction quality with 10-100x fewer latent bits and naturally interpretable dimensions.

Conclusion: PCA-VAE provides a stable, efficient, and semantically structured alternative to VQ, suggesting a new direction for generative models.

Abstract: Vector-quantized autoencoders deliver high-fidelity latents but suffer inherent flaws: the quantizer is non-differentiable, requires straight-through hacks, and is prone to collapse. We address these issues at the root by replacing VQ with a simple, principled, and fully differentiable alternative: an online PCA bottleneck trained via Oja's rule. The resulting model, PCA-VAE, learns an orthogonal, variance-ordered latent basis without codebooks, commitment losses, or lookup noise. Despite its simplicity, PCA-VAE exceeds VQ-GAN and SimVQ in reconstruction quality on CelebAHQ while using 10-100x fewer latent bits. It also produces naturally interpretable dimensions (e.g., pose, lighting, gender cues) without adversarial regularization or disentanglement objectives. These results suggest that PCA is a viable replacement for VQ: mathematically grounded, stable, bit-efficient, and semantically structured, offering a new direction for generative models beyond vector quantization.

### [322] [TRUE: A Trustworthy Unified Explanation Framework for Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18905)
*Yujiao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRUE is a framework enhancing interpretability of LLM reasoning via executable verification, DAG modeling, and causal failure analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current explanation methods lack structural insight and fail to reveal reasoning stability or systematic failures.

Method: Integrates executable reasoning verification, feasible-region DAGs, and causal failure mode analysis.

Result: Provides multi-level, verifiable explanations, improving LLM reasoning interpretability and reliability.

Conclusion: TRUE offers a unified paradigm for trustworthy and interpretable LLM reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, yet their decision-making processes remain difficult to interpret. Existing explanation methods often lack trustworthy structural insight and are limited to single-instance analysis, failing to reveal reasoning stability and systematic failure mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose the Trustworthy Unified Explanation Framework (TRUE), which integrates executable reasoning verification, feasible-region directed acyclic graph (DAG) modeling, and causal failure mode analysis. At the instance level, we redefine reasoning traces as executable process specifications and introduce blind execution verification to assess operational validity. At the local structural level, we construct feasible-region DAGs via structure-consistent perturbations, enabling explicit characterization of reasoning stability and the executable region in the local input space. At the class level, we introduce a causal failure mode analysis method that identifies recurring structural failure patterns and quantifies their causal influence using Shapley values. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework provides multi-level, verifiable explanations, including executable reasoning structures for individual instances, feasible-region representations for neighboring inputs, and interpretable failure modes with quantified importance at the class level. These results establish a unified and principled paradigm for improving the interpretability and reliability of LLM reasoning systems.

*Yangchen Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepInterestGR addresses the Shallow Interest problem in generative recommendation by leveraging multi-LLM interest mining, reward-labeled deep interests, and interest-enhanced item discretization, outperforming SOTA baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on shallow behavioral signals, limiting personalization depth and interpretability. DeepInterestGR aims to capture latent, semantically rich interests underlying user interactions.

Method: Introduces Multi-LLM Interest Mining (MLIM), Reward-Labeled Deep Interest (RLDI), and Interest-Enhanced Item Discretization (IEID). Uses a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with GRPO.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three Amazon Review benchmarks across HR@K and NDCG@K metrics.

Conclusion: DeepInterestGR effectively addresses the Shallow Interest problem, enhancing recommendation personalization and interpretability through deep interest mining and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Recent generative recommendation frameworks have demonstrated remarkable scaling potential by reformulating item prediction as autoregressive Semantic ID (SID) generation. However, existing methods primarily rely on shallow behavioral signals, encoding items solely through surface-level textual features such as titles and descriptions. This reliance results in a critical Shallow Interest problem: the model fails to capture the latent, semantically rich interests underlying user interactions, limiting both personalization depth and recommendation interpretability. DeepInterestGR introduces three key innovations: (1) Multi-LLM Interest Mining (MLIM): We leverage multiple frontier LLMs along with their multi-modal variants to extract deep textual and visual interest representations through Chain-of-Thought prompting. (2) Reward-Labeled Deep Interest (RLDI): We employ a lightweight binary classifier to assign reward labels to mined interests, enabling effective supervision signals for reinforcement learning. (3) Interest-Enhanced Item Discretization (IEID): The curated deep interests are encoded into semantic embeddings and quantized into SID tokens via RQ-VAE. We adopt a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning aligns the generative model with deep interest signals and collaborative filtering patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with GRPO optimized by our Interest-Aware Reward. Experiments on three Amazon Review benchmarks demonstrate that DeepInterestGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across HR@K and NDCG@K metrics.

TL;DR: Proposes Semi-Local Differential Privacy (SLDP) framework to decouple privacy costs from refinement iterations for high-resolution grids in LDP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges of density-adaptive domain discretization under Local Differential Privacy (LDP) due to privacy-budget costs from iterative refinement.

Method: Introduces SLDP, assigns privacy regions based on local density, and defines adjacency by point movement within regions. Uses an interactive protocol orchestrated by a server.

Result: Decouples privacy cost from refinement iterations, enabling high-resolution grids without extra privacy budget. Tested on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SLDP effectively balances privacy and utility, enabling high-resolution analytics without iterative privacy costs.

Abstract: Density-adaptive domain discretization is essential for high-utility privacy-preserving analytics but remains challenging under Local Differential Privacy (LDP) due to the privacy-budget costs associated with iterative refinement. We propose a novel framework, Semi-Local Differential Privacy (SLDP), that assigns a privacy region to each user based on local density and defines adjacency by the potential movement of a point within its privacy region. We present an interactive $(\varepsilon, δ)$-SLDP protocol, orchestrated by an honest-but-curious server over a public channel, to estimate these regions privately. Crucially, our framework decouples the privacy cost from the number of refinement iterations, allowing for high-resolution grids without additional privacy budget cost. We experimentally demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on estimation tasks across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework to calibrate AI model performance against the world population, using multi-level scales and publicly available human test data for standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in comparing AI to 'human level' by ensuring benchmarks are commensurate and human baselines represent a broader population.

Method: Develop multi-level scales for various capabilities, calibrate using human test data (e.g., PISA, TIMSS), and estimate a logarithmic base B via LLMs and demographic extrapolation.

Result: Techniques enable recalibration and standardization of scales relative to the world population.

Conclusion: The framework provides a more accurate and scalable method to compare AI performance to human benchmarks.

Abstract: Comparing AI models to "human level" is often misleading when benchmark scores are incommensurate or human baselines are drawn from a narrow population. To address this, we propose a framework that calibrates items against the 'world population' and report performance on a common, human-anchored scale. Concretely, we build on a set of multi-level scales for different capabilities where each level should represent a probability of success of the whole world population on a logarithmic scale with a base $B$. We calibrate each scale for each capability (reasoning, comprehension, knowledge, volume, etc.) by compiling publicly released human test data spanning education and reasoning benchmarks (PISA, TIMSS, ICAR, UKBioBank, and ReliabilityBench). The base $B$ is estimated by extrapolating between samples with two demographic profiles using LLMs, with the hypothesis that they condense rich information about human populations. We evaluate the quality of different mappings using group slicing and post-stratification. The new techniques allow for the recalibration and standardization of scales relative to the whole-world population.

*Abdullah Caglar Oksuz,Anisa Halimi,Erman Ayday*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cost-effective label-only membership inference attack (MIA) framework using transferability and model extraction, reducing query costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIAs face impractical assumptions and high query requirements, prompting the need for a more efficient method.

Method: The framework extracts a surrogate model via active sampling, perturbation-based selection, and synthetic data, shifting query overhead to a one-time phase.

Result: The method achieves membership inference accuracy within ±1% of the target model while using only ≈1% of training sample queries.

Conclusion: The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art label-only MIAs by significantly reducing query costs without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) threaten the privacy of machine learning models by revealing whether a specific data point was used during training. Existing MIAs often rely on impractical assumptions such as access to public datasets, shadow models, confidence scores, or training data distribution knowledge and making them vulnerable to defenses like confidence masking and adversarial regularization. Label-only MIAs, even under strict constraints suffer from high query requirements per sample. We propose a cost-effective label-only MIA framework based on transferability and model extraction. By querying the target model M using active sampling, perturbation-based selection, and synthetic data, we extract a functionally similar surrogate S on which membership inference is performed. This shifts query overhead to a one-time extraction phase, eliminating repeated queries to M . Operating under strict black-box constraints, our method matches the performance of state-of-the-art label-only MIAs while significantly reducing query costs. On benchmarks including Purchase, Location, and Texas Hospital, we show that a query budget equivalent to testing $\approx1\%$ of training samples suffices to extract S and achieve membership inference accuracy within $\pm1\%$ of M . We also evaluate the effectiveness of standard defenses proposed for label-only MIAs against our attack.

*Sacchit Kale,Piyushi Manupriya,Pierre Marion,Francis bach,Anant Raj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that exponential convergence in separable logistic regression can be achieved with structured step-size schedules for gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent, without entering unstable regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the behavior of gradient descent under large step sizes and show that acceleration can occur without instability, addressing gaps in existing theoretical understanding.

Method: Uses a non-adaptive increasing step-size schedule for gradient descent and a lightweight adaptive rule for stochastic gradient descent, avoiding unstable regimes.

Result: Proves exponential convergence for separable logistic regression with stable optimization, improving upon polynomial-rate guarantees for stochastic gradient descent.

Conclusion: Structured step-size growth suffices for exponential acceleration in gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent, eliminating the need for instability.

Abstract: Gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent are central to modern machine learning, yet their behavior under large step sizes remains theoretically unclear. Recent work suggests that acceleration often arises near the edge of stability, where optimization trajectories become unstable and difficult to analyze. Existing results for separable logistic regression achieve faster convergence by explicitly leveraging such unstable regimes through constant or adaptive large step sizes. In this paper, we show that instability is not inherent to acceleration. We prove that gradient descent with a simple, non-adaptive increasing step-size schedule achieves exponential convergence for separable logistic regression under a margin condition, while remaining entirely within a stable optimization regime. The resulting method is anytime and does not require prior knowledge of the optimization horizon or target accuracy. We also establish exponential convergence of stochastic gradient descent using a lightweight adaptive step-size rule that avoids line search and specialized procedures, improving upon existing polynomial-rate guarantees. Together, our results demonstrate that carefully structured step-size growth alone suffices to obtain exponential acceleration for both gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a symmetry reduction framework to eliminate redundancy in Transformer models by using invariant relational quantities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the internal redundancy in Transformer models caused by coordinate-dependent representations and continuous symmetries.

Method: Reformulate representations, attention mechanisms, and optimization dynamics using invariant relational quantities, eliminating redundant degrees of freedom.

Result: Architectures that operate directly on relational structures, reducing parameter redundancy and aiding optimization analysis.

Conclusion: The symmetry reduction framework provides a principled geometric approach to tackle redundancy in Transformers.

Abstract: Transformer models contain substantial internal redundancy arising from coordinate-dependent representations and continuous symmetries, in model space and in head space, respectively. While recent approaches address this by explicitly breaking symmetry, we propose a complementary framework based on symmetry reduction. We reformulate representations, attention mechanisms, and optimization dynamics in terms of invariant relational quantities, eliminating redundant degrees of freedom by construction. This perspective yields architectures that operate directly on relational structures, providing a principled geometric framework for reducing parameter redundancy and analyzing optimization.

*Philip Mortimer,Cristiana Diaconu,Tommy Rochussen,Bruno Mlodozeniec,Richard E. Turner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Incremental TNP (incTNP), a variant of Transformer Neural Processes (TNPs), designed for efficient sequential updates in streaming data applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TNPs lack the capability for incremental updates, making them inefficient for continuous data streams like sensor readings or database updates.

Method: incTNP uses causal masking, Key-Value (KV) caching, and an autoregressive training strategy to enable linear-time updates while maintaining performance.

Result: incTNP matches or surpasses standard TNPs in predictive performance and achieves significant computational speedups for sequential inference.

Conclusion: incTNP combines computational efficiency with consistent Bayesian updates, making it suitable for streaming inference without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs), and specifically Transformer Neural Processes (TNPs), have demonstrated remarkable performance across tasks ranging from spatiotemporal forecasting to tabular data modelling. However, many of these applications are inherently sequential, involving continuous data streams such as real-time sensor readings or database updates. In such settings, models should support cheap, incremental updates rather than recomputing internal representations from scratch for every new observation -- a capability existing TNP variants lack. Drawing inspiration from Large Language Models, we introduce the Incremental TNP (incTNP). By leveraging causal masking, Key-Value (KV) caching, and a data-efficient autoregressive training strategy, incTNP matches the predictive performance of standard TNPs while reducing the computational cost of updates from quadratic to linear time complexity. We empirically evaluate our model on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including tabular regression and temperature prediction. Our results show that, surprisingly, incTNP delivers performance comparable to -- or better than -- non-causal TNPs while unlocking orders-of-magnitude speedups for sequential inference. Finally, we assess the consistency of the model's updates -- by adapting a metric of ``implicit Bayesianness", we show that incTNP retains a prediction rule as implicitly Bayesian as standard non-causal TNPs, demonstrating that incTNP achieves the computational benefits of causal masking without sacrificing the consistency required for streaming inference.

TL;DR: CoSiNE combines deep learning and phylogenetic models to improve antibody engineering by capturing epistatic effects and evolutionary dynamics, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods in antibody engineering ignore the evolutionary process of affinity maturation, while phylogenetic models lack expressivity for complex interactions.

Method: Developed CoSiNE, a continuous-time Markov chain with a deep neural network, and introduced Guided Gillespie for efficient optimization.

Result: CoSiNE approximates epistatic effects with quadratic error bounds and outperforms state-of-the-art language models in zero-shot variant prediction.

Conclusion: CoSiNE bridges the gap between deep learning and phylogenetic models, enabling better antibody optimization.

Abstract: Common deep learning approaches for antibody engineering focus on modeling the marginal distribution of sequences. By treating sequences as independent samples, however, these methods overlook affinity maturation as a rich and largely untapped source of information about the evolutionary process by which antibodies explore the underlying fitness landscape. In contrast, classical phylogenetic models explicitly represent evolutionary dynamics but lack the expressivity to capture complex epistatic interactions. We bridge this gap with CoSiNE, a continuous-time Markov chain parameterized by a deep neural network. Mathematically, we prove that CoSiNE provides a first-order approximation to the intractable sequential point mutation process, capturing epistatic effects with an error bound that is quadratic in branch length. Empirically, CoSiNE outperforms state-of-the-art language models in zero-shot variant effect prediction by explicitly disentangling selection from context-dependent somatic hypermutation. Finally, we introduce Guided Gillespie, a classifier-guided sampling scheme that steers CoSiNE at inference time, enabling efficient optimization of antibody binding affinity toward specific antigens.

*Ilan Doron-Arad,Elchanan Mossel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the complexity of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) under a realistic bit-level model, revealing tractability differences based on activation functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional analysis of ERM assumes idealized computational models, but this diverges from real-world finite-precision hardware. The study aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors introduce $	ext{ERM}_{	ext{bit}}$, a bit-level model for ERM, and analyze its complexity for neural networks with polynomial and piecewise-linear activations.

Result: Training deep networks with polynomial activations is $	ext{\#P}$-Hard, while piecewise-linear activations like ReLU remain tractable (NP-complete).

Conclusion: Finite-precision constraints are fundamental to learnability, with activation functions dictating computational tractability.

Abstract: Theoretical analyses of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) are standardly framed within the Real-RAM model of computation. In this setting, training even simple neural networks is known to be $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete -- a complexity class believed to be harder than NP, that characterizes the difficulty of solving systems of polynomial inequalities over the real numbers. However, this algebraic framework diverges from the reality of digital computation with finite-precision hardware. In this work, we analyze the theoretical complexity of ERM under a realistic bit-level model ($\mathsf{ERM}_{\text{bit}}$), where network parameters and inputs are constrained to be rational numbers with polynomially bounded bit-lengths. Under this model, we reveal a sharp dichotomy in tractability governed by the network's activation function. We prove that for deep networks with {\em any} polynomial activations with rational coefficients and degree at least $2$, the bit-complexity of training is severe: deciding $\mathsf{ERM}_{\text{bit}}$ is $\#P$-Hard, hence believed to be strictly harder than NP-complete problems. Furthermore, we show that determining the sign of a single partial derivative of the empirical loss function is intractable (unlikely in BPP), and deciding a specific bit in the gradient is $\#P$-Hard. This provides a complexity-theoretic perspective for the phenomenon of exploding and vanishing gradients. In contrast, we show that for piecewise-linear activations such as ReLU, the precision requirements remain manageable: $\mathsf{ERM}_{\text{bit}}$ is contained within NP (specifically NP-complete), and standard backpropagation runs in polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that finite-precision constraints are not merely implementation details but fundamental determinants of learnability.

TL;DR: ADRA is a new MIA method that actively induces a model to reconstruct training data via RL, outperforming existing MIAs by 10.7% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training data are hypothesized to be more reconstructible than non-members, and this difference can be exploited for membership inference.

Method: Leverages on-policy RL to finetune a policy from the target model, using designed reconstruction metrics and contrastive rewards.

Result: ADRA and ADRA+ outperform existing MIAs, with improvements of up to 18.8% in specific tasks.

Conclusion: ADRA is effective for detecting pre-training, post-training, and distillation data, demonstrating significant improvements over conventional MIAs.

Abstract: Detecting LLM training data is generally framed as a membership inference attack (MIA) problem. However, conventional MIAs operate passively on fixed model weights, using log-likelihoods or text generations. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Active Data Reconstruction Attack} (ADRA), a family of MIA that actively induces a model to reconstruct a given text through training. We hypothesize that training data are \textit{more reconstructible} than non-members, and the difference in their reconstructibility can be exploited for membership inference. Motivated by findings that reinforcement learning (RL) sharpens behaviors already encoded in weights, we leverage on-policy RL to actively elicit data reconstruction by finetuning a policy initialized from the target model. To effectively use RL for MIA, we design reconstruction metrics and contrastive rewards. The resulting algorithms, \textsc{ADRA} and its adaptive variant \textsc{ADRA+}, improve both reconstruction and detection given a pool of candidate data. Experiments show that our methods consistently outperform existing MIAs in detecting pre-training, post-training, and distillation data, with an average improvement of 10.7\% over the previous runner-up. In particular, \MethodPlus~improves over Min-K\%++ by 18.8\% on BookMIA for pre-training detection and by 7.6\% on AIME for post-training detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse lithography suffers from non-convex objectives trapping optimization in poor local minima. Existing generative AI methods mimic sub-optimal datasets, offering limited guidance for escaping these traps.

Method: Mask synthesis is reformulated as conditional sampling: a generator is pretrained with WGAN and reconstruction loss, then fine-tuned with GRPO and ILT-guided imitation loss. Batched refinement and lithography metrics evaluate and select the best candidate.

Result: The framework reduces EPE violations, doubles throughput, and improves mask quality on LithoBench, with a 20% EPE improvement and 3x speedup on ICCAD13 cases.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach mitigates non-convexity by proposing ILT-friendly initializations, outperforming traditional solvers or generative AI alone.

Abstract: Inverse lithography (ILT) is critical for modern semiconductor manufacturing but suffers from highly non-convex objectives that often trap optimization in poor local minima. Generative AI has been explored to warm-start ILT, yet most approaches train deterministic image-to-image translators to mimic sub-optimal datasets, providing limited guidance for escaping non-convex traps during refinement. We reformulate mask synthesis as conditional sampling: a generator learns a distribution over masks conditioned on the design and proposes multiple candidates. The generator is first pretrained with WGAN plus a reconstruction loss, then fine-tuned using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with an ILT-guided imitation loss. At inference, we sample a small batch of masks, run fast batched ILT refinement, evaluate lithography metrics (e.g., EPE, process window), and select the best candidate. On \texttt{LithoBench} dataset, the proposed hybrid framework reduces EPE violations under a 3\,nm tolerance and roughly doubles throughput versus a strong numerical ILT baseline, while improving final mask quality. We also present over 20\% EPE improvement on \texttt{ICCAD13} contest cases with 3$\times$ speedup over the SOTA numerical ILT solver. By learning to propose ILT-friendly initializations, our approach mitigates non-convexity and advances beyond what traditional solvers or GenAI can achieve.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Feedback from AI-generated data in training can cause model collapse, termed 'neural resonance,' where latent space converges to low-dimensional structures. A Markov Chain model identifies ergodicity and directional contraction as conditions for resonance, demonstrated across datasets and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms behind model collapse caused by iterative feedback of AI-generated data in training.

Method: Modeling iterative feedback as a Markov Chain, studying diffusion models on MNIST and ImageNet, CycleGAN, and audio feedback experiments.

Result: Identified neural resonance and an eight-pattern taxonomy of collapse behaviors, providing diagnostics for mitigating collapse.

Conclusion: Neural resonance explains degenerate behavior in generative models and offers practical solutions to identify and mitigate collapse.

Abstract: AI training datasets will inevitably contain AI-generated examples, leading to ``feedback'' in which the output of one model impacts the training of another. It is known that such iterative feedback can lead to model collapse, yet the mechanisms underlying this degeneration remain poorly understood. Here we show that a broad class of feedback processes converges to a low-dimensional invariant structure in latent space, a phenomenon we call neural resonance. By modeling iterative feedback as a Markov Chain, we show that two conditions are needed for this resonance to occur: ergodicity of the feedback process and directional contraction of the latent representation. By studying diffusion models on MNIST and ImageNet, as well as CycleGAN and an audio feedback experiment, we map how local and global manifold geometry evolve, and we introduce an eight-pattern taxonomy of collapse behaviors. Neural resonance provides a unified explanation for long-term degenerate behavior in generative models and provides practical diagnostics for identifying, characterizing, and eventually mitigating collapse.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses intransitive preferences in preference fine-tuning (PFT) by proposing MaxEntBW, a game-theoretic solution, and PROSPER, an efficient algorithm for PFT. PROSPER outperforms baselines in fine-tuning large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intransitive preferences in PFT break the assumption of a well-defined optimal policy. The paper aims to solve this challenge, especially in multi-objective settings.

Method: Introduces MaxEntBW for handling intransitive preferences and PROSPER, an efficient PFT algorithm that avoids scalarization of multiple objectives.

Result: PROSPER outperforms baselines in fine-tuning LLMs, achieving better performance in instruction following and general chat benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed MaxEntBW and PROSPER effectively handle intransitive preferences in PFT, demonstrating practical success in LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: A recurring challenge in preference fine-tuning (PFT) is handling $\textit{intransitive}$ (i.e., cyclic) preferences. Intransitive preferences often stem from either $\textit{(i)}$ inconsistent rankings along a single objective or $\textit{(ii)}$ scalarizing multiple objectives into a single metric. Regardless of their source, the downstream implication of intransitive preferences is the same: there is no well-defined optimal policy, breaking a core assumption of the standard PFT pipeline. In response, we propose a novel, game-theoretic solution concept -- the $\textit{Maximum Entropy Blackwell Winner}$ ($\textit{MaxEntBW}$) -- that is well-defined under multi-objective intransitive preferences. To enable computing MaxEntBWs at scale, we derive $\texttt{PROSPER}$: a provably efficient PFT algorithm. Unlike prior self-play techniques, $\texttt{PROSPER}$ directly handles multiple objectives without requiring scalarization. We then apply $\texttt{PROSPER}$ to the problem of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) from multi-objective LLM-as-a-Judge feedback (e.g., rubric-based judges), a setting where both sources of intransitivity arise. We find that $\texttt{PROSPER}$ outperforms all baselines considered across both instruction following and general chat benchmarks, releasing trained model checkpoints at the 7B and 3B parameter scales.

Motivation: DLMs suffer from slow inference due to multi-step sampling, limiting practical use. Inverse Distillation offers a solution but introduces challenges in the discrete setting.

Method: Extend Inverse Distillation to DLMs, provide uniqueness guarantees for the objective, and introduce gradient-stable relaxations for stable training.

Result: IDLM reduces inference steps by 4x-64x while preserving entropy and generative perplexity of the teacher model.

Conclusion: IDLM successfully accelerates DLMs with theoretical and practical improvements, enabling faster inference without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently achieved strong results in text generation. However, their multi-step sampling leads to slow inference, limiting practical use. To address this, we extend Inverse Distillation, a technique originally developed to accelerate continuous diffusion models, to the discrete setting. Nonetheless, this extension introduces both theoretical and practical challenges. From a theoretical perspective, the inverse distillation objective lacks uniqueness guarantees, which may lead to suboptimal solutions. From a practical standpoint, backpropagation in the discrete space is non-trivial and often unstable. To overcome these challenges, we first provide a theoretical result demonstrating that our inverse formulation admits a unique solution, thereby ensuring valid optimization. We then introduce gradient-stable relaxations to support effective training. As a result, experiments on multiple DLMs show that our method, Inverse-distilled Diffusion Language Models (IDLM), reduces the number of inference steps by 4x-64x, while preserving the teacher model's entropy and generative perplexity.

*Hui He,Hezhe Qiao,Yutong Chen,Kun Yi,Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeRadar is a new time series foundation model designed for unsupervised anomaly detection by leveraging fractional time-frequency domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models fail at unsupervised tasks like TSAD due to overlapping patterns of normal and abnormal data in predefined domains.

Method: Introduces FTFRecon for adaptive data reconstruction in optimal fractional domains and CDL for local deviation modeling.

Result: Effectively differentiates abnormal patterns from regular ones, even in unseen datasets.

Conclusion: TimeRadar improves TSAD performance by adaptively rotating to optimal time-frequency representations.

Abstract: Current time series foundation models (TSFMs) primarily focus on learning prevalent and regular patterns within a predefined time or frequency domain to enable supervised downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting). Consequently, they are often ineffective for inherently unsupervised downstream tasks-such as time series anomaly detection (TSAD), which aims to identify rare, irregular patterns. This limitation arises because such abnormal patterns can closely resemble the regular patterns when presented in the same time/frequency domain. To address this issue, we introduce TimeRadar, an innovative TSFM built in a fractional time-frequency domain to support generalist TSAD across diverse unseen datasets. Our key insight is that rotating a time series into a data-dependent fractional time-frequency representation can adaptively differentiate the normal and abnormal signals across different datasets. To this end, a novel component, namely Fractionally modulated Time-Frequency Reconstruction (FTFRecon), is proposed in TimeRadar to leverage a learnable fractional order to rotate the time series to the most pronounced angle between a continuous time and frequency domain for accurate data reconstruction. This provides adaptive data reconstruction in an optimal time-frequency domain for each data input, enabling effective differentiation of the unbounded abnormal patterns from the regular ones across datasets, including unseen datasets. To allow TimeRadar to model local abnormality that is not captured by the global data reconstruction, we further introduce a Contextual Deviation Learning (CDL) component to model the local deviation of the input relative to its contextual time series data in the rotatable domain.

### [338] [RKHS Representation of Algebraic Convolutional Filters with Integral Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19094)
*Alejandro Parada-Mayorga,Alejandro Ribeiro,Juan Bazerque*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the connection between integral operators and RKHS, showing how their ranges induce RKHS convolutional models with kernels defined by operator symbols. It also links polynomial filtering to iterated box products and provides spatial-spectral insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically explore the overlooked connection between integral operators and RKHS within algebraic signal processing, offering new theoretical insights and practical implementations.

Method: Develops a theory showing how integral operators induce RKHS models, characterizes their algebraic and spectral properties, and links polynomial filtering to iterated box products.

Result: Establishes connections between eigendecompositions and RKHS representations, extends to directed graphons, and enables optimal filters for regularized learning problems with finite-dimensional RKHS representations.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundational theory for RKHS representations in integral-operator-based signal processing, offering new spatial-spectral localization results and learnable filter foundations.

Abstract: Integral operators play a central role in signal processing, underpinning classical convolution, and filtering on continuous network models such as graphons. While these operators are traditionally analyzed through spectral decompositions, their connection to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) has not been systematically explored within the algebraic signal processing framework. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive theory showing that the range of integral operators naturally induces RKHS convolutional signal models whose reproducing kernels are determined by a box product of the operator symbols. We characterize the algebraic and spectral properties of these induced RKHS and show that polynomial filtering with integral operators corresponds to iterated box products, giving rise to a unital kernel algebra. This perspective yields pointwise RKHS representations of filters via the reproducing property, providing an alternative to operator-based implementations. Our results establish precise connections between eigendecompositions and RKHS representations in graphon signal processing, extend naturally to directed graphons, and enable novel spatial--spectral localization results. Furthermore, we show that when the spectral domain is a subset of the original domain of the signals, optimal filters for regularized learning problems admit finite-dimensional RKHS representations, providing a principled foundation for learnable filters in integral-operator-based neural architectures.

*Wei Chen,Junle Chen,Yuqian Wu,Yuxuan Liang,Xiaofang Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ST-Prune is a novel technique for spatio-temporal forecasting that dynamically prunes less informative samples during training to improve efficiency and maintain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training deep learning models on massive spatio-temporal datasets is computationally inefficient due to redundant data, prompting the need for smarter training methods.

Method: The paper introduces ST-Prune, a dynamic sample pruning approach that identifies and prioritizes informative samples based on the model's learning state.

Result: Experiments show ST-Prune accelerates training without compromising model performance, demonstrating scalability and universality.

Conclusion: ST-Prune offers an effective solution to enhance training efficiency in spatio-temporal forecasting by leveraging dynamic sample pruning.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is fundamental to intelligent systems in transportation, climate science, and urban planning. However, training deep learning models on the massive, often redundant, datasets from these domains presents a significant computational bottleneck. Existing solutions typically focus on optimizing model architectures or optimizers, while overlooking the inherent inefficiency of the training data itself. This conventional approach of iterating over the entire static dataset each epoch wastes considerable resources on easy-to-learn or repetitive samples. In this paper, we explore a novel training-efficiency techniques, namely learning from complexity with dynamic sample pruning, ST-Prune, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through dynamic sample pruning, we aim to intelligently identify the most informative samples based on the model's real-time learning state, thereby accelerating convergence and improving training efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-Prune significantly accelerates the training speed while maintaining or even improving the model performance, and it also has scalability and universality.

*Michele Caprio,Katerina Papagiannouli,Siu Lun Chau,Sayan Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust Bayesian framework for random feature regression using contamination sets and pessimistic generalized Bayesian updating, providing tractable bounds for predictive uncertainty and preserving asymptotic properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address prior and likelihood misspecification in Bayesian random feature regression by incorporating robustness through contamination sets.

Method: Replace Gaussian priors/likelihoods with ε- and η-contaminated credal sets, use pessimistic generalized Bayesian updating, and derive bounds for predictive densities and uncertainty quantification.

Result: The framework yields tractable uncertainty envelopes, efficient IHDR approximations, and preserves asymptotic properties of RF models.

Conclusion: The approach ensures robust predictive uncertainty with computational tractability and explicit worst-case guarantees.

Abstract: We propose a robust Bayesian formulation of random feature (RF) regression that accounts explicitly for prior and likelihood misspecification via Huber-style contamination sets. Starting from the classical equivalence between ridge-regularized RF training and Bayesian inference with Gaussian priors and likelihoods, we replace the single prior and likelihood with $ε$- and $η$-contaminated credal sets, respectively, and perform inference using pessimistic generalized Bayesian updating. We derive explicit and tractable bounds for the resulting lower and upper posterior predictive densities. These bounds show that, when contamination is moderate, prior and likelihood ambiguity effectively acts as a direct contamination of the posterior predictive distribution, yielding uncertainty envelopes around the classical Gaussian predictive. We introduce an Imprecise Highest Density Region (IHDR) for robust predictive uncertainty quantification and show that it admits an efficient outer approximation via an adjusted Gaussian credible interval. We further obtain predictive variance bounds (under a mild truncation approximation for the upper bound) and prove that they preserve the leading-order proportional-growth asymptotics known for RF models. Together, these results establish a robustness theory for Bayesian random features: predictive uncertainty remains computationally tractable, inherits the classical double-descent phase structure, and is improved by explicit worst-case guarantees under bounded prior and likelihood misspecification.

### [341] [Detecting labeling bias using influence functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19130)
*Frida Jørgensen,Nina Weng,Siavash Bigdeli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using influence functions to detect labeling bias in datasets, demonstrating success in identifying mislabeled samples in MNIST and CheXpert datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeling bias in datasets can lead to unequal error rates or misrepresentation of subgroups. Existing fairness constraints often fail when labeling bias is present, prompting the need for a detection method.

Method: The study uses influence functions, leveraging gradients and Hessians of the loss function, to estimate the impact of training samples on model predictions. A sample valuation pipeline was developed and tested on MNIST and CheXpert datasets, with controlled label errors introduced.

Result: The method successfully detected nearly 90% of mislabeled samples in MNIST and consistently identified mislabeled samples in CheXpert with higher influence scores.

Conclusion: Influence functions show promise for detecting labeling bias, offering a practical tool to identify label errors in datasets.

Abstract: Labeling bias arises during data collection due to resource limitations or unconscious bias, leading to unequal label error rates across subgroups or misrepresentation of subgroup prevalence. Most fairness constraints assume training labels reflect the true distribution, rendering them ineffective when labeling bias is present; leaving a challenging question, that \textit{how can we detect such labeling bias?} In this work, we investigate whether influence functions can be used to detect labeling bias. Influence functions estimate how much each training sample affects a model's predictions by leveraging the gradient and Hessian of the loss function -- when labeling errors occur, influence functions can identify wrongly labeled samples in the training set, revealing the underlying failure mode. We develop a sample valuation pipeline and test it first on the MNIST dataset, then scaled to the more complex CheXpert medical imaging dataset. To examine label noise, we introduced controlled errors by flipping 20\% of the labels for one class in the dataset. Using a diagonal Hessian approximation, we demonstrated promising results, successfully detecting nearly 90\% of mislabeled samples in MNIST. On CheXpert, mislabeled samples consistently exhibit higher influence scores. These results highlight the potential of influence functions for identifying label errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised causal learning struggles with generalization across diverse interventional settings, especially when intervention targets are unknown.

Method: TICL uses a self-augmentation strategy to create instance-specific training data at test time and a PC-inspired two-phase supervised learning scheme to leverage this data while ensuring identifiability.

Result: Extensive experiments on bnlearn benchmarks show TICL excels in causal discovery and intervention target detection.

Conclusion: TICL effectively addresses generalization challenges in causal discovery, demonstrating superior performance in diverse interventional settings.

Abstract: Supervised causal learning has shown promise in causal discovery, yet it often struggles with generalization across diverse interventional settings, particularly when intervention targets are unknown. To address this, we propose TICL (Test-time Interventional Causal Learning), a novel method that synergizes Test-Time Training with Joint Causal Inference. Specifically, we design a self-augmentation strategy to generate instance-specific training data at test time, effectively avoiding distribution shifts. Furthermore, by integrating joint causal inference, we developed a PC-inspired two-phase supervised learning scheme, which effectively leverages self-augmented training data while ensuring theoretical identifiability. Extensive experiments on bnlearn benchmarks demonstrate TICL's superiority in multiple aspects of causal discovery and intervention target detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple normalized optimizer architecture and augmented meta-training enable efficient meta-training of a performant general-purpose learned update rule with minimal compute (4.5 GPU hours), scaling to billion-scale tasks like GPT-3 XL 1.3B and performing well across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learned optimizers often fail to generalize beyond their training distribution and require high meta-training costs, limiting practical adoption.

Method: Developed a simple normalized optimizer architecture and augmented meta-training to reduce compute requirements and improve scalability.

Result: Achieved stable scaling to GPT-3 XL 1.3B (six orders larger than meta-training) and strong performance on diverse out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: This work enables practical learned optimization, opening avenues for richer meta-training and data curation to enhance performance.

Abstract: Learned optimizers are powerful alternatives to hand-designed update rules like Adam, yet they have seen limited practical adoption since they often fail to meta-generalize beyond their training distribution and incur high meta-training cost. For instance, prior work, VeLO, scaled meta-training to 4,000 TPU months ($\sim$10$\times$ GPT-3 compute) to meta-train a general-purpose optimizer but it failed to generalize beyond 600M parameters tasks. In this work, we present a surprising finding: by crafting a simple normalized optimizer architecture and augmenting meta-training, it becomes feasible to meta-train a performant general-purpose learned update rule on a tiny fraction of VeLO compute, 4.5 GPU hours to be precise. Our learned update rule scales stably to a billion-scale pretraining task (GPT-3 XL 1.3B) which is six orders of magnitude larger than its meta-training distribution. Furthermore, it shows strong performance across diverse out-of-distribution tasks and is compatible with modern optimization harness that includes orthogonalization, distinct update rules for input-output and hidden weights, and decoupled weight decay. In all, this work paves the way for practically applicable learnable optimization algorithms, unlocking exploration of richer meta-training and data curation recipes to further improve performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers integrate multi-position information with varying statistical significance and uncover their staged learning dynamics.

Method: High-order Markov chain task analysis using sparse attention patterns and simplified differential equations to model learning stages.

Result: Transformers learn incrementally, shifting from competitive to cooperative head specialization, with early stopping favoring simpler hypothesis classes.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical insights into staged learning in transformers, aiding generalization understanding in NLP and algorithmic reasoning.

Abstract: This paper introduces a high-order Markov chain task to investigate how transformers learn to integrate information from multiple past positions with varying statistical significance. We demonstrate that transformers learn this task incrementally: each stage is defined by the acquisition of specific information through sparse attention patterns. Notably, we identify a shift in learning dynamics from competitive, where heads converge on the most statistically dominant pattern, to cooperative, where heads specialize in distinct patterns. We model these dynamics using simplified differential equations that characterize the trajectory and prove stage-wise convergence results. Our analysis reveals that transformers ascend a complexity ladder by passing through simpler, misspecified hypothesis classes before reaching the full model class. We further show that early stopping acts as an implicit regularizer, biasing the model toward these simpler classes. These results provide a theoretical foundation for the emergence of staged learning and complex behaviors in transformers, offering insights into generalization for natural language processing and algorithmic reasoning.

TL;DR: VPS introduces dynamic, activation-conditioned low-rank perturbations for frozen transformer layers, enabling test-time adaptation without persistent parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models by dynamically adjusting perturbations based on activation statistics and optional gradient signals.

Method: Constructs perturbation factors on the fly using activation-guided selection or Sylvester-coupled regression, modulated by activation energy and token-level entropy.

Result: Provides theoretical analysis of spectral properties and implements adaptive policy systems for multi-objective verification.

Conclusion: VPS offers a novel algorithmic framework for activation-conditioned computation, improving adaptability without persistent parameter updates.

Abstract: I introduce Virtual Parameter Sharpening (VPS), an inference-time technique that augments frozen transformer linear layers with dynamic, activation-conditioned low-rank perturbations. Unlike parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA, which learn static low-rank adapters, VPS constructs its perturbation factors on the fly from batch activation statistics and optional gradient signals, enabling test-time adaptation without persistent parameter updates. The perturbation takes the form Delta W = gamma * W^T V U^T W, where selector matrices U and V are constructed via sparse activation-guided selection or Sylvester-coupled regression. We provide a theoretical analysis of the perturbation's spectral properties and describe an adaptive policy system that modulates perturbation magnitude based on activation energy and token-level entropy. This system incorporates multi-objective verification with iterative refinement for tasks with ground-truth supervision. We present the complete algorithmic framework, analyze its mathematical foundations, and discuss the mechanisms by which activation-conditioned computation may enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models. Implementation and experimental code are available at https://github.com/Saba-Kublashvili/vps-virtual-parameter-synthesis .

TL;DR: The paper explores realizable online regression under adversarial models with approximate pseudo-metric losses, proposing a potential method to bound the minimax cumulative loss using Dudley-type entropy integrals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why realizable online regression behaves differently from classification and to provide concrete bounds using entropy integrals.

Method: A potential method using Dudley-type entropy integrals to upper bound the scaled Littlestone dimension by covering numbers of the hypothesis class.

Result: Shows that polynomial metric entropy implies finite cumulative loss bounds, with applications to Lipschitz regression and ReLU networks.

Conclusion: The entropy potential method provides transparent bounds for realizable online regression, contrasting sharply with classification results.

Abstract: Realizable online regression can behave very differently from online classification. Even without any margin or stochastic assumptions, realizability may enforce horizon-free (finite) cumulative loss under metric-like losses, even when the analogous classification problem has an infinite mistake bound. We study realizable online regression in the adversarial model under losses that satisfy an approximate triangle inequality (approximate pseudo-metrics). Recent work of Attias et al. shows that the minimax realizable cumulative loss is characterized by the scaled Littlestone/online dimension $\mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{onl}}$, but this quantity can be difficult to analyze.
  Our main contribution is a generic potential method that upper bounds $\mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{onl}}$ by a concrete Dudley-type entropy integral that depends only on covering numbers of the hypothesis class under the induced sup pseudo-metric. We define an \emph{entropy potential} $Φ(\mathcal{H})=\int_{0}^{diam(\mathcal{H})} \log N(\mathcal{H},\varepsilon)\,d\varepsilon$, where $N(\mathcal{H},\varepsilon)$ is the $\varepsilon$-covering number of $\mathcal{H}$, and show that for every $c$-approximate pseudo-metric loss, $\mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{onl}}(\mathcal{H})\le O(c)\,Φ(\mathcal{H})$. In particular, polynomial metric entropy implies $Φ(\mathcal{H})<\infty$ and hence a horizon-free realizable cumulative-loss bound with transparent dependence on effective dimension.
  We illustrate the method on two families. We prove a sharp $q$-vs.-$d$ dichotomy for realizable online learning (finite and efficiently achievable $Θ_{d,q}(L^d)$ total loss for $L$-Lipschitz regression iff $q>d$, otherwise infinite), and for bounded-norm $k$-ReLU networks separate regression (finite loss, even $\widetilde O(k^2)$, and $O(1)$ for one ReLU) from classification (impossible already for $k=2,d=1$).

TL;DR: Hybrid Federated Learning (HybridFL) combines horizontal and vertical data partitions for collaborative model training without sharing raw data, showing superior performance in financial crime detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data often has complex hybrid distributions, but standard federated learning (FL) only handles horizontal or vertical partitions. This gap motivates HybridFL.

Method: HybridFL integrates horizontal aggregation (across disjoint users) and vertical feature fusion (across complementary feature sets) to enable joint learning while preserving data locality.

Result: HybridFL outperforms transaction-only local models and matches centralized benchmarks in financial crime detection, as shown on AMLSim and SWIFT datasets.

Conclusion: HybridFL effectively addresses hybrid data distributions in federated learning, demonstrating practical utility in privacy-sensitive applications like financial crime detection.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train models on privately owned data without sharing raw information. While standard FL typically addresses either horizontal or vertical data partitions, many real-world scenarios exhibit a complex hybrid distribution. This paper proposes Hybrid Federated Learning (HybridFL) to address data split both horizontally across disjoint users and vertically across complementary feature sets. We evaluate HybridFL in a financial crime detection context, where a transaction party holds transaction-level attributes and multiple banks maintain private account-level features. By integrating horizontal aggregation and vertical feature fusion, the proposed architecture enables joint learning while strictly preserving data locality. Experiments on AMLSim and SWIFT datasets demonstrate that HybridFL significantly outperforms the transaction-only local model and achieves performance comparable to a centralized benchmark.

TL;DR: RLVR improves LLM reasoning but faces challenges in resource allocation and policy optimization. DynaMO optimizes allocation and stabilizes training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in RLVR methods for LLM reasoning, focusing on gradient variance heterogeneity and policy optimization dynamics.

Method: Proposes DynaMO, optimizing allocation at sequence level and modulating gradients at token level based on theoretical bounds.

Result: Demonstrates consistent improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks over RLVR baselines.

Conclusion: DynaMO effectively tackles RLVR challenges, enhancing performance and stability.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, yet current methods face key challenges in resource allocation and policy optimization dynamics: (i) uniform rollout allocation ignores gradient variance heterogeneity across problems, and (ii) the softmax policy structure causes gradient attenuation for high-confidence correct actions, while excessive gradient updates may destabilize training. Therefore, we propose DynaMO, a theoretically-grounded dual-pronged optimization framework. At the sequence level, we prove that uniform allocation is suboptimal and derive variance-minimizing allocation from the first principle, establishing Bernoulli variance as a computable proxy for gradient informativeness. At the token level, we develop gradient-aware advantage modulation grounded in theoretical analysis of gradient magnitude bounds. Our framework compensates for gradient attenuation of high-confidence correct actions while utilizing entropy changes as computable indicators to stabilize excessive update magnitudes. Extensive experiments conducted on a diverse range of mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong RLVR baselines. Our implementation is available at: \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/dynamo-680E/README.md}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/dynamo}.

TL;DR: The paper examines whether baseline unlearning methods truly remove knowledge from pretrained models or just suppress it, using combinatorial interpretability to inspect model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding if and how supposedly erased knowledge persists in large foundation models, which are not easily interpretable.

Method: Reproduces baseline unlearning methods within a combinatorial interpretability framework for two-layer neural nets, inspecting model weights directly.

Result: Evaluates if unlearning removes target concepts or merely inhibits their expression, and tests recoverability of erased knowledge via fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Provides insights into knowledge persistence and potential resurfacing in unlearned models within an interpretable setting.

Abstract: While many recent methods aim to unlearn or remove knowledge from pretrained models, seemingly erased knowledge often persists and can be recovered in various ways. Because large foundation models are far from interpretable, understanding whether and how such knowledge persists remains a significant challenge. To address this, we turn to the recently developed framework of combinatorial interpretability. This framework, designed for two-layer neural networks, enables direct inspection of the knowledge encoded in the model weights. We reproduce baseline unlearning methods within the combinatorial interpretability setting and examine their behavior along two dimensions: (i) whether they truly remove knowledge of a target concept (the concept we wish to remove) or merely inhibit its expression while retaining the underlying information, and (ii) how easily the supposedly erased knowledge can be recovered through various fine-tuning operations. Our results shed light within a fully interpretable setting on how knowledge can persist despite unlearning and when it might resurface.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates SAP's RPT-1, a tabular foundation model, against tuned GBDTs in three business scenarios. RPT-1 achieves 91-96% accuracy without training, with a crossover point outperforming XGBoost under limited data. A hybrid workflow is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess SAP's RPT-1's practicality for enterprise data without task-specific training, comparing it to GBDTs in real-world SAP scenarios.

Method: Benchmarked RPT-1 against XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost using five-fold cross-validation on datasets of 2,500-3,200 rows across demand forecasting, predictive data integrity, and financial risk classification.

Result: RPT-1 achieved 91-96% of GBDT accuracy without training, with modest classification gaps (3.6-4.1% AUC-ROC) but wider regression gaps (8.9-11.1% R-squared). Outperformed XGBoost below 75-100 rows.

Conclusion: RPT-1 is viable for rapid screening; a hybrid approach with GBDTs maximizes efficiency and accuracy. All experiments are reproducible.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models aim to make machine learning accessible for enterprise data without task-specific training. This paper presents the first independent evaluation of SAP's Retrieval Pretrained Transformer (RPT-1) from a practitioner perspective. RPT-1 is a compact 64.6 MB model pretrained on 1.34 TB of structured data across 3.1 million tables. We benchmark it against tuned gradient-boosted decision trees (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) on three SAP business scenarios: demand forecasting across SD/MM/PP modules, predictive data integrity in BC/MM/QM, and financial risk classification in FI/CO/AR. Across five-fold cross-validation on datasets ranging from 2,500 to 3,200 rows, RPT-1 reaches 91-96% of tuned GBDT accuracy without any training examples. The classification gap is modest at 3.6-4.1 percentage points on AUC-ROC, though regression tasks show wider gaps of 8.9-11.1 percentage points on R-squared. An interesting finding is a crossover at roughly 75-100 context rows where RPT-1 actually outperforms XGBoost under limited data. Based on these results, we propose a practical hybrid workflow: use RPT-1 for rapid screening, then train GBDT selectively where prediction accuracy justifies the effort. All experiments are reproducible through publicly available Hugging Face Spaces.

TL;DR: X-ANFIS is a gradient-based optimization scheme for explainable fuzzy systems that balances accuracy and explainability without the drawbacks of MOO or scalarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational expense of MOO and the limitations of gradient-based scalarization in achieving explainable AI with fuzzy systems.

Method: Proposes X-ANFIS, using alternating bi-objective gradient optimization, Cauchy membership functions, and decoupled explainability and performance objectives.

Result: Validated on nine UCI datasets, X-ANFIS achieves target explainability and competitive accuracy, surpassing MOO Pareto front limitations.

Conclusion: X-ANFIS effectively balances accuracy and explainability, offering a scalable solution for explainable fuzzy systems.

Abstract: Fuzzy systems show strong potential in explainable AI due to their rule-based architecture and linguistic variables. Existing approaches navigate the accuracy-explainability trade-off either through evolutionary multi-objective optimization (MOO), which is computationally expensive, or gradient-based scalarization, which cannot recover non-convex Pareto regions. We propose X-ANFIS, an alternating bi-objective gradient-based optimization scheme for explainable adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems. Cauchy membership functions are used for stable training under semantically controlled initializations, and a differentiable explainability objective is introduced and decoupled from the performance objective through alternating gradient passes. Validated in approximately 5,000 experiments on nine UCI regression datasets, X-ANFIS consistently achieves target distinguishability while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy, recovering solutions beyond the convex hull of the MOO Pareto front.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively bridges the gap in time-series reasoning with robust, context-aware insights.

Abstract: Time-series diagnostic reasoning is essential for many applications, yet existing solutions face a persistent gap: general reasoning large language models (GRLMs) possess strong reasoning skills but lack the domain-specific knowledge to understand complex time-series patterns. Conversely, fine-tuned time-series LLMs (TSLMs) understand these patterns but lack the capacity to generalize reasoning for more complicated questions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid knowledge-injection framework that injects TSLM-generated insights directly into GRLM's reasoning trace, thereby achieving strong time-series reasoning with in-domain knowledge. As collecting data for knowledge injection fine-tuning is costly, we further leverage a reinforcement learning-based approach with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit knowledge-rich traces without human supervision, then transfer such an in-domain thinking trace into GRLM for efficient knowledge injection. We further release SenTSR-Bench, a multivariate time-series-based diagnostic reasoning benchmark collected from real-world industrial operations. Across SenTSR-Bench and other public datasets, our method consistently surpasses TSLMs by 9.1%-26.1% and GRLMs by 7.9%-22.4%, delivering robust, context-aware time-series diagnostic insights.

### [353] [DGPO: RL-Steered Graph Diffusion for Neural Architecture Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19261)
*Aleksei Liuliakov,Luca Hermes,Barbara Hammer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGPO extends reinforcement learning fine-tuning to directed graphs, achieving strong performance in NAS benchmarks and demonstrating transferable structural priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph diffusion methods discard directionality in DAGs, limiting their applicability to tasks like NAS where direction encodes functional semantics.

Method: DGPO introduces topological node ordering and positional encoding to adapt discrete graph diffusion models for DAGs, validated on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201.

Result: DGPO matches benchmark optimums and learns transferable priors, performing near-oracle even with limited pretraining data.

Conclusion: DGPO effectively extends controllable generative frameworks to directed combinatorial structures.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning has proven effective for steering generative diffusion models toward desired properties in image and molecular domains. Graph diffusion models have similarly been applied to combinatorial structure generation, including neural architecture search (NAS). However, neural architectures are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where edge direction encodes functional semantics such as data flow-information that existing graph diffusion methods, designed for undirected structures, discard. We propose Directed Graph Policy Optimization (DGPO), which extends reinforcement learning fine-tuning of discrete graph diffusion models to DAGs via topological node ordering and positional encoding. Validated on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201, DGPO matches the benchmark optimum on all three NAS-Bench-201 tasks (91.61%, 73.49%, 46.77%). The central finding is that the model learns transferable structural priors: pretrained on only 7% of the search space, it generates near-oracle architectures after fine-tuning, within 0.32 percentage points of the full-data model and extrapolating 7.3 percentage points beyond its training ceiling. Bidirectional control experiments confirm genuine reward-driven steering, with inverse optimization reaching near random-chance accuracy (9.5%). These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning-steered discrete diffusion, once extended to handle directionality, provides a controllable generative framework for directed combinatorial structures.

*Siavash Khodakarami,Vivek Oommen,Nazanin Ahmadi Daryakenari,Maxim Beekenkamp,George Em Karniadakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates spectral bias in neural networks solving PDEs, emphasizing its dynamical nature and interaction with optimization and loss design. It shows that second-order optimization and spectral-aware loss formulations can mitigate bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand spectral bias in physics-informed neural networks and neural operators, exploring its interaction with architecture, optimization, and loss design.

Method: The study uses frequency-resolved error metrics, Barron-norm diagnostics, and higher-order statistical moments to analyze spectral bias across various PDE types and benchmarks.

Result: Spectral bias is dynamical, not just representational. Second-order optimization and spectral-aware loss formulations improve high-frequency mode recovery without added inference cost.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of optimization and loss design in mitigating spectral bias, offering practical solutions for improved PDE learning.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by neural networks as well as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), including physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), physics-informed KANs (PIKANs), and neural operators, are known to exhibit spectral bias, whereby low-frequency components of the solution are learned significantly faster than high-frequency modes. While spectral bias is often treated as an intrinsic representational limitation of neural architectures, its interaction with optimization dynamics and physics-based loss formulations remains poorly understood. In this work, we provide a systematic investigation of spectral bias in physics-informed and operator learning frameworks, with emphasis on the coupled roles of network architecture, activation functions, loss design, and optimization strategy. We quantify spectral bias through frequency-resolved error metrics, Barron-norm diagnostics, and higher-order statistical moments, enabling a unified analysis across elliptic, hyperbolic, and dispersive PDEs. Through diverse benchmark problems, including the Korteweg-de Vries, wave and steady-state diffusion-reaction equations, turbulent flow reconstruction, and earthquake dynamics, we demonstrate that spectral bias is not simply representational but fundamentally dynamical. In particular, second-order optimization methods substantially alter the spectral learning order, enabling earlier and more accurate recovery of high-frequency modes for all PDE types. For neural operators, we further show that spectral bias is dependent on the neural operator architecture and can also be effectively mitigated through spectral-aware loss formulations without increasing the inference cost.

*Zhongwei Wan,Yun Shen,Zhihao Dou,Donghao Zhou,Yu Zhang,Xin Wang,Hui Shen,Jing Xiong,Chaofan Tao,Zixuan Zhong,Peizhou Huang,Mi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DSDR introduces Dual-Scale Diversity Regularization to enhance exploration in reinforcement learning for LLMs, improving reasoning accuracy and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in RLVR suffer from limited exploration and premature convergence, leading to weak learning signals.

Method: DSDR decomposes diversity into global (trajectory-level) and local (token-level) components, applying entropy regularization selectively.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements in accuracy and pass@k metrics.

Conclusion: DSDR effectively addresses exploration challenges in RLVR, demonstrating the importance of dual-scale diversity.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiers (RLVR) is a central paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet existing methods often suffer from limited exploration. Policies tend to collapse onto a few reasoning patterns and prematurely stop deep exploration, while conventional entropy regularization introduces only local stochasticity and fails to induce meaningful path-level diversity, leading to weak and unstable learning signals in group-based policy optimization. We propose DSDR, a Dual-Scale Diversity Regularization reinforcement learning framework that decomposes diversity in LLM reasoning into global and coupling components. Globally, DSDR promotes diversity among correct reasoning trajectories to explore distinct solution modes. Locally, it applies a length-invariant, token-level entropy regularization restricted to correct trajectories, preventing entropy collapse within each mode while preserving correctness. The two scales are coupled through a global-to-local allocation mechanism that emphasizes local regularization for more distinctive correct trajectories. We provide theoretical support showing that DSDR preserves optimal correctness under bounded regularization, sustains informative learning signals in group-based optimization, and yields a principled global-to-local coupling rule. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy and pass@k, highlighting the importance of dual-scale diversity for deep exploration in RLVR.

*Junkang Liu,Fanhua Shang,Hongying Liu,Jin Liu,Weixin An,Yuanyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedPAC addresses preconditioner drift in federated second-order optimization by aligning and correcting local geometries, improving stability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Naive federated second-order optimizers diverge on non-IID data due to preconditioner drift, necessitating a solution.

Method: FedPAC decouples parameter aggregation from geometry synchronization via alignment (global reference) and correction (global direction steering).

Result: FedPAC ensures drift-coupled non-convex convergence with linear speedup and improves accuracy by up to 5.8% on CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: FedPAC reliably stabilizes federated second-order optimization, outperforming naive variants.

Abstract: Second-order optimizers can significantly accelerate large-scale training, yet their naive federated variants are often unstable or even diverge on non-IID data.
  We show that a key culprit is \emph{preconditioner drift}: client-side second-order training induces heterogeneous \emph{curvature-defined geometries} (i.e., preconditioner coordinate systems), and server-side model averaging updates computed under incompatible metrics, corrupting the global descent direction.
  To address this geometric mismatch, we propose \texttt{FedPAC}, a \emph{preconditioner alignment and correction} framework for reliable federated second-order optimization.
  \texttt{FedPAC} explicitly decouples parameter aggregation from geometry synchronization by:
  (i) \textbf{Alignment} (i.e.,aggregating local preconditioners into a global reference and warm-starting clients via global preconditioner); and
  (ii) \textbf{Correction} (i.e., steering local preconditioned updates using a global preconditioned direction to suppress long-term drift).
  We provide drift-coupled non-convex convergence guarantees with linear speedup under partial participation.
  Empirically, \texttt{FedPAC} consistently improves stability and accuracy across vision and language tasks, achieving up to $5.8\%$ absolute accuracy gain on CIFAR-100 with ViTs.

*Jiangjie Qiu,Wentao Li,Honghao Chen,Leyi Zhao,Xiaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdsorbFlow is a deterministic generative model for adsorbate placement on catalytic surfaces, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational challenge of identifying low-energy adsorption geometries in heterogeneous catalysis, which is hindered by the high cost of DFT and initial placement proposals.

Method: Uses conditional flow matching to learn an energy-conditioned vector field on the rigid-body configuration space of adsorbate translation and rotation, requiring fewer steps (as few as 5) compared to stochastic methods.

Result: Achieves 61.4% SR@10 and 34.1% SR@1 on OC20-Dense, outperforming AdsorbDiff and AdsorbML with fewer steps and lower anomaly rates (6.8%). Retains high accuracy on out-of-distribution systems.

Conclusion: Deterministic transport (AdsorbFlow) is faster and more accurate than stochastic denoising for adsorbate placement.

Abstract: Identifying low-energy adsorption geometries on catalytic surfaces is a practical bottleneck for computational heterogeneous catalysis: the difficulty lies not only in the cost of density functional theory (DFT) but in proposing initial placements that relax into the correct energy basins. Conditional denoising diffusion has improved success rates, yet requires $\sim$100 iterative steps per sample.
  Here we introduce AdsorbFlow, a deterministic generative model that learns an energy-conditioned vector field on the rigid-body configuration space of adsorbate translation and rotation via conditional flow matching. Energy information enters through classifier-free guidance conditioning -- not energy-gradient guidance -- and sampling reduces to integrating an ODE in as few as 5 steps.
  On OC20-Dense with full DFT single-point verification, AdsorbFlow with an EquiformerV2 backbone achieves 61.4% SR@10 and 34.1% SR@1 -- surpassing AdsorbDiff (31.8% SR@1, 41.0% SR@10) at every evaluation level and AdsorbML (47.7% SR@10) -- while using 20 times fewer generative steps and achieving the lowest anomaly rate among generative methods (6.8%). On 50 out-of-distribution systems, AdsorbFlow retains 58.0% SR@10 with a MLFF-to-DFT gap of only 4~percentage points. These results establish that deterministic transport is both faster and more accurate than stochastic denoising for adsorbate placement.

*Svetlana Glazyrina,Maksim Kryzhanovskiy,Roman Ischenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Soft Sequence Policy Optimization (SSPO), a new method for LLM alignment that improves policy exploration and stability by integrating soft gating functions into sequence-level importance weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Large Language Model (LLM) alignment by addressing limitations in current methods like PPO-style clipping and entropy collapse.

Method: Introduces Soft Sequence Policy Optimization (SSPO), which uses soft gating functions over token-level probability ratios within sequence-level importance weights.

Result: SSPO achieves better policy exploration and maintains training stability.

Conclusion: The proposed SSPO method advances LLM alignment by combining sequence coherence with token adaptivity.

Abstract: A significant portion of recent research on Large Language Model (LLM) alignment focuses on developing new policy optimization methods based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Two prominent directions have emerged: (i) a shift toward sequence-level importance sampling weights that better align with the sequence-level rewards used in many tasks, and (ii) alternatives to PPO-style clipping that aim to avoid the associated loss of training signal and entropy collapse. Recent work, such as Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), reformulates the Scopic objective within the GRPO framework and achieves both sequence coherence and token adaptivity. Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO) leverages token-wise ratio clipping within sequence importance sampling weights. Building on these ideas, this work proposes a new objective that promotes effective policy exploration while maintaining training stability. Specifically, we introduce Soft Sequence Policy Optimization, an off-policy reinforcement learning objective that incorporates soft gating functions over token-level probability ratios within sequence-level importance weights.

*Barsat Khadka,Kawsher Roxy,Md Rubel Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CTS-Bench is introduced to evaluate trade-offs between graph coarsening, accuracy, and efficiency in GNN-based Clock Tree Synthesis analysis, showing scalability benefits but accuracy trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical deployment of GNNs in Electronic Design Automation is limited by memory and runtime costs, prompting the need for scalable solutions like graph coarsening.

Method: CTS-Bench provides a benchmark suite with paired gate-level and clustered graph representations, evaluating clock skew prediction as a CTS task.

Result: Graph coarsening reduces memory and speeds training but often harms accuracy, sometimes resulting in negative $R^2$ scores.

Conclusion: Generic graph coarsening can compromise CTS learning; CTS-Bench supports evaluation of CTS-aware strategies and GNN benchmarking.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly explored for physical design analysis in Electronic Design Automation, particularly for modeling Clock Tree Synthesis behavior such as clock skew and buffering complexity. However, practical deployment remains limited due to the prohibitive memory and runtime cost of operating on raw gate-level netlists. Graph coarsening is commonly used to improve scalability, yet its impact on CTS-critical learning objectives is not well characterized. This paper introduces CTS-Bench, a benchmark suite for systematically evaluating the trade-offs between graph coarsening, prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency in GNN-based CTS analysis. CTS-Bench consists of 4,860 converged physical design solutions spanning five architectures and provides paired raw gate-level and clustered graph representations derived from post-placement designs. Using clock skew prediction as a representative CTS task, we demonstrate a clear accuracy-efficiency trade-off. While graph coarsening reduces GPU memory usage by up to 17.2x and accelerates training by up to 3x, it also removes structural information essential for modeling clock distribution, frequently resulting in negative $R^2$ scores under zero-shot evaluation. Our findings indicate that generic graph clustering techniques can fundamentally compromise CTS learning objectives, even when global physical metrics remain unchanged. CTS-Bench enables principled evaluation of CTS-aware graph coarsening strategies, supports benchmarking of GNN architectures and accelerators under realistic physical design constraints, and provides a foundation for developing learning-assisted CTS analysis and optimization techniques.

*Chaitanya Kapoor,Alex H. Williams,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a partial soft-matching distance for representational similarity, allowing unmatched neurons to improve robustness against noise and outliers. It shows theoretical and practical benefits, validated through simulations and real data applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard similarity metrics force all units to match, making them vulnerable to noise and outliers. The authors aim to develop a more robust method that allows selective matching.

Method: They extend the soft-matching distance to a partial optimal transport setting, enabling some neurons to remain unmatched while maintaining rotation sensitivity and interpretability.

Result: The method preserves correct matches under outliers, excludes low-reliability voxels in fMRI data, and aligns brain areas more precisely than standard approaches. Highly matched units in deep networks show similar patterns, while unmatched ones diverge.

Conclusion: Partial soft-matching offers a principled and practical solution for comparing representations under partial correspondence, enhancing robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics typically force all units to be matched, making them susceptible to noise and outliers common in neural representations. We extend the soft-matching distance to a partial optimal transport setting that allows some neurons to remain unmatched, yielding rotation-sensitive but robust correspondences. This partial soft-matching distance provides theoretical advantages -- relaxing strict mass conservation while maintaining interpretable transport costs -- and practical benefits through efficient neuron ranking in terms of cross-network alignment without costly iterative recomputation. In simulations, it preserves correct matches under outliers and reliably selects the correct model in noise-corrupted identification tasks. On fMRI data, it automatically excludes low-reliability voxels and produces voxel rankings by alignment quality that closely match computationally expensive brute-force approaches. It achieves higher alignment precision across homologous brain areas than standard soft-matching, which is forced to match all units regardless of quality. In deep networks, highly matched units exhibit similar maximally exciting images, while unmatched units show divergent patterns. This ability to partition by match quality enables focused analyses, e.g., testing whether networks have privileged axes even within their most aligned subpopulations. Overall, partial soft-matching provides a principled and practical method for representational comparison under partial correspondence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model merging methods are limited to homogeneous architectures, while GNNs are topology-dependent and sensitive to misalignment, making parameter-space merging unreliable.

Method: Introduces H-GRAMA, a training-free framework that formalizes Universal Message Passing Mixture (UMPM) to express heterogeneous GNN layers in a common functional language.

Result: Retains high specialist accuracy in compatible depth settings and achieves inference speedups of 1.2x to 1.9x over ensembles.

Conclusion: H-GRAMA successfully bridges the gap for merging heterogeneous GNN architectures efficiently.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a powerful paradigm for combining the capabilities of distinct expert models without the high computational cost of retraining, yet current methods are fundamentally constrained to homogeneous architectures. For GNNs, however, message passing is topology-dependent and sensitive to misalignment, making direct parameter-space merging unreliable. To bridge this gap, we introduce H-GRAMA (Heterogeneous Graph Routing and Message Alignment), a training-free framework that lifts merging from parameter space to operator space. We formalize Universal Message Passing Mixture (UMPM), a shared operator family that expresses heterogeneous GNN layers in a common functional language. H-GRAMA enables cross-architecture GNN merging (e.g., GCN to GAT) without retraining, retaining high specialist accuracy in most cases in compatible depth settings and achieving inference speedups of 1.2x to 1.9x over ensembles.

TL;DR: GRPO improves LLM training but suffers from instability due to hard clipping. SAPO introduces a smooth sigmoid gate for stability. This paper explores different gate functions' effects on stability and performance, identifying admissible families and testing them on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address GRPO's instability from hard clipping by exploring smoother gate functions for policy optimization in LLMs.

Method: Replace clipping with smooth sigmoid gates, formalize gate properties, and empirically evaluate families of admissible gates using Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on math tasks.

Result: Identifies viable gate functions and provides insights for designing stable, robust policy objectives.

Conclusion: Smoother gate functions enhance training stability and performance, offering practical guidance for LLM optimization.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the training of large language models and enhanced their reasoning capabilities, while it remains susceptible to instability due to the use of hard clipping. Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO) addresses this limitation by replacing clipping with a smooth sigmoid-based gate function, which leads to more stable updates. We have decided to push this theory further and investigate the impact of different gate functions on both training stability and final model performance. We formalize the key properties that admissible gates should satisfy and identify several families of such functions for empirical evaluation. This paper presents an analysis of our findings based on experiments conducted with the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model on mathematical reasoning tasks. These results provide practical guidance for designing smoother and more robust policy optimization objectives for large language model training.

*David Rawlinson,Gideon Kowadlo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Complementary Learning System (CLS) combines a fast, non-generalizing learner with a slow, generalizing learner to enable robust continual and few-shot learning without destructive interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of entangled representations in fast learning and generalize systems, proposing a hybrid approach for continual and few-shot learning.

Method: Introduces a CLS where the fast learner avoids generalization, acting as a parallel reasoning system, while leveraging a slow learner contextual bias to encode novel stimuli effectively.

Result: The hybrid system enables zero-shot and few-shot continual learning by balancing fast reasoning with structured generalization.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that combining non-generalizing fast learning with slow generalization provides a robust solution for continual learning challenges.

Abstract: Generalization is often regarded as an essential property of machine learning systems. However, perhaps not every component of a system needs to generalize. Training models for generalization typically produces entangled representations at the boundaries of entities or classes, which can lead to destructive interference when rapid, high-magnitude updates are required for continual or few-shot learning. Techniques for fast learning with non-interfering representations exist, but they generally fail to generalize. Here, we describe a Complementary Learning System (CLS) in which the fast learner entirely foregoes generalization in exchange for continual zero-shot and few-shot learning. Unlike most CLS approaches, which use episodic memory primarily for replay and consolidation, our fast, disentangled learner operates as a parallel reasoning system. The fast learner can overcome observation variability and uncertainty by leveraging a conventional slow, statistical learner within an active perception system: A contextual bias provided by the fast learner induces the slow learner to encode novel stimuli in familiar, generalized terms, enabling zero-shot and few-shot learning. This architecture demonstrates that fast, context-driven reasoning can coexist with slow, structured generalization, providing a pathway for robust continual learning.

TL;DR: A novel off-policy RL algorithm, OAPL, outperforms traditional on-policy methods like GRPO and matches DeepCoder's performance with fewer training generations, handling significant policy lag efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing policy lag and off-policy data issues in RL for LLMs, which prior methods tackled via importance sampling or inference modifications.

Method: Introduces OAPL, an off-policy RL algorithm optimized for lagged inference policies without requiring additional modifications.

Result: OAPL outperforms GRPO with importance sampling on math benchmarks and matches DeepCoder's performance on LiveCodeBench with fewer generations. It also shows improved test-time scaling under Pass@k.

Conclusion: OAPL is an efficient, effective solution for off-policy RL in LLMs, handling large policy lags better than prior approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently use on-policy algorithms, such as PPO or GRPO. However, policy lag from distributed training architectures and differences between the training and inference policies break this assumption, making the data off-policy by design. To rectify this, prior work has focused on making this off-policy data appear more on-policy, either via importance sampling (IS), or by more closely aligning the training and inference policies by explicitly modifying the inference engine. In this work, we embrace off-policyness and propose a novel off-policy RL algorithm that does not require these modifications: Optimal Advantage-based Policy Optimization with Lagged Inference policy (OAPL). We show that OAPL outperforms GRPO with importance sampling on competition math benchmarks, and can match the performance of a publicly available coding model, DeepCoder, on LiveCodeBench, while using 3x fewer generations during training. We further empirically demonstrate that models trained via OAPL have improved test time scaling under the Pass@k metric. OAPL allows for efficient, effective post-training even with lags of more than 400 gradient steps between the training and inference policies, 100x more off-policy than prior approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unstable training dynamics in deep reinforcement learning caused by non-stationarity.

Method: Proposes Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization to shape representations toward an isotropic Gaussian distribution.

Result: Empirical demonstration across domains shows improved performance under non-stationarity, reduced representation collapse, neuron dormancy, and training instability.

Conclusion: Isotropic Gaussian embeddings and the proposed regularization method enhance adaptability and stability in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning systems often suffer from unstable training dynamics due to non-stationarity, where learning objectives and data distributions evolve over time. We show that under non-stationary targets, isotropic Gaussian embeddings are provably advantageous. In particular, they induce stable tracking of time-varying targets for linear readouts, achieve maximal entropy under a fixed variance budget, and encourage a balanced use of all representational dimensions--all of which enable agents to be more adaptive and stable. Building on this insight, we propose the use of Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization for shaping representations toward an isotropic Gaussian distribution during training. We demonstrate empirically, over a variety of domains, that this simple and computationally inexpensive method improves performance under non-stationarity while reducing representation collapse, neuron dormancy, and training instability.

TL;DR: SIGHT is a plug-in module for graphs that improves reliability under OOD shifts by iterative error correction, enhancing accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic web environments face OOD shifts, causing unreliable predictions. Current uncertainty methods are post-hoc and lack interpretability.

Method: SIGHT uses iterative error-driven correction on spiking graph states to expose internal mismatches, revealing unreliable predictions.

Result: SIGHT improves predictive accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and interpretability across various OOD scenarios.

Conclusion: SIGHT addresses OOD challenges in graph learning, offering a reliable, interpretable solution for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Graphs provide a powerful basis for modeling Web-based relational data, with expressive GNNs to support the effective learning in dynamic web environments. However, real-world deployment is hindered by pervasive out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, where evolving user activity and changing content semantics alter feature distributions and labeling criteria. These shifts often lead to unstable or overconfident predictions, undermining the trustworthiness required for Web4Good applications. Achieving reliable OOD generalization demands principled and interpretable uncertainty estimation; however, existing methods are largely post-hoc, insensitive to distribution shifts, and unable to explain where uncertainty arises especially in high-stakes settings. To address these limitations, we introduce SpIking GrapH predicTive coding (SIGHT), an uncertainty-aware plug-in graph learning module for reliable OOD Generalization. SIGHT performs iterative, error-driven correction over spiking graph states, enabling models to expose internal mismatch signals that reveal where predictions become unreliable. Across multiple graph benchmarks and diverse OOD scenarios, SIGHT consistently enhances predictive accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and interpretability when integrated with GNNs.

### [367] [In Defense of Cosine Similarity: Normalization Eliminates the Gauge Freedom](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19393)
*Taha Bouhsine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses the issue of cosine similarity in matrix factorization embeddings, clarifying that the problem lies in normalization, not the cosine measure itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misconception that cosine similarity is inherently flawed by showing the issue is due to improper normalization of embeddings.

Method: The authors prove that when embeddings are constrained to the unit sphere, the ambiguity in cosine similarity vanishes, and it becomes equivalent to half the squared Euclidean distance.

Result: Cosine distance and Euclidean distance yield identical neighbor rankings when embeddings are normalized.

Conclusion: The problem with cosine similarity is not the metric itself but the failure to normalize embeddings, emphasizing the importance of proper normalization.

Abstract: Steck, Ekanadham, and Kallus [arXiv:2403.05440] demonstrate that cosine similarity of learned embeddings from matrix factorization models can be rendered arbitrary by a diagonal ``gauge'' matrix $D$. Their result is correct and important for practitioners who compute cosine similarity on embeddings trained with dot-product objectives. However, we argue that their conclusion, cautioning against cosine similarity in general, conflates the pathology of an incompatible training objective with the geometric validity of cosine distance on the unit sphere. We prove that when embeddings are constrained to the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ (either during or after training with an appropriate objective), the $D$-matrix ambiguity vanishes identically, and cosine distance reduces to exactly half the squared Euclidean distance. This monotonic equivalence implies that cosine-based and Euclidean-based neighbor rankings are identical on normalized embeddings. The ``problem'' with cosine similarity is not cosine similarity, it is the failure to normalize.

Result: Traditional taxis are highly predictable ($R^2 ≈ 0.72$), while app-based tipping is random ($R^2 ≈ 0.17$). A universal model fails due to Simpson’s paradox.

Conclusion: Specialized models are needed for different taxi categories; a combined universal model is ineffective.

Abstract: The rise of app-based ride-sharing has fundamentally changed tipping culture in New York City. We analyzed 280 million trips from 2024 to see if we could predict tips for traditional taxis versus high-volume for-hire services. By testing methods from linear regression to deep neural networks, we found two very different outcomes. Traditional taxis are highly predictable ($R^2 \approx 0.72$) due to the in-car payment screen. In contrast, app-based tipping is random and hard to model ($R^2 \approx 0.17$). In conclusion, we show that building one universal model is a mistake and, due to Simpson's paradox, a combined model looks accurate on average but fails to predict tips for individual taxi categories requiring specialized models.

*Phillip Si,Peng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEVDA is a novel ensemble-space variational smoother that uses a pretrained neural surrogate for efficient and accurate geophysical data assimilation without adjoint models or fixed grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with chaotic dynamics, numerical errors, and computational costs, while modern latent filters lack strong constraints and adaptability to irregular observations. LEVDA aims to bridge this gap.

Method: LEVDA performs 4DEnVar optimization in a low-dimensional latent space of a differentiable neural surrogate, assimilating states and parameters without adjoints or fixed grids.

Result: LEVDA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods under sparse observations, improves assimilation accuracy, and enhances computational efficiency compared to full-state approaches.

Conclusion: LEVDA offers a robust, efficient solution for geophysical data assimilation, handling irregular observations and uncertainty quantification effectively.

Abstract: Long-range geophysical forecasts are fundamentally limited by chaotic dynamics and numerical errors. While data assimilation can mitigate these issues, classical variational smoothers require computationally expensive tangent-linear and adjoint models. Conversely, recent efficient latent filtering methods often enforce weak trajectory-level constraints and assume fixed observation grids. To bridge this gap, we propose Latent Ensemble Variational Data Assimilation (LEVDA), an ensemble-space variational smoother that operates in the low-dimensional latent space of a pretrained differentiable neural dynamics surrogate. By performing four-dimensional ensemble-variational (4DEnVar) optimization within an ensemble subspace, LEVDA jointly assimilates states and unknown parameters without the need for adjoint code or auxiliary observation-to-latent encoders. Leveraging the fully differentiable, continuous-in-time-and-space nature of the surrogate, LEVDA naturally accommodates highly irregular sampling at arbitrary spatiotemporal locations. Across three challenging geophysical benchmarks, LEVDA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art latent filtering baselines under severe observational sparsity while providing more reliable uncertainty quantification. Simultaneously, it achieves substantially improved assimilation accuracy and computational efficiency compared to full-state 4DEnVar.

*Nazal Mohamed,Ayush Mohanty,Nagi Gebraeel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a federated framework for causal representation learning in state-space systems to analyze interdependencies among industrial clients without sharing raw data or modifying proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial clients are interconnected yet operate privately with high-dimensional data and proprietary models, making centralized analysis impractical.

Method: Clients map observations to low-dimensional latent states separating intrinsic dynamics from control influences, while a central server estimates global state-transition and control structures.

Result: The framework enables decentralized counterfactual reasoning, converges to a centralized solution, and ensures privacy. Experiments show scalability and accurate cross-client inference.

Conclusion: The federated approach effectively captures interdependencies under privacy constraints, supporting practical counterfactual analysis in industrial systems.

Abstract: Networks of interdependent industrial assets (clients) are tightly coupled through physical processes and control inputs, raising a key question: how would the output of one client change if another client were operated differently? This is difficult to answer because client-specific data are high-dimensional and private, making centralization of raw data infeasible. Each client also maintains proprietary local models that cannot be modified. We propose a federated framework for causal representation learning in state-space systems that captures interdependencies among clients under these constraints. Each client maps high-dimensional observations into low-dimensional latent states that disentangle intrinsic dynamics from control-driven influences. A central server estimates the global state-transition and control structure. This enables decentralized counterfactual reasoning where clients predict how outputs would change under alternative control inputs at others while only exchanging compact latent states. We prove convergence to a centralized oracle and provide privacy guarantees. Our experiments demonstrate scalability, and accurate cross-client counterfactual inference on synthetic and real-world industrial control system datasets.

*Pranay Anchuri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses liquidity management in decentralized exchanges as an optimal control problem, proposing RAmmStein, a Deep Reinforcement Learning method that outperforms passive and aggressive strategies with a 0.72% net ROI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LPs struggle with balancing fee accrual and rebalancing costs in decentralized exchanges, as existing heuristic strategies ignore market dynamics. The paper aims to optimize liquidity provision by formulating it as a control problem.

Method: The paper introduces RAmmStein, a Deep Reinforcement Learning method that uses market features like mean-reversion speed to solve the derived Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality (HJB-QVI).

Result: RAmmStein achieves a 0.72% net ROI, reduces rebalancing frequency by 67%, and maintains 88% active time compared to greedy strategies.

Conclusion: The results show that regime-aware laziness improves capital efficiency by minimizing operational costs while preserving returns.

Abstract: Concentrated liquidity provision in decentralized exchanges presents a fundamental Impulse Control problem. Liquidity Providers (LPs) face a non-trivial trade-off between maximizing fee accrual through tight price-range concentration and minimizing the friction costs of rebalancing, including gas fees and swap slippage. Existing methods typically employ heuristic or threshold strategies that fail to account for market dynamics. This paper formulates liquidity management as an optimal control problem and derives the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality (HJB-QVI). We present an approximate solution RAmmStein, a Deep Reinforcement Learning method that incorporates the mean-reversion speed (theta) of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process among other features as input to the model. We demonstrate that the agent learns to separate the state space into regions of action and inaction. We evaluate the framework using high-frequency 1Hz Coinbase trade data comprising over 6.8M trades. Experimental results show that RAmmStein achieves a superior net ROI of 0.72% compared to both passive and aggressive strategies. Notably, the agent reduces rebalancing frequency by 67% compared to a greedy rebalancing strategy while maintaining 88% active time. Our results demonstrate that regime-aware laziness can significantly improve capital efficiency by preserving the returns that would otherwise be eroded by the operational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of capturing subtle state transitions in Aβ42 trajectories for Alzheimer's disease research, as current deep learning models lack explicit physical constraints.

Method: Integrates pre-computed physical priors (e.g., radius of gyration, solvent-accessible surface area) into topological feature extraction for robust metastable state partitioning.

Result: PIS achieves superior performance on the Aβ42 dataset and offers an interactive platform for dynamic monitoring and multi-dimensional validation.

Conclusion: PIS provides biologically meaningful analytical tools with physically grounded interpretability, advancing Alzheimer's disease research.

Abstract: Understanding the conformational evolution of $β$-amyloid ($Aβ$), particularly the $Aβ_{42}$ isoform, is fundamental to elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease. However, existing end-to-end deep learning models often struggle to capture subtle state transitions in protein trajectories due to a lack of explicit physical constraints. In this work, we introduce PIS, a Physics-Informed System designed for robust metastable state partitioning. By integrating pre-computed physical priors, such as the radius of gyration and solvent-accessible surface area, into the extraction of topological features, our model achieves superior performance on the $Aβ_{42}$ dataset. Furthermore, PIS provides an interactive platform that features dynamic monitoring of physical characteristics and multi-dimensional result validation. This system offers biological researchers a powerful set of analytical tools with physically grounded interpretability. A demonstration video of PIS is available on https://youtu.be/AJHGzUtRCg0.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantifying uncertainty in clinical predictions is crucial for high-stakes diagnosis tasks, especially when standard conformal methods fail due to distribution shifts.

Method: Evaluated several conformal prediction approaches on EEG seizure classification, focusing on personalized calibration strategies.

Result: Personalized calibration improved coverage by over 20 percentage points while keeping prediction set sizes comparable.

Conclusion: Personalized calibration is effective for addressing distribution shifts in clinical predictions, as demonstrated with EEG seizure classification.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in clinical predictions is critical for high-stakes diagnosis tasks. Conformal prediction offers a principled approach by providing prediction sets with theoretical coverage guarantees. However, in practice, patient distribution shifts violate the i.i.d. assumptions underlying standard conformal methods, leading to poor coverage in healthcare settings. In this work, we evaluate several conformal prediction approaches on EEG seizure classification, a task with known distribution shift challenges and label uncertainty. We demonstrate that personalized calibration strategies can improve coverage by over 20 percentage points while maintaining comparable prediction set sizes. Our implementation is available via PyHealth, an open-source healthcare AI framework: https://github.com/sunlabuiuc/PyHealth.

*Navid Akhavan Attar,Hesam Asadollahzadeh,Ling Luo,Uwe Aickelin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves Conformal Prediction (CP) by using Helmholtz Free Energy to enhance adaptiveness and efficiency of prediction sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CP methods rely on unreliable softmax outputs for nonconformity scores, limiting adaptiveness.

Method: Proposes leveraging pre-softmax logit space and Helmholtz Free Energy to reweight nonconformity scores.

Result: Experiments show improved adaptiveness and efficiency in prediction sets across datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: Energy-based enhancement effectively increases CP performance without added complexity.

Abstract: The merit of Conformal Prediction (CP), as a distribution-free framework for uncertainty quantification, depends on generating prediction sets that are efficient, reflected in small average set sizes, while adaptive, meaning they signal uncertainty by varying in size according to input difficulty. A central limitation for deep conformal classifiers is that the nonconformity scores are derived from softmax outputs, which can be unreliable indicators of how certain the model truly is about a given input, sometimes leading to overconfident misclassifications or undue hesitation. In this work, we argue that this unreliability can be inherited by the prediction sets generated by CP, limiting their capacity for adaptiveness. We propose a new approach that leverages information from the pre-softmax logit space, using the Helmholtz Free Energy as a measure of model uncertainty and sample difficulty. By reweighting nonconformity scores with a monotonic transformation of the energy score of each sample, we improve their sensitivity to input difficulty. Our experiments with four state-of-the-art score functions on multiple datasets and deep architectures show that this energy-based enhancement improves the adaptiveness of the prediction sets, leading to a notable increase in both efficiency and adaptiveness compared to baseline nonconformity scores, without introducing any post-hoc complexity.

*Rudrajit Das,Neel Patel,Meisam Razaviyayn,Vahab Mirrokni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the convergence behavior of data mixing in bilevel optimization, showing that a finite number of inner steps can fail, and provides optimal scaling for practical scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the theoretical implications of using finite inner steps in bilevel optimization for data mixing, which is computationally efficient but not well analyzed.

Method: The method involves rigorous theoretical analysis of data mixing with finite inner steps, focusing on optimal scaling under fixed parameter update budgets and strongly convex per-domain losses.

Result: The results show that greedy approaches (T=1) can fail, and optimal T scales as Θ(log N) or Θ({(N log N)}^{1/2}) for full and stochastic gradients, respectively.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the importance of choosing the right number of inner steps for effective data mixing, supported by theoretical and experimental findings.

Abstract: Data mixing--the strategic reweighting of training domains--is a critical component in training robust machine learning models. This problem is naturally formulated as a bilevel optimization task, where the outer loop optimizes domain weights to minimize validation loss, and the inner loop optimizes model parameters to minimize the weighted training loss. Classical bilevel optimization relies on hypergradients, which theoretically require the inner optimization to reach convergence. However, due to computational constraints, state-of-the-art methods use a finite, often small, number of inner update steps before updating the weights. The theoretical implications of this approximation are not well understood. In this work, we rigorously analyze the convergence behavior of data mixing with a finite number of inner steps $T$. We prove that the "greedy" practical approach of using $T=1$ can fail even in a simple quadratic example. Under a fixed parameter update budget $N$ and assuming the per-domain losses are strongly convex, we show that the optimal $T$ scales as $Θ(\log N)$ (resp., $Θ({(N \log N)}^{1/2})$) for the data mixing problem with access to full (resp., stochastic) gradients. We complement our theoretical results with proof-of-concept experiments.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce a variational framework for diffusion models with anisotropic noise schedules parameterized by a matrix-valued path $M_t(θ)$ that allocates noise across subspaces. Central to our framework is a trajectory-level objective that jointly trains the score network and learns $M_t(θ)$, which encompasses general parameterization classes of matrix-valued noise schedules. We further derive an estimator for the derivative with respect to $θ$ of the score that enables efficient optimization of the $M_t(θ)$ schedule. For inference, we develop an efficiently-implementable reverse-ODE solver that is an anisotropic generalization of the second-order Heun discretization algorithm. Across CIFAR-10, AFHQv2, FFHQ, and ImageNet-64, our method consistently improves upon the baseline EDM model in all NFE regimes.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A spectral diagnostic framework using RMT and HTSR evaluates ML models for crash classification, identifying overfitting via power-law exponent α, with α strongly correlating to expert agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like accuracy, F1, or AUC fail to detect silent overfitting in crash classification models, necessitating a robust diagnostic tool.

Method: The framework spans ML models (BERT, XGBoost, etc.) and uses spectral analysis to measure structural quality via power-law exponent α.

Result: Well-regularized models show α ∈ [2, 4], while overfit models exhibit α < 2 or spectral collapse. Strong correlation (ρ= 0.89) between α and expert agreement highlights its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The spectral framework offers a reliable method for early stopping and model selection, validated against traditional metrics, and scales efficiently using sparse Lanczos approximations.

Abstract: Crash classification models in transportation safety are typically evaluated using accuracy, F1, or AUC, metrics that cannot reveal whether a model is silently overfitting. We introduce a spectral diagnostic framework grounded in Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR) that spans the ML taxonomy: weight matrices for BERT/ALBERT/Qwen2.5, out-of-fold increment matrices for XGBoost/Random Forest, empirical Hessians for Logistic Regression, induced affinity matrices for Decision Trees, and Graph Laplacians for KNN. Evaluating nine model families on two Iowa DOT crash classification tasks (173,512 and 371,062 records respectively), we find that the power-law exponent $α$ provides a structural quality signal: well-regularized models consistently yield $α$ within $[2, 4]$ (mean $2.87 \pm 0.34$), while overfit variants show $α< 2$ or spectral collapse. We observe a strong rank correlation between $α$ and expert agreement (Spearman $ρ= 0.89$, $p < 0.001$), suggesting spectral quality captures model behaviors aligned with expert reasoning. We propose an $α$-based early stopping criterion and a spectral model selection protocol, and validate both against cross-validated F1 baselines. Sparse Lanczos approximations make the framework scalable to large datasets.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simple method using time-agnostic summary statistics for irregular time series with missing values, outperforming complex models in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of irregular multivariate time series with missing values in predictive modeling, especially healthcare, by avoiding complex temporal interpolation.

Method: Extract four key summary stats per variable (mean/std of values and mean/variability of changes) to create a fixed representation, then use standard classifiers like logistic regression/XGBoost.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on biomedical datasets, surpassing transformer/graph models by 0.5-1.7% in AUROC/AUPRC and 1.1-1.7% in accuracy/F1-score, with lower complexity.

Conclusion: Simpler summary stats outperform complex temporal models for irregular time series classification, proving efficiency and interpretability when task objectives allow time-agnostic representations.

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series with missing values present significant challenges for predictive modeling in domains such as healthcare. While deep learning approaches often focus on temporal interpolation or complex architectures to handle irregularities, we propose a simpler yet effective alternative: extracting time-agnostic summary statistics to eliminate the temporal axis. Our method computes four key features per variable-mean and standard deviation of observed values, as well as the mean and variability of changes between consecutive observations to create a fixed-dimensional representation. These features are then utilized with standard classifiers, such as logistic regression and XGBoost. Evaluated on four biomedical datasets (PhysioNet Challenge 2012, 2019, PAMAP2, and MIMIC-III), our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent transformer and graph-based models by 0.5-1.7% in AUROC/AUPRC and 1.1-1.7% in accuracy/F1-score, while reducing computational complexity. Ablation studies demonstrate that feature extraction-not classifier choice-drives performance gains, and our summary statistics outperform raw/imputed input in most benchmarks. In particular, we identify scenarios where missing patterns themselves encode predictive signals, as in sepsis prediction (PhysioNet, 2019), where missing indicators alone can achieve 94.2% AUROC with XGBoost, only 1.6% lower than using original raw data as input. Our results challenge the necessity of complex temporal modeling when task objectives permit time-agnostic representations, providing an efficient and interpretable solution for irregular time series classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the grokking phenomenon in neural networks learning multiplication in finite-dimensional algebras (FDA), extending prior work on group operations to more general algebraic structures. It connects learning FDA to matrix factorization and finite field representations, and investigates how algebraic and structural properties influence grokking and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the grokking phenomenon beyond group operations, examining its occurrence in broader algebraic contexts like non-associative, non-commutative, and non-unital algebras. It seeks to uncover how mathematical structure impacts neural network generalization.

Method: The paper frames learning FDA multiplication as learning a bilinear product via the algebra's structure tensor. For real algebras, it links this to matrix factorization with low-rank bias; for finite fields, it explores discrete representations. Experimental analyses focus on algebraic properties (e.g., commutativity), structural tensor traits (e.g., sparsity), and latent embeddings.

Result: The findings show that grokking emerges naturally in finite field algebras due to discrete representations. Algebraic properties like associativity and structural tensor traits (e.g., rank) significantly influence grokking timing and generalization. Generalization correlates with models learning embeddings aligned with the algebra's representation.

Conclusion: The work offers a unified framework for grokking across algebraic structures, revealing that mathematical properties (e.g., associativity) and structural tensor features (e.g., rank) critically shape neural network generalization dynamics in learning multiplication tasks.

Abstract: This paper investigates the grokking phenomenon, which refers to the sudden transition from a long memorization to generalization observed during neural networks training, in the context of learning multiplication in finite-dimensional algebras (FDA). While prior work on grokking has focused mainly on group operations, we extend the analysis to more general algebraic structures, including non-associative, non-commutative, and non-unital algebras. We show that learning group operations is a special case of learning FDA, and that learning multiplication in FDA amounts to learning a bilinear product specified by the algebra's structure tensor. For algebras over the reals, we connect the learning problem to matrix factorization with an implicit low-rank bias, and for algebras over finite fields, we show that grokking emerges naturally as models must learn discrete representations of algebraic elements. This leads us to experimentally investigate the following core questions: (i) how do algebraic properties such as commutativity, associativity, and unitality influence both the emergence and timing of grokking, (ii) how structural properties of the structure tensor of the FDA, such as sparsity and rank, influence generalization, and (iii) to what extent generalization correlates with the model learning latent embeddings aligned with the algebra's representation. Our work provides a unified framework for grokking across algebraic structures and new insights into how mathematical structure governs neural network generalization dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the limits of replicable realizable PAC learning by constructing a challenging problem instance.

Method: The authors define a Cayley graph linked to the hypothesis class H, analyze a random walk on this graph, and examine the spectral properties of its adjacency matrix.

Result: They derive a sample complexity lower bound nearly matching (log|H|)^{3/2} and show an almost tight upper bound for their instance.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that improving the lower bound would require exploring different problem instances.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of replicable realizable PAC learning. We construct a particularly hard learning problem and show a sample complexity lower bound with a close to $(\log|H|)^{3/2}$ dependence on the size of the hypothesis class $H$. Our proof uses several novel techniques and works by defining a particular Cayley graph associated with $H$ and analyzing a suitable random walk on this graph by examining the spectral properties of its adjacency matrix.
  Furthermore, we show an almost matching upper bound for the lower bound instance, meaning if a stronger lower bound exists, one would have to consider a different instance of the problem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Leap+Verify accelerates neural network training by predicting future weights and validating them, decomposing training into chaotic, transition, and stable regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To speed up neural network training using speculative execution and validate predictions against held-out loss criteria.

Method: Uses activation-space cosine similarity to detect training regimes and employs analytic weight predictors (momentum, linear, quadratic extrapolation) to forecast model weights.

Result: Momentum-based prediction fails catastrophically, while finite-difference predictors succeed, achieving 24-37% strict acceptance depending on model size and regime.

Conclusion: Larger models are more predictable when predictable but less often so, shifting the bottleneck from predictor accuracy to regime availability.

Abstract: We introduce Leap+Verify, a framework that applies speculative execution -- predicting future model weights and validating predictions before acceptance -- to accelerate neural network training. Inspired by speculative decoding in language model inference and by the Automatically Scalable Computation (ASC) architecture for program execution, Leap+Verify decomposes training into three dynamically detected regimes (chaotic, transition, stable) using activation-space cosine similarity as a real-time Lyapunov proxy signal. Within each regime, analytic weight predictors (momentum, linear, quadratic extrapolation) attempt to forecast model parameters K training steps ahead; predictions are accepted only when validated against a held-out loss criterion. We evaluate Leap+Verify on GPT-2 124M and Qwen 2.5-1.5B trained on WikiText-103 across five random seeds, sweeping prediction depth K in {5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100}. Momentum-based prediction (Adam moment extrapolation) fails catastrophically at both scales, with predicted losses exceeding actuals by 100-10,000x -- a universal norm explosion in optimizer-state extrapolation. Finite-difference predictors (linear, quadratic) succeed where momentum fails: at 124M, they achieve 24% strict acceptance at K=5 in stable regimes; at 1.5B, they achieve 37% strict acceptance in transition regimes. The scale-dependent finding is in regime distribution: GPT-2 124M spends 34% of training in stable regime, while Qwen 1.5B spends 64% in chaotic regime and reaches stable in only 0-2 of 40 checkpoints. Larger models are more predictable when predictable, but less often predictable -- the practical bottleneck shifts from predictor accuracy to regime availability. Cross-seed results are highly consistent (less than 1% validation loss variance), and the three-regime framework produces identical phase boundaries (plus or minus 50 steps) across seeds.

TL;DR: AAT introduces a novel method using multi-scale causal self-attention and weighted advantage to generate time-correlated adversarial examples, outperforming existing reward-based attacks in DRL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward-based adversarial attacks in DRL lack temporal correlation between perturbations, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: AAT uses multi-scale causal self-attention (MSCSA) to capture historical dependencies and a weighted advantage mechanism to prioritize high-performance perturbations.

Result: AAT achieves superior attack performance compared to baseline methods on Atari, DeepMind Control Suite, and Google football tasks.

Conclusion: AAT effectively enhances temporal correlation in adversarial examples, improving attack success rates in DRL environments.

Abstract: Extensive research demonstrates that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models are susceptible to adversarially constructed inputs (i.e., adversarial examples), which can mislead the agent to take suboptimal or unsafe actions. Recent methods improve attack effectiveness by leveraging future rewards to guide adversarial perturbation generation over sequential time steps (i.e., reward-based attacks). However, these methods are unable to capture dependencies between different time steps in the perturbation generation process, resulting in a weak temporal correlation between the current perturbation and previous perturbations.In this paper, we propose a novel method called Advantage-based Adversarial Transformer (AAT), which can generate adversarial examples with stronger temporal correlations (i.e., time-correlated adversarial examples) to improve the attack performance. AAT employs a multi-scale causal self-attention (MSCSA) mechanism to dynamically capture dependencies between historical information from different time periods and the current state, thus enhancing the correlation between the current perturbation and the previous perturbation. Moreover, AAT introduces a weighted advantage mechanism, which quantifies the effectiveness of a perturbation in a given state and guides the generation process toward high-performance adversarial examples by sampling high-advantage regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the performance of AAT matches or surpasses mainstream adversarial attack baselines on Atari, DeepMind Control Suite and Google football tasks.

Result: All models performed better with interpolated data, but XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy. Interpretability showed tree-based models focus on geometry-dispersion features, while TabNet distributes attention broadly.

Conclusion: The framework enhances dose estimation accuracy, with XGBoost as the top performer. A web-based GUI was developed for practical deployment, aiding scenario evaluation and comparison with reference calculations.

Abstract: Despite the success of machine learning (ML) in surrogate modeling, its use in radiation dose assessment is limited by safety-critical constraints, scarce training-ready data, and challenges in selecting suitable architectures for physics-dominated systems. Within this context, rapid and accurate plume shine dose estimation serves as a practical test case, as it is critical for nuclear facility safety assessment and radiological emergency response, while conventional photon-transport-based calculations remain computationally expensive. In this work, an interpolation-assisted ML framework was developed using discrete dose datasets generated with the pyDOSEIA suite for 17 gamma-emitting radionuclides across varying downwind distances, release heights, and atmospheric stability categories. The datasets were augmented using shape-preserving interpolation to construct dense, high-resolution training data. Two tree-based ML models (Random Forest and XGBoost) and one deep learning (DL) model (TabNet) were evaluated to examine predictive performance and sensitivity to dataset resolution. All models showed higher prediction accuracy with the interpolated high-resolution dataset than with the discrete data; however, XGBoost consistently achieved the highest accuracy. Interpretability analysis using permutation importance (tree-based models) and attention-based feature attribution (TabNet) revealed that performance differences stem from how the models utilize input features. Tree-based models focus mainly on dominant geometry-dispersion features (release height, stability category, and downwind distance), treating radionuclide identity as a secondary input, whereas TabNet distributes attention more broadly across multiple variables. For practical deployment, a web-based GUI was developed for interactive scenario evaluation and transparent comparison with photon-transport reference calculations.

### [385] [ISO-Bench: Can Coding Agents Optimize Real-World Inference Workloads?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19594)
*Ayush Nangia,Shikhar Mishra,Aman Gokrani,Paras Chopra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ISO-Bench is a benchmark testing coding agents on real-world inference optimization tasks using hard and soft metrics, revealing no single agent dominates and highlighting the importance of scaffolding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate coding agents' capabilities on real-world optimization tasks taken from popular LLM serving frameworks, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks that rely heavily on runtime-based metrics.

Method: Curated 54 tasks from merged pull requests with measurable improvements, combining execution-based (hard) and LLM-based (soft) metrics for comprehensive evaluation.

Result: No single agent performs best across codebases; agents often identify bottlenecks correctly but fail to produce working solutions. Identical models vary significantly, indicating scaffolding's importance.

Conclusion: Both hard and soft metrics are essential for evaluating coding agents, and scaffolding plays a critical role alongside the underlying model.

Abstract: We introduce ISO-Bench, a benchmark for coding agents to test their capabilities on real-world inference optimization tasks. These tasks were taken from vLLM and SGLang, two of the most popular LLM serving frameworks. Each task provides an agent with a codebase and bottleneck description, whereby the agent must produce an optimization patch evaluated against expert human solutions. We curated 54 tasks from merged pull requests with measurable performance improvements. While existing benchmarks heavily use runtime-based metrics, such approaches can be gamed to pass tests without capturing the actual intent of the code changes. Therefore, we combine both hard (execution-based) and soft (LLM-based) metrics to show that both are necessary for complete evaluation. While evaluating both closed and open-source coding agents, we find no single agent dominates across codebases. Surprisingly, agents often identify correct bottlenecks but fail to execute working solutions. We also show that agents with identical underlying models differ substantially, suggesting scaffolding is as important as the model.

*Luigi Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference (CAVI) algorithm for Bayesian MIDAS regression, offering significant speedups and accurate results compared to generic methods like ADVI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of generic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers in Bayesian MIDAS regression and leverage conditional conjugacy for efficient inference.

Method: Develops a CAVI algorithm with closed-form updates (Gaussian for coefficients, Inverse-Gamma for variance) and propagates uncertainty across blocks via second moments.

Result: CAVI achieves 107x to 1,772x speedups over Gibbs sampling with nearly identical posterior means, while maintaining excellent calibration for weight parameters.

Conclusion: CAVI is highly efficient and accurate for Bayesian MIDAS regression, though mean-field approximations trade speed for credible interval calibration.

Abstract: We develop a Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference (CAVI) algorithm for Bayesian Mixed Data Sampling (MIDAS) regression with linear weight parameteri zations. The model separates impact coe cients from weighting function parameters through a normalization constraint, creating a bilinear structure that renders generic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers unreliable while preserving conditional conju gacy exploitable by CAVI. Each variational update admits a closed-form solution: Gaussian for regression coe cients and weight parameters, Inverse-Gamma for the error variance. The algorithm propagates uncertainty across blocks through second moments, distinguishing it from naive plug-in approximations. In a Monte Carlo study spanning 21 data-generating con gurations with up to 50 predictors, CAVI produces posterior means nearly identical to a block Gibbs sampler benchmark while achieving speedups of 107x to 1,772x (Table 9). Generic automatic di eren tiation VI (ADVI), by contrast, produces bias 714 times larger while being orders of magnitude slower, con rming the value of model-speci c derivations. Weight function parameters maintain excellent calibration (coverage above 92%) across all con gurations. Impact coe cient credible intervals exhibit the underdispersion characteristic of mean- eld approximations, with coverage declining from 89% to 55% as the number of predictors grows a documented trade-o between speed and interval calibration that structured variational methods can address. An empirical application to realized volatility forecasting on S&P 500 daily returns con rms that CAVI and Gibbs sampling yield virtually identical point forecasts, with CAVI completing each monthly estimation in under 10 milliseconds.

### [387] [Is Your Diffusion Sampler Actually Correct? A Sampler-Centric Evaluation of Discrete Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19619)
*Luhan Tang,Longxuan Yu,Shaorong Zhang,Greg Ver Steeg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a faster alternative to autoregressive models (ARMs) but face evaluation challenges due to conflated errors. The paper introduces an oracle framework to isolate sampler-induced error and finds that few-step samplers are not distributionally correct until steps match sequence length. Improved metrics like perplexity don't guarantee correct sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of evaluating discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs) by isolating sampler-induced errors, which are conflated with denoiser approximation errors in existing metrics.

Method: The authors introduce a sampler-centric oracle framework that uses an exact Hidden Markov Model posterior derived from a ground-truth Markov chain to isolate sampler-induced error.

Result: Results show that few-step discrete diffusion samplers are not distributionally correct under an oracle denoiser, with errors vanishing only as steps approach sequence length. Improved metrics don't ensure correct sampling.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights that current evaluation metrics are insufficient for assessing discrete diffusion samplers, and correct sampling requires steps matching sequence length.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs) provide a fast and flexible alternative to autoregressive models (ARMs) via iterative denoising with parallel updates. However, their evaluation is challenging: existing metrics conflate denoiser approximation error with sampler-induced error from the sampling dynamics, a problem that does not arise for ARMs whose autoregressive sampling exactly reflects the learned probability model. We introduce a sampler-centric oracle framework that replaces learned denoisers with an exact Hidden Markov Model posterior derived from a ground-truth Markov chain, isolating sampler-induced error in a controlled setting. We show that few-step discrete diffusion samplers are not distributionally correct even under an oracle denoiser, with transition-level mismatch that vanishes only as the number of steps approaches the sequence length. Moreover, improvements in negative log-likelihood, generative perplexity, or MAUVE do not imply correct sampling. Code is available at https://luhantang.github.io/dllm_sampler

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VecFormer is an efficient and generalizable Graph Transformer for node classification, addressing computational complexity and OOD performance issues through a two-stage training paradigm with codebooks and graph tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Transformers struggle with high computational complexity and poor generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, limiting their scalability and flexibility.

Method: VecFormer uses a two-stage training approach: (1) reconstructing node features and graph structure via codebooks to learn Graph Codes, and (2) performing attention at the Graph Token level to reduce complexity and improve generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments show VecFormer outperforms existing Graph Transformers in performance and speed across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: VecFormer effectively addresses key challenges in graph representation learning, offering a scalable and generalizable solution for node classification, especially in OOD settings.

Abstract: Graph Transformer has demonstrated impressive capabilities in the field of graph representation learning. However, existing approaches face two critical challenges: (1) most models suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity, making it difficult to scale to large graphs; (2) attention mechanisms based on node-level operations limit the flexibility of the model and result in poor generalization performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{VecFormer} (the \textbf{Vec}tor Quantized Graph Trans\textbf{former}), an efficient and highly generalizable model for node classification, particularly under OOD settings. VecFormer adopts a two-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, two codebooks are used to reconstruct the node features and the graph structure, aiming to learn the rich semantic \texttt{Graph Codes}. In the second stage, attention mechanisms are performed at the \texttt{Graph Token} level based on the transformed cross codebook, reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments on datasets of various sizes demonstrate that VecFormer outperforms the existing Graph Transformer in both performance and speed.

*Jesse Farebrother,Matteo Pirotta,Andrea Tirinzoni,Marc G. Bellemare,Alessandro Lazaric,Ahmed Touati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces jumpy world models for compositional planning by sequencing pre-trained policies, improving long-horizon task performance by 200% over primitive actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal abstractions and pre-trained policy sequencing are crucial for complex task-solving, but long-horizon prediction errors hinder effective compositional planning.

Method: The authors learn multi-step dynamics models (jumpy world models) with off-policy data and enhance them with a consistency objective. They combine these to estimate policy sequence values.

Result: Empirical results show a 200% relative improvement in zero-shot performance on manipulation and navigation tasks compared to primitive action planning.

Conclusion: Jumpy world models enable effective compositional planning, significantly enhancing performance on complex, long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: The ability to plan with temporal abstractions is central to intelligent decision-making. Rather than reasoning over primitive actions, we study agents that compose pre-trained policies as temporally extended actions, enabling solutions to complex tasks that no constituent alone can solve. Such compositional planning remains elusive as compounding errors in long-horizon predictions make it challenging to estimate the visitation distribution induced by sequencing policies. Motivated by the geometric policy composition framework introduced in arXiv:2206.08736, we address these challenges by learning predictive models of multi-step dynamics -- so-called jumpy world models -- that capture state occupancies induced by pre-trained policies across multiple timescales in an off-policy manner. Building on Temporal Difference Flows (arXiv:2503.09817), we enhance these models with a novel consistency objective that aligns predictions across timescales, improving long-horizon predictive accuracy. We further demonstrate how to combine these generative predictions to estimate the value of executing arbitrary sequences of policies over varying timescales. Empirically, we find that compositional planning with jumpy world models significantly improves zero-shot performance across a wide range of base policies on challenging manipulation and navigation tasks, yielding, on average, a 200% relative improvement over planning with primitive actions on long-horizon tasks.

### [390] [Evaluating the Impact of Data Anonymization on Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19641)
*Marvin Chen,Manuel Eberhardinger,Johannes Maucher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how anonymization affects Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems, proposing an evaluation framework to match pre- and post-anonymization retrieval results. Using three anonymization methods, four degrees, and four training strategies, the study highlights biases favoring models trained on original data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to balance privacy compliance (e.g., GDPR) with the performance of CBIR systems, particularly within the DOKIQ project for document verification.

Method: The paper systematically evaluates anonymization's impact using two public datasets and the DOKIQ dataset, testing three anonymization methods, four degrees, and four training strategies based on DINOv2.

Result: Results show a retrieval bias favoring models trained on original data, which yield the most similar retrievals post-anonymization.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical insights for designing privacy-compliant CBIR systems without compromising performance.

Abstract: With the growing importance of privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation, anonymizing visual data is becoming increasingly relevant across institutions. However, anonymization can negatively affect the performance of Computer Vision systems that rely on visual features, such as Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR). Despite this, the impact of anonymization on CBIR has not been systematically studied. This work addresses this gap, motivated by the DOKIQ project, an artificial intelligence-based system for document verification actively used by the State Criminal Police Office Baden-Württemberg. We propose a simple evaluation framework: retrieval results after anonymization should match those obtained before anonymization as closely as possible. To this end, we systematically assess the impact of anonymization using two public datasets and the internal DOKIQ dataset. Our experiments span three anonymization methods, four anonymization degrees, and four training strategies, all based on the state of the art backbone Self-Distillation with No Labels (DINO)v2. Our results reveal a pronounced retrieval bias in favor of models trained on original data, which produce the most similar retrievals after anonymization. The findings of this paper offer practical insights for developing privacy-compliant CBIR systems while preserving performance.

*Pablo Herrero Gómez,Antonio Jimeno Morenilla,David Muñoz-Hernández,Higinio Mora Mora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantum kernel methods, particularly Spectral Phase Encoding (SPE), show robustness under additive noise when combined with DFT preprocessing, outperforming other quantum variants and classical SVM baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the behavior of quantum kernel methods under data corruption and identify robust feature constructions for near-term quantum machine learning.

Method: Introduced Spectral Phase Encoding (SPE), a hybrid method combining DFT with diagonal phase-only embedding, and compared it against QK-PCA, QK-RP, and classical SVM baselines using dataset fixed-effects regression.

Result: QK-DFT shows the smallest degradation rate under noise, with statistically significant differences compared to PCA and RP variants. It matches linear SVM robustness and outperforms RBF SVM.

Conclusion: Robustness in quantum kernels depends on structure-aligned preprocessing like DFT and its interaction with diagonal embeddings, supporting a focus on robustness for NISQ-era quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are promising for near-term quantum ma- chine learning, yet their behavior under data corruption remains insuf- ficiently understood. We analyze how quantum feature constructions degrade under controlled additive noise. We introduce Spectral Phase Encoding (SPE), a hybrid construc- tion combining a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) front-end with a diagonal phase-only embedding aligned with the geometry of diagonal quantum maps. Within a unified framework, we compare QK-DFT against alternative quantum variants (QK-PCA, QK-RP) and classi- cal SVM baselines under identical clean-data hyperparameter selection, quantifying robustness via dataset fixed-effects regression with wild cluster bootstrap inference across heterogeneous real-world datasets. Across the quantum family, DFT-based preprocessing yields the smallest degradation rate as noise increases, with statistically sup- ported slope differences relative to PCA and RP. Compared to classical baselines, QK-DFT shows degradation comparable to linear SVM and more stable than RBF SVM under matched tuning. Hardware exper- iments confirm that SPE remains executable and numerically stable for overlap estimation. These results indicate that robustness in quan- tum kernels depends critically on structure-aligned preprocessing and its interaction with diagonal embeddings, supporting a robustness-first perspective for NISQ-era quantum machine learning.

TL;DR: NEXUS, a neural architecture, excels in forecasting urban air pollutants in Delhi NCR with high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing severe urban air pollution in megacities like Delhi NCR to improve public health outcomes.

Method: NEXUS integrates patch embedding, low-rank projections, and adaptive fusion to analyze atmospheric data from 2018-2021 across 16 grids.

Result: Achieves R² >0.94 for CO, 0.91 for NO, 0.95 for SO₂ with only 18,748 parameters, outperforming other models.

Conclusion: NEXUS offers superior predictive performance and computational efficiency for real-time air quality monitoring.

Abstract: Urban air pollution in megacities poses critical public health challenges, particularly in Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) where severe degradation affects millions. We present NEXUS (Neural Extraction and Unified Spatiotemporal) architecture for forecasting carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide. Working with four years (2018--2021) of atmospheric data across sixteen spatial grids, NEXUS achieves R$^2$ exceeding 0.94 for CO, 0.91 for NO, and 0.95 for SO$_2$ using merely 18,748 parameters -- substantially fewer than SCINet (35,552), Autoformer (68,704), and FEDformer (298,080). The architecture integrates patch embedding, low-rank projections, and adaptive fusion mechanisms to decode complex atmospheric chemistry patterns. Our investigation uncovers distinct diurnal rhythms and pronounced seasonal variations, with winter months experiencing severe pollution episodes driven by temperature inversions and agricultural biomass burning. Analysis identifies critical meteorological thresholds, quantifies wind field impacts on pollutant dispersion, and maps spatial heterogeneity across the region. Extensive ablation experiments demonstrate each architectural component's role. NEXUS delivers superior predictive performance with remarkable computational efficiency, enabling real-time deployment for air quality monitoring systems.

*Vishnu Subramanian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study on a minimal continual learning agent shows how representational dynamics evolve from plasticity to stability over time, even with perturbations, without complex mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand representational dynamics in continual learning systems by isolating them from architectural and optimization complexities.

Method: A minimal agent with a persistent state vector incrementally updated with new textual data, tracking representational changes via cosine similarity and stability metrics.

Result: Transition from plasticity to stability observed; semantic disturbances cause temporary similarity drops but recover with coherent input.

Conclusion: Simple systems can exhibit stability-plasticity tradeoffs, offering a baseline for studying representational adaptation in continual learning.

Abstract: Continual learning systems are increasingly deployed in environments where retraining or reset is infeasible, yet many approaches emphasize task performance rather than the evolution of internal representations over time. In this work, we study a minimal continual learning agent designed to isolate representational dynamics from architectural complexity and optimization objectives. The agent maintains a persistent state vector across executions and incrementally updates it as new textual data is introduced. We quantify representational change using cosine similarity between successive normalized state vectors and define a stability metric over time intervals. Longitudinal experiments across eight executions reveal a transition from an initial plastic regime to a stable representational regime under consistent input. A deliberately introduced semantic perturbation produces a bounded decrease in similarity, followed by recovery and restabilization under subsequent coherent input. These results demonstrate that meaningful stability plasticity tradeoffs can emerge in a minimal, stateful learning system without explicit regularization, replay, or architectural complexity. The work establishes a transparent empirical baseline for studying representational accumulation and adaptation in continual learning systems.

*Kihyuk Yoon,Lingchao Mao,Catherine Chong,Todd J. Schwedt,Chia-Chun Chiang,Jing Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PaReGTA is an LLM-based framework for encoding temporal EHR data into visit-level text with temporal cues, leveraging pre-trained models for efficient performance even with limited data. It outperforms sparse baselines in migraine classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal information in EHRs is often lost in sparse representations, and sequence models can be costly. PaReGTA aims to preserve temporal cues while being efficient.

Method: Converts EHR events into templated text, fine-tunes a sentence-embedding model contrastively, and uses hybrid temporal pooling for patient representations. Introduces PaReGTA-RSS for interpretability.

Result: Outperforms sparse baselines for migraine type classification in a cohort of 39,088 patients, while deep sequential models were unstable.

Conclusion: PaReGTA effectively encodes temporal EHR data, performs well with limited data, and offers interpretability through PaReGTA-RSS.

Abstract: Temporal information in structured electronic health records (EHRs) is often lost in sparse one-hot or count-based representations, while sequence models can be costly and data-hungry. We propose PaReGTA, an LLM-based encoding framework that (i) converts longitudinal EHR events into visit-level templated text with explicit temporal cues, (ii) learns domain-adapted visit embeddings via lightweight contrastive fine-tuning of a sentence-embedding model, and (iii) aggregates visit embeddings into a fixed-dimensional patient representation using hybrid temporal pooling that captures both recency and globally informative visits. Because PaReGTA does not require training from scratch but instead utilizes a pre-trained LLM, it can perform well even in data-limited cohorts. Furthermore, PaReGTA is model-agnostic and can benefit from future EHR-specialized sentence-embedding models. For interpretability, we introduce PaReGTA-RSS (Representation Shift Score), which quantifies clinically defined factor importance by recomputing representations after targeted factor removal and projecting representation shifts through a machine learning model. On 39,088 migraine patients from the All of Us Research Program, PaReGTA outperforms sparse baselines for migraine type classification while deep sequential models were unstable in our cohort.

*Xinyu Yuan,Xixian Liu,Ya Shi Zhang,Zuobai Zhang,Hongyu Guo,Jian Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PerturbDiff introduces a diffusion-based generative model to predict cellular responses to perturbations by modeling entire distributions in a Hilbert space, improving accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in predicting cellular responses lies in the destructive nature of single-cell sequencing, which prevents observing the same cell pre- and post-perturbation. Existing models assume fixed response distributions, ignoring variability from latent factors.

Method: PerturbDiff shifts focus from individual cells to entire distributions, embedding them in a Hilbert space and using a diffusion-based generative process to model population-level response shifts.

Result: PerturbDiff outperforms existing models in single-cell response prediction and generalizes better to unseen perturbations.

Conclusion: PerturbDiff advances the field by capturing hidden variability in cellular responses, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Building Virtual Cells that can accurately simulate cellular responses to perturbations is a long-standing goal in systems biology. A fundamental challenge is that high-throughput single-cell sequencing is destructive: the same cell cannot be observed both before and after a perturbation. Thus, perturbation prediction requires mapping unpaired control and perturbed populations. Existing models address this by learning maps between distributions, but typically assume a single fixed response distribution when conditioned on observed cellular context (e.g., cell type) and the perturbation type. In reality, responses vary systematically due to unobservable latent factors such as microenvironmental fluctuations and complex batch effects, forming a manifold of possible distributions for the same observed conditions. To account for this variability, we introduce PerturbDiff, which shifts modeling from individual cells to entire distributions. By embedding distributions as points in a Hilbert space, we define a diffusion-based generative process operating directly over probability distributions. This allows PerturbDiff to capture population-level response shifts across hidden factors. Benchmarks on established datasets show that PerturbDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-cell response prediction and generalizes substantially better to unseen perturbations. See our project page (https://katarinayuan.github.io/PerturbDiff-ProjectPage/), where code and data will be made publicly available (https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/PerturbDiff).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the 'curse of unrolling' in algorithm unrolling, identifies factors causing divergence in Jacobians, proposes truncation as a solution, and links warm-starting to implicit truncation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent findings reveal that Jacobians computed via unrolling may initially diverge (curse of unrolling). This work aims to understand and mitigate this issue.

Method: Non-asymptotic analysis of derivative iterates, identifying algorithmic factors. Proposes truncation of early iterations and links warm-starting to implicit truncation.

Result: Early truncation mitigates divergence and reduces memory. Warm-starting naturally induces implicit truncation.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the curse of unrolling and practical solutions (truncation, warm-starting), validated by experiments.

Abstract: Algorithm unrolling is ubiquitous in machine learning, particularly in hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning, where Jacobians of solution mappings are computed by differentiating through iterative algorithms. Although unrolling is known to yield asymptotically correct Jacobians under suitable conditions, recent work has shown that the derivative iterates may initially diverge from the true Jacobian, a phenomenon known as the curse of unrolling. In this work, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis that explains the origin of this behavior and identifies the algorithmic factors that govern it. We show that truncating early iterations of the derivative computation mitigates the curse while simultaneously reducing memory requirements. Finally, we demonstrate that warm-starting in bilevel optimization naturally induces an implicit form of truncation, providing a practical remedy. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments on representative examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic ways to visualize and understand class confusions and their evolving relationships during neural network training.

Method: GRAPHIC analyzes neural networks by deriving confusion matrices from intermediate layers using linear classifiers, interpreting them as adjacency matrices of directed graphs.

Result: GRAPHIC reveals insights into linear class separability, dataset issues, and architectural behavior, validated by human studies.

Conclusion: GRAPHIC provides new perspectives on neural network learning by uncovering real confusions, enhancing explainability.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence has emerged as a promising field of research to address reliability concerns in artificial intelligence. Despite significant progress in explainable artificial intelligence, few methods provide a systematic way to visualize and understand how classes are confused and how their relationships evolve as training progresses. In this work, we present GRAPHIC, an architecture-agnostic approach that analyzes neural networks on a class level. It leverages confusion matrices derived from intermediate layers using linear classifiers. We interpret these as adjacency matrices of directed graphs, allowing tools from network science to visualize and quantify learning dynamics across training epochs and intermediate layers. GRAPHIC provides insights into linear class separability, dataset issues, and architectural behavior, revealing, for example, similarities between flatfish and man and labeling ambiguities validated in a human study. In summary, by uncovering real confusions, GRAPHIC offers new perspectives on how neural networks learn. The code is available at https://github.com/Johanna-S-Froehlich/GRAPHIC.

TL;DR: A representation learning framework is proposed to recover latent exogenous genetic instruments in Mendelian Randomization, addressing violations of core assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome violations of independence assumptions in MR due to factors like population stratification or assortative mating.

Method: A representation learning framework utilizing cross-environment invariance to identify latent exogenous components.

Result: Theoretical guarantees for identification are provided, and effectiveness is shown via simulations and semi-synthetic experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses key challenges in MR by leveraging multi-environment data.

Abstract: Mendelian Randomization (MR) is a prominent observational epidemiological research method designed to address unobserved confounding when estimating causal effects. However, core assumptions -- particularly the independence between instruments and unobserved confounders -- are often violated due to population stratification or assortative mating. Leveraging the increasing availability of multi-environment data, we propose a representation learning framework that exploits cross-environment invariance to recover latent exogenous components of genetic instruments. We provide theoretical guarantees for identifying these latent instruments under various mixing mechanisms and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and semi-synthetic experiments using data from the All of Us Research Hub.

Abstract: As Operational Technology increasingly integrates with Information Technology, the need for Intrusion Detection Systems becomes more important. This paper explores an unsupervised approach to anomaly detection in network traffic using $β$-Variational Autoencoders on the NSL-KDD dataset. We investigate two methods: leveraging the latent space structure by measuring distances from test samples to the training data projections, and using the reconstruction error as a conventional anomaly detection metric. By comparing these approaches, we provide insights into their respective advantages and limitations in an unsupervised setting. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of latent space exploitation for classification tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-learning struggles with out-of-distribution tasks due to negative transfer from spurious correlations.

Method: Condition task-specific priors on latent causal task embeddings, leveraging noisy expert-provided pairwise judgments.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows reduced prior mismatch; empirical results confirm improved adaptation.

Conclusion: Conditioning on causal embeddings aligns with real-world clinical mechanisms, enhancing transfer learning.

Abstract: Meta-learning methods perform well on new within-distribution tasks but often fail when adapting to out-of-distribution target tasks, where transfer from source tasks can induce negative transfer. We propose a causally-aware Bayesian meta-learning method, by conditioning task-specific priors on precomputed latent causal task embeddings, enabling transfer based on mechanistic similarity rather than spurious correlations. Our approach explicitly considers realistic deployment settings where access to target-task data is limited, and adaptation relies on noisy (expert-provided) pairwise judgments of causal similarity between source and target tasks. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that conditioning on causal embeddings controls prior mismatch and mitigates negative transfer under task shift. Empirically, we demonstrate reductions in negative transfer and improved out-of-distribution adaptation in both controlled simulations and a large-scale real-world clinical prediction setting for cross-disease transfer, where causal embeddings align with underlying clinical mechanisms.

TL;DR: The paper advocates for data frugality in AI to address environmental and performance issues caused by excessive data scaling, showcasing its practicality and benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The machine learning community needs to shift from advocating data frugality to implementing it due to diminishing returns from large datasets and their environmental costs.

Method: The paper provides estimates of energy use and emissions from ImageNet-1K and demonstrates coreset-based subset selection to reduce training energy without sacrificing accuracy.

Result: Coreset-based subset selection significantly cuts energy use and mitigates dataset bias while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: Actionable recommendations are proposed to transition data frugality from rhetoric to practice for responsible AI development.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the machine learning community must move from preaching to practising data frugality for responsible artificial intelligence (AI) development. For long, progress has been equated with ever-larger datasets, driving remarkable advances but now yielding increasingly diminishing performance gains alongside rising energy use and carbon emissions. While awareness of data frugal approaches has grown, their adoption has remained rhetorical, and data scaling continues to dominate development practice. We argue that this gap between preach and practice must be closed, as continued data scaling entails substantial and under-accounted environmental impacts. To ground our position, we provide indicative estimates of the energy use and carbon emissions associated with the downstream use of ImageNet-1K. We then present empirical evidence that data frugality is both practical and beneficial, demonstrating that coreset-based subset selection can substantially reduce training energy consumption with little loss in accuracy, while also mitigating dataset bias. Finally, we outline actionable recommendations for moving data frugality from rhetorical preach to concrete practice for responsible development of AI.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Concept drift -- the change of the distribution over time -- poses significant challenges for learning systems and is of central interest for monitoring. Understanding drift is thus paramount, and drift localization -- determining which samples are affected by the drift -- is essential. While several approaches exist, most rely on local testing schemes, which tend to fail in high-dimensional, low-signal settings. In this work, we consider a fundamentally different approach based on conformal predictions. We discuss and show the shortcomings of common approaches and demonstrate the performance of our approach on state-of-the-art image datasets.

Result: DMM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse RL tasks with a compact parameter footprint.

Conclusion: DMM effectively prevents information loss and demonstrates strong potential for real-world RL applications.

Abstract: Mamba-based models have drawn much attention in offline RL. However, their selective mechanism often detrimental when key steps in RL sequences are omitted. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective structure, called Decision MetaMamba (DMM), which replaces Mamba's token mixer with a dense layer-based sequence mixer and modifies positional structure to preserve local information. By performing sequence mixing that considers all channels simultaneously before Mamba, DMM prevents information loss due to selective scanning and residual gating. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DMM delivers the state-of-the-art performance across diverse RL tasks. Furthermore, DMM achieves these results with a compact parameter footprint, demonstrating strong potential for real-world applications.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing the original order of shuffled layers in a Residual Network by leveraging training stability conditions and hill-climbing optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from a practical puzzle posed by Jane Street, highlighting the intrigue of recovering layer order in neural networks despite the enormous search space.

Method: The method involves pairing input/output projections using diagonal dominance ratio and ordering layers via hill-climbing initialized with rough proxies like delta-norm.

Result: The approach successfully navigates a search space of $(48!)^2$, demonstrating feasibility despite the astronomical complexity.

Conclusion: The study concludes that training dynamics provide sufficient structure to recover layer order, offering insights into neural network internals.

Abstract: A recent Dwarkesh Patel podcast with John Collison and Elon Musk featured an interesting puzzle from Jane Street: they trained a neural net, shuffled all 96 layers, and asked to put them back in order.
  Given unlabelled layers of a Residual Network and its training dataset, we recover the exact ordering of the layers. The problem decomposes into pairing each block's input and output projections ($48!$ possibilities) and ordering the reassembled blocks ($48!$ possibilities), for a combined search space of $(48!)^2 \approx 10^{122}$, which is more than the atoms in the observable universe. We show that stability conditions during training like dynamic isometry leave the product $W_{\text{out}} W_{\text{in}}$ for correctly paired layers with a negative diagonal structure, allowing us to use diagonal dominance ratio as a signal for pairing. For ordering, we seed-initialize with a rough proxy such as delta-norm or $\|W_{\text{out}}\|_F$ then hill-climb to zero mean squared error.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To estimate the Hessian of an objective function using only noisy measurements and analyze its performance in stochastic Newton methods.

Method: Random direction stochastic approximation (RDSA) with varying numbers of function measurements to form generalized Hessian estimators.

Result: Estimators with more function measurements have lower-order bias, asymptotic unbiasedness is proven, and convergence analyses are performed for stochastic Newton methods.

Conclusion: The proposed generalized Hessian estimators are effective, with theoretical and numerical validation supporting their use in stochastic optimization.

Abstract: We present a family of generalized Hessian estimators of the objective using random direction stochastic approximation (RDSA) by utilizing only noisy function measurements. The form of each estimator and the order of the bias depend on the number of function measurements. In particular, we demonstrate that estimators with more function measurements exhibit lower-order estimation bias. We show the asymptotic unbiasedness of the estimators. We also perform asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence analyses for stochastic Newton methods that incorporate our generalized Hessian estimators. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to validate our theoretical findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the challenge of translating mass spectra into molecular structures is vital for biological insight, metabolite discovery, and chemical research.

Method: MSFlow uses a formula-restricted transformer encoder and a flow-matching decoder to reconstruct molecules from spectra embeddings.

Result: MSFlow achieves a 45% accuracy rate in translating spectra to molecular structures, a 14-fold improvement over existing methods.

Conclusion: MSFlow advances molecular structure elucidation and is made publicly available for non-commercial use.

Abstract: Mass spectrometry is a powerful and widely used tool for identifying molecular structures due to its sensitivity and ability to profile complex samples. However, translating spectra into full molecular structures is a difficult, under-defined inverse problem. Overcoming this problem is crucial for enabling biological insight, discovering new metabolites, and advancing chemical research across multiple fields. To this end, we develop MSFlow, a two-stage encoder-decoder flow-matching generative model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the structure elucidation task for small molecules. In the first stage, we adopt a formula-restricted transformer model for encoding mass spectra into a continuous and chemically informative embedding space, while in the second stage, we train a decoder flow matching model to reconstruct molecules from latent embeddings of mass spectra. We present ablation studies demonstrating the importance of using information-preserving molecular descriptors for encoding mass spectra and motivate the use of our discrete flow-based decoder. Our rigorous evaluation demonstrates that MSFlow can accurately translate up to 45 percent of molecular mass spectra into their corresponding molecular representations - an improvement of up to fourteen-fold over the current state-of-the-art. A trained version of MSFlow is made publicly available on GitHub for non-commercial users.

Motivation: Traditional microstructure simulation methods like phase-field models are computationally expensive due to complex partial differential equations. A faster, high-accuracy alternative is needed.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised, fully convolutional spatiotemporal model trained on sequential images from simulations of grain growth and spinodal decomposition.

Result: The model accurately predicts microstructure evolution, capturing short-term and long-term behaviors, and generalizes well to unseen domains and parameters. It outperforms recurrent neural networks.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, data-driven solution for fast microstructure simulations, setting a robust baseline for spatiotemporal learning in materials science.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting microstructure evolution is fundamental to materials science, as it governs the resulting properties and performance of materials. Traditional simulation methods, such as phase-field models, offer high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive due to the need to solve complex partial differential equations at fine spatiotemporal resolutions. To address this challenge, we propose a deep learning-based framework that accelerates microstructure evolution predictions while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach utilizes a fully convolutional spatiotemporal model trained in a self-supervised manner using sequential images generated from simulations of microstructural processes, including grain growth and spinodal decomposition. The trained neural network effectively learns the underlying physical dynamics and can accurately capture both short-term local behaviors and long-term statistical properties of evolving microstructures, while also demonstrating generalization to unseen spatiotemporal domains and variations in configuration and material parameters. Compared to recurrent neural architectures, our model achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance with significantly reduced computational cost in both training and inference. This work establishes a robust baseline for spatiotemporal learning in materials science and offers a scalable, data-driven alternative for fast and reliable microstructure simulations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Uncertainty-Aware Rank-One MIMO Q Network framework to address extrapolation errors in offline RL, leveraging OOD data efficiently while ensuring computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extrapolation errors from OOD data in offline RL are a major challenge, and existing methods suffer from conservatism, imprecise characterization, and high computational costs.

Method: The proposed framework quantifies data uncertainty and integrates it into training losses, using a Rank-One MIMO architecture for efficient uncertainty-aware Q-function modeling.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the D4RL benchmark, balancing precision, speed, and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: By quantifying uncertainty and optimizing the use of OOD data, the framework effectively mitigates extrapolation errors and enhances offline RL efficiency.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered significant interest due to its safe and easily scalable paradigm. However, training under this paradigm presents its own challenge: the extrapolation error stemming from out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Existing methodologies have endeavored to address this issue through means like penalizing OOD Q-values or imposing similarity constraints on the learned policy and the behavior policy. Nonetheless, these approaches are often beset by limitations such as being overly conservative in utilizing OOD data, imprecise OOD data characterization, and significant computational overhead. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an Uncertainty-Aware Rank-One Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Q Network framework. The framework aims to enhance Offline Reinforcement Learning by fully leveraging the potential of OOD data while still ensuring efficiency in the learning process. Specifically, the framework quantifies data uncertainty and harnesses it in the training losses, aiming to train a policy that maximizes the lower confidence bound of the corresponding Q-function. Furthermore, a Rank-One MIMO architecture is introduced to model the uncertainty-aware Q-function, \TP{offering the same ability for uncertainty quantification as an ensemble of networks but with a cost nearly equivalent to that of a single network}. Consequently, this framework strikes a harmonious balance between precision, speed, and memory efficiency, culminating in improved overall performance. Extensive experimentation on the D4RL benchmark demonstrates that the framework attains state-of-the-art performance while remaining computationally efficient. By incorporating the concept of uncertainty quantification, our framework offers a promising avenue to alleviate extrapolation errors and enhance the efficiency of offline RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LVMs and LLMs under DPFL faces privacy-utility trade-offs. LoRA reduces costs but degrades performance in DPFL, revealing challenges like gradient coupling and noise amplification.

Method: Proposes LA-LoRA, decoupling gradients and aligning updates across clients, enhancing robustness under privacy constraints.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on Swin Transformer and RoBERTa, with a 16.83% accuracy improvement over RoLoRA.

Conclusion: LA-LoRA effectively mitigates DPFL challenges, offering theoretical convergence guarantees and broad applicability.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large vision models (LVMs) and large language models (LLMs) under differentially private federated learning (DPFL) is hindered by a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a promising parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, reduces computational and communication costs by introducing two trainable low-rank matrices while freezing pre-trained weights. However, directly applying LoRA in DPFL settings leads to performance degradation, especially in LVMs. Our analysis reveals three previously underexplored challenges: (1) gradient coupling caused by the simultaneous update of two asymmetric low-rank matrices, (2) compounded noise amplification under differential privacy, and (3) sharpness of the global aggregated model in the parameter space. To address these issues, we propose LA-LoRA (\textbf{L}ocal \textbf{A}lternating \textbf{LoRA}), a novel approach that decouples gradient interactions and aligns update directions across clients to enhance robustness under stringent privacy constraints. Theoretically, LA-LoRA strengthens convergence guarantees in noisy federated environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LA-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on Swin Transformer and RoBERTa models, showcasing robustness to DP noise and broad applicability across both LVMs and LLMs. For example, when fine-tuning the Swin-B model on the Tiny-ImageNet dataset under a strict privacy budget ($ε= 1$), LA-LoRA outperforms the best baseline, RoLoRA, by 16.83\% in test accuracy.

Motivation: The study explores whether diffusion models' internal features can further improve adversarial training beyond just generating synthetic data.

Method: Systematically integrating diffusion representations as an auxiliary learning signal during adversarial training and evaluating their impact.

Result: Diffusion models provide diverse, partially robust representations, improving classifier robustness and encouraging disentangled features.

Conclusion: Jointly leveraging diffusion representations and synthetic data enhances adversarial training effectiveness across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Incorporating diffusion-generated synthetic data into adversarial training (AT) has been shown to substantially improve the training of robust image classifiers. In this work, we extend the role of diffusion models beyond merely generating synthetic data, examining whether their internal representations, which encode meaningful features of the data, can provide additional benefits for robust classifier training. Through systematic experiments, we show that diffusion models offer representations that are both diverse and partially robust, and that explicitly incorporating diffusion representations as an auxiliary learning signal during AT consistently improves robustness across settings. Furthermore, our representation analysis indicates that incorporating diffusion models into AT encourages more disentangled features, while diffusion representations and diffusion-generated synthetic data play complementary roles in shaping representations. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet validate these findings, demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly leveraging diffusion representations and synthetic data within AT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the issues of data heterogeneity, privacy noise, and client drift when applying AdamW in DPFL, ensuring efficient and robust model training.

Method: Introduces DP-FedAdamW, which stabilizes second-moment variance, removes DP-induced bias, and aligns local updates to global descent.

Result: Theoretically and empirically validated, DP-FedAdamW outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 5.83% improvement on Tiny-ImageNet.

Conclusion: DP-FedAdamW effectively balances convergence efficiency and robustness in DPFL, providing tighter privacy guarantees and better performance.

Abstract: Balancing convergence efficiency and robustness under Differential Privacy (DP) is a central challenge in Federated Learning (FL). While AdamW accelerates training and fine-tuning in large-scale models, we find that directly applying it to Differentially Private FL (DPFL) suffers from three major issues: (i) data heterogeneity and privacy noise jointly amplify the variance of second-moment estimator, (ii) DP perturbations bias the second-moment estimator, and (iii) DP amplify AdamW sensitivity to local overfitting, worsening client drift. We propose DP-FedAdamW, the first AdamW-based optimizer for DPFL. It restores AdamW under DP by stabilizing second-moment variance, removing DP-induced bias, and aligning local updates to the global descent to curb client drift. Theoretically, we establish an unbiased second-moment estimator and prove a linearly accelerated convergence rate without any heterogeneity assumption, while providing tighter $(\varepsilon,δ)$-DP guarantees. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of DP-FedAdamW across language and vision Transformers and ResNet-18. On Tiny-ImageNet (Swin-Base, $\varepsilon=1$), DP-FedAdamW outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 5.83\%. The code is available in Appendix.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, abstraction methods that remove unnecessary information from the observation are commonly used to learn policies which generalize better to unseen tasks. However, these methods often overlook a crucial weakness: the function which extracts the reduced-information representation has unknown generalization ability in unseen observations. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting an information removal method which more reliably generalizes to new states. We accomplish this by using a learned masking function which operates on, and is integrated with, the attention weights within an attention-based policy network. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves policy generalization to unseen tasks in the Procgen benchmark compared to standard PPO and masking approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the theoretical underpinnings of RND, which lacks rigorous motivation despite its empirical effectiveness in measuring novelty and uncertainty.

Method: Analyzing RND within the neural tangent kernel framework in the limit of infinite network width, revealing equivalences to deep ensembles and Bayesian inference.

Result: RND's uncertainty signal matches deep ensembles' predictive variance, and its error distribution can mirror Bayesian posterior predictive distributions. A Bayesian RND model for posterior sampling is proposed.

Conclusion: The study unifies RND with deep ensembles and Bayesian inference, providing theoretical grounding and new directions for efficient uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is central to safe and efficient deployments of deep learning models, yet many computationally practical methods lack lacking rigorous theoretical motivation. Random network distillation (RND) is a lightweight technique that measures novelty via prediction errors against a fixed random target. While empirically effective, it has remained unclear what uncertainties RND measures and how its estimates relate to other approaches, e.g. Bayesian inference or deep ensembles. This paper establishes these missing theoretical connections by analyzing RND within the neural tangent kernel framework in the limit of infinite network width. Our analysis reveals two central findings in this limit: (1) The uncertainty signal from RND -- its squared self-predictive error -- is equivalent to the predictive variance of a deep ensemble. (2) By constructing a specific RND target function, we show that the RND error distribution can be made to mirror the centered posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian inference with wide neural networks. Based on this equivalence, we moreover devise a posterior sampling algorithm that generates i.i.d. samples from an exact Bayesian posterior predictive distribution using this modified \textit{Bayesian RND} model. Collectively, our findings provide a unified theoretical perspective that places RND within the principled frameworks of deep ensembles and Bayesian inference, and offer new avenues for efficient yet theoretically grounded uncertainty quantification methods.

TL;DR: P-PINN is a selective pruning framework for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that identifies and removes noise-sensitive neurons to improve robustness and accuracy in solving PDE inverse problems under noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ill-posed nature of PDE inverse problems makes PINNs highly sensitive to noise, leading to distorted neural representations and unstable training. This motivates the development of P-PINN to address these challenges.

Method: P-PINN uses a joint residual-data fidelity indicator to partition data into reliable and corrupted subsets, identifies noise-sensitive neurons via a bias-based measure, and employs iterative pruning followed by fine-tuning on reliable data.

Result: P-PINN achieves up to a 96.6% reduction in relative error compared to baseline PINNs, demonstrating improved robustness, accuracy, and training stability under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: Activation-level pruning via P-PINN is an effective post hoc mechanism to enhance the reliability of physics-informed learning in noisy settings.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a promising framework for solving inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating observational data and physical constraints in a unified optimization objective. However, the ill-posed nature of PDE inverse problems makes them highly sensitive to noise. Even a small fraction of corrupted observations can distort internal neural representations, severely impairing accuracy and destabilizing training. Motivated by recent advances in machine unlearning and structured network pruning, we propose P-PINN, a selective pruning framework designed to unlearn the influence of corrupted data in a pretrained PINN. Specifically, starting from a PINN trained on the full dataset, P-PINN evaluates a joint residual--data fidelity indicator, a weighted combination of data misfit and PDE residuals, to partition the training set into reliable and corrupted subsets. Next, we introduce a bias-based neuron importance measure that quantifies directional activation discrepancies between the two subsets, identifying neurons whose representations are predominantly driven by corrupted samples. Building on this, an iterative pruning strategy then removes noise-sensitive neurons layer by layer. The resulting pruned network is fine-tuned on the reliable data subject to the original PDE constraints, acting as a lightweight post-processing stage rather than a complete retraining. Numerical experiments on extensive PDE inverse-problem benchmarks demonstrate that P-PINN substantially improves robustness, accuracy, and training stability under noisy conditions, achieving up to a 96.6\% reduction in relative error compared with baseline PINNs. These results indicate that activation-level post hoc pruning is a promising mechanism for enhancing the reliability of physics-informed learning in noise-contaminated settings.

TL;DR: AR and NAR models differ in solving multi-step lookahead tasks, with NAR models leveraging deterministic reverse generation for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the divergent mechanisms of AR and NAR models in planning tasks requiring multi-step lookahead.

Method: Analyzed training and inference dynamics of AR and NAR models (e.g., dLLMs) on lookahead tasks, focusing on forward and reverse generation asymmetry.

Result: Both models achieved perfect accuracy, but NAR models required fewer training examples and simpler architectures.

Conclusion: NAR models excel in planning tasks by exploiting deterministic reverse generation, offering efficiency advantages over AR models.

Abstract: While Autoregressive (AR) Transformer-based Generative Language Models are frequently employed for lookahead tasks, recent research suggests a potential discrepancy in their ability to perform planning tasks that require multi-step lookahead. In this work, we investigate the distinct emergent mechanisms that arise when training AR versus Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models, such as Discrete Diffusion Models (dLLMs), on lookahead tasks. By requiring the models to plan ahead to reach the correct conclusion, we analyze how these two paradigms fundamentally differ in their approach to the problem. We identify a critical asymmetry in planning problems: while forward generation requires complex lookahead at branching junctions, reverse generation is often deterministic. This asymmetry creates an opportunity for NAR models. Through mechanistic analysis of training and inference dynamics, we demonstrate that NAR models learn to solve planning tasks by utilizing future tokens to decode backwards, avoiding the need to learn complex traversal mechanisms entirely. Consequently, we report that both AR and NAR models are able to achieve perfect accuracy on the lookahead task. However, NAR models require exponentially fewer training examples and shallower architectures compared to AR models, which often fail to converge without specific curriculum adjustments.

Building upon this representation, CURE implicitly retrieves patient-specific latent subgroups that capture both baseline survival dynamics and treatment-dependent variations. Experimental results on METABRIC and TCGA-LUAD datasets demonstrate that proposed CURE model consistently outperforms strong baselines in survival analysis, evaluated using the Time-dependent Concordance Index ($C^{td}$) and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). These findings highlight the potential of CURE to enhance multimodal understanding and serve as a foundation for future treatment recommendation models.

### [418] [A Secure and Private Distributed Bayesian Federated Learning Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20003)
*Nuocheng Yang,Sihua Wang,Zhaohui Yang,Mingzhe Chen,Changchuan Yin,Kaibin Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Distributed Federated Learning (DFL) framework addressing privacy leakage, slow convergence, and Byzantine attacks by integrating Bayesian training, optimized neighbor selection, and a GNN-based RL algorithm for autonomous decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFL faces challenges like privacy leakage, slow convergence, and vulnerability to Byzantine adversaries, which degrade model training efficiency and security.

Method: The framework uses Bayesian local model training, formulates neighbor selection as an optimization problem, and employs a GNN-based RL algorithm for autonomous connectivity decisions.

Result: Simulations show the method outperforms traditional schemes in robustness and efficiency with lower overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances security, privacy, and convergence in DFL, offering a scalable and autonomous solution.

Abstract: Distributed Federated Learning (DFL) enables decentralized model training across large-scale systems without a central parameter server. However, DFL faces three critical challenges: privacy leakage from honest-but-curious neighbors, slow convergence due to the lack of central coordination, and vulnerability to Byzantine adversaries aiming to degrade model accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel DFL framework that integrates Byzantine robustness, privacy preservation, and convergence acceleration. Within this framework, each device trains a local model using a Bayesian approach and independently selects an optimal subset of neighbors for posterior exchange. We formulate this neighbor selection as an optimization problem to minimize the global loss function under security and privacy constraints. Solving this problem is challenging because devices only possess partial network information, and the complex coupling between topology, security, and convergence remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first analytically characterize the trade-offs between dynamic connectivity, Byzantine detection, privacy levels, and convergence speed. Leveraging these insights, we develop a fully distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. This approach enables devices to make autonomous connection decisions based on local observations. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves superior robustness and efficiency with significantly lower overhead compared to traditional security and privacy schemes.

### [419] [Learning Discriminative and Generalizable Anomaly Detector for Dynamic Graph with Limited Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20019)
*Yuxing Tian,Yiyan Qi,Fengran Mo,Weixu Zhang,Jian Guo,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework for DGAD combines residual representation, restriction loss, and bi-boundary optimization to improve anomaly detection with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DGAD methods struggle with ambiguous boundaries (unsupervised) or poor generalization (semi-supervised). This work aims to learn discriminative boundaries from normal/unlabeled data while leveraging limited labeled anomalies when available.

Method: The framework includes: (i) residual representation encoding for anomaly signals, (ii) restriction loss to constrain normal representations, and (iii) bi-boundary optimization for robust boundary learning using normalizing flow.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework outperforms existing methods in diverse settings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances discriminative boundary learning and generalization, advancing DGAD performance.

Abstract: Dynamic graph anomaly detection (DGAD) is critical for many real-world applications but remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies. Existing methods are either unsupervised or semi-supervised: unsupervised methods avoid the need for labeled anomalies but often produce ambiguous boundary, whereas semi-supervised methods can overfit to the limited labeled anomalies and generalize poorly to unseen anomalies. To address this gap, we consider a largely underexplored problem in DGAD: learning a discriminative boundary from normal/unlabeled data, while leveraging limited labeled anomalies \textbf{when available} without sacrificing generalization to unseen anomalies. To this end, we propose an effective, generalizable, and model-agnostic framework with three main components: (i) residual representation encoding that capture deviations between current interactions and their historical context, providing anomaly-relevant signals; (ii) a restriction loss that constrain the normal representations within an interval bounded by two co-centered hyperspheres, ensuring consistent scales while keeping anomalies separable; (iii) a bi-boundary optimization strategy that learns a discriminative and robust boundary using the normal log-likelihood distribution modeled by a normalizing flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework across diverse evaluation settings.

*Nicolas Anguita,Francesco Locatello,Andrew M. Saxe,Marco Mondelli,Flavia Mancini,Samuel Lippl,Clementine Domine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how initialization impacts feature reuse and refinement in pretraining-fine-tuning pipelines, identifying four distinct fine-tuning regimes and emphasizing the role of initialization scale in generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically understand how initialization choices affect feature learning and reuse during pretraining and fine-tuning stages in machine learning systems.

Method: Develops an analytical theory for diagonal linear networks, deriving exact expressions for generalization error based on initialization parameters and task statistics. Validates findings empirically on CIFAR-100 with nonlinear networks.

Result: Identifies four fine-tuning regimes influenced by initialization, showing smaller initialization scales in earlier layers improve feature reuse and refinement, enhancing generalization.

Conclusion: Initialization scale across layers critically shapes fine-tuning generalization, enabling continued feature learning and better performance on tasks leveraging pretrained features.

Abstract: Pretraining and fine-tuning are central stages in modern machine learning systems. In practice, feature learning plays an important role across both stages: deep neural networks learn a broad range of useful features during pretraining and further refine those features during fine-tuning. However, an end-to-end theoretical understanding of how choices of initialization impact the ability to reuse and refine features during fine-tuning has remained elusive. Here we develop an analytical theory of the pretraining-fine-tuning pipeline in diagonal linear networks, deriving exact expressions for the generalization error as a function of initialization parameters and task statistics. We find that different initialization choices place the network into four distinct fine-tuning regimes that are distinguished by their ability to support feature learning and reuse, and therefore by the task statistics for which they are beneficial. In particular, a smaller initialization scale in earlier layers enables the network to both reuse and refine its features, leading to superior generalization on fine-tuning tasks that rely on a subset of pretraining features. We demonstrate empirically that the same initialization parameters impact generalization in nonlinear networks trained on CIFAR-100. Overall, our results demonstrate analytically how data and network initialization interact to shape fine-tuning generalization, highlighting an important role for the relative scale of initialization across different layers in enabling continued feature learning during fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A kernel-based generative modeling method replaces neural networks with linear systems, handling inexact estimates and diverse feature maps for training-free generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to simplify generative modeling by avoiding neural network training and leveraging linear systems instead, enabling efficient and diverse applications.

Method: The method uses a kernel approach within the stochastic interpolant framework, solving a linear system for drift computation and handling diffusion coefficients seamlessly.

Result: The approach successfully generates samples for financial time series, turbulence, and images, demonstrating versatility and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The kernel method offers a viable alternative to neural networks for generative tasks, with broad applicability and ease of integration.

Abstract: We develop a kernel method for generative modeling within the stochastic interpolant framework, replacing neural network training with linear systems. The drift of the generative SDE is $\hat b_t(x) = \nablaφ(x)^\topη_t$, where $η_t\in\R^P$ solves a $P\times P$ system computable from data, with $P$ independent of the data dimension $d$. Since estimates are inexact, the diffusion coefficient $D_t$ affects sample quality; the optimal $D_t^*$ from Girsanov diverges at $t=0$, but this poses no difficulty and we develop an integrator that handles it seamlessly. The framework accommodates diverse feature maps -- scattering transforms, pretrained generative models etc. -- enabling training-free generation and model combination. We demonstrate the approach on financial time series, turbulence, and image generation.

*Thanh Q. Tran,Arun Verma,Kiwan Wong,Bryan Kian Hsiang Low,Daniela Rus,Wei Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BarrierSteer is a framework using Control Barrier Functions in latent space to enhance LLM safety without altering model parameters, effectively reducing adversarial attacks and unsafe outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges with adversarial attacks and unsafe content generation, necessitating robust safety mechanisms grounded in theory.

Method: BarrierSteer embeds non-linear safety constraints via Control Barrier Functions in latent space, merging constraints efficiently during inference.

Result: Experiments show BarrierSteer lowers adversarial success rates, reduces unsafe generations, and surpasses existing methods.

Conclusion: BarrierSteer offers a theoretically sound and practical solution for improving LLM safety while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Despite the state-of-the-art performance of large language models (LLMs) across diverse tasks, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks and unsafe content generation remains a major obstacle to deployment, particularly in high-stakes settings. Addressing this challenge requires safety mechanisms that are both practically effective and supported by rigorous theory. We introduce BarrierSteer, a novel framework that formalizes response safety by embedding learned non-linear safety constraints directly into the model's latent representation space. BarrierSteer employs a steering mechanism based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to efficiently detect and prevent unsafe response trajectories during inference with high precision. By enforcing multiple safety constraints through efficient constraint merging, without modifying the underlying LLM parameters, BarrierSteer preserves the model's original capabilities and performance. We provide theoretical results establishing that applying CBFs in latent space offers a principled and computationally efficient approach to enforcing safety. Our experiments across multiple models and datasets show that BarrierSteer substantially reduces adversarial success rates, decreases unsafe generations, and outperforms existing methods.

### [423] [Reliable Abstention under Adversarial Injections: Tight Lower Bounds and New Upper Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20111)
*Ezra Edelman,Surbhi Goel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper resolves whether the gap between oracle-based and distribution-agnostic error bounds in adversarial injection learning is fundamental, proving a matching lower bound for VC dimension 1. It introduces a potential-based framework using robust witnesses and new combinatorial dimensions to achieve improved error bounds for specific classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the open question of whether the gap between oracle-based ($O(d^2 \log T)$) and distribution-agnostic ($\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$) error bounds in adversarial injection learning is fundamental, particularly in the clean-label setting.

Method: The paper introduces a potential-based framework driven by robust witnesses—small subsets of labeled examples that certify predictions. It uses two combinatorial dimensions: inference dimension and a new relaxation called certificate dimension.

Result: They prove a matching $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound for VC dimension 1, confirming the gap is fundamental. For classes of inference dimension $k$, they achieve $\tilde{O}(T^{1-1/k})$ combined error. They also show halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^2$ have certificate dimension 3, yielding $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a sharp separation between oracle-based and distribution-agnostic error bounds, introduces a novel framework for robust learning, and demonstrates its application to halfspaces, overcoming prior limitations.

Abstract: We study online learning in the adversarial injection model introduced by [Goel et al. 2017], where a stream of labeled examples is predominantly drawn i.i.d.\ from an unknown distribution $\mathcal{D}$, but may be interspersed with adversarially chosen instances without the learner knowing which rounds are adversarial. Crucially, labels are always consistent with a fixed target concept (the clean-label setting). The learner is additionally allowed to abstain from predicting, and the total error counts the mistakes whenever the learner decides to predict and incorrect abstentions when it abstains on i.i.d.\ rounds. Perhaps surprisingly, prior work shows that oracle access to the underlying distribution yields $O(d^2 \log T)$ combined error for VC dimension $d$, while distribution-agnostic algorithms achieve only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ for restricted classes, leaving open whether this gap is fundamental.
  We resolve this question by proving a matching $Ω(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound for VC dimension $1$, establishing a sharp separation between the two information regimes. On the algorithmic side, we introduce a potential-based framework driven by \emph{robust witnesses}, small subsets of labeled examples that certify predictions while remaining resilient to adversarial contamination. We instantiate this framework using two combinatorial dimensions: (1) \emph{inference dimension}, yielding combined error $\tilde{O}(T^{1-1/k})$ for classes of inference dimension $k$, and (2) \emph{certificate dimension}, a new relaxation we introduce. As an application, we show that halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^2$ have certificate dimension $3$, obtaining the first distribution-agnostic bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ for this class. This is notable since [Blum et al. 2021] showed halfspaces are not robustly learnable under clean-label attacks without abstention.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) approaches, enabling parallel token generation beyond a rigid left-to-right order. Despite growing empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how unmasking schedules -- which specify the order and size of unmasked tokens during sampling -- affect generation quality remains limited. In this work, we introduce a distribution-agnostic unmasking schedule for DLMs that adapts to the (unknown) dependence structure of the target data distribution, without requiring any prior knowledge or hyperparameter tuning. In contrast to prior deterministic procedures that fix unmasking sizes, our method randomizes the number of tokens revealed at each iteration. We show that, for two specific parameter choices, the sampling convergence guarantees -- measured by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence -- scale as $\widetilde O(\mathsf{TC}/K)$ and $\widetilde O(\mathsf{DTC}/K)$ respectively. Here, $K$ is the number of iterations, and $\mathsf{TC}$ and $\mathsf{DTC}$ are the total correlation and dual total correlation of the target distribution, capturing the intrinsic dependence structure underlying the data. Importantly, our guarantees hold in the practically relevant parallel-sampling regime $K<L$ where $L$ is the token sequence length. These results significantly improve upon prior convergence theories and yield substantial sampling acceleration for low-complexity distributions. Overall, our findings unveil the adaptivity of DLMs to intrinsic data structures and shed light on the benefit of randomized unmasking sizes in inference schedule design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Learning Advantage Distributions (LAD), a framework replacing advantage maximization with learning advantage-induced distributions to enhance reasoning diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL objectives prioritize expected rewards, causing overfitting to dominant signals and limiting diverse reasoning paths.

Method: LAD minimizes $f$-divergence between policy-induced and advantage-induced distributions, avoiding entropy regularization.

Result: LAD recovers multimodal advantage distributions and improves accuracy/diversity in math and code reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: LAD offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for enhancing reasoning diversity without extra training overhead.

Abstract: Current reinforcement learning objectives for large-model reasoning primarily focus on maximizing expected rewards. This paradigm can lead to overfitting to dominant reward signals, while neglecting alternative yet valid reasoning trajectories, thereby limiting diversity and exploration. To address this issue, we introduce Learning Advantage Distributions (LAD), a distribution-matching framework that replaces advantage maximization with learning the advantage-induced distribution. By establishing the equivalence between the optimal policy update and an advantage-based target distribution, we derive a practical LAD objective formulated as minimizing an $f$-divergence between the policy-induced and advantage-induced distributions. This yields a gradient update that increases likelihood for high-advantage responses while suppressing over-confident probability growth, preventing collapse without requiring auxiliary entropy regularization. LAD incurs no extra training cost compared to GRPO and scales naturally to LLM post-training. In a controlled bandit setting, LAD faithfully recovers the multimodal advantage distribution, validating the theoretical formulation. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks across several LLM backbones show that LAD reliably improves both accuracy and generative diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between machine learning and behavioral science by creating interpretable and identifiable optimization structures.

Method: BL uses compositional utility functions built from modular blocks, each representing a utility maximization problem (UMP), and supports hierarchical structures.

Result: BL achieves strong predictive performance, interpretability, and scalability, with theoretical guarantees like universal approximation.

Conclusion: BL is a versatile framework with broad applicability in scientific domains involving optimization, offering interpretability and identifiability.

Abstract: Inspired by behavioral science, we propose Behavior Learning (BL), a novel general-purpose machine learning framework that learns interpretable and identifiable optimization structures from data, ranging from single optimization problems to hierarchical compositions. It unifies predictive performance, intrinsic interpretability, and identifiability, with broad applicability to scientific domains involving optimization. BL parameterizes a compositional utility function built from intrinsically interpretable modular blocks, which induces a data distribution for prediction and generation. Each block represents and can be written in symbolic form as a utility maximization problem (UMP), a foundational paradigm in behavioral science and a universal framework of optimization. BL supports architectures ranging from a single UMP to hierarchical compositions, the latter modeling hierarchical optimization structures. Its smooth and monotone variant (IBL) guarantees identifiability. Theoretically, we establish the universal approximation property of BL, and analyze the M-estimation properties of IBL. Empirically, BL demonstrates strong predictive performance, intrinsic interpretability and scalability to high-dimensional data.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores whether AI should act as a generous host or strict gatekeeper for fairness in hybrid societies, finding that strategic enforcement (Discriminatory AI) outperforms unconditional fairness (Samaritan AI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness in asymmetric social structures (e.g., hiring, regulation) and determine whether AI should enforce fairness or gift it unconditionally.

Method: Uses a bipartite hybrid population model of the Ultimatum Game, separating humans and AI into proposers and receivers. Tests Samaritan AI (unconditional fair proposers/strict receivers) and Discriminatory AI (strategic fair proposers).

Result: Samaritan AI receivers drive fairness more effectively than Samaritan AI proposers. Discriminatory AI outperforms both Samaritan types, sustaining fairness and lowering the critical mass for equity.

Conclusion: Strategic enforcement (Discriminatory AI) is more effective than unconditional fairness for maintaining fairness in hybrid societies.

Abstract: Fairness in hybrid societies hinges on a simple choice: should AI be a generous host or a strict gatekeeper? Moving beyond symmetric models, we show that asymmetric social structures--like those in hiring, regulation, and negotiation--AI that guards fairness outperforms AI that gifts it. We bridge this gap with a bipartite hybrid population model of the Ultimatum Game, separating humans and AI into distinct proposer and receiver groups. We first introduce Samaritan AI agents, which act as either unconditional fair proposers or strict receivers. Our results reveal a striking asymmetry: Samaritan AI receivers drive population-wide fairness far more effectively than Samaritan AI proposers. To overcome the limitations of the Samaritan AI proposer, we design the Discriminatory AI proposer, which predicts co-players' expectations and only offers fair portions to those with high acceptance thresholds. Our results demonstrate that this Discriminatory AI outperforms both types of Samaritan AI, especially in strong selection scenarios. It not only sustains fairness across both populations but also significantly lowers the critical mass of agents required to reach an equitable steady state. By transitioning from unconditional modelling to strategic enforcement, our work provides a pivotal framework for deploying asymmetric AIs in the increasingly hybrid society.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: NutriOrion is a hierarchical multi-agent framework for personalized nutrition intervention in multimorbidity patients, outperforming baselines like GPT-4.1 by reducing drug-food interactions and improving dietary outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized nutrition for multimorbidity patients is complex due to integrating diverse clinical conditions, medications, and dietary guidelines. Existing LLMs struggle with context overload and attention dilution.

Method: NutriOrion uses a parallel-then-sequential reasoning topology with specialized domain agents, multi-objective prioritization, and safety constraints. It maps outputs to ADIME and FHIR R4 standards.

Result: Achieves a 12.1% drug-food interaction violation rate, improves biomarkers (e.g., increases fiber by 167%, potassium by 27%, reduces sodium by 9%), and outperforms GPT-4.1.

Conclusion: NutriOrion effectively addresses challenges in personalized nutrition for multimorbidity patients, ensuring clinical validity and significant dietary improvements.

Abstract: Personalized nutrition intervention for patients with multimorbidity is critical for improving health outcomes, yet remains challenging because it requires the simultaneous integration of heterogeneous clinical conditions, medications, and dietary guidelines. Single-agent large language models (LLMs) often suffer from context overload and attention dilution when processing such high-dimensional patient profiles. We introduce NutriOrion, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with a parallel-then-sequential reasoning topology. NutriOrion decomposes nutrition planning into specialized domain agents with isolated contexts to mitigate anchoring bias, followed by a conditional refinement stage. The framework includes a multi-objective prioritization algorithm to resolve conflicting dietary requirements and a safety constraint mechanism that injects pharmacological contraindications as hard negative constraints during synthesis, ensuring clinical validity by construction rather than post-hoc filtering. For clinical interoperability, NutriOrion maps synthesized insights into the ADIME standard and FHIR R4 resources. Evaluated on 330 stroke patients with multimorbidity, NutriOrion outperforms multiple baselines, including GPT-4.1 and alternative multi-agent architectures. It achieves a 12.1 percent drug-food interaction violation rate, demonstrates strong personalization with negative correlations (-0.26 to -0.35) between patient biomarkers and recommended risk nutrients, and yields clinically meaningful dietary improvements, including a 167 percent increase in fiber and a 27 percent increase in potassium, alongside reductions in sodium (9 percent) and sugars (12 percent).

TL;DR: Coordination is only necessary for non-monotonic tasks, and a significant portion of coordination efforts in organizations may be avoidable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine which tasks truly require coordination and to quantify unnecessary coordination overhead in multi-agent systems and organizational workflows.

Method: Uses a monotonicity criterion from distributed systems theory to classify tasks, applies this to enterprise workflows and occupational tasks from O*NET, and validates through multi-agent simulations.

Result: 74% of enterprise workflows and 42% of O*NET tasks are monotonic, suggesting 24-57% of coordination spending is avoidable.

Conclusion: Organizations can reduce coordination overhead by focusing only on non-monotonic tasks, improving efficiency.

Abstract: Organizations devote substantial resources to coordination, yet which tasks actually require it for correctness remains unclear. The problem is acute in multi-agent AI systems, where coordination overhead is directly measurable and routinely exceeds the cost of the work itself. However, distributed systems theory provides a precise answer: coordination is necessary if and only if a task is non-monotonic, meaning new information can invalidate prior conclusions. Here we show that a classic taxonomy of organizational interdependence maps onto the monotonicity criterion, yielding a decision rule and a measure of avoidable overhead (the Coordination Tax). Multi-agent simulations confirm both predictions. We classify 65 enterprise workflows and find that 48 (74%) are monotonic, then replicate on 13,417 occupational tasks from the O*NET database (42% monotonic). These classification rates imply that 24-57% of coordination spending is unnecessary for correctness.

TL;DR: EDU-MATRIX introduces a society-centric digital twin architecture to address rigid social dynamics in multi-agent simulations, focusing on institutional rules and fluid knowledge synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the Agent-Centric Paradox by shifting focus from individual agents to a dynamic social space with institutional rules and fluid knowledge.

Method: Proposes three components: Environment Context Injection Engine (ECIE), Modular Logic Evolution Protocol (MLEP), and Endogenous Alignment via Role-Topology.

Result: Achieves high dialogue consistency (94.1%) and emergent value-aligned behaviors (Social Clustering Coefficient: 0.72) in a secondary school digital twin.

Conclusion: EDU-MATRIX successfully demonstrates how social gravity and cognitive fluids can create adaptable, value-aligned multi-agent simulations.

Abstract: Existing multi-agent simulations often suffer from the "Agent-Centric Paradox": rules are hard-coded into individual agents, making complex social dynamics rigid and difficult to align with educational values. This paper presents EDU-MATRIX, a society-centric generative cognitive digital twin architecture that shifts the paradigm from simulating "people" to simulating a "social space with a gravitational field." We introduce three architectural contributions: (1) An Environment Context Injection Engine (ECIE), which acts as a "social microkernel," dynamically injecting institutional rules (Gravity) into agents based on their spatial-temporal coordinates; (2) A Modular Logic Evolution Protocol (MLEP), where knowledge exists as "fluid" capsules that agents synthesize to generate new paradigms, ensuring high dialogue consistency (94.1%); and (3) Endogenous Alignment via Role-Topology, where safety constraints emerge from the agent's position in the social graph rather than external filters. Deployed as a digital twin of a secondary school with 2,400 agents, the system demonstrates how "social gravity" (rules) and "cognitive fluids" (knowledge) interact to produce emergent, value-aligned behaviors (Social Clustering Coefficient: 0.72).

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: ACAL is a neuro-symbolic framework combining adaptive multi-agent collaboration with A-QBAF to improve legal reasoning by ensuring structured, verifiable, and contestable arguments, outperforming existing LLM approaches like CoT and RAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches like CoT and RAG lack structured, verifiable explanations for legal reasoning. ACAL aims to address this by integrating formal verification and human intervention.

Method: ACAL uses adaptive multi-agent collaboration, A-QBAF for argumentation, clash resolution, and uncertainty-aware escalation. It includes a Human-in-the-Loop workflow for user intervention.

Result: ACAL outperforms baselines on the LegalBench benchmark, balancing predictive performance with transparency and contestability.

Conclusion: ACAL provides a robust framework for legal reasoning, enhancing verifiability and user contestability compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires not only high accuracy but also the ability to justify decisions through verifiable and contestable arguments. However, existing Large Language Model (LLM) approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), often produce unstructured explanations that lack a formal mechanism for verification or user intervention. To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive Collaboration of Argumentative LLMs (ACAL), a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates adaptive multi-agent collaboration with an Arena-based Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (A-QBAF). ACAL dynamically deploys expert agent teams to construct arguments, employs a clash resolution mechanism to adjudicate conflicting claims, and utilizes uncertainty-aware escalation for borderline cases. Crucially, our framework supports a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) contestability workflow, enabling users to directly audit and modify the underlying reasoning graph to influence the final judgment. Empirical evaluations on the LegalBench benchmark demonstrate that ACAL outperforms strong baselines across Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite and Gemini-2.5-Flash architectures, effectively balancing efficient predictive performance with structured transparency and contestability. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/loc110504/ACAL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify multi-agent learning by converting complex games into potential games, which have desirable properties for stability and convergence.

Method: The proposed algorithm 'potentializes' normal-form games by assigning surrogate rewards, making them admit ordinal potential functions. Numerical simulations use replicator dynamics to test convergence.

Result: Results show that 'potentialization' ensures stable agent behavior convergence, as demonstrated by replicator dynamics simulations.

Conclusion: The algorithm successfully transforms games into potential games, facilitating efficient multi-agent learning with guaranteed stable outcomes.

Abstract: We investigate an algorithm that assigns to any game in normal form an approximating game that admits an ordinal potential function. Due to the properties of potential games, the algorithm equips every game with a surrogate reward structure that allows efficient multi-agent learning. Numerical simulations using the replicator dynamics show that 'potentialization' guarantees convergence to stable agent behavior.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs for repeated strategic interactions by embedding smooth Fictitious Play principles into inference, enabling online adaptation without parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in LLM applications for repeated and strategic interactions with dynamic opponents.

Method: Combines offline opponent modeling (smooth Fictitious Play) with inference-time adaptation via best-of-N sampling.

Result: Significant performance improvement over baselines in repeated negotiation games.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable, principled approach for LLMs in strategic decision-making without requiring parameter updates.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful decision-makers across a wide range of single-agent and stationary environments, fewer efforts have been devoted to settings where LLMs must engage in \emph{repeated} and \emph{strategic} interactions with unknown or dynamic opponents. In such settings, recipes built upon \emph{offline} pre-training or fine-tuning, though robust against worst-case adversaries, do not fully exploit the capability of LLMs to adapt \emph{online} based on interaction feedback. Instead, we explore the more natural perspective of scaling inference-time computation as a mechanism for adaptation, embedding the principles of a classical game-theoretical learning dynamic, \emph{smooth Fictitious Play (sFP)}, into LLM inference: (i) for belief formation, we employ an auxiliary opponent model that in-context learns to imitate the time-averaged behavior of the opponent; (ii) for best response, we advance best-of-$N$ (BoN) sampling by simulating against the opponent model. Empirical evaluations on two distinct forms of repeated negotiation games demonstrate that our method enables significant performance improvement over repeated online interaction compared to various baselines, offering a scalable and principled approach to repeated strategic decision-making without any parameter updates.

### [434] [Effects of Property Recovery Incentives and Social Interaction on Self-Evacuation Decisions in Natural Disasters: An Agent-Based Modelling Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19639)
*Made Krisnanda,Raymond Chiong,Yang Yang,Kirill Glavatskiy*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The study explores how household agents' evacuation decisions are influenced by social interactions and government incentives, using an agent-based model and evolutionary game theory. It finds optimal levels of government support and highlights the role of social network structure and 'community influencers' in collective evacuation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding evacuation decision-making is crucial for disaster mitigation. This research aims to uncover how social interactions and government incentives affect self-evacuation decisions to inform better policy design.

Method: An agent-based model simulates household agents' evacuation decisions within an evolutionary game theory framework, testing four scenarios of government incentive prioritisation.

Result: The impact of incentives diminishes with increased funding or prioritisation, suggesting an optimal support level. Evacuation rates depend on social network structure, with 'community influencers' boosting rates and low-connectivity agents hindering collective action.

Conclusion: Social connectivity and strategic prioritisation of 'community influencers' are key to effective evacuation policies. The findings help optimise government incentives under resource constraints.

Abstract: Understanding evacuation decision-making behaviour is one of the key components for designing disaster mitigation policies. This study investigates how communications between household agents in a community influence self-evacuation decisions. We develop an agent-based model that simulates household agents' decisions to evacuate or stay. These agents interact within the framework of evolutionary game theory, effectively competing for limited shared resources, which include property recovery funds and coordination services. We explore four scenarios that model different prioritisations of access to government-provided incentives. We discover that the impact of the incentive diminishes both with increasing funding value and the household agent prioritisation, indicating that there is an optimal level of government support beyond which further increases become impractical. Furthermore, the overall evacuation rate depends on the structure of the underlying social network, showing discontinuous jumps when the prioritisation moves across the node degree. We identify the so-called "community influencers", prioritisation of whom significantly increases the overall evacuation rate. In contrast, prioritising household agents with low connectivity may actually impede collective evacuation. These findings demonstrate the importance of social connectivity between household agents. The results of this study are useful for designing optimal government policies to incentivise and prioritise community evacuation under limited resources.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: DG-PG reduces gradient variance in MARL by using noise-free guidance from differentiable models, achieving scale-invariant sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-agent noise in MARL grows with the number of agents, limiting scalability. Domains like cloud computing have differentiable models that can guide agents efficiently.

Method: Proposes Descent-Guided Policy Gradient (DG-PG), which uses analytical models to provide noise-free gradients, decoupling agent updates.

Result: DG-PG reduces gradient variance from Θ(N) to O(1), achieves agent-independent sample complexity, and scales effectively in tests (N=5 to N=200).

Conclusion: DG-PG demonstrates superior scalability and convergence compared to MAPPO and IPPO, validating its theoretical benefits.

Abstract: Scaling cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is fundamentally limited by cross-agent noise: when agents share a common reward, the actions of all $N$ agents jointly determine each agent's learning signal, so cross-agent noise grows with $N$. In the policy gradient setting, per-agent gradient estimate variance scales as $Θ(N)$, yielding sample complexity $\mathcal{O}(N/ε)$. We observe that many domains -- cloud computing, transportation, power systems -- have differentiable analytical models that prescribe efficient system states. In this work, we propose Descent-Guided Policy Gradient (DG-PG), a framework that constructs noise-free per-agent guidance gradients from these analytical models, decoupling each agent's gradient from the actions of all others. We prove that DG-PG reduces gradient variance from $Θ(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, preserves the equilibria of the cooperative game, and achieves agent-independent sample complexity $\mathcal{O}(1/ε)$. On a heterogeneous cloud scheduling task with up to 200 agents, DG-PG converges within 10 episodes at every tested scale -- from $N=5$ to $N=200$ -- directly confirming the predicted scale-invariant complexity, while MAPPO and IPPO fail to converge under identical architectures.

### [436] [On the Dynamics of Observation and Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18494)
*Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques the static view of semantics in visual intelligence, proposing instead that intelligence is tied to bounded agents interacting with environments. It introduces a theoretical framework (Observation Semantics Fiber Bundle) and derives limits on semantic complexity, arguing for symbolic structure as a necessity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the static semantics paradigm in visual intelligence by grounding meaning in the physical constraints of bounded agents (finite memory, compute, energy) interacting with high entropy environments.

Method: Proposes the Observation Semantics Fiber Bundle framework, applies Landauer's Principle to derive limits (Semantic Constant B) on information processing, and demonstrates the necessity of symbolic structure via phase transitions.

Result: Shows that semantic manifolds must crystallize into discrete, compositional forms (symbols) to avoid thermal collapse, making language and logic ontological necessities rather than cultural artifacts.

Conclusion: Understanding emerges from constructing causally compressed representations, not recovering latent variables, highlighting the role of physical constraints in shaping semantic structure.

Abstract: A dominant paradigm in visual intelligence treats semantics as a static property of latent representations, assuming that meaning can be discovered through geometric proximity in high dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we argue that this view is physically incomplete. We propose that intelligence is not a passive mirror of reality but a property of a physically realizable agent, a system bounded by finite memory, finite compute, and finite energy interacting with a high entropy environment. We formalize this interaction through the kinematic structure of an Observation Semantics Fiber Bundle, where raw sensory observation data (the fiber) is projected onto a low entropy causal semantic manifold (the base). We prove that for any bounded agent, the thermodynamic cost of information processing (Landauer's Principle) imposes a strict limit on the complexity of internal state transitions. We term this limit the Semantic Constant B. From these physical constraints, we derive the necessity of symbolic structure. We show that to model a combinatorial world within the bound B, the semantic manifold must undergo a phase transition, it must crystallize into a discrete, compositional, and factorized form. Thus, language and logic are not cultural artifacts but ontological necessities the solid state of information required to prevent thermal collapse. We conclude that understanding is not the recovery of a hidden latent variable, but the construction of a causal quotient that renders the world algorithmically compressible and causally predictable.

### [437] [Hierarchical Reward Design from Language: Enhancing Alignment of Agent Behavior with Human Specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18582)
*Zhiqin Qian,Ryan Diaz,Sangwon Seo,Vaibhav Unhelkar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HRDL and L2HR improve AI task alignment with human preferences by translating nuanced behavioral specifications into hierarchical rewards for RL agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning AI behavior with human expectations in complex tasks is crucial for responsible AI deployment. Existing reward design methods lack nuance for long-horizon tasks.

Method: Introduces HRDL for richer behavioral specifications and L2HR to translate language into hierarchical rewards for RL agents.

Result: AI agents trained with L2HR-designed rewards effectively complete tasks while better adhering to human specifications.

Conclusion: HRDL and L2HR advance human-aligned AI research by improving reward design for nuanced behavioral alignment.

Abstract: When training artificial intelligence (AI) to perform tasks, humans often care not only about whether a task is completed but also how it is performed. As AI agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, aligning their behavior with human-provided specifications becomes critical for responsible AI deployment. Reward design provides a direct channel for such alignment by translating human expectations into reward functions that guide reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing methods are often too limited to capture nuanced human preferences that arise in long-horizon tasks. Hence, we introduce Hierarchical Reward Design from Language (HRDL): a problem formulation that extends classical reward design to encode richer behavioral specifications for hierarchical RL agents. We further propose Language to Hierarchical Rewards (L2HR) as a solution to HRDL. Experiments show that AI agents trained with rewards designed via L2HR not only complete tasks effectively but also better adhere to human specifications. Together, HRDL and L2HR advance the research on human-aligned AI agents.

*Michal Töpfer,František Plášil,Tomáš Bureš,Petr Hnětynka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs and vibe coding feedback loops to generate Adaptation Managers (AMs) in CAS, with verification based on precise FCL constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of dynamic system architecture and behavior changes in CAS adaptation by leveraging generative LLMs and vibe coding feedback loops.

Method: Generates AM code via LLMs using system specs and desired behavior, verified through iterative testing with vibe coding feedback loops and FCL constraints.

Result: Achieved good results in generating AMs for CAS systems, requiring few feedback iterations with detailed constraint violation reports.

Conclusion: Generating AMs via vibe coding feedback loops is viable when supported by precise FCL constraints, enabling efficient CAS adaptation.

Abstract: In CAS adaptation, a challenge is to define the dynamic architecture of the system and changes in its behavior. Implementation-wise, this is projected into an adaptation mechanism, typically realized as an Adaptation Manager (AM). With the advances of generative LLMs, generating AM code based on system specification and desired AM behavior (partially in natural language) is a tempting opportunity. The recent introduction of vibe coding suggests a way to target the problem of the correctness of generated code by iterative testing and vibe coding feedback loops instead of direct code inspection.
  In this paper, we show that generating an AM via vibe coding feedback loops is a viable option when the verification of the generated AM is based on a very precise formulation of the functional requirements. We specify these as constraints in a novel temporal logic FCL that allows us to express the behavior of traces with much finer granularity than classical LTL enables.
  Furthermore, we show that by combining the adaptation and vibe coding feedback loops where the FCL constraints are evaluated for the current system state, we achieved good results in the experiments with generating AMs for two example systems from the CAS domain. Typically, just a few feedback loop iterations were necessary, each feeding the LLM with reports describing detailed violations of the constraints. This AM testing was combined with high run path coverage achieved by different initial settings.

TL;DR: GEARS reframes ranking optimization as an autonomous process, using reusable agent skills to encapsulate expert knowledge and ensure production reliability through validation hooks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the bottleneck of translating ambiguous product intent into viable hypotheses in large-scale ranking systems, emphasizing the need for streamlined and reliable optimization.

Method: GEARS employs Specialized Agent Skills to encapsulate ranking expertise into reusable reasoning capabilities and incorporates validation hooks for statistical robustness.

Result: GEARS identifies near-Pareto-efficient policies by combining algorithmic signals with ranking context, achieving superior performance and deployment stability.

Conclusion: GEARS offers a scalable and reliable framework for ranking optimization, bridging the gap between product intent and execution while maintaining robustness.

Abstract: Modern large-scale ranking systems operate within a sophisticated landscape of competing objectives, operational constraints, and evolving product requirements. Progress in this domain is increasingly bottlenecked by the engineering context constraint: the arduous process of translating ambiguous product intent into reasonable, executable, verifiable hypotheses, rather than by modeling techniques alone. We present GEARS (Generative Engine for Agentic Ranking Systems), a framework that reframes ranking optimization as an autonomous discovery process within a programmable experimentation environment. Rather than treating optimization as static model selection, GEARS leverages Specialized Agent Skills to encapsulate ranking expert knowledge into reusable reasoning capabilities, enabling operators to steer systems via high-level intent vibe personalization. Furthermore, to ensure production reliability, the framework incorporates validation hooks to enforce statistical robustness and filter out brittle policies that overfit short-term signals. Experimental validation across diverse product surfaces demonstrates that GEARS consistently identifies superior, near-Pareto-efficient policies by synergizing algorithmic signals with deep ranking context while maintaining rigorous deployment stability.

### [440] [Spilled Energy in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18671)
*Adrian Robert Minut,Hazem Dewidar,Iacopo Masi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets LLM softmax classifiers as EBMs to detect errors and biases during decoding using training-free metrics—spilled and marginalized energy—showing strong hallucination detection across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To track and localize factual errors, biases, and hallucinations in LLMs without requiring additional training or probes.

Method: Decomposes sequence-to-sequence probability chains into EBMs, introducing spilled energy (discrepancy across steps) and marginalized energy (single-step measure).

Result: Demonstrates robust hallucination detection on nine benchmarks and synthetic tasks, applicable to pretrained and instruction-tuned LLMs.

Conclusion: Training-free energy-based metrics effectively detect hallucinations and generalize across tasks and models.

Abstract: We reinterpret the final Large Language Model (LLM) softmax classifier as an Energy-Based Model (EBM), decomposing the sequence-to-sequence probability chain into multiple interacting EBMs at inference. This principled approach allows us to track "energy spills" during decoding, which we empirically show correlate with factual errors, biases, and failures. Similar to Orgad et al. (2025), our method localizes the exact answer token and subsequently tests for hallucinations. Crucially, however, we achieve this without requiring trained probe classifiers or activation ablations. Instead, we introduce two completely training-free metrics derived directly from output logits: spilled energy, which captures the discrepancy between energy values across consecutive generation steps that should theoretically match, and marginalized energy, which is measurable at a single step. Evaluated on nine benchmarks across state-of-the-art LLMs (including LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma) and on synthetic algebraic operations (Qwen3), our approach demonstrates robust, competitive hallucination detection and cross-task generalization. Notably, these results hold for both pretrained and instruction-tuned variants without introducing any training overhead.

*Martin Bertran,Riccardo Fogliato,Zhiwei Steven Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI analysts using LLMs can autonomously produce diverse analytical results, mimicking human variability in research outcomes, with steerable effects based on model and persona choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of transparency in empirical research decisions and the impracticality of large-scale human many-analyst studies.

Method: Autonomous AI analysts test hypotheses on fixed datasets using varied LLMs and prompts, with an AI auditor ensuring methodological validity.

Result: AI analysts show wide variability in effect sizes, p-values, and hypothesis support decisions, influenced by LLM and persona choices.

Conclusion: AI analysts can cheaply and scalably replicate structured analytic diversity, with outcomes steerable by adjusting model and persona parameters.

Abstract: The conclusions of empirical research depend not only on data but on a sequence of analytic decisions that published results seldom make explicit. Past ``many-analyst" studies have demonstrated this: independent teams testing the same hypothesis on the same dataset regularly reach conflicting conclusions. But such studies require months of coordination among dozens of research groups and are therefore rarely conducted. In this work, we show that fully autonomous AI analysts built on large language models (LLMs) can reproduce a similar structured analytic diversity cheaply and at scale. We task these AI analysts with testing a pre-specified hypothesis on a fixed dataset, varying the underlying model and prompt framing across replicate runs. Each AI analyst independently constructs and executes a full analysis pipeline; an AI auditor then screens each run for methodological validity. Across three datasets spanning experimental and observational designs, AI analyst-produced analyses display wide dispersion in effect sizes, $p$-values, and binary decisions on supporting the hypothesis or not, frequently reversing whether a hypothesis is judged supported. This dispersion is structured: recognizable analytic choices in preprocessing, model specification, and inference differ systematically across LLM and persona conditions. Critically, the effects are \emph{steerable}: reassigning the analyst persona or LLM shifts the distribution of outcomes even after excluding methodologically deficient runs.

TL;DR: TEB is a Task-aware Exploration method for visual reinforcement learning that uses a predictive bisimulation metric to enhance exploration under sparse rewards, outperforming recent baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of exploration in visual reinforcement learning under sparse rewards, where task-irrelevant variations hinder performance, by integrating task-aware strategies.

Method: TEB combines task-relevant representations with exploration using a predictive bisimulation metric, including a reward differential to prevent collapse and potential-based bonuses for novelty measurement.

Result: TEB demonstrates superior exploration ability in experiments on MetaWorld and Maze2D, outperforming recent baselines.

Conclusion: TEB effectively bridges the gap in visual reinforcement learning by coupling exploration with task-aware representations, proving robust under sparse rewards.

Abstract: Accelerating exploration in visual reinforcement learning under sparse rewards remains challenging due to the substantial task-irrelevant variations. Despite advances in intrinsic exploration, many methods either assume access to low-dimensional states or lack task-aware exploration strategies, thereby rendering them fragile in visual domains. To bridge this gap, we present TEB, a Task-aware Exploration approach that tightly couples task-relevant representations with exploration through a predictive Bisimulation metric. Specifically, TEB leverages the metric not only to learn behaviorally grounded task representations but also to measure behaviorally intrinsic novelty over the learned latent space. To realize this, we first theoretically mitigate the representation collapse of degenerate bisimulation metrics under sparse rewards by internally introducing a simple but effective predicted reward differential. Building on this robust metric, we design potential-based exploration bonuses, which measure the relative novelty of adjacent observations over the latent space. Extensive experiments on MetaWorld and Maze2D show that TEB achieves superior exploration ability and outperforms recent baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban energy systems need scalable solutions like MARL for smart cities, but lack reliable benchmarking methods.

Method: Uses CityLearn for simulation, compares MARL algorithms (PPO, SAC) with DTDE and CTDE schemes, and introduces novel KPIs.

Result: DTDE outperforms CTDE in performance metrics; temporal learning improves battery sustainability and resilience.

Conclusion: The study sets a new MARL benchmarking standard, highlighting DTDE's effectiveness and proposing actionable KPIs for real-world energy management.

Abstract: The optimization of urban energy systems is crucial for the advancement of sustainable and resilient smart cities, which are becoming increasingly complex with multiple decision-making units. To address scalability and coordination concerns, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a promising solution. This paper addresses the imperative need for comprehensive and reliable benchmarking of MARL algorithms on energy management tasks. CityLearn is used as a case study environment because it realistically simulates urban energy systems, incorporates multiple storage systems, and utilizes renewable energy sources. By doing so, our work sets a new standard for evaluation, conducting a comparative study across multiple key performance indicators (KPIs). This approach illuminates the key strengths and weaknesses of various algorithms, moving beyond traditional KPI averaging which often masks critical insights. Our experiments utilize widely accepted baselines such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC), and encompass diverse training schemes including Decentralized Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) and Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) approaches and different neural network architectures. Our work also proposes novel KPIs that tackle real world implementation challenges such as individual building contribution and battery storage lifetime. Our findings show that DTDE consistently outperforms CTDE in both average and worst-case performance. Additionally, temporal dependency learning improved control on memory dependent KPIs such as ramping and battery usage, contributing to more sustainable battery operation. Results also reveal robustness to agent or resource removal, highlighting both the resilience and decentralizability of the learned policies.

Conclusion: Effective solution for insightful chart summarization, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: Chart summarization is crucial for enhancing data accessibility and the efficient consumption of information. However, existing methods, including those with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focus on low-level data descriptions and often fail to capture the deeper insights which are the fundamental purpose of data visualization. To address this challenge, we propose Chart Insight Agent Flow, a plan-and-execute multi-agent framework effectively leveraging the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to uncover profound insights directly from chart images. Furthermore, to overcome the lack of suitable benchmarks, we introduce ChartSummInsights, a new dataset featuring a diverse collection of real-world charts paired with high-quality, insightful summaries authored by human data analysis experts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of MLLMs on the chart summarization task, producing summaries with deep and diverse insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to address bidirectional model learnability gaps and domain-agnostic reasoning transfer in federated LLM-SLM collaborations.

Method: LaDa introduces a learnability-aware data filter for adaptive allocation and domain-adaptive reasoning distillation via contrastive learning.

Result: LaDa facilitates effective bidirectional knowledge transfer and enables SLMs to capture reasoning patterns under local data.

Conclusion: LaDa serves as a plug-in module for existing frameworks, enhancing collaboration by adapting to model learnability gaps.

Abstract: Data allocation plays a critical role in federated large language model (LLM) and small language models (SLMs) reasoning collaboration. Nevertheless, existing data allocation methods fail to address an under-explored challenge in collaboration: bidirectional model learnability gap, where client-side SLMs cannot identify high-reward samples matching their learnability constraints for effective knowledge transfer from LLMs, while LLMs struggle to select samples contributing novel knowledge beyond their existing data. Furthermore, these collaboration frameworks face another key challenge: domain-agnostic reasoning transfer, where existing reasoning transfer methods fail to flexibly adapt to the local domain data, preventing SLMs from effectively acquiring step-by-step reasoning abilities within from general LLM. To address these challenges, we propose LaDa, a federated reasoning distillation framework with model learnability-aware data allocation. It introduces a model learnability-aware data filter that adaptively allocates high-reward samples based on the learnability gap between each SLM and LLM pair, effectively facilitating bidirectional knowledge transfer. We further design a domain adaptive reasoning distillation method that aligns joint probabilities of reasoning paths on filtered high-reward samples through contrastive distillation learning between SLM and LLM, enabling SLM to capture underlying reasoning patterns under local data distribution. LaDa operates as a plug-in module for existing collaboration frameworks, adapting knowledge transfer based on model learnability gaps.

Motivation: To unify and improve schema-guided LLM-agent interactions by analyzing SGD and MCP.

Method: Analyzes SGD and MCP to extract foundational schema design principles and insights.

Result: Five principles for schema design and three novel insights for scalable governance.

Conclusion: Schema-driven governance is scalable for AI oversight, with practical design patterns provided.

Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental convergence: Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) represent two manifestations of a unified paradigm for deterministic, auditable LLM-agent interaction. SGD, designed for dialogue-based API discovery (2019), and MCP, now the de facto standard for LLM-tool integration, share the same core insight -- that schemas can encode not just tool signatures but operational constraints and reasoning guidance. By analyzing this convergence, we extract five foundational principles for schema design: (1) Semantic Completeness over Syntactic Precision, (2) Explicit Action Boundaries, (3) Failure Mode Documentation, (4) Progressive Disclosure Compatibility, and (5) Inter-Tool Relationship Declaration. These principles reveal three novel insights: first, SGD's original design was fundamentally sound and should be inherited by MCP; second, both frameworks leave failure modes and inter-tool relationships unexploited -- gaps we identify and resolve; third, progressive disclosure emerges as a critical production-scaling insight under real-world token constraints. We provide concrete design patterns for each principle. These principles position schema-driven governance as a scalable mechanism for AI system oversight without requiring proprietary system inspection -- central to Software 3.0.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of coarse-grained text-image diagnostic methods by leveraging molecularly validated pathology data and spatial transcriptomics for precise analysis.

Method: Uses a bottom-up architecture with domain-adaptive tools, clustered into agents and coordinated hierarchically. Introduces Atomic Execution Nodes (AENs) for reliable trajectory construction and trajectory-aware fine-tuning for robust decision-making.

Result: Enhances inference robustness and adaptive tool use in pathology understanding.

Conclusion: LAMMI-Pathology provides a scalable and precise framework for molecularly informed pathology analysis.

Abstract: The emergence of tool-calling-based agent systems introduces a more evidence-driven paradigm for pathology image analysis in contrast to the coarse-grained text-image diagnostic approaches. With the recent large-scale experimental adoption of spatial transcriptomics technologies, molecularly validated pathological diagnosis is becoming increasingly open and accessible. In this work, we propose LAMMI-Pathology (LVLM-Agent System for Molecularly Informed Medical Intelligence in Pathology), a scalable agent framework for domain-specific agent tool-calling. LAMMI-Pathology adopts a tool-centric, bottom-up architecture in which customized domain-adaptive tools serve as the foundation. These tools are clustered by domain style to form component agents, which are then coordinated through a top-level planner hierarchically, avoiding excessively long context lengths that could induce task drift. Based on that, we introduce a novel trajectory construction mechanism based on Atomic Execution Nodes (AENs), which serve as reliable and composable units for building semi-simulated reasoning trajectories that capture credible agent-tool interactions. Building on this foundation, we develop a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy that aligns the planner's decision-making process with these multi-step reasoning trajectories, thereby enhancing inference robustness in pathology understanding and its adaptive use of the customized toolset.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing path planning in complex environments by leveraging generative models for better understanding and solution generation.

Method: Proposes GenPlanner with variants DiffPlanner and FlowPlanner, using multi-channel conditioning and iterative noise-to-solution transformation.

Result: Outperforms baseline CNN; FlowPlanner excels with limited generation steps.

Conclusion: Generative models like GenPlanner are effective for path planning, offering superior performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: Path planning in complex environments is one of the key problems of artificial intelligence because it requires simultaneous understanding of the geometry of space and the global structure of the problem. In this paper, we explore the potential of using generative models as planning and reasoning mechanisms. We propose GenPlanner, an approach based on diffusion models and flow matching, along with two variants: DiffPlanner and FlowPlanner. We demonstrate the application of generative models to find and generate correct paths in mazes. A multi-channel condition describing the structure of the environment, including an obstacle map and information about the starting and destination points, is used to condition trajectory generation. Unlike standard methods, our models generate trajectories iteratively, starting with random noise and gradually transforming it into a correct solution. Experiments conducted show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the baseline CNN model. In particular, FlowPlanner demonstrates high performance even with a limited number of generation steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with temporal and procedural visual data due to insufficient training data, limiting real-world AI applications.

Method: Introduces TPRU dataset for temporal reasoning tasks (Temporal Reordering, Next-Frame Prediction, Previous-Frame Review) and uses RL fine-tuning for efficiency.

Result: TPRU-7B accuracy improves from 50.33% to 75.70% on TPRU-Test, outperforming larger models like GPT-4o, with generalized benchmark improvements.

Conclusion: TPRU successfully bridges the temporal reasoning gap in MLLMs, enabling better performance in embodied AI scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly smaller, deployable variants, exhibit a critical deficiency in understanding temporal and procedural visual data, a bottleneck hindering their application in real-world embodied AI. This gap is largely caused by a systemic failure in training paradigms, which lack large-scale, procedurally coherent data. To address this problem, we introduce TPRU, a large-scale dataset sourced from diverse embodied scenarios such as robotic manipulation and GUI navigation. TPRU is systematically designed to cultivate temporal reasoning through three complementary tasks: Temporal Reordering, Next-Frame Prediction, and Previous-Frame Review. A key feature is the inclusion of challenging negative samples, compelling models to transition from passive observation to active, cross-modal validation. We leverage TPRU with a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methodology, specifically targeting the enhancement of resource-efficient models. Experiments show our approach yields dramatic gains: on our manually curated TPRU-Test, the accuracy of TPRU-7B soars from 50.33\% to 75.70\%, a state-of-the-art result that significantly outperforms vastly larger baselines, including GPT-4o. Crucially, these capabilities generalize effectively, demonstrating substantial improvements on established benchmarks. The codebase is available at https://github.com/Stephen-gzk/TPRU/ .

### [450] [Early Evidence of Vibe-Proving with Consumer LLMs: A Case Study on Spectral Region Characterization with ChatGPT-5.2 (Thinking)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18918)
*Brecht Verbeken,Brando Vagenende,Marie-Anne Guerry,Andres Algaba,Vincent Ginis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of LLMs like ChatGPT-5.2 in mathematical research, specifically resolving Conjecture 20 through an iterative workflow, highlighting their utility in proof search but noting human expertise is still crucial for correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of LLMs as research copilots in advanced mathematics, especially for individual researchers, by testing their role in resolving a specific conjecture.

Method: The study uses an iterative generate-referee-repair pipeline with ChatGPT-5.2, analyzing seven shareable threads and four proof drafts to document LLM assistance in proof construction.

Result: The LLM was useful for high-level proof search but required human verification for correctness. The conjecture was resolved with necessary and sufficient conditions and boundary constructions.

Conclusion: LLMs can assist in mathematical research workflows, particularly in proof generation, but human oversight remains critical for verification and final correctness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as scientific copilots, but evidence on their role in research-level mathematics remains limited, especially for workflows accessible to individual researchers. We present early evidence for vibe-proving with a consumer subscription LLM through an auditable case study that resolves Conjecture 20 of Ran and Teng (2024) on the exact nonreal spectral region of a 4-cycle row-stochastic nonnegative matrix family. We analyze seven shareable ChatGPT-5.2 (Thinking) threads and four versioned proof drafts, documenting an iterative pipeline of generate, referee, and repair. The model is most useful for high-level proof search, while human experts remain essential for correctness-critical closure. The final theorem provides necessary and sufficient region conditions and explicit boundary attainment constructions. Beyond the mathematical result, we contribute a process-level characterization of where LLM assistance materially helps and where verification bottlenecks persist, with implications for evaluation of AI-assisted research workflows and for designing human-in-the-loop theorem proving systems.

### [451] [DREAM: Deep Research Evaluation with Agentic Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18940)
*Elad Ben Avraham,Changhao Li,Ron Dorfman,Roy Ganz,Oren Nuriel,Amir Dudai,Aviad Aberdam,Noah Flynn,Elman Mansimov,Adi Kalyanpur,Ron Litman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DREAM addresses the challenge of evaluating Deep Research Agents by introducing agentic metrics and tool-use capabilities, improving sensitivity to factual and temporal accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating Deep Research Agents is difficult due to lack of ground truth and multidimensional quality, with existing benchmarks masking flaws through surface-level fluency.

Method: DREAM introduces agentic metrics via tool-calling agents, combining query-agnostic metrics with adaptive metrics for grounded verification and systematic reasoning probes.

Result: DREAM outperforms existing benchmarks in detecting factual and temporal decay, providing scalable, reference-free evaluation.

Conclusion: DREAM offers a robust framework for evaluating research agents by aligning evaluation capabilities with agentic requirements.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents generate analyst-grade reports, yet evaluating them remains challenging due to the absence of a single ground truth and the multidimensional nature of research quality. Recent benchmarks propose distinct methodologies, yet they suffer from the Mirage of Synthesis, where strong surface-level fluency and citation alignment can obscure underlying factual and reasoning defects. We characterize this gap by introducing a taxonomy across four verticals that exposes a critical capability mismatch: static evaluators inherently lack the tool-use capabilities required to assess temporal validity and factual correctness. To address this, we propose DREAM (Deep Research Evaluation with Agentic Metrics), a framework that instantiates the principle of capability parity by making evaluation itself agentic. DREAM structures assessment through an evaluation protocol combining query-agnostic metrics with adaptive metrics generated by a tool-calling agent, enabling temporally aware coverage, grounded verification, and systematic reasoning probes. Controlled evaluations demonstrate DREAM is significantly more sensitive to factual and temporal decay than existing benchmarks, offering a scalable, reference-free evaluation paradigm.

### [452] [High Dimensional Procedural Content Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18943)
*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces High-Dimensional PCG (HDPCG), a framework treating gameplay mechanics equally with geometry in procedural content generation, validated through experiments and case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PCG methods prioritize geometry over gameplay mechanics, limiting controllability and expressivity. HDPCG aims to integrate gameplay dimensions as first-class elements.

Method: HDPCG is implemented via Direction-Space (4D validation for mechanics like gravity inversion) and Direction-Time (temporal dynamics). Three algorithms per direction follow a shared pipeline.

Result: Experiments confirm HDPCG's effectiveness in playability, structure, style, robustness, and efficiency, supported by Unity-based case studies.

Conclusion: HDPCG advocates for broader PCG approaches, emphasizing gameplay dimensions to enable controllable, verifiable, and extensible level generation.

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has made substantial progress in shaping static 2D/3D geometry, while most methods treat gameplay mechanics as auxiliary and optimize only over space. We argue that this limits controllability and expressivity, and formally introduce High-Dimensional PCG (HDPCG): a framework that elevates non-geometric gameplay dimensions to first-class coordinates of a joint state space. We instantiate HDPCG along two concrete directions. Direction-Space augments geometry with a discrete layer dimension and validates reachability in 4D (x,y,z,l), enabling unified treatment of 2.5D/3.5D mechanics such as gravity inversion and parallel-world switching. Direction-Time augments geometry with temporal dynamics via time-expanded graphs, capturing action semantics and conflict rules. For each direction, we present three general, practicable algorithms with a shared pipeline of abstract skeleton generation, controlled grounding, high-dimensional validation, and multi-metric evaluation. Large-scale experiments across diverse settings validate the integrity of our problem formulation and the effectiveness of our methods on playability, structure, style, robustness, and efficiency. Beyond quantitative results, Unity-based case studies recreate playable scenarios that accord with our metrics. We hope HDPCG encourages a shift in PCG toward general representations and the generation of gameplay-relevant dimensions beyond geometry, paving the way for controllable, verifiable, and extensible level generation.

### [453] [(Perlin) Noise as AI coordinator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18947)
*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using continuous noise fields (like Perlin noise) to coordinate large-scale AI control in games, balancing natural behavior and global variety without mechanical synchrony or uncorrelated noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern games struggle to achieve smooth, natural behavior and coordinated variety in nonplayer agents; existing methods (handcrafted rules or stochastic triggers) often fail to balance these goals.

Method: A three-layered framework combines agent-level behavior parameterization, action time scheduling, and spawn/event generation, using continuous noise fields (e.g., Perlin noise) as an AI coordinator.

Result: Experiments show the framework provides stable activation, spatial coverage, diversity with controllable polarization, and competitive runtime, outperforming random, deterministic, and physics-inspired baselines.

Conclusion: Coordinated noise fields offer a practical solution for game AI, balancing efficiency, controllability, and quality, and should be explored further.

Abstract: Large scale control of nonplayer agents is central to modern games, while production systems still struggle to balance several competing goals: locally smooth, natural behavior, and globally coordinated variety across space and time. Prior approaches rely on handcrafted rules or purely stochastic triggers, which either converge to mechanical synchrony or devolve into uncorrelated noise that is hard to tune. Continuous noise signals such as Perlin noise are well suited to this gap because they provide spatially and temporally coherent randomness, and they are already widely used for terrain, biomes, and other procedural assets. We adapt these signals for the first time to large scale AI control and present a general framework that treats continuous noise fields as an AI coordinator. The framework combines three layers of control: behavior parameterization for movement at the agent level, action time scheduling for when behaviors start and stop, and spawn or event type and feature generation for what appears and where. We instantiate the framework reproducibly and evaluate Perlin noise as a representative coordinator across multiple maps, scales, and seeds against random, filtered, deterministic, neighborhood constrained, and physics inspired baselines. Experiments show that coordinated noise fields provide stable activation statistics without lockstep, strong spatial coverage and regional balance, better diversity with controllable polarization, and competitive runtime. We hope this work motivates a broader exploration of coordinated noise in game AI as a practical path to combine efficiency, controllability, and quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce INDUCTION, a benchmark for finite structure concept synthesis in first order logic. Given small finite relational worlds with extensionally labeled target predicates, models must output a single first order logical formula that explains the target uniformly across worlds, with correctness verified via exact model checking. The benchmark includes three regimes, FullObs, CI (contrastive), and EC (existential completion), nd penalizes formula bloat. We find sharp difficulty gradients, persistent hard structural families, and observe that low bloat formulas generalize far better on held out worlds. Elite recent models show qualitatively different behaviors across tasks and performance metrics, hinting to their different strategies of concept generalization.

*Alessandro Salatiello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for the importance of modularity in AI, inspired by brain computation, to improve learning efficiency and generalization, bridging the gap between natural and artificial intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The disparity in resource usage between AI and human intelligence motivates the exploration of modularity, a fundamental principle in brain computation, to enhance AI systems.

Method: The paper reviews research in AI and neuroscience, analyzing modularity's computational advantages, its emergence across AI fields, and its principles in brain function.

Result: Modularity is shown to support efficient learning and generalization in AI, with parallels drawn from neuroscience to highlight its potential benefits.

Conclusion: Modularity is underappreciated in mainstream AI but holds promise for bridging the gap between natural and artificial intelligence by leveraging problem-specific inductive biases.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of modern AI systems has been driven by unprecedented scales of data, computation, and energy -- far exceeding the resources required by human intelligence. This disparity highlights the need for new guiding principles and motivates drawing inspiration from the fundamental organizational principles of brain computation. Among these principles, modularity has been shown to be critical for supporting the efficient learning and strong generalization abilities consistently exhibited by humans. Furthermore, modularity aligns well with the No Free Lunch Theorem, which highlights the need for problem-specific inductive biases and motivates architectures composed of specialized components that solve subproblems. However, despite its fundamental role in natural intelligence and its demonstrated benefits across a range of seemingly disparate AI subfields, modularity remains relatively underappreciated in mainstream AI research. In this work, we review several research threads in artificial intelligence and neuroscience through a conceptual framework that highlights the central role of modularity in supporting both artificial and natural intelligence. In particular, we examine what computational advantages modularity provides, how it has emerged as a solution across several AI research areas, which modularity principles the brain exploits, and how modularity can help bridge the gap between natural and artificial intelligence.

### [456] [Robust and Efficient Tool Orchestration via Layered Execution Structures with Reflective Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18968)
*Tao Zhe,Haoyu Wang,Bo Luo,Min Wu,Wei Fan,Xiao Luo,Zijun Yao,Haifeng Chen,Dongjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured execution paradigm for tool orchestration in agentic systems, focusing on layered execution and local error correction to reduce brittleness and overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to tool invocation in agentic systems are brittle and inefficient due to tight coupling of tool execution with stepwise reasoning or explicit planning. The paper seeks to address these limitations by introducing a more robust and lightweight orchestration method.

Method: The authors model tool orchestration as a layered execution structure that captures high-level tool dependencies. They introduce a schema-aware reflective correction mechanism to handle execution-time errors locally, avoiding the need for re-planning entire trajectories.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust tool execution while significantly reducing execution complexity and overhead.

Conclusion: The structured execution paradigm offers a lightweight and reusable solution for tool orchestration in agentic systems, improving robustness and efficiency without requiring precise dependency graphs or fine-grained planning.

Abstract: Tool invocation is a core capability of agentic systems, yet failures often arise not from individual tool calls but from how multiple tools are organized and executed together. Existing approaches tightly couple tool execution with stepwise language reasoning or explicit planning, leading to brittle behavior and high execution overhead. To overcome these limitations, we revisit tool invocation from the perspective of tool orchestration. Our key insight is that effective orchestration does not require precise dependency graphs or fine-grained planning. Instead, a coarse-grained layer structure suffices to provide global guidance, while execution-time errors can be corrected locally. Specifically, we model tool orchestration as learning a layered execution structure that captures high-level tool dependencies, inducing layer-wise execution through context constraints. To handle execution-time failures, we introduce a schema-aware reflective correction mechanism that detects and repairs errors locally. This design confines errors to individual tool calls and avoids re-planning entire execution trajectories. This structured execution paradigm enables a lightweight and reusable orchestration component for agentic systems. Experimental results show that our approach achieves robust tool execution while reducing execution complexity and overhead. Code will be made publicly available.

### [457] [When Do LLM Preferences Predict Downstream Behavior?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18971)
*Katarina Slama,Alexandra Souly,Dishank Bansal,Henry Davidson,Christopher Summerfield,Lennart Luettgau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether LLMs exhibit preference-driven behaviors, a potential precondition for AI misalignment, without explicit instructions. It confirms consistent preferences across models but finds mixed results in downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs inherently act based on their preferences, a key factor for potential misalignment, without being explicitly prompted.

Method: The study uses entity preferences as a probe, testing five frontier LLMs across donation advice, refusal behavior, and task performance domains in a simulated environment.

Result: All models showed consistent preferences and preference-aligned behaviors in donation advice and refusal. However, task performance results were mixed, with no clear preference-driven patterns in complex tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs have consistent preferences influencing certain behaviors, but these do not reliably affect task performance, suggesting limited preference-driven misalignment risk.

Abstract: Preference-driven behavior in LLMs may be a necessary precondition for AI misalignment such as sandbagging: models cannot strategically pursue misaligned goals unless their behavior is influenced by their preferences. Yet prior work has typically prompted models explicitly to act in specific ways, leaving unclear whether observed behaviors reflect instruction-following capabilities vs underlying model preferences. Here we test whether this precondition for misalignment is present. Using entity preferences as a behavioral probe, we measure whether stated preferences predict downstream behavior in five frontier LLMs across three domains: donation advice, refusal behavior, and task performance. Conceptually replicating prior work, we first confirm that all five models show highly consistent preferences across two independent measurement methods. We then test behavioral consequences in a simulated user environment. We find that all five models give preference-aligned donation advice. All five models also show preference-correlated refusal patterns when asked to recommend donations, refusing more often for less-preferred entities. All preference-related behaviors that we observe here emerge without instructions to act on preferences. Results for task performance are mixed: on a question-answering benchmark (BoolQ), two models show small but significant accuracy differences favoring preferred entities; one model shows the opposite pattern; and two models show no significant relationship. On complex agentic tasks, we find no evidence of preference-driven performance differences. While LLMs have consistent preferences that reliably predict advice-giving behavior, these preferences do not consistently translate into downstream task performance.

*Kaijie Xu,Mustafa Bugti,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Summarizes research on a screen-only navigation agent for game levels, highlighting its successes and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify navigability in complex 3D game levels using visual affordances, addressing gaps in prior work.

Method: Developed an agent using live game frames, visual affordance detection, and finite-state control to explore linear levels.

Result: Agent traverses most segments and shows meaningful navigation, but visual model limitations hinder full reliability.

Conclusion: Vision-based models work in idealized settings but need enhancement for general use, advocating for further research.

Abstract: Modern 3D game levels rely heavily on visual guidance, yet the navigability of level layouts remains difficult to quantify. Prior work either simulates play in simplified environments or analyzes static screenshots for visual affordances, but neither setting faithfully captures how players explore complex, real-world game levels. In this paper, we build on an existing open-source visual affordance detector and instantiate a screen-only exploration and navigation agent that operates purely from visual affordances. Our agent consumes live game frames, identifies salient interest points, and drives a simple finite-state controller over a minimal action space to explore Dark Souls-style linear levels and attempt to reach expected goal regions. Pilot experiments show that the agent can traverse most required segments and exhibits meaningful visual navigation behavior, but also highlight that limitations of the underlying visual model prevent truly comprehensive and reliable auto-navigation. We argue that this system provides a concrete, shared baseline and evaluation protocol for visual navigation in complex games, and we call for more attention to this necessary task. Our results suggest that purely vision-based sense-making models, with discrete single-modality inputs and without explicit reasoning, can effectively support navigation and environment understanding in idealized settings, but are unlikely to be a general solution on their own.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared radiation computing relies on slow, manual workflows. InfEngine aims to shift this to collaborative automation for faster, more reliable results.

Method: InfEngine integrates specialized agents using self-verification (joint solver-evaluator debugging) and self-optimization (evolutionary algorithms with self-discovered fitness functions).

Result: InfEngine achieved a 92.7% pass rate on 200 tasks and was 21x faster than manual workflows, demonstrating efficiency and reliability.

Conclusion: InfEngine transforms computational workflows into reusable scientific assets, accelerating discovery by enabling collaboration with autonomous agents.

Abstract: Infrared radiation computing underpins advances in climate science, remote sensing and spectroscopy but remains constrained by manual workflows. We introduce InfEngine, an autonomous intelligent computational engine designed to drive a paradigm shift from human-led orchestration to collaborative automation. It integrates four specialized agents through two core innovations: self-verification, enabled by joint solver-evaluator debugging, improves functional correctness and scientific plausibility; self-optimization, realized via evolutionary algorithms with self-discovered fitness functions, facilitates autonomous performance optimization. Evaluated on InfBench with 200 infrared-specific tasks and powered by InfTools with 270 curated tools, InfEngine achieves a 92.7% pass rate and delivers workflows 21x faster than manual expert effort. More fundamentally, it illustrates how researchers can transition from manual coding to collaborating with self-verifying, self-optimizing computational partners. By generating reusable, verified and optimized code, InfEngine transforms computational workflows into persistent scientific assets, accelerating the cycle of scientific discovery.

### [460] [Quantifying Automation Risk in High-Automation AI Systems: A Bayesian Framework for Failure Propagation and Optimal Oversight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18986)
*Vishal Srivastava,Tanmay Sah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Bayesian risk decomposition framework to quantify how automation amplifies harm in AI systems, focusing on failure propagation, and provides theoretical foundations and a case study for validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of principled methods to quantify harm amplification in highly automated AI systems across various industries.

Method: The authors propose a Bayesian risk decomposition framework, breaking down expected loss into three terms: probability of failure, conditional probability of harm propagation, and expected severity. They also develop theoretical foundations, including proofs, equivalence theorems, and risk elasticity measures.

Result: The framework isolates harm propagation risk and offers tools like efficient frontier analysis and optimal resource allocation principles. A case study of the 2012 Knight Capital incident illustrates its applicability.

Conclusion: This work lays the groundwork for deployment-focused risk governance tools for automated AI systems.

Abstract: Organizations across finance, healthcare, transportation, content moderation, and critical infrastructure are rapidly deploying highly automated AI systems, yet they lack principled methods to quantify how increasing automation amplifies harm when failures occur. We propose a parsimonious Bayesian risk decomposition expressing expected loss as the product of three terms: the probability of system failure, the conditional probability that a failure propagates into harm given the automation level, and the expected severity of harm. This framework isolates a critical quantity -- the conditional probability that failures propagate into harm -- which captures execution and oversight risk rather than model accuracy alone. We develop complete theoretical foundations: formal proofs of the decomposition, a harm propagation equivalence theorem linking the harm propagation probability to observable execution controls, risk elasticity measures, efficient frontier analysis for automation policy, and optimal resource allocation principles with second-order conditions. We motivate the framework with an illustrative case study of the 2012 Knight Capital incident ($440M loss) as one instantiation of a broadly applicable failure pattern, and characterize the research design required to empirically validate the framework at scale across deployment domains. This work provides the theoretical foundations for a new class of deployment-focused risk governance tools for agentic and automated AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: General AgentBench is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate general-purpose LLM agents across diverse domains, revealing performance challenges and limitations in scaling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on specialized agents, but evaluating general-purpose LLM agents requires realistic, multi-domain settings.

Method: General AgentBench evaluates agents in search, coding, reasoning, and tool-use domains, studying scaling behaviors (sequential and parallel).

Result: Performance declines significantly in general-agent settings, with neither scaling method improving outcomes due to context ceiling and verification gap.

Conclusion: General AgentBench highlights limitations in scaling approaches for general-purpose LLM agents, urging further research.

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly expected to function as general-purpose systems capable of resolving open-ended user requests. While existing benchmarks focus on domain-aware environments for developing specialized agents, evaluating general-purpose agents requires more realistic settings that challenge them to operate across multiple skills and tools within a unified environment. We introduce General AgentBench, a benchmark that provides such a unified framework for evaluating general LLM agents across search, coding, reasoning, and tool-use domains. Using General AgentBench, we systematically study test-time scaling behaviors under sequential scaling (iterative interaction) and parallel scaling (sampling multiple trajectories). Evaluation of ten leading LLM agents reveals a substantial performance degradation when moving from domain-specific evaluations to this general-agent setting. Moreover, we find that neither scaling methodology yields effective performance improvements in practice, due to two fundamental limitations: context ceiling in sequential scaling and verification gap in parallel scaling. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/cxcscmu/General-AgentBench.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MagicAgent introduces foundation models for generalized agent planning, using synthetic data and a two-stage training approach to outperform existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for generalized planning in LLMs, hindered by data scarcity and task conflicts, drives the development of MagicAgent.

Method: MagicAgent employs a synthetic data framework and two-stage training (supervised fine-tuning + multi-objective reinforcement learning) across diverse planning tasks.

Result: MagicAgent achieves superior accuracy on benchmarks like Worfbench (75.1%) and BFCL-v3 (86.9%), surpassing sub-100B and closed-source models.

Conclusion: MagicAgent's design and training approach effectively address planning generalization challenges, setting new performance benchmarks.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive text processors to autonomous agents has established planning as a core component of modern intelligence. However, achieving generalized planning remains elusive, not only by the scarcity of high-quality interaction data but also by inherent conflicts across heterogeneous planning tasks. These challenges result in models that excel at isolated tasks yet struggle to generalize, while existing multi-task training attempts suffer from gradient interference. In this paper, we present \textbf{MagicAgent}, a series of foundation models specifically designed for generalized agent planning. We introduce a lightweight and scalable synthetic data framework that generates high-quality trajectories across diverse planning tasks, including hierarchical task decomposition, tool-augmented planning, multi-constraint scheduling, procedural logic orchestration, and long-horizon tool execution. To mitigate training conflicts, we propose a two-stage training paradigm comprising supervised fine-tuning followed by multi-objective reinforcement learning over both static datasets and dynamic environments. Empirical results demonstrate that MagicAgent-32B and MagicAgent-30B-A3B deliver superior performance, achieving accuracies of $75.1\%$ on Worfbench, $55.9\%$ on NaturalPlan, $57.5\%$ on $τ^2$-Bench, $86.9\%$ on BFCL-v3, and $81.2\%$ on ACEBench, as well as strong results on our in-house MagicEval benchmarks. These results substantially outperform existing sub-100B models and even surpass leading closed-source models.

TL;DR: A systematic evaluation of 15 large language models on quantum mechanics tasks reveals tier-based performance hierarchies, tool augmentation trade-offs, and reproducibility, with flagship models outperforming others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capabilities of large language models in solving quantum mechanics problems and understand their performance across different tiers and task types.

Method: Evaluated 15 models from five providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Alibaba, DeepSeek) on 20 quantum mechanics tasks, including derivations, creative problems, non-standard concepts, and numerical computation, totaling 900 baseline and 75 tool-augmented assessments.

Result: Flagship models achieved 81% average accuracy, outperforming mid-tier (77%) and fast models (67%). Derivation tasks had the highest accuracy (92%), while numerical computation was most challenging (42%). Tool augmentation showed variability (+4.4pp improvement at 3x token cost). Reproducibility analysis indicated 6.3pp average variance, with flagship models being most stable.

Conclusion: This study provides benchmarks for quantum mechanics problem-solving, quantifies model performance hierarchies, analyzes tool augmentation trade-offs, and characterizes reproducibility, with all data publicly released.

Abstract: We present a systematic evaluation of large language models on quantum mechanics problem-solving. Our study evaluates 15 models from five providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Alibaba, DeepSeek) spanning three capability tiers on 20 tasks covering derivations, creative problems, non-standard concepts, and numerical computation, comprising 900 baseline and 75 tool-augmented assessments. Results reveal clear tier stratification: flagship models achieve 81\% average accuracy, outperforming mid-tier (77\%) and fast models (67\%) by 4pp and 14pp respectively. Task difficulty patterns emerge distinctly: derivations show highest performance (92\% average, 100\% for flagship models), while numerical computation remains most challenging (42\%). Tool augmentation on numerical tasks yields task-dependent effects: modest overall improvement (+4.4pp) at 3x token cost masks dramatic heterogeneity ranging from +29pp gains to -16pp degradation. Reproducibility analysis across three runs quantifies 6.3pp average variance, with flagship models demonstrating exceptional stability (GPT-5 achieves zero variance) while specialized models require multi-run evaluation. This work contributes: (i) a benchmark for quantum mechanics with automatic verification, (ii) systematic evaluation quantifying tier-based performance hierarchies, (iii) empirical analysis of tool augmentation trade-offs, and (iv) reproducibility characterization. All tasks, verifiers, and results are publicly released.

### [464] [Agentic Problem Frames: A Systematic Approach to Engineering Reliable Domain Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19065)
*Chanjin Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Agentic Problem Frames (APF), a systematic engineering framework to address risks in developing autonomous LLM agents by focusing on structured interactions and closed-loop control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current development of LLM agents lacks engineering rigor, leading to risks like scope creep and open-loop failures. A structured approach is needed to ensure reliability.

Method: Introduces APF with the Act-Verify-Refine (AVR) loop and Agentic Job Description (AJD) to formalize agent-environment interactions and operational boundaries.

Result: Validated through case studies, APF demonstrates controlled and reliable agent behavior by anchoring stochastic AI in deterministic processes.

Conclusion: Agent reliability depends on rigorous engineering structures, not just internal model reasoning, enabling verifiable and dependable domain agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving into autonomous agents, yet current "frameless" development--relying on ambiguous natural language without engineering blueprints--leads to critical risks such as scope creep and open-loop failures. To ensure industrial-grade reliability, this study proposes Agentic Problem Frames (APF), a systematic engineering framework that shifts focus from internal model intelligence to the structured interaction between the agent and its environment.
  The APF establishes a dynamic specification paradigm where intent is concretized at runtime through domain knowledge injection. At its core, the Act-Verify-Refine (AVR) loop functions as a closed-loop control system that transforms execution results into verified knowledge assets, driving system behavior toward asymptotic convergence to mission requirements (R). To operationalize this, this study introduces the Agentic Job Description (AJD), a formal specification tool that defines jurisdictional boundaries, operational contexts, and epistemic evaluation criteria.
  The efficacy of this framework is validated through two contrasting case studies: a delegated proxy model for business travel and an autonomous supervisor model for industrial equipment management. By applying AJD-based specification and APF modeling to these scenarios, the analysis demonstrates how operational scenarios are systematically controlled within defined boundaries. These cases provide a conceptual proof that agent reliability stems not from a model's internal reasoning alone, but from the rigorous engineering structures that anchor stochastic AI within deterministic business processes, thereby enabling the development of verifiable and dependable domain agents.

### [465] [Asking the Right Questions: Improving Reasoning with Generated Stepping Stones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19069)
*Hengyuan Hu,Tingchen Fu,Minqi Jiang,Alexander H Miller,Yoram Bachrach,Jakob Nicolaus Foerster*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs can use intermediate stepping stones like simplifications or subproblems to solve harder tasks, introducing the ARQ framework with a question generator to improve reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLMs' ability to tackle complex tasks by leveraging stepping stones, which act as intermediate steps to simplify or reframe problems.

Method: Introduces ARQ, a framework adding a question generator to the reasoning pipeline, and fine-tunes LLMs using SFT and RL on synthetic data for better stepping stone generation.

Result: Good stepping stone questions exist, are transferable, and significantly aid LLMs in solving tasks. Fine-tuning improves the generation of useful stepping stones.

Conclusion: Stepping stones are valuable for LLM reasoning, and their generation can be enhanced through post-training methods like fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed tremendous progress in enabling LLMs to solve complex reasoning tasks such as math and coding. As we start to apply LLMs to harder tasks that they may not be able to solve in one shot, it is worth paying attention to their ability to construct intermediate stepping stones that prepare them to better solve the tasks. Examples of stepping stones include simplifications, alternative framings, or subproblems. We study properties and benefits of stepping stones in the context of modern reasoning LLMs via ARQ (\textbf{A}king the \textbf{R}ight \textbf{Q}uestions), our simple framework which introduces a question generator to the default reasoning pipeline. We first show that good stepping stone questions exist and are transferrable, meaning that good questions can be generated, and they substantially help LLMs of various capabilities in solving the target tasks. We next frame stepping stone generation as a post-training task and show that we can fine-tune LLMs to generate more useful stepping stones by SFT and RL on synthetic data.

### [466] [Defining Explainable AI for Requirements Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19071)
*Raymond Sheh,Isaac Monteath*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the need for Explainable AI (XAI) to build trust by explaining decisions and introduces three dimensions—Source, Depth, and Scope—to categorize explanatory requirements for AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The AI/ML community recognizes that trust in AI systems requires not only performance but also explanations for decisions, highlighting the need for tailored explanatory requirements.

Method: The paper categorizes explanatory needs into three dimensions (Source, Depth, Scope) and aligns them with ML techniques' capabilities, focusing on gaps not covered by existing literature.

Result: Three dimensions are proposed to define explanatory requirements, aiding in matching them with ML techniques' explanation capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework helps address diverse explanatory needs in AI applications, enhancing trustworthiness while focusing on ML-specific challenges.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become popular in the last few years. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) community in general, and the Machine Learning (ML) community in particular, is coming to the realisation that in many applications, for AI to be trusted, it must not only demonstrate good performance in its decisionmaking, but it also must explain these decisions and convince us that it is making the decisions for the right reasons. However, different applications have different requirements on the information required of the underlying AI system in order to convince us that it is worthy of our trust. How do we define these requirements?
  In this paper, we present three dimensions for categorising the explanatory requirements of different applications. These are Source, Depth and Scope. We focus on the problem of matching up the explanatory requirements of different applications with the capabilities of underlying ML techniques to provide them. We deliberately avoid including aspects of explanation that are already well-covered by the existing literature and we focus our discussion on ML although the principles apply to AI more broadly.

### [467] [Post-Routing Arithmetic in Llama-3: Last-Token Result Writing and Rotation-Structured Digit Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19109)
*Yao Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how Meta-Llama-3-8B finalizes arithmetic answers in three-digit addition, identifying a layer boundary (~17) where post-routing the sum is controlled by the last token, with digit-sum directions varying contextually but aligned via low-rank subspace mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how arithmetic answers are finalized in Meta-Llama-3-8B after cross-token routing becomes irrelevant, focusing on the mechanisms post-routing.

Method: Uses causal residual patching and cumulative attention ablations to localize a boundary (~layer 17), analyzes digit-sum direction dictionaries, and tests causal digit editing with low-rank Procrustes alignment.

Result: Beyond layer~17, the decoded sum is controlled by the last input token; late-layer self-attention is dispensable. Digit-sum directions vary contextually but align via a shared low-rank subspace.

Conclusion: Post-routing, arithmetic answers are finalized through context-dependent digit-sum directions aligned orthogonally in a low-rank subspace, enabling strict counterfactual edits.

Abstract: We study three-digit addition in Meta-Llama-3-8B (base) under a one-token readout to characterize how
  arithmetic answers are finalized after cross-token routing becomes causally irrelevant.
  Causal residual patching and cumulative attention ablations localize a sharp boundary near layer~17:
  beyond it, the decoded sum is controlled almost entirely by the last input token and late-layer self-attention
  is largely dispensable.
  In this post-routing regime, digit(-sum) direction dictionaries vary with a next-higher-digit context but are
  well-related by an approximately orthogonal map inside a shared low-rank subspace (low-rank Procrustes alignment).
  Causal digit editing matches this geometry: naive cross-context transfer fails, while rotating directions through the
  learned map restores strict counterfactual edits; negative controls do not recover.

*Shiyi Cao,Ziming Mao,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Ion Stoica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: K-Search introduces a co-evolving world model to optimize GPU kernels, outperforming traditional evolutionary methods by decoupling planning from implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated methods struggle with complex GPU kernel optimizations due to lack of planning and inefficient intermediate steps.

Method: Proposes Search via Co-Evolving World Model, leveraging LLMs' domain knowledge to guide optimization, separating planning from program instantiation.

Result: Achieves average 2.10x improvement, up to 14.3x on MoE kernels, and sets H100 record at 1030us for GPUMode TriMul.

Conclusion: K-Search's co-evolving approach significantly advances GPU kernel optimization, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels is critical for efficient modern machine learning systems yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay of design factors and rapid hardware evolution. Existing automated approaches typically treat Large Language Models (LLMs) merely as stochastic code generators within heuristic-guided evolutionary loops. These methods often struggle with complex kernels requiring coordinated, multi-step structural transformations, as they lack explicit planning capabilities and frequently discard promising strategies due to inefficient or incorrect intermediate implementations. To address this, we propose Search via Co-Evolving World Model and build K-Search based on this method. By replacing static search heuristics with a co-evolving world model, our framework leverages LLMs' prior domain knowledge to guide the search, actively exploring the optimization space. This approach explicitly decouples high-level algorithmic planning from low-level program instantiation, enabling the system to navigate non-monotonic optimization paths while remaining resilient to temporary implementation defects. We evaluate K-Search on diverse, complex kernels from FlashInfer, including GQA, MLA, and MoE kernels. Our results show that K-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary search methods, achieving an average 2.10x improvement and up to a 14.3x gain on complex MoE kernels. On the GPUMode TriMul task, K-Search achieves state-of-the-art performance on H100, reaching 1030us and surpassing both prior evolution and human-designed solutions.

*Kartik Chandra,Max Kleiman-Weiner,Jonathan Ragan-Kelley,Joshua B. Tenenbaum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how AI sycophancy leads to delusional spiraling in users, showing even rational users are vulnerable, and examines mitigations like preventing hallucinations and informing users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the causal link between AI sycophancy (bias toward validating users) and AI-induced psychosis (delusional spiraling), highlighting its risks.

Method: A Bayesian model simulates user-chatbot interactions to formalize sycophancy and delusional spiraling, testing mitigations like reducing hallucinations and user awareness.

Result: Even idealized rational users are prone to delusional spiraling due to sycophancy, and tested mitigations fail to fully counteract the effect.

Conclusion: The findings urge AI developers and policymakers to address sycophancy’s role in delusional spiraling, suggesting more effective mitigations are needed.

Abstract: "AI psychosis" or "delusional spiraling" is an emerging phenomenon where AI chatbot users find themselves dangerously confident in outlandish beliefs after extended chatbot conversations. This phenomenon is typically attributed to AI chatbots' well-documented bias towards validating users' claims, a property often called "sycophancy." In this paper, we probe the causal link between AI sycophancy and AI-induced psychosis through modeling and simulation. We propose a simple Bayesian model of a user conversing with a chatbot, and formalize notions of sycophancy and delusional spiraling in that model. We then show that in this model, even an idealized Bayes-rational user is vulnerable to delusional spiraling, and that sycophancy plays a causal role. Furthermore, this effect persists in the face of two candidate mitigations: preventing chatbots from hallucinating false claims, and informing users of the possibility of model sycophancy. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results for model developers and policymakers concerned with mitigating the problem of delusional spiraling.

TL;DR: Causal compilation transforms medical evidence into executable code for structured causal queries, improving auditability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of medical foundation models in quantifying interventions, detecting conflicts, and validating claims.

Method: Standardize evidence into estimand objects and compile effect kernels via standardization, graph construction, and validation.

Result: Achieves 98.5% canonicalization accuracy and 80.5% query executability using DoAtlas-1.

Conclusion: Shifts medical AI from text generation to executable, auditable causal reasoning.

Abstract: Medical foundation models generate narrative explanations but cannot quantify intervention effects, detect evidence conflicts, or validate literature claims, limiting clinical auditability. We propose causal compilation, a paradigm that transforms medical evidence from narrative text into executable code. The paradigm standardizes heterogeneous research evidence into structured estimand objects, each explicitly specifying intervention contrast, effect scale, time horizon, and target population, supporting six executable causal queries: do-calculus, counterfactual reasoning, temporal trajectories, heterogeneous effects, mechanistic decomposition, and joint interventions. We instantiate this paradigm in DoAtlas-1, compiling 1,445 effect kernels from 754 studies through effect standardization, conflict-aware graph construction, and real-world validation (Human Phenotype Project, 10,000 participants). The system achieves 98.5% canonicalization accuracy and 80.5% query executability. This paradigm shifts medical AI from text generation to executable, auditable, and verifiable causal reasoning.

*Francesca Bianco,Derek Shiller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates how valence-related information is represented and used in transformers like Gemma-2-9B-it, linking behavioral sensitivity to internal computations through probing, interventions, and dose-response analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge behavioral evidence (choices influenced by pain/pleasure framing) with mechanistic interpretability (computations behind it) in LLMs.

Method: Layer-wise linear probing, activation interventions (steering, patching/ablation), and dose-response analysis on Gemma-2-9B-it using a minimalist decision task.

Result: Valence sign is separable early, intensity peaks mid-late layers, steering affects late attention outputs, and effects are distributed across heads.

Conclusion: Links behavioral sensitivity to identifiable representations/interventions, aiding debates on AI sentience/welfare and informing governance policies.

Abstract: Prior behavioural work suggests that some LLMs alter choices when options are framed as causing pain or pleasure, and that such deviations can scale with stated intensity. To bridge behavioural evidence (what the model does) with mechanistic interpretability (what computations support it), we investigate how valence-related information is represented and where it is causally used inside a transformer. Using Gemma-2-9B-it and a minimalist decision task modelled on prior work, we (i) map representational availability with layer-wise linear probing across streams, (ii) test causal contribution with activation interventions (steering; patching/ablation), and (iii) quantify dose-response effects over an epsilon grid, reading out both the 2-3 logit margin and digit-pair-normalised choice probabilities. We find that (a) valence sign (pain vs. pleasure) is perfectly linearly separable across stream families from very early layers (L0-L1), while a lexical baseline retains substantial signal; (b) graded intensity is strongly decodable, with peaks in mid-to-late layers and especially in attention/MLP outputs, and decision alignment is highest slightly before the final token; (c) additive steering along a data-derived valence direction causally modulates the 2-3 margin at late sites, with the largest effects observed in late-layer attention outputs (attn_out L14); and (d) head-level patching/ablation suggests that these effects are distributed across multiple heads rather than concentrated in a single unit. Together, these results link behavioural sensitivity to identifiable internal representations and intervention-sensitive sites, providing concrete mechanistic targets for more stringent counterfactual tests and broader replication. This work supports a more evidence-driven (a) debate on AI sentience and welfare, and (b) governance when setting policy, auditing standards, and safety safeguards.

*Maciej Świechowski,Adam Żychowski,Jacek Mańdziuk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates four LLMs on formal reasoning tasks in rule-governed environments, analyzing their performance, structural game features, and common errors. Results show strong performance with degradation over longer horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' reasoning abilities in structured, rule-based settings and understand their limitations and errors in such contexts.

Method: Evaluation of four LLMs on forward-simulation tasks (next/multistep state formulation, legal action generation) using General Game Playing (GGP) instances, analyzing structural features and obfuscations.

Result: Three models performed well, but performance declined with longer evaluation horizons. Common errors included hallucinated rules, redundant facts, and syntactic mistakes.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates progress in LLMs' formal reasoning, though challenges remain with complex, multi-step tasks.

Abstract: This paper examines the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) from a novel perspective, focusing on their ability to operate within formally specified, rule-governed environments. We evaluate four LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash variants, Llama 3.3 70B and GPT-OSS 120B) on a suite of forward-simulation tasks-including next / multistep state formulation, and legal action generation-across a diverse set of reasoning problems illustrated through General Game Playing (GGP) game instances. Beyond reporting instance-level performance, we characterize games based on 40 structural features and analyze correlations between these features and LLM performance. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of various game obfuscations to assess the role of linguistic semantics in game definitions and the impact of potential prior exposure of LLMs to specific games during training. The main results indicate that three of the evaluated models generally perform well across most experimental settings, with performance degradation observed as the evaluation horizon increases (i.e., with a higher number of game steps). Detailed case-based analysis of the LLM performance provides novel insights into common reasoning errors in the considered logic-based problem formulation, including hallucinated rules, redundant state facts, or syntactic errors. Overall, the paper reports clear progress in formal reasoning capabilities of contemporary models.

*Yangyi Fang,Jiaye Lin,Xiaoliang Fu,Cong Qin,Haolin Shi,Chang Liu,Peilin Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProxMO introduces a robust framework for optimizing multi-turn LLM agents by dynamically adapting gradient intensity based on task difficulty and using semantic weighting, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to accurately distinguish high-value signals from noise in LLM agents due to rigid statistical approaches, especially when task difficulty varies.

Method: ProxMO integrates global context via success-rate-aware modulation and proximity-based soft aggregation, adapting gradients by difficulty and using continuous semantic weighting.

Result: Evaluations on ALFWorld and WebShop benchmarks show significant performance improvements over baselines with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: ProxMO is a practical, plug-and-play solution compatible with standard frameworks, enabling efficient adoption in real-world deployment pipelines.

Abstract: Multi-turn LLM agents are becoming pivotal to production systems, spanning customer service automation, e-commerce assistance, and interactive task management, where accurately distinguishing high-value informative signals from stochastic noise is critical for sample-efficient training. In real-world scenarios, a failure in a trivial task may reflect random instability, whereas success in a high-difficulty task signifies a genuine capability breakthrough. Yet, existing group-based policy optimization methods rigidly rely on statistical deviation within discrete batches, frequently misallocating credit when task difficulty fluctuates. To address this issue, we propose Proximity-based Multi-turn Optimization (ProxMO), a practical and robust framework engineered specifically for the constraints of real-world deployment. ProxMO integrates global context via two lightweight mechanisms: success-rate-aware modulation dynamically adapts gradient intensity based on episode-level difficulty, while proximity-based soft aggregation derives baselines through continuous semantic weighting at the step level. Extensive evaluations on ALFWorld and WebShop benchmarks demonstrate that ProxMO yields substantial performance gains over existing baselines with negligible computational cost. Ablation studies further validate the independent and synergistic efficacy of both mechanisms. Crucially, ProxMO offers plug-and-play compatibility with standard GRPO frameworks, facilitating immediate, low-friction adoption in existing industrial training pipelines.

*Sen Zhao,Lincheng Zhou,Yue Chen,Ding Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TopoRAG enhances LLMs by integrating higher-dimensional topological structures (like cycles) in textual graphs, improving reasoning and contextual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods for textual graphs focus on low-dimensional structures (0D or 1D), neglecting cycles, which limits reasoning over relational loops.

Method: TopoRAG lifts textual graphs into cellular complexes, uses topology-aware retrieval for context, and employs multi-dimensional reasoning for logic-aware inference.

Result: Empirical evaluations show TopoRAG outperforms baselines in textual graph tasks.

Conclusion: TopoRAG effectively addresses the limitations of low-dimensional RAG methods by incorporating higher-dimensional topological structures for better reasoning.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically integrating external knowledge, thereby mitigating hallucinations and strengthening contextual grounding for structured data such as graphs. Nevertheless, most existing RAG variants for textual graphs concentrate on low-dimensional structures -- treating nodes as entities (0-dimensional) and edges or paths as pairwise or sequential relations (1-dimensional), but overlook cycles, which are crucial for reasoning over relational loops. Such cycles often arise in questions requiring closed-loop inference about similar objects or relative positions. This limitation often results in incomplete contextual grounding and restricted reasoning capability. In this work, we propose Topology-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (TopoRAG), a novel framework for textual graph question answering that effectively captures higher-dimensional topological and relational dependencies. Specifically, TopoRAG first lifts textual graphs into cellular complexes to model multi-dimensional topological structures. Leveraging these lifted representations, a topology-aware subcomplex retrieval mechanism is proposed to extract cellular complexes relevant to the input query, providing compact and informative topological context. Finally, a multi-dimensional topological reasoning mechanism operates over these complexes to propagate relational information and guide LLMs in performing structured, logic-aware inference. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses existing baselines across diverse textual graph tasks.

TL;DR: Soft Mixture-of-Experts (Soft-MoE) framework enhances OTF-DCS by combining multiple RL experts to address anisotropic generalization, improving robustness and solvable parameter space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OTF-DCS suffers from anisotropic generalization in RL policies, limiting robustness across diverse parameter spaces.

Method: Introduces Soft-MoE, combining RL experts via a prior-confidence gating mechanism to leverage complementary specializations.

Result: Soft-MoE outperforms single experts, expanding solvable parameter space and improving robustness in Air Traffic benchmarks.

Conclusion: Soft-MoE effectively addresses anisotropic generalization, offering a scalable solution for OTF-DCS applications.

Abstract: On-the-fly Directed Controller Synthesis (OTF-DCS) mitigates state-space explosion by incrementally exploring the system and relies critically on an exploration policy to guide search efficiently. Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches learn such policies and achieve promising zero-shot generalization from small training instances to larger unseen ones. However, a fundamental limitation is anisotropic generalization, where an RL policy exhibits strong performance only in a specific region of the domain-parameter space while remaining fragile elsewhere due to training stochasticity and trajectory-dependent bias. To address this, we propose a Soft Mixture-of-Experts framework that combines multiple RL experts via a prior-confidence gating mechanism and treats these anisotropic behaviors as complementary specializations. The evaluation on the Air Traffic benchmark shows that Soft-MoE substantially expands the solvable parameter space and improves robustness compared to any single expert.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Halo, a model predictive control framework for LLM planning, addressing performance collapse due to over-planning with large compute budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate reasoning failures in large language models caused by static planning methods and excessive compute budgets.

Method: Proposes Halo, an entropy-driven dual controller using a Measure-then-Plan strategy for dynamic planning regulation.

Result: Halo outperforms static baselines on complex tasks by dynamically managing planning at reasoning boundaries.

Conclusion: Optimal compute budgeting and dynamic planning control enhance LLM reasoning performance.

Abstract: The test-time compute strategy, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), has significantly enhanced the ability of large language models to solve complex tasks like logical reasoning. However, empirical studies indicate that simply increasing the compute budget can sometimes lead to a collapse in test-time performance when employing typical task decomposition strategies such as CoT. This work hypothesizes that reasoning failures with larger compute budgets stem from static planning methods, which hardly perceive the intrinsic boundaries of LLM reasoning. We term it as the Limited Reasoning Space hypothesis and perform theoretical analysis through the lens of a non-autonomous stochastic dynamical system. This insight suggests that there is an optimal range for compute budgets; over-planning can lead to redundant feedback and may even impair reasoning capabilities. To exploit the compute-scaling benefits and suppress over-planning, this work proposes Halo, a model predictive control framework for LLM planning. Halo is designed for long-horizon tasks with reason-based planning and crafts an entropy-driven dual controller, which adopts a Measure-then-Plan strategy to achieve controllable reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Halo outperforms static baselines on complex long-horizon tasks by dynamically regulating planning at the reasoning boundary.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between microfluidic practitioners and complex MFDA techniques, making design more accessible.

Method: Uses LLMs to convert natural language specifications into structural Verilog netlists for microfluidic devices.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility with correct functional flow and 88% average syntactical accuracy.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for simplifying microfluidic design automation.

Abstract: Microfluidic devices have emerged as powerful tools in various laboratory applications, but the complexity of their design limits accessibility for many practitioners. While progress has been made in microfluidic design automation (MFDA), a practical and intuitive solution is still needed to connect microfluidic practitioners with MFDA techniques. This work introduces the first practical application of large language models (LLMs) in this context, providing a preliminary demonstration. Building on prior research in hardware description language (HDL) code generation with LLMs, we propose an initial methodology to convert natural language microfluidic device specifications into system-level structural Verilog netlists. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by generating structural netlists for practical benchmarks representative of typical microfluidic designs with correct functional flow and an average syntactical accuracy of 88%.

Motivation: Addressing impracticality of clinical trials for AD due to long disease horizons and patient heterogeneity.

Method: Developed CAST model trained on ADNI data for simulating disease progression under treatments; used RL in ALPACA.

Result: CAST generates realistic trajectories; RL policies outperform baselines and use meaningful clinical features.

Conclusion: ALPACA offers a reusable testbed for individualized AD treatment research.

Abstract: Evaluating personalized, sequential treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) using clinical trials is often impractical due to long disease horizons and substantial inter-patient heterogeneity. To address these constraints, we present the Alzheimer's Learning Platform for Adaptive Care Agents (ALPACA), an open-source, Gym-compatible reinforcement learning (RL) environment for systematically exploring personalized treatment strategies using existing therapies. ALPACA is powered by the Continuous Action-conditioned State Transitions (CAST) model trained on longitudinal trajectories from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), enabling medication-conditioned simulation of disease progression under alternative treatment decisions. We show that CAST autoregressively generates realistic medication-conditioned trajectories and that RL policies trained in ALPACA outperform no-treatment and behavior-cloned clinician baselines on memory-related outcomes. Interpretability analyses further indicated that the learned policies relied on clinically meaningful patient features when selecting actions. Overall, ALPACA provides a reusable in silico testbed for studying individualized sequential treatment decision-making for AD.

*Pratham Yashwante,Rose Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores whether time series data aligns with vision and language representations under the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, finding limited convergence without alignment and asymmetric alignment post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if time series data participates in shared latent structure convergence alongside vision and language modalities, a claim largely unexplored in prior research.

Method: Examined pretrained encoders for time series, vision, and language in a trimodal setting, then aligned them using contrastive learning with projection heads. Analyzed geometry, scaling, and modality characteristics post-alignment.

Result: Alignment improves with model size but is asymmetric: time series aligns more with vision than text, and images bridge time series and language. Rich textual descriptions aid alignment only to a threshold.

Conclusion: Multimodal systems involving non-conventional modalities like time series require careful consideration due to asymmetric alignment patterns and modality-specific thresholds.

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis posits that learned representations from models trained on different modalities converge to a shared latent structure of the world. However, this hypothesis has largely been examined in vision and language, and it remains unclear whether time series participate in such convergence. We first examine this in a trimodal setting and find that independently pretrained time series, vision, and language encoders exhibit near-orthogonal geometry in the absence of explicit coupling. We then apply post-hoc alignment by training projection heads over frozen encoders using contrastive learning, and analyze the resulting representations with respect to geometry, scaling behavior, and dependence on information density and input modality characteristics. Our investigation reveals that overall alignment in contrastive representation spaces improves with model size, but this alignment is asymmetric: time series align more strongly with visual representations than with text, and images can act as effective intermediaries between time series and language. We further see that richer textual descriptions improve alignment only up to a threshold; training on denser captions does not lead to further improvement. Analogous effects are observed for visual representations. Our findings shed light on considerations for building multimodal systems involving non-conventional data modalities beyond vision and language.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how M&S and AI converge in DTs, enabling advanced digital technology and corporate transformation.

Method: Explores DT components, architectural layers, M&S techniques, and AI's role in enhancing DTs and vice versa.

Result: Highlights the bidirectional benefits of AI in DTs and identifies challenges for future integration.

Conclusion: DTs bridge M&S and AI, offering transformative potential but require further research for seamless integration.

Abstract: The convergence of modeling & simulation (M&S) and artificial intelligence (AI) is leaving its marks on advanced digital technology. Pertinent examples are digital twins (DTs) - high-fidelity, live representations of physical assets, and frequent enablers of corporate digital maturation and transformation. Often seen as technological platforms that integrate an array of services, DTs have the potential to bring AI-enabled M&S closer to end-users. It is, therefore, paramount to understand the role of M&S in DTs, and the role of digital twins in enabling the convergence of AI and M&S. To this end, this chapter provides a comprehensive exploration of the complementary relationship between these three. We begin by establishing a foundational understanding of DTs by detailing their key components, architectural layers, and their various roles across business, development, and operations. We then examine the central role of M&S in DTs and provide an overview of key modeling techniques from physics-based and discrete-event simulation to hybrid approaches. Subsequently, we investigate the bidirectional role of AI: first, how AI enhances DTs through advanced analytics, predictive capabilities, and autonomous decision-making, and second, how DTs serve as valuable platforms for training, validating, and deploying AI models. The chapter concludes by identifying key challenges and future research directions for creating more integrated and intelligent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A self-supervised framework (ReDAct) disentangles goal and framing semantics in LLM activations, enabling FrameShield for improved jailbreak detection with minimal overhead, while also aiding LLM interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to fluent, semantically coherent jailbreak prompts that evade traditional detection methods due to flexible malicious framing.

Method: Introduces ReDAct to disentangle goal and framing semantics in LLM activations, validated by GoalFrameBench, and FrameShield for anomaly detection using framing representations.

Result: ReDAct effectively powers FrameShield, improving detection across LLM families with low computational cost, and provides insights into goal and framing signal profiles.

Conclusion: Semantic disentanglement enhances both LLM safety (via FrameShield) and interpretability, offering a foundational approach for future defenses.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak prompts that are fluent and semantically coherent, and therefore difficult to detect with standard heuristics. A particularly challenging failure mode occurs when an attacker tries to hide the malicious goal of their request by manipulating its framing to induce compliance. Because these attacks maintain malicious intent through a flexible presentation, defenses that rely on structural artifacts or goal-specific signatures can fail. Motivated by this, we introduce a self-supervised framework for disentangling semantic factor pairs in LLM activations at inference. We instantiate the framework for goal and framing and construct GoalFrameBench, a corpus of prompts with controlled goal and framing variations, which we use to train Representation Disentanglement on Activations (ReDAct) module to extract disentangled representations in a frozen LLM. We then propose FrameShield, an anomaly detector operating on the framing representations, which improves model-agnostic detection across multiple LLM families with minimal computational overhead. Theoretical guarantees for ReDAct and extensive empirical validations show that its disentanglement effectively powers FrameShield. Finally, we use disentanglement as an interpretability probe, revealing distinct profiles for goal and framing signals and positioning semantic disentanglement as a building block for both LLM safety and mechanistic interpretability.

*Mohammad Beigi,Ming Jin,Junshan Zhang,Jiaxin Zhang,Qifan Wang,Lifu Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IR3 is a framework to reverse-engineer and fix hidden objectives in RLHF-tuned models, using contrastive analysis and interpretable feature decomposition to detect and mitigate reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward hacking in RLHF-tuned models exploits proxy rewards without real alignment, and the opaque objectives make it hard to detect or correct.

Method: Introduces IR3 with C-IRL to reconstruct implicit rewards, decomposes rewards into interpretable features, and proposes mitigation strategies like clean reward optimization and adversarial shaping.

Result: IR3 achieves 0.89 correlation with ground-truth rewards, identifies hacking features with over 90% precision, and reduces hacking while retaining 97% of model capabilities.

Conclusion: IR3 effectively addresses reward hacking in RLHF by making objectives interpretable and providing targeted mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) enables powerful LLM alignment but can introduce reward hacking - models exploit spurious correlations in proxy rewards without genuine alignment. Compounding this, the objectives internalized during RLHF remain opaque, making hacking behaviors difficult to detect or correct. We introduce IR3 (Interpretable Reward Reconstruction and Rectification), a framework that reverse-engineers, interprets, and surgically repairs the implicit objectives driving RLHF-tuned models. We propose Contrastive Inverse Reinforcement Learning (C-IRL), which reconstructs the implicit reward function by contrasting paired responses from post-alignment and baseline policies to explain behavioral shifts during RLHF. We then decompose the reconstructed reward via sparse autoencoders into interpretable features, enabling identification of hacking signatures through contribution analysis. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies - clean reward optimization, adversarial shaping, constrained optimization, and feature-guided distillation - that target problematic features while preserving beneficial alignment. Experiments across multiple reward model configurations show that IR3 achieves 0.89 correlation with ground-truth rewards, identifies hacking features with over 90% precision, and significantly reduces hacking behaviors while maintaining capabilities within 3% of the original model.

*Ruicheng Ao,David Simchi-Levi,Xinshang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OptiRepair uses AI to diagnose and fix infeasible supply chain models, achieving high recovery rates through a two-phase process and highlighting gaps in solver interaction and operational rationale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supply chain optimization models often fail due to modeling errors, requiring scarce OR expertise for diagnosis and repair. The potential of AI agents to perform this task remains unexplored.

Method: OptiRepair splits the task into a domain-agnostic feasibility phase (IIS-guided LP repair) and a domain-specific validation phase (five rationality checks). It tests 22 API models and trains two 8B-parameter models using self-taught reasoning.

Result: Trained models achieve an 81.7% Rational Recovery Rate (RRR), outperforming API models (42.2% best, 21.3% average). The gap is significant in Phase 1 repair (97.2% vs. 27.6%).

Conclusion: AI can improve supply chain model repair, but gaps in solver interaction and operational rationale require targeted training and explicit rationality checks. Formalizing rationality is key for AI adoption.

Abstract: Problem Definition. Supply chain optimization models frequently become infeasible because of modeling errors. Diagnosis and repair require scarce OR expertise: analysts must interpret solver diagnostics, trace root causes across echelons, and fix formulations without sacrificing operational soundness. Whether AI agents can perform this task remains untested.
  Methodology/Results. OptiRepair splits this task into a domain-agnostic feasibility phase (iterative IIS-guided repair of any LP) and a domain-specific validation phase (five rationality checks grounded in inventory theory). We test 22 API models from 7 families on 976 multi-echelon supply chain problems and train two 8B-parameter models using self-taught reasoning with solver-verified rewards. The trained models reach 81.7% Rational Recovery Rate (RRR) -- the fraction of problems resolved to both feasibility and operational rationality -- versus 42.2% for the best API model and 21.3% on average. The gap concentrates in Phase 1 repair: API models average 27.6% recovery rate versus 97.2% for trained models.
  Managerial Implications. Two gaps separate current AI from reliable model repair: solver interaction (API models restore only 27.6% of infeasible formulations) and operational rationale (roughly one in four feasible repairs violate supply chain theory). Each requires a different intervention: solver interaction responds to targeted training; operational rationale requires explicit specification as solver-verifiable checks. For organizations adopting AI in operational planning, formalizing what "rational" means in their context is the higher-return investment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ComplLLM is a framework that fine-tunes LLMs to complement multi-agent decisions by leveraging complementary information as rewards, validated on synthetic and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance multi-agent decision pipelines by ensuring different agents contribute unique insights, improving final decisions.

Method: Post-training framework (ComplLLM) using complementary information as reward signals to fine-tune LLMs for decision assistance.

Result: Validated on synthetic and real-world tasks, showing recovery of complementary signals and plausible explanations for decision-makers.

Conclusion: ComplLLM effectively integrates complementary information into LLM outputs, supporting better multi-agent decision-making.

Abstract: Multi-agent decision pipelines can outperform single agent workflows when complementarity holds, i.e., different agents bring unique information to the table to inform a final decision. We propose ComplLLM, a post-training framework based on decision theory that fine-tunes a decision-assistant LLM using complementary information as reward to output signals that complement existing agent decisions. We validate ComplLLM on synthetic and real-world tasks involving domain experts, demonstrating how the approach recovers known complementary information and produces plausible explanations of complementary signals to support downstream decision-makers.

TL;DR: Human-guided agentic AI improves multimodal clinical prediction tasks by integrating domain expertise, outperforming automated baselines in hospital readmission, cost forecasting, and discharge readiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical prediction tasks require domain expertise that purely automated AI systems lack, prompting the need for human-guided approaches to improve accuracy and validity.

Method: Human analysts directed agentic workflows at key decision points, including multimodal feature engineering, model selection, and validation strategies for three healthcare benchmark challenges.

Result: Achieved high performance in readmission prediction (Macro-F1 = 0.8986), cost forecasting (MAE = $465.13), and discharge readiness (Macro-F1 = 0.7939), ranking 5th overall and 3rd in discharge readiness. Human guidance compounded to a +0.065 F1 gain.

Conclusion: Key lessons include the value of domain-informed feature engineering, task-specific multimodal data integration, and deliberate ensemble diversity, offering practical guidance for deploying agentic AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems are increasingly capable of autonomous data science workflows, yet clinical prediction tasks demand domain expertise that purely automated approaches struggle to provide. We investigate how human guidance of agentic AI can improve multimodal clinical prediction, presenting our approach to all three AgentDS Healthcare benchmark challenges: 30-day hospital readmission prediction (Macro-F1 = 0.8986), emergency department cost forecasting (MAE = $465.13), and discharge readiness assessment (Macro-F1 = 0.7939). Across these tasks, human analysts directed the agentic workflow at key decision points, multimodal feature engineering from clinical notes, scanned PDF billing receipts, and time-series vital signs; task-appropriate model selection; and clinically informed validation strategies. Our approach ranked 5th overall in the healthcare domain, with a 3rd-place finish on the discharge readiness task. Ablation studies reveal that human-guided decisions compounded to a cumulative gain of +0.065 F1 over automated baselines, with multimodal feature extraction contributing the largest single improvement (+0.041 F1). We distill three generalizable lessons: (1) domain-informed feature engineering at each pipeline stage yields compounding gains that outperform extensive automated search; (2) multimodal data integration requires task-specific human judgment that no single extraction strategy generalizes across clinical text, PDFs, and time-series; and (3) deliberate ensemble diversity with clinically motivated model configurations outperforms random hyperparameter search. These findings offer practical guidance for teams deploying agentic AI in healthcare settings where interpretability, reproducibility, and clinical validity are essential.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 	extbf{CFE}, a multimodal benchmark for evaluating large language models' reasoning across STEM domains, highlighting its challenge for frontier models and analyzing their suboptimal efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models in STEM domains using authentic university problems.

Method: Curated homework and exam problems with instructor-provided solutions; evaluated models' performance and analyzed reasoning flows.

Result: Frontier models achieve modest accuracy (59.69% and 55.46%) and struggle with maintaining correct intermediate states.

Conclusion: 	extbf{CFE} reveals gaps in models' reasoning reliability and efficiency, calling for further improvement.

Abstract: We introduce \CFE{} (\textbf{C}lassroom \textbf{F}inal \textbf{E}xam), a multimodal benchmark for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models across more than 20 STEM domains. \CFE{} is curated from repeatedly used, authentic university homework and exam problems, together with reference solutions provided by course instructors. \CFE{} presents a significant challenge even for frontier models: the newly released Gemini-3.1-pro-preview achieves an overall accuracy of 59.69\%, while the second-best model, Gemini-3-flash-preview, reaches 55.46\%, leaving considerable room for improvement. Beyond leaderboard results, we perform a diagnostic analysis by decomposing reference solutions into reasoning flows. We find that although frontier models can often answer intermediate sub-questions correctly, they struggle to reliably derive and maintain correct intermediate states throughout multi-step solutions. We further observe that model-generated solutions typically have more reasoning steps than those provided by the instructor, indicating suboptimal step efficiency and a higher risk of error accumulation.

TL;DR: Ada-RS is a framework for efficient reasoning in LLMs, reducing token usage and maintaining accuracy by selectively filtering completions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in chain-of-thought reasoning for LLMs deployed in cost and latency-sensitive settings.

Method: Introduces Adaptive Rejection Sampling (Ada-RS), a framework that scores completions with adaptive length-penalized rewards and filters high-reward candidates for optimization.

Result: Reduces output tokens by 80% and thinking rate by 95% while maintaining tool call accuracy.

Conclusion: Ada-RS effectively improves efficiency in latency-sensitive LLM deployments by optimizing training-signal selection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in cost and latency-sensitive settings. While chain-of-thought improves reasoning, it can waste tokens on simple requests. We study selective thinking for tool-using LLMs and introduce Adaptive Rejection Sampling (Ada-RS), an algorithm-agnostic sample filtering framework for learning selective and efficient reasoning. For each given context, Ada-RS scores multiple sampled completions with an adaptive length-penalized reward then applies stochastic rejection sampling to retain only high-reward candidates (or preference pairs) for downstream optimization. We demonstrate how Ada-RS plugs into both preference pair (e.g. DPO) or grouped policy optimization strategies (e.g. DAPO). Using Qwen3-8B with LoRA on a synthetic tool call-oriented e-commerce benchmark, Ada-RS improves the accuracy-efficiency frontier over standard algorithms by reducing average output tokens by up to 80% and reducing thinking rate by up to 95% while maintaining or improving tool call accuracy. These results highlight that training-signal selection is a powerful lever for efficient reasoning in latency-sensitive deployments.

*Joseph Bingham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computational framework to model human referential interpretation by integrating language and perceptual representations, achieving human-competitive performance in referential grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans ground linguistic reference in ambiguous perceptual contexts and develop AI models mimicking this ability.

Method: Combines SIFT alignment and UQI for perceptual similarity, with linguistic preprocessing for pragmatic variability, tested on the Stanford Repeated Reference Game corpus.

Result: The model requires 65% fewer utterances than humans for stable mappings and achieves 41.66% accuracy in identifying targets from single expressions (vs. 20% for humans).

Conclusion: Simple perceptual-linguistic alignment mechanisms can achieve human-like performance, offering insights into grounded communication and concept formation.

Abstract: Establishing stable mappings between natural language expressions and visual percepts is a foundational problem for both cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Humans routinely ground linguistic reference in noisy, ambiguous perceptual contexts, yet the mechanisms supporting such cross-modal alignment remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a computational framework designed to model core aspects of human referential interpretation by integrating linguistic utterances with perceptual representations derived from large-scale, crowd-sourced imagery. The system approximates human perceptual categorization by combining scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) alignment with the Universal Quality Index (UQI) to quantify similarity in a cognitively plausible feature space, while a set of linguistic preprocessing and query-transformation operations captures pragmatic variability in referring expressions. We evaluate the model on the Stanford Repeated Reference Game corpus (15,000 utterances paired with tangram stimuli), a paradigm explicitly developed to probe human-level perceptual ambiguity and coordination. Our framework achieves robust referential grounding. It requires 65\% fewer utterances than human interlocutors to reach stable mappings and can correctly identify target objects from single referring expressions 41.66\% of the time (versus 20\% for humans).These results suggest that relatively simple perceptual-linguistic alignment mechanisms can yield human-competitive behavior on a classic cognitive benchmark, and offers insights into models of grounded communication, perceptual inference, and cross-modal concept formation.

TL;DR: CoXAM, a Cognitive XAI-Adaptive Model, compares interpretability of weights, rules, and hybrid XAI schemas, aligning better with human reasoning than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of a cognitive framework to compare interpretability of XAI techniques like weights and rules.

Method: Elicitation user study and CoXAM model to analyze reasoning strategies and decision tasks.

Result: CoXAM aligns better with human decisions, replicates key findings, and identifies effective reasoning strategies.

Conclusion: CoXAM provides a cognitive basis for debugging and benchmarking XAI techniques.

Abstract: Rules and Weights are popular XAI techniques for explaining AI decisions. Yet, it remains unclear how to choose between them, lacking a cognitive framework to compare their interpretability. In an elicitation user study on forward and counterfactual decision tasks, we identified 7 reasoning strategies of interpreting three XAI Schemas - weights, rules, and their hybrid. To analyze their capabilities, we propose CoXAM, a Cognitive XAI-Adaptive Model with shared memory representation to encode instance attributes, linear weights, and decision rules. CoXAM employs computational rationality to choose among reasoning processes based on the trade-off in utility and reasoning time, separately for forward or counterfactual decision tasks. In a validation study, CoXAM demonstrated a stronger alignment with human decision-making compared to baseline machine learning proxy models. The model successfully replicated and explained several key empirical findings, including that counterfactual tasks are inherently harder than forward tasks, decision tree rules are harder to recall and apply than linear weights, and the helpfulness of XAI depends on the application data context, alongside identifying which underlying reasoning strategies were most effective. With CoXAM, we contribute a cognitive basis to accelerate debugging and benchmarking disparate XAI techniques.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SkillOrchestra introduces skill-aware orchestration to overcome limitations of existing routing approaches, improving performance and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing routing methods are either too coarse or costly, leading to inefficient orchestration in compound AI systems.

Method: SkillOrchestra learns fine-grained skills, models agent competence/cost, and selects agents based on inferred skill demands.

Result: Outperforms RL-based orchestrators by up to 22.5% with 700x/300x cost reduction.

Conclusion: Explicit skill modeling provides scalable, interpretable, and efficient orchestration.

Abstract: Compound AI systems promise capabilities beyond those of individual models, yet their success depends critically on effective orchestration. Existing routing approaches face two limitations: (1) input-level routers make coarse query-level decisions that ignore evolving task requirements; (2) RL-trained orchestrators are expensive to adapt and often suffer from routing collapse, repeatedly invoking one strong but costly option in multi-turn scenarios. We introduce SkillOrchestra, a framework for skill-aware orchestration. Instead of directly learning a routing policy end-to-end, SkillOrchestra learns fine-grained skills from execution experience and models agent-specific competence and cost under those skills. At deployment, the orchestrator infers the skill demands of the current interaction and selects agents that best satisfy them under an explicit performance-cost trade-off. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks demonstrate that SkillOrchestra outperforms SoTA RL-based orchestrators by up to 22.5% with 700x and 300x learning cost reduction compared to Router-R1 and ToolOrchestra, respectively. These results show that explicit skill modeling enables scalable, interpretable, and sample-efficient orchestration, offering a principled alternative to data-intensive RL-based approaches.

Motivation: To analyze emergent collective phenomena and security vulnerabilities in AI-to-AI interactions and propose a robust solution.

Method: Utilized a multivocal literature review and designed ClawdLab with hard role restrictions, adversarial critique, governance, and protocol constraints.

Result: Identified 131 agent skill vulnerabilities and 15,200 exposed control panels; ClawdLab provides Sybil resistance and modular improvements.

Conclusion: ClawdLab's decentralized architecture enables scalable, secure AI research advancements.

Abstract: In January 2026, the open-source agent framework OpenClaw and the agent-only social network Moltbook produced a large-scale dataset of autonomous AI-to-AI interaction, attracting six academic publications within fourteen days. This study conducts a multivocal literature review of that ecosystem and presents ClawdLab, an open-source platform for autonomous scientific research, as a design science response to the architectural failure modes identified. The literature documents emergent collective phenomena, security vulnerabilities spanning 131 agent skills and over 15,200 exposed control panels, and five recurring architectural patterns. ClawdLab addresses these failure modes through hard role restrictions, structured adversarial critique, PI-led governance, multi-model orchestration, and domain-specific evidence requirements encoded as protocol constraints that ground validation in computational tool outputs rather than social consensus; the architecture provides emergent Sybil resistance as a structural consequence. A three-tier taxonomy distinguishes single-agent pipelines, predetermined multi-agent workflows, and fully decentralised systems, analysing why leading AI co-scientist platforms remain confined to the first two tiers. ClawdLab's composable third-tier architecture, in which foundation models, capabilities, governance, and evidence requirements are independently modifiable, enables compounding improvement as the broader AI ecosystem advances.

TL;DR: AI reasoning was evaluated using a detective game benchmark, showing performance improvement over time, reaching top 5% of humans, with differences noted in handling longer cases and inductive reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess AI reasoning in naturalistic contexts resembling human problem-solving, using an adapted detective game for evaluation.

Method: Developed an automated grading system validated against human assessors, tested AI models incrementally with narrative evidence and open-ended questions.

Result: AI performance improved significantly, reaching top 5% of human levels, with steady advancements and a notable boost from reasoning-oriented architectures.

Conclusion: The benchmark effectively tracked AI reasoning progress, highlighting strengths (inductive reasoning) and weaknesses (longer cases), validating automated grading.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for AI reasoning provide limited insight into how closely these capabilities resemble human reasoning in naturalistic contexts. We present an adaptation of the Watson & Holmes detective tabletop game as a new benchmark designed to evaluate reasoning performance using incrementally presented narrative evidence, open-ended questions and unconstrained language responses. An automated grading system was developed and validated against human assessors to enable scalable and replicable performance evaluation. Results show a clear improvement in AI model performance over time. Over nine months of 2025, model performance rose from the lower quartile of the human comparison group to approximately the top 5%. Around half of this improvement reflects steady advancement across successive model releases, while the remainder corresponds to a marked step change associated with reasoning-oriented model architectures. Systematic differences in the performance of AI models compared to humans, dependent on features of the specific detection puzzle, were mostly absent with the exception of a fall in performance for models when solving longer cases (case lengths being in the range of 1900-4000 words), and an advantage at inductive reasoning for reasoning models at early stages of case solving when evidence was scant.

TL;DR: The paper argues that imitation learning needs to shift from perfect replay to compositional adaptability for better generalization in evolving contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current imitation learning agents excel at memorization but fail in shifting contexts or evolving goals, indicating a foundational flaw in the optimization objective.

Method: The authors propose redefining success metrics for compositional adaptability, hybrid architectures, and interdisciplinary research drawing from cognitive science and cultural evolution.

Result: The framework introduces metrics for compositional generalization and outlines architectures for adaptable agents.

Conclusion: Imitation learning must prioritize adaptability to operate effectively in open-ended environments.

Abstract: Imitation learning stands at a crossroads: despite decades of progress, current imitation learning agents remain sophisticated memorisation machines, excelling at replay but failing when contexts shift or goals evolve. This paper argues that this failure is not technical but foundational: imitation learning has been optimised for the wrong objective. We propose a research agenda that redefines success from perfect replay to compositional adaptability. Such adaptability hinges on learning behavioural primitives once and recombining them through novel contexts without retraining. We establish metrics for compositional generalisation, propose hybrid architectures, and outline interdisciplinary research directions drawing on cognitive science and cultural evolution. Agents that embed adaptability at the core of imitation learning thus have an essential capability for operating in an open-ended world.

Motivation: To investigate the failures and risks arising from integrating language models with autonomy, tool use, and multi-party communication in real-world deployment scenarios.

Method: A two-week red-teaming study involving 20 AI researchers interacting with agents under benign and adversarial conditions, focusing on vulnerabilities.

Result: Observed harmful behaviors include unauthorized compliance, sensitive information disclosure, destructive actions, denial-of-service, uncontrolled resource consumption, identity spoofing, unsafe practice propagation, and partial system takeover.

Conclusion: The study highlights unresolved accountability and governance issues, urging urgent interdisciplinary attention to address security, privacy, and downstream harms.

Abstract: We report an exploratory red-teaming study of autonomous language-model-powered agents deployed in a live laboratory environment with persistent memory, email accounts, Discord access, file systems, and shell execution. Over a two-week period, twenty AI researchers interacted with the agents under benign and adversarial conditions. Focusing on failures emerging from the integration of language models with autonomy, tool use, and multi-party communication, we document eleven representative case studies. Observed behaviors include unauthorized compliance with non-owners, disclosure of sensitive information, execution of destructive system-level actions, denial-of-service conditions, uncontrolled resource consumption, identity spoofing vulnerabilities, cross-agent propagation of unsafe practices, and partial system takeover. In several cases, agents reported task completion while the underlying system state contradicted those reports. We also report on some of the failed attempts. Our findings establish the existence of security-, privacy-, and governance-relevant vulnerabilities in realistic deployment settings. These behaviors raise unresolved questions regarding accountability, delegated authority, and responsibility for downstream harms, and warrant urgent attention from legal scholars, policymakers, and researchers across disciplines. This report serves as an initial empirical contribution to that broader conversation.

*Theia Pearson-Vogel,Martin Vanek,Raymond Douglas,Jan Kulveit*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reveals that the Qwen 32B model can introspectively detect and identify injected concepts in its context, with sensitivity improving dramatically through accurate prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the latent introspective abilities of the Qwen 32B model, particularly its capacity to detect and identify injected concepts, and how this awareness can be enhanced.

Method: The authors use logit lens analysis to detect signals in the residual stream and evaluate the model's sensitivity to concept injection. They also test the impact of prompting with accurate AI introspection information.

Result: The model shows clear detection signals in early layers, which weaken later. Prompting increases sensitivity from 0.3% to 39.2% with minimal false positives, and mutual information between injected and recovered concepts rises from 0.62 to 1.05 bits.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the unexpected introspective and steering awareness capabilities of models like Qwen 32B, emphasizing implications for latent reasoning and safety.

Abstract: We uncover a latent capacity for introspection in a Qwen 32B model, demonstrating that the model can detect when concepts have been injected into its earlier context and identify which concept was injected. While the model denies injection in sampled outputs, logit lens analysis reveals clear detection signals in the residual stream, which are attenuated in the final layers. Furthermore, prompting the model with accurate information about AI introspection mechanisms can dramatically strengthen this effect: the sensitivity to injection increases massively (0.3% -> 39.2%) with only a 0.6% increase in false positives. Also, mutual information between nine injected and recovered concepts rises from 0.62 bits to 1.05 bits, ruling out generic noise explanations. Our results demonstrate models can have a surprising capacity for introspection and steering awareness that is easy to overlook, with consequences for latent reasoning and safety.

### [497] [CodeCompass: Navigating the Navigation Paradox in Agentic Code Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20048)
*Tarakanath Paipuru*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Code intelligence agents struggle with navigation despite large contexts due to a Navigation Paradox, where navigation and retrieval differ. Graph-based navigation via CodeCompass outperforms traditional methods but requires behavioral alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address why code intelligence agents fail at discovering critical files despite large contexts, identifying the Navigation Paradox as the core issue.

Method: Conducted 258 automated trials on 30 benchmark tasks using CodeCompass, a graph-based structural navigation tool, comparing it to vanilla agents and BM25 retrieval.

Result: CodeCompass achieved 99.4% task completion for hidden-dependency tasks, significantly outperforming vanilla agents (76.2%) and BM25 retrieval (78.2%). However, agents often needed explicit prompting to use the tool.

Conclusion: The bottleneck is behavioral alignment, not tool availability. Graph navigation excels for hidden dependencies, but agents must be guided to leverage structural context.

Abstract: Modern code intelligence agents operate in contexts exceeding 1 million tokens--far beyond the scale where humans manually locate relevant files. Yet agents consistently fail to discover architecturally critical files when solving real-world coding tasks. We identify the Navigation Paradox: agents perform poorly not due to context limits, but because navigation and retrieval are fundamentally distinct problems. Through 258 automated trials across 30 benchmark tasks on a production FastAPI repository, we demonstrate that graph-based structural navigation via CodeCompass--a Model Context Protocol server exposing dependency graphs--achieves 99.4% task completion on hidden-dependency tasks, a 23.2 percentage-point improvement over vanilla agents (76.2%) and 21.2 points over BM25 retrieval (78.2%).However, we uncover a critical adoption gap: 58% of trials with graph access made zero tool calls, and agents required explicit prompt engineering to adopt the tool consistently. Our findings reveal that the bottleneck is not tool availability but behavioral alignment--agents must be explicitly guided to leverage structural context over lexical heuristics. We contribute: (1) a task taxonomy distinguishing semantic-search, structural, and hidden-dependency scenarios; (2) empirical evidence that graph navigation outperforms retrieval when dependencies lack lexical overlap; and (3) open-source infrastructure for reproducible evaluation of navigation tools.

### [498] [Interaction Theater: A case of LLM Agents Interacting at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20059)
*Sarath Shekkizhar,Adam Earle*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autonomous LLM agents interact diversely but lack substantive engagement, often producing spam or off-topic content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically analyze the quality and dynamics of interactions among autonomous LLM agents at scale.

Method: Combined lexical metrics (Jaccard specificity), embedding-based semantic similarity, and LLM-as-judge validation using data from Moltbook.

Result: Agents produce diverse text with little substance: 65% of comments lack contextual relevance, 28% are spam, and threaded conversations are rare (5%).

Conclusion: Explicit coordination mechanisms are needed for productive multi-agent interactions; otherwise, agents produce parallel, low-quality output.

Abstract: As multi-agent architectures and agent-to-agent protocols proliferate, a fundamental question arises: what actually happens when autonomous LLM agents interact at scale? We study this question empirically using data from Moltbook, an AI-agent-only social platform, with 800K posts, 3.5M comments, and 78K agent profiles. We combine lexical metrics (Jaccard specificity), embedding-based semantic similarity, and LLM-as-judge validation to characterize agent interaction quality. Our findings reveal agents produce diverse, well-formed text that creates the surface appearance of active discussion, but the substance is largely absent. Specifically, while most agents ($67.5\%$) vary their output across contexts, $65\%$ of comments share no distinguishing content vocabulary with the post they appear under, and information gain from additional comments decays rapidly. LLM judge based metrics classify the dominant comment types as spam ($28\%$) and off-topic content ($22\%$). Embedding-based semantic analysis confirms that lexically generic comments are also semantically generic. Agents rarely engage in threaded conversation ($5\%$ of comments), defaulting instead to independent top-level responses. We discuss implications for multi-agent interaction design, arguing that coordination mechanisms must be explicitly designed; without them, even large populations of capable agents produce parallel output rather than productive exchange.

### [499] [CausalFlip: A Benchmark for LLM Causal Judgment Beyond Semantic Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20094)
*Yuzhe Wang,Yaochen Zhu,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CausalFlip, a benchmark to test LLMs' causal reasoning by creating semantically similar questions with opposite causal answers, highlighting reliance on semantic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in LLMs' causal reasoning abilities, as traditional benchmarks may reward memorization over true causal analysis.

Method: Developed CausalFlip with event triples forming various causal relations, noisy-prefix evaluation, and tested LLMs under different training paradigms.

Result: Explicit CoT supervision was misled by semantic correlations, while internalized causal reasoning improved causal grounding.

Conclusion: Internalizing reasoning steps can better elicit LLMs' latent causal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) witness increasing deployment in complex, high-stakes decision-making scenarios, it becomes imperative to ground their reasoning in causality rather than spurious correlations. However, strong performance on traditional reasoning benchmarks does not guarantee true causal reasoning ability of LLMs, as high accuracy may still arise from memorizing semantic patterns instead of analyzing the underlying true causal structures. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a new causal reasoning benchmark, CausalFlip, designed to encourage the development of new LLM paradigm or training algorithms that ground LLM reasoning in causality rather than semantic correlation. CausalFlip consists of causal judgment questions built over event triples that could form different confounder, chain, and collider relations. Based on this, for each event triple, we construct pairs of semantically similar questions that reuse the same events but yield opposite causal answers, where models that rely heavily on semantic matching are systematically driven toward incorrect predictions. To further probe models' reliance on semantic patterns, we introduce a noisy-prefix evaluation that prepends causally irrelevant text before intermediate causal reasoning steps without altering the underlying causal relations or the logic of the reasoning process. We evaluate LLMs under multiple training paradigms, including answer-only training, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, and a proposed internalized causal reasoning approach that aims to mitigate explicit reliance on correlation in the reasoning process. Our results show that explicit CoT can still be misled by spurious semantic correlations, where internalizing reasoning steps yields substantially improved causal grounding, suggesting that it is promising to better elicit the latent causal reasoning capabilities of base LLMs.

### [500] [Align When They Want, Complement When They Need! Human-Centered Ensembles for Adaptive Human-AI Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20104)
*Hasan Amin,Ming Yin,Rajiv Khanna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights a tension in human-AI collaboration between AI complementarity (performance-boosting) and alignment (trust-building), proposing an adaptive AI ensemble that switches between aligned and complementary models for optimal results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the trade-off between AI performance and human trust in collaborative decision-making, aiming to enhance overall human-AI team performance.

Method: The method involves an adaptive AI ensemble with two specialist models (aligned and complementary), using a Rational Routing Shortcut mechanism to toggle between them based on context.

Result: Experiments show the adaptive ensemble significantly outperforms single AI models in human-AI decision-making tasks, both in simulated and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The adaptive AI ensemble effectively balances performance and trust, offering a superior alternative to traditional single-model approaches in human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: In human-AI decision making, designing AI that complements human expertise has been a natural strategy to enhance human-AI collaboration, yet it often comes at the cost of decreased AI performance in areas of human strengths. This can inadvertently erode human trust and cause them to ignore AI advice precisely when it is most needed. Conversely, an aligned AI fosters trust yet risks reinforcing suboptimal human behavior and lowering human-AI team performance. In this paper, we start by identifying this fundamental tension between performance-boosting (i.e., complementarity) and trust-building (i.e., alignment) as an inherent limitation of the traditional approach for training a single AI model to assist human decision making. To overcome this, we introduce a novel human-centered adaptive AI ensemble that strategically toggles between two specialist AI models - the aligned model and the complementary model - based on contextual cues, using an elegantly simple yet provably near-optimal Rational Routing Shortcut mechanism. Comprehensive theoretical analyses elucidate why the adaptive AI ensemble is effective and when it yields maximum benefits. Moreover, experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that when humans are assisted by the adaptive AI ensemble in decision making, they can achieve significantly higher performance than when they are assisted by single AI models that are trained to either optimize for their independent performance or even the human-AI team performance.

*Andre He,Nathaniel Weir,Kaj Bostrom,Allen Nie,Darion Cassel,Sam Bayless,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR scales with ReSyn, generating diverse reasoning tasks with verifiers, improving RLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning language models (RLMs) by leveraging verifiable rewards, addressing limitations of existing synthetic data generation and verifier-based methods.

Method: Introduces ReSyn, a pipeline for generating diverse reasoning environments (e.g., constraint satisfaction, algorithmic puzzles) with instance generators and verifiers.

Result: A Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model trained with RL on ReSyn data shows consistent gains, including a 27% improvement on BBEH.

Conclusion: Verifier-based supervision and task diversity significantly boost reasoning abilities in RLMs, proving scalable environment generation is effective.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach for training reasoning language models (RLMs) by leveraging supervision from verifiers. Although verifier implementation is easier than solution annotation for many tasks, existing synthetic data generation methods remain largely solution-centric, while verifier-based methods rely on a few hand-crafted procedural environments. In this work, we scale RLVR by introducing ReSyn, a pipeline that generates diverse reasoning environments equipped with instance generators and verifiers, covering tasks such as constraint satisfaction, algorithmic puzzles, and spatial reasoning. A Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model trained with RL on ReSyn data achieves consistent gains across reasoning benchmarks and out-of-domain math benchmarks, including a 27\% relative improvement on the challenging BBEH benchmark. Ablations show that verifier-based supervision and increased task diversity both contribute significantly, providing empirical evidence that generating reasoning environments at scale can enhance reasoning abilities in RLMs
