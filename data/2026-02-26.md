### [1] [StoryTailor:A Zero-Shot Pipeline for Action-Rich Multi-Subject Visual Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21273)
*Jinghao Hu,Yuhe Zhang,GuoHua Geng,Kang Li,Han Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StoryTailor is a zero-shot pipeline for generating coherent, identity-preserving image sequences from narrative prompts. It outperforms baselines in faithfulness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in generating multi-frame visual narratives—balancing action text faithfulness, subject identity fidelity, and background continuity—without fine-tuning.

Method: Uses three modules: Gaussian-Centered Attention (GCA) for subject focus, Action-Boost Singular Value Reweighting (AB-SVR) to enhance action-related text embeddings, and Selective Forgetting Cache (SFC) for background continuity.

Result: Improves CLIP-T by 10-15%, maintains competitive CLIP-I scores, and runs efficiently on a 24 GB GPU, outperforming baselines like FluxKontext in speed and quality.

Conclusion: StoryTailor effectively generates expressive, stable visual narratives with high fidelity and efficiency, setting a strong benchmark for zero-shot methods.

Abstract: Generating multi-frame, action-rich visual narratives without fine-tuning faces a threefold tension: action text faithfulness, subject identity fidelity, and cross-frame background continuity. We propose StoryTailor, a zero-shot pipeline that runs on a single RTX 4090 (24 GB) and produces temporally coherent, identity-preserving image sequences from a long narrative prompt, per-subject references, and grounding boxes. Three synergistic modules drive the system: Gaussian-Centered Attention (GCA) to dynamically focus on each subject core and ease grounding-box overlaps; Action-Boost Singular Value Reweighting (AB-SVR) to amplify action-related directions in the text embedding space; and Selective Forgetting Cache (SFC) that retains transferable background cues, forgets nonessential history, and selectively surfaces retained cues to build cross-scene semantic ties. Compared with baseline methods, experiments show that CLIP-T improves by up to 10-15%, with DreamSim lower than strong baselines, while CLIP-I stays in a visually acceptable, competitive range. With matched resolution and steps on a 24 GB GPU, inference is faster than FluxKontext. Qualitatively, StoryTailor delivers expressive interactions and evolving yet stable scenes.

*Yifan Wang,Francesco Pittaluga,Zaid Tasneem,Chenyu You,Manmohan Chandraker,Ziyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HorizonForge introduces a unified framework for photorealistic and controllable driving scene generation using editable Gaussian Splats and Meshes, with language-driven vehicle insertion and noise-aware video diffusion for rendering. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods in user preference and FID metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for realistic and scalable autonomous driving simulation with precise control over scene generation, addressing limitations in existing approaches that lack joint photorealism and fine-grained manipulation.

Method: HorizonForge combines Gaussian Splats and Meshes for 3D reconstruction and manipulation, uses language-driven vehicle insertion, and employs a noise-aware video diffusion process for rendering with spatial and temporal consistency. It avoids per-trajectory optimization for efficiency.

Result: The framework achieves an 83.4% user-preference gain and a 25.19% FID improvement over the second-best state-of-the-art method, demonstrating higher fidelity and coherent synthesis.

Conclusion: HorizonForge provides a simple yet powerful solution for photorealistic, controllable driving simulation, validated by extensive experiments and the introduction of the HorizonSuite benchmark for standardized evaluation.

Abstract: Controllable driving scene generation is critical for realistic and scalable autonomous driving simulation, yet existing approaches struggle to jointly achieve photorealism and precise control. We introduce HorizonForge, a unified framework that reconstructs scenes as editable Gaussian Splats and Meshes, enabling fine-grained 3D manipulation and language-driven vehicle insertion. Edits are rendered through a noise-aware video diffusion process that enforces spatial and temporal consistency, producing diverse scene variations in a single feed-forward pass without per-trajectory optimization. To standardize evaluation, we further propose HorizonSuite, a comprehensive benchmark spanning ego- and agent-level editing tasks such as trajectory modifications and object manipulation. Extensive experiments show that Gaussian-Mesh representation delivers substantially higher fidelity than alternative 3D representations, and that temporal priors from video diffusion are essential for coherent synthesis. Combining these findings, HorizonForge establishes a simple yet powerful paradigm for photorealistic, controllable driving simulation, achieving an 83.4% user-preference gain and a 25.19% FID improvement over the second best state-of-the-art method.

*Dominik Schneider,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Sampath Rapuri,Vishalroshan Anil,Aiza Maksutova,Yiqing Shen,Jan Emily Mangulabnan,Hao Ding,Jose L. Porras,Masaru Ishii,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for synthesizing rare safety-critical OR events using video diffusion outperforms baselines and aids AI model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of curating rare OR event datasets for ambient intelligence development.

Method: Uses geometric abstraction, conditioning, and diffusion models to generate realistic OR videos and synthetic datasets.

Result: Achieves better metrics than baselines, aids AI model training with 70.13% recall, and validates design choices via ablation.

Conclusion: Demonstrates controlled synthesis of OR events and potential to support ambient intelligence.

Abstract: Purpose: Curating large-scale datasets of operating room (OR) workflow, encompassing rare, safety-critical, or atypical events, remains operationally and ethically challenging. This data bottleneck complicates the development of ambient intelligence for detecting, understanding, and mitigating rare or safety-critical events in the OR.
  Methods: This work presents an OR video diffusion framework that enables controlled synthesis of rare and safety-critical events. The framework integrates a geometric abstraction module, a conditioning module, and a fine-tuned diffusion model to first transform OR scenes into abstract geometric representations, then condition the synthesis process, and finally generate realistic OR event videos. Using this framework, we also curate a synthetic dataset to train and validate AI models for detecting near-misses of sterile-field violations.
  Results: In synthesizing routine OR events, our method outperforms off-the-shelf video diffusion baselines, achieving lower FVD/LPIPS and higher SSIM/PSNR in both in- and out-of-domain datasets. Through qualitative results, we illustrate its ability for controlled video synthesis of counterfactual events. An AI model trained and validated on the generated synthetic data achieved a RECALL of 70.13% in detecting near safety-critical events. Finally, we conduct an ablation study to quantify performance gains from key design choices.
  Conclusion: Our solution enables controlled synthesis of routine and rare OR events from abstract geometric representations. Beyond demonstrating its capability to generate rare and safety-critical scenarios, we show its potential to support the development of ambient intelligence models.

### [4] [Momentum Memory for Knowledge Distillation in Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21395)
*Yongxin Guo,Hao Lu,Onur C. Koyun,Zhengjie Zhu,Muhammet Fatih Demir,Metin Nafi Gurcan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoMKD improves cross-modal knowledge distillation in cancer diagnosis by using momentum-updated memory to stabilize training and decoupling gradients for better histology feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KD methods suffer from instability due to limited batch-local alignment, hindering clinical translation of multimodal cancer diagnosis.

Method: MoMKD introduces momentum-updated memory for cross-modal distillation and decouples gradients to prevent genomic signal dominance.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on TCGA-BRCA and in-house datasets, showing strong generalization with histology-only inference.

Conclusion: MoMKD provides a robust and generalizable framework for computational pathology, advancing multimodal learning.

Abstract: Multimodal learning that integrates genomics and histopathology has shown strong potential in cancer diagnosis, yet its clinical translation is hindered by the limited availability of paired histology-genomics data. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a practical solution by transferring genomic supervision into histopathology models, enabling accurate inference using histology alone. However, existing KD methods rely on batch-local alignment, which introduces instability due to limited within-batch comparisons and ultimately degrades performance.
  To address these limitations, we propose Momentum Memory Knowledge Distillation (MoMKD), a cross-modal distillation framework driven by a momentum-updated memory. This memory aggregates genomic and histopathology information across batches, effectively enlarging the supervisory context available to each mini-batch. Furthermore, we decouple the gradients of the genomics and histology branches, preventing genomic signals from dominating histology feature learning during training and eliminating the modality-gap issue at inference time.
  Extensive experiments on the TCGA-BRCA benchmark (HER2, PR, and ODX classification tasks) and an independent in-house testing dataset demonstrate that MoMKD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MIL and multimodal KD baselines, delivering strong performance and generalization under histology-only inference. Overall, MoMKD establishes a robust and generalizable knowledge distillation paradigm for computational pathology.

### [5] [MMLoP: Multi-Modal Low-Rank Prompting for Efficient Vision-Language Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21397)
*Sajjad Ghiasvand,Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie,Mahnoosh Alizadeh,Ramtin Pedarsani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMLoP is a low-rank prompting framework for vision-language models that achieves high performance with only 11.5K trainable parameters, addressing the parameter inefficiency of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt tuning methods for vision-language models increase trainable parameters excessively, losing the efficiency of prompt tuning. MMLoP aims to maintain performance while drastically reducing parameters.

Method: MMLoP uses low-rank factorization for vision and text prompts, a self-regulating consistency loss, uniform drift correction, and shared up-projection to enhance cross-modal alignment.

Result: MMLoP outperforms many methods with far more parameters, achieving a harmonic mean of 79.70% on base-to-novel generalization.

Conclusion: MMLoP successfully balances accuracy and parameter efficiency, making it a practical solution for prompt tuning in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Prompt learning has become a dominant paradigm for adapting vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP to downstream tasks without modifying pretrained weights. While extending prompts to both vision and text encoders across multiple transformer layers significantly boosts performance, it dramatically increases the number of trainable parameters, with state-of-the-art methods requiring millions of parameters and abandoning the parameter efficiency that makes prompt tuning attractive. In this work, we propose \textbf{MMLoP} (\textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{Lo}w-Rank \textbf{P}rompting), a framework that achieves deep multi-modal prompting with only \textbf{11.5K trainable parameters}, comparable to early text-only methods like CoOp. MMLoP parameterizes vision and text prompts at each transformer layer through a low-rank factorization, which serves as an implicit regularizer against overfitting on few-shot training data. To further close the accuracy gap with state-of-the-art methods, we introduce three complementary components: a self-regulating consistency loss that anchors prompted representations to frozen zero-shot CLIP features at both the feature and logit levels, a uniform drift correction that removes the global embedding shift induced by prompt tuning to preserve class-discriminative structure, and a shared up-projection that couples vision and text prompts through a common low-rank factor to enforce cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and 11 diverse datasets demonstrate that MMLoP achieves a highly favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, outperforming the majority of existing methods including those with orders of magnitude more parameters, while achieving a harmonic mean of 79.70\% on base-to-novel generalization.

### [6] [FlowFixer: Towards Detail-Preserving Subject-Driven Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21402)
*Jinyoung Jun,Won-Dong Jang,Wenbin Ouyang,Raghudeep Gadde,Jungbeom Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowFixer is a refinement framework for SDG that enhances detail fidelity by using image-to-image translation and self-supervised training, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses loss of fine details in SDG due to scale and perspective changes, avoiding language prompt ambiguities.

Method: Uses direct image-to-image translation, one-step denoising for self-supervised training, and a keypoint matching-based metric for assessment.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art SDG methods in qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: Sets a new benchmark for high-fidelity subject-driven generation.

Abstract: We present FlowFixer, a refinement framework for subject-driven generation (SDG) that restores fine details lost during generation caused by changes in scale and perspective of a subject. FlowFixer proposes direct image-to-image translation from visual references, avoiding ambiguities in language prompts. To enable image-to-image training, we introduce a one-step denoising scheme to generate self-supervised training data, which automatically removes high-frequency details while preserving global structure, effectively simulating real-world SDG errors. We further propose a keypoint matching-based metric to properly assess fidelity in details beyond semantic similarities usually measured by CLIP or DINO. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowFixer outperforms state-of-the-art SDG methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, setting a new benchmark for high-fidelity subject-driven generation.

### [7] [WildSVG: Towards Reliable SVG Generation Under Real-Word Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21416)
*Marco Terral,Haotian Zhang,Tianyang Zhang,Meng Lin,Xiaoqing Xie,Haoran Dai,Darsh Kaushik,Pai Peng,Nicklas Scharpff,David Vazquez,Joan Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SVG extraction from images, highlighting challenges in real-world scenarios and proposing the WildSVG Benchmark to address the lack of benchmarks. Current models underperform but iterative refinement shows promise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in scalable vector graphics (SVG) extraction from noisy, real-world images, as existing models struggle with noise and domain shifts.

Method: Introduces the WildSVG Benchmark, consisting of Natural WildSVG (real images with SVG annotations) and Synthetic WildSVG (complex SVG renderings in real scenes).

Result: Benchmarked state-of-the-art models show poor performance in real-world SVG extraction, but iterative refinement methods indicate potential for improvement.

Conclusion: While current models are insufficient for reliable SVG extraction in real scenarios, the WildSVG Benchmark provides a foundation for future advancements, and iterative refinement is a promising direction.

Abstract: We introduce the task of SVG extraction, which consists in translating specific visual inputs from an image into scalable vector graphics. Existing multimodal models achieve strong results when generating SVGs from clean renderings or textual descriptions, but they fall short in real-world scenarios where natural images introduce noise, clutter, and domain shifts. A central challenge in this direction is the lack of suitable benchmarks. To address this need, we introduce the WildSVG Benchmark, formed by two complementary datasets: Natural WildSVG, built from real images containing company logos paired with their SVG annotations, and Synthetic WildSVG, which blends complex SVG renderings into real scenes to simulate difficult conditions. Together, these resources provide the first foundation for systematic benchmarking SVG extraction. We benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models and find that current approaches perform well below what is needed for reliable SVG extraction in real scenarios. Nonetheless, iterative refinement methods point to a promising path forward, and model capabilities are steadily improving

### [8] [ECHOSAT: Estimating Canopy Height Over Space And Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21421)
*Jan Pauls,Karsten Schrödter,Sven Ligensa,Martin Schwartz,Berkant Turan,Max Zimmer,Sassan Saatchi,Sebastian Pokutta,Philippe Ciais,Fabian Gieseke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ECHOSAT introduces a global, temporally consistent tree height map at 10m resolution using multi-sensor satellite data and a vision transformer model, improving accuracy and enabling dynamic forest monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing global tree height maps lack temporal dynamics, crucial for accurate carbon accounting and climate change mitigation.

Method: Uses multi-sensor satellite data to train a vision transformer model for pixel-level temporal regression, regularized by a self-supervised growth loss aligning with natural tree development.

Result: Improves state-of-the-art accuracy in single-year predictions and offers the first global-scale map quantifying tree growth and disturbances over time.

Conclusion: ECHOSAT advances carbon monitoring and disturbance assessment globally, with maps accessible for further use.

Abstract: Forest monitoring is critical for climate change mitigation. However, existing global tree height maps provide only static snapshots and do not capture temporal forest dynamics, which are essential for accurate carbon accounting. We introduce ECHOSAT, a global and temporally consistent tree height map at 10 m resolution spanning multiple years. To this end, we resort to multi-sensor satellite data to train a specialized vision transformer model, which performs pixel-level temporal regression. A self-supervised growth loss regularizes the predictions to follow growth curves that are in line with natural tree development, including gradual height increases over time, but also abrupt declines due to forest loss events such as fires. Our experimental evaluation shows that our model improves state-of-the-art accuracies in the context of single-year predictions. We also provide the first global-scale height map that accurately quantifies tree growth and disturbances over time. We expect ECHOSAT to advance global efforts in carbon monitoring and disturbance assessment. The maps can be accessed at https://github.com/ai4forest/echosat.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 	extit{tugturn.py}, a Python-based workflow for 3D markerless Instrumented Timed Up and Go (TUG) analysis, offering phase segmentation, gait-event detection, and stability metrics, with reproducible outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of robust and reproducible markerless pipelines for TUG analysis, supporting clinical and research decision-making.

Method: The workflow combines phase segmentation, gait-event detection, spatiotemporal metrics, intersegmental coordination, and dynamic stability analysis using spatial thresholds and a relative-distance strategy.

Result: The pipeline produces reproducible artifacts like HTML reports, CSV tables, and visual outputs, configured via TOML files.

Conclusion: 	extit{tugturn.py} is a valuable tool for markerless biomechanical TUG analysis, enhancing reproducibility and clinical utility.

Abstract: Instrumented Timed Up and Go (TUG) analysis can support clinical and research decision-making, but robust and reproducible markerless pipelines are still limited. We present \textit{tugturn.py}, a Python-based workflow for 3D markerless TUG processing that combines phase segmentation, gait-event detection, spatiotemporal metrics, intersegmental coordination, and dynamic stability analysis. The pipeline uses spatial thresholds to segment each trial into stand, first gait, turning, second gait, and sit phases, and applies a relative-distance strategy to detect heel-strike and toe-off events within valid gait windows. In addition to conventional kinematics, \textit{tugturn} provides Vector Coding outputs and Extrapolated Center of Mass (XCoM)-based metrics. The software is configured through TOML files and produces reproducible artifacts, including HTML reports, CSV tables, and quality-assurance visual outputs. A complete runnable example is provided with test data and command-line instructions. This manuscript describes the implementation, outputs, and reproducibility workflow of \textit{tugturn} as a focused software contribution for markerless biomechanical TUG analysis.

### [10] [PSF-Med: Measuring and Explaining Paraphrase Sensitivity in Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21428)
*Binesh Sadanandan,Vahid Behzadan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Paraphrase Sensitivity Failure (PSF)-Med, a benchmark highlighting inconsistency in medical VLMs' answers due to paraphrased questions. It identifies flip rates, analyzes underlying mechanisms, and proposes a method to reduce flips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical VLMs can give inconsistent answers when questions are rephrased, posing deployment risks. This study aims to quantify and address this issue.

Method: Developed PSF-Med benchmark with 19,748 chest X-ray questions and 92,000 paraphrases. Evaluated six VLMs, used GemmaScope 2 SAEs to analyze MedGemma 4B, and identified features causing flips.

Result: Flip rates ranged from 8% to 58%. A sparse feature correlated with flips was identified; clamping it reduced flips by 31% with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Flip rate alone is insufficient for robustness; evaluations should assess both paraphrase stability and image reliance. The identified feature offers a practical fix.

Abstract: Medical Vision Language Models (VLMs) can change their answers when clinicians rephrase the same question, which raises deployment risks. We introduce Paraphrase Sensitivity Failure (PSF)-Med, a benchmark of 19,748 chest Xray questions paired with about 92,000 meaningpreserving paraphrases across MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. Across six medical VLMs, we measure yes/no flips for the same image and find flip rates from 8% to 58%. However, low flip rate does not imply visual grounding: text-only baselines show that some models stay consistent even when the image is removed, suggesting they rely on language priors. To study mechanisms in one model, we apply GemmaScope 2 Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to MedGemma 4B and analyze FlipBank, a curated set of 158 flip cases. We identify a sparse feature at layer 17 that correlates with prompt framing and predicts decision margin shifts. In causal patching, removing this feature's contribution recovers 45% of the yesminus-no logit margin on average and fully reverses 15% of flips. Acting on this finding, we show that clamping the identified feature at inference reduces flip rates by 31% relative with only a 1.3 percentage-point accuracy cost, while also decreasing text-prior reliance. These results suggest that flip rate alone is not enough; robustness evaluations should test both paraphrase stability and image reliance.

### [11] [Synergizing Understanding and Generation with Interleaved Analyzing-Drafting Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21435)
*Shengqiong Wu,Bobo Li,Xinkai Wang,Xiangtai Li,Lei Cui,Furu Wei,Shuicheng Yan,Hao Fei,Tat-seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AD-Loop, a problem-solving paradigm for UVLMs that alternates between understanding and generation tasks to achieve synergy, showing improved performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UVLMs treat understanding and generation as parallel skills, lacking synergy. The authors aim to create a framework enabling dynamic interaction between these capabilities.

Method: Proposes AD-Loop, a think paradigm alternating analytic and drafting operations. Training involves supervised learning on interleaved thought data, followed by reinforcement learning.

Result: AD-Loop improves performance on standard benchmarks for understanding and generation, demonstrating strong transferability across UVLM architectures.

Conclusion: AD-Loop is a principled and broadly applicable strategy for synergizing comprehension and creation in UVLMs.

Abstract: Unified Vision-Language Models (UVLMs) aim to advance multimodal learning by supporting both understanding and generation within a single framework. However, existing approaches largely focus on architectural unification while overlooking the need for explicit interaction between the two capabilities during task solving. As a result, current models treat understanding and generation as parallel skills rather than synergistic processes. To achieve real synergy, we introduce the interleaved Analyzing-Drafting problem-solving loop (AD-Loop), a new think paradigm that dynamically alternates between analytic and drafting operations. By interleaving textual thoughts with visual thoughts, AD-Loop enables models to iteratively refine both comprehension and outputs, fostering genuine synergy. To train this mechanism, we design a two-stage strategy: supervised learning on interleaved thought data to initialize alternation, followed by reinforcement learning to promote adaptive and autonomous control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AD-Loop consistently improves performance across standard benchmarks for both understanding and generation, with strong transferability to various UVLMs architectures. Visual analyses further validate the effectiveness of implicit visual thoughts. These results highlight AD-Loop as a principled and broadly applicable strategy for synergizing comprehension and creation. The project page is at https://sqwu.top/AD-Loop.

### [12] [Adversarial Robustness of Deep Learning-Based Thyroid Nodule Segmentation in Ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21452)
*Nicholas Dietrich,David McShannon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates adversarial attacks and defenses for thyroid nodule segmentation in ultrasound, finding spatial-domain perturbations partially mitigatable but frequency-domain ones resistant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning segmentation models in clinical imaging lack robustness characterization against adversarial attacks, especially in ultrasound.

Method: Two adversarial attacks (SSAA and FDUA) and three inference-time defenses were tested on a U-Net model trained on thyroid nodule data.

Result: SSAA reduced segmentation accuracy more than FDUA. Defenses worked against SSAA but not FDUA.

Conclusion: Ultrasound adversarial robustness is modality-specific, with spatial-domain attacks being partially mitigatable.

Abstract: Introduction: Deep learning-based segmentation models are increasingly integrated into clinical imaging workflows, yet their robustness to adversarial perturbations remains incompletely characterized, particularly for ultrasound images. We evaluated adversarial attacks and inference-time defenses for thyroid nodule segmentation in B-mode ultrasound. Methods: Two black-box adversarial attacks were developed: (1) Structured Speckle Amplification Attack (SSAA), which injects boundary-targeted noise, and (2) Frequency-Domain Ultrasound Attack (FDUA), which applies bandpass-filtered phase perturbations in the Fourier domain. Three inference-time mitigations were evaluated on adversarial images: randomized preprocessing with test-time augmentation, deterministic input denoising, and stochastic ensemble inference with consistency-aware aggregation. Experiments were conducted on a U-Net segmentation model trained on cine-clips from a database of 192 thyroid nodules. Results: The baseline model achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.76 (SD 0.20) on unperturbed images. SSAA reduced DSC by 0.29 (SD 0.20) while maintaining high visual similarity (SSIM = 0.94). FDUA resulted in a smaller DSC reduction of 0.11 (SD 0.09) with lower visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.82). Against SSAA, all three defenses significantly improved DSC after correction, with deterministic denoising showing the largest recovery (+0.10, p < 0.001), followed by randomized preprocessing (+0.09, p < 0.001), and stochastic ensemble inference (+0.08, p = 0.002). No defense achieved statistically significant improvement against FDUA. Conclusion: Spatial-domain adversarial perturbations in ultrasound segmentation showed partial mitigation with input preprocessing, whereas frequency-domain perturbations were not mitigated by the defenses, highlighting modality-specific challenges in adversarial robustness evaluation.

### [13] [Automatic Map Density Selection for Locally-Performant Visual Place Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21473)
*Somayeh Hussaini,Tobias Fischer,Michael Milford*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a dynamic Visual Place Recognition (VPR) mapping approach to meet user-defined local recall performance targets by optimizing reference map density, validated on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of ensuring VPR systems meet local performance requirements across environments, not just global averages, by focusing on reference map density.

Method: Uses pairs of reference traverses to model match patterns and predict required map density for achieving target Local Recall@1 and Recall Achievement Rate (RAR).

Result: Demonstrates consistent achievement of specified local recall levels across environments, avoiding unnecessary over-densification compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Highlights that conventional global Recall@1 is inadequate for operational goals, advocating for the more meaningful RAR metric.

Abstract: A key challenge in translating Visual Place Recognition (VPR) from the lab to long-term deployment is ensuring a priori that a system can meet user-specified performance requirements across different parts of an environment, rather than just on average globally. A critical mechanism for controlling local VPR performance is the density of the reference mapping database, yet this factor is largely neglected in existing work, where benchmark datasets with fixed, engineering-driven (sensors, storage, GPS frequency) sampling densities are typically used. In this paper, we propose a dynamic VPR mapping approach that uses pairs of reference traverses from the target environment to automatically select an appropriate map density to satisfy two user-defined requirements: (1) a target Local Recall@1 level, and (2) the proportion of the operational environment over which this requirement must be met or exceeded, which we term the Recall Achievement Rate (RAR). Our approach is based on the hypothesis that match patterns between multiple reference traverses, evaluated across different map densities, can be modelled to predict the density required to meet these performance targets on unseen deployment data. Through extensive experiments across multiple VPR methods and the Nordland and Oxford RobotCar benchmarks, we show that our system consistently achieves or exceeds the specified local recall level over at least the user-specified proportion of the environment. Comparisons with alternative baselines demonstrate that our approach reliably selects the correct operating point in map density, avoiding unnecessary over-densification. Finally, ablation studies and analysis evaluate sensitivity to reference map choice and local space definitions, and reveal that conventional global Recall@1 is a poor predictor of the often more operationally meaningful RAR metric.

### [14] [Unified Unsupervised and Sparsely-Supervised 3D Object Detection by Semantic Pseudo-Labeling and Prototype Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21484)
*Yushen He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPL is a unified framework for unsupervised and sparsely-supervised 3D object detection, using semantic pseudo-labeling and prototype learning to address challenges like low-quality pseudo-labels and unstable feature mining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D object detection methods heavily rely on large-scale annotated data, which is costly and limits scalability. Unsupervised and sparsely-supervised approaches face issues like poor pseudo-label quality and unstable feature learning. SPL aims to overcome these challenges.

Method: SPL integrates image semantics, point cloud geometry, and temporal cues to generate high-quality pseudo-labels. It employs a multi-stage prototype learning strategy with memory-based initialization and momentum-based updating to stabilize feature learning from labeled and unlabeled data.

Result: SPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on KITTI and nuScenes datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in both unsupervised and sparsely-supervised settings.

Conclusion: SPL provides a robust and scalable solution for 3D object detection with minimal manual annotation, advancing the field by addressing key challenges in unsupervised and sparsely-supervised learning.

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving and robotic perception, yet its reliance on large-scale manually annotated data limits scalability and adaptability. To reduce annotation dependency, unsupervised and sparsely-supervised paradigms have emerged. However, they face intertwined challenges: low-quality pseudo-labels, unstable feature mining, and a lack of a unified training framework. This paper proposes SPL, a unified training framework for both Unsupervised and Sparsely-Supervised 3D Object Detection via Semantic Pseudo-labeling and prototype Learning. SPL first generates high-quality pseudo-labels by integrating image semantics, point cloud geometry, and temporal cues, producing both 3D bounding boxes for dense objects and 3D point labels for sparse ones. These pseudo-labels are not used directly but as probabilistic priors within a novel, multi-stage prototype learning strategy. This strategy stabilizes feature representation learning through memory-based initialization and momentum-based prototype updating, effectively mining features from both labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that SPL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both settings. Our work provides a robust and generalizable solution for learning 3D object detectors with minimal or no manual annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs suffer from visual hallucination propagation in CoT reasoning, and current RL-based solutions are costly and not generalizable.

Method: Introduces a textual visual-evidence pool and visual decider module to supervise reasoning steps dynamically at test time.

Result: Achieves 16.5%-29.5% improvements on TreeBench and 13.7% RH-AUC gains on RH-Bench, reducing hallucinations.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances multimodal reasoning accuracy without additional training.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning ability by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) responses. However, CoT reasoning in multimodal contexts is highly vulnerable to visual hallucination propagation: once an intermediate reasoning step becomes inconsistent with the visual evidence, subsequent steps-even if logically valid-can still lead to incorrect final answers. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this issue by training models to "think with images" via reinforcement learning (RL). While effective, these methods are costly, model-specific, and difficult to generalize across architectures. Differently, we present a lightweight method that bypasses RL training and provides an iterative, training-free, plug-and-play framework for visually-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our key idea is to supervise each reasoning step at test time with visual evidence, ensuring that every decoded token is justified by corresponding visual cues. Concretely, we construct a textual visual-evidence pool that guides the model's reasoning generation. When existing evidence is insufficient, a visual decider module dynamically extracts additional relevant evidence from the image based on the ongoing reasoning context, expanding the pool until the model achieves sufficient visual certainty to terminate reasoning and produce the final answer. Extensive experiments on multiple LVLM backbones and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method achieves 16.5%-29.5% improvements on TreeBench and 13.7% RH-AUC gains on RH-Bench, substantially reducing hallucination rates while improving reasoning accuracy without additional training.

*Shimin Hu,Yuanyi Wei,Fei Zha,Yudong Guo,Juyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a fast, feedforward 3D editing framework using TRELLIS generative backbone, addressing multi-view inconsistency and appearance fidelity issues with Voxel FlowEdit and normal-guided generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D editing methods are slow and inconsistent across views. The goal is to enable efficient and consistent 3D model editing.

Method: Uses TRELLIS generative backbone with Voxel FlowEdit for geometric consistency and a normal-guided module for high-fidelity texture restoration.

Result: Achieves fast, globally consistent, and high-fidelity 3D editing from a single view.

Conclusion: The framework effectively overcomes limitations of existing methods, offering superior performance in speed and quality.

Abstract: Existing 3D editing methods rely on computationally intensive scene-by-scene iterative optimization and suffer from multi-view inconsistency. We propose an effective and fully feedforward 3D editing framework based on the TRELLIS generative backbone, capable of modifying 3D models from a single editing view. Our framework addresses two key issues: adapting training-free 2D editing to structured 3D representations, and overcoming the bottleneck of appearance fidelity in compressed 3D features. To ensure geometric consistency, we introduce Voxel FlowEdit, an edit-driven flow in the sparse voxel latent space that achieves globally consistent 3D deformation in a single pass. To restore high-fidelity details, we develop a normal-guided single to multi-view generation module as an external appearance prior, successfully recovering high-frequency textures. Experiments demonstrate that our method enables fast, globally consistent, and high-fidelity 3D model editing.

### [17] [AHAN: Asymmetric Hierarchical Attention Network for Identical Twin Face Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21503)
*Hoang-Nhat Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AHAN improves twin face verification by 3.4% through multi-granular analysis and asymmetric attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard face recognition fails for identical twins (88.9% accuracy), highlighting biometric security vulnerabilities.

Method: Proposes AHAN with Hierarchical Cross-Attention (multi-scale analysis) and Facial Asymmetry Attention Module (captures subtle asymmetries). Uses Twin-Aware Pair-Wise Cross-Attention for training.

Result: AHAN achieves 92.3% accuracy on ND_TWIN dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art by 3.4%.

Conclusion: AHAN addresses twin verification challenges through specialized attention mechanisms and training strategies.

Abstract: Identical twin face verification represents an extreme fine-grained recognition challenge where even state-of-the-art systems fail due to overwhelming genetic similarity. Current face recognition methods achieve over 99.8% accuracy on standard benchmarks but drop dramatically to 88.9% when distinguishing identical twins, exposing critical vulnerabilities in biometric security systems. The difficulty lies in learning features that capture subtle, non-genetic variations that uniquely identify individuals. We propose the Asymmetric Hierarchical Attention Network (AHAN), a novel architecture specifically designed for this challenge through multi-granularity facial analysis. AHAN introduces a Hierarchical Cross-Attention (HCA) module that performs multi-scale analysis on semantic facial regions, enabling specialized processing at optimal resolutions. We further propose a Facial Asymmetry Attention Module (FAAM) that learns unique biometric signatures by computing cross-attention between left and right facial halves, capturing subtle asymmetric patterns that differ even between twins. To ensure the network learns truly individuating features, we introduce Twin-Aware Pair-Wise Cross-Attention (TA-PWCA), a training-only regularization strategy that uses each subject's own twin as the hardest possible distractor. Extensive experiments on the ND_TWIN dataset demonstrate that AHAN achieves 92.3% twin verification accuracy, representing a 3.4% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

### [18] [Which Tool Response Should I Trust? Tool-Expertise-Aware Chest X-ray Agent with Multimodal Agentic Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21517)
*Zheang Huai,Honglong Yang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for AI agents to learn and resolve conflicts among error-prone medical tools via agentic learning, demonstrated in chest X-ray analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical AI agents lack understanding of tools' real-world reliability, leading to unresolved tool conflicts.

Method: Introduces TEA-CXA, an agent that learns tool trustworthiness through interaction, rewards, and reinforcement learning in multimodal contexts.

Result: TEA-CXA outperforms state-of-the-art methods and baselines in chest X-ray analysis.

Conclusion: The framework advances medical AI by effectively handling multimodal, multi-turn tool-calling scenarios.

Abstract: AI agents with tool-use capabilities show promise for integrating the domain expertise of various tools. In the medical field, however, tools are usually AI models that are inherently error-prone and can produce contradictory responses. Existing research on medical agents lacks sufficient understanding of the tools' realistic reliability and thus cannot effectively resolve tool conflicts. To address this gap, this paper introduces a framework that enables an agent to interact with tools and empirically learn their practical trustworthiness across different types of multimodal queries via agentic learning. As a concrete instantiation, we focus on chest X-ray analysis and present a tool-expertise-aware chest X-ray agent (TEA-CXA). When tool outputs disagree, the agent experimentally accepts or rejects multimodal tool results, receives rewards, and learns which tool to trust for each query type. Importantly, TEA-CXA extends existing codebases for reinforcement learning with multi-turn tool-calling that focus on textual inputs, to support multimodal contexts effectively. In addition, we enhance the codebase for medical use scenarios by supporting multiple tool calls in one turn, parallel tool inference, and multi-image accommodation within a single user query. Our code framework is applicable to general medical research on multi-turn tool-calling reinforcement learning in multimodal settings. Experiments show that TEA-CXA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and a comprehensive set of baselines. Code will be released.

*Beizhen Zhao,Sicheng Yu,Guanzhi Ding,Yu Hu,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for high-quality 3D scene reconstruction from sparse outdoor viewpoints, leveraging bidirectional pseudo frame restoration and Gaussian management to address challenges like limited views and geometric inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outdoor 3D scene reconstruction under sparse viewpoints is challenging due to complex lighting, scale variation, and limited input views, which can degrade reconstruction quality.

Method: The framework uses bidirectional pseudo frame restoration (with diffusion-based synthesis, deblurring, and confidence masks) and scene perception Gaussian management (optimizing Gaussians using depth-density information).

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in reconstruction completeness, artifact reduction, and geometric consistency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances sparse-view outdoor reconstruction quality, outperforming current techniques in fidelity and stability.

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction under unposed sparse viewpoints is a highly challenging yet practically important problem, especially in outdoor scenes due to complex lighting and scale variation. With extremely limited input views, directly utilizing diffusion model to synthesize pseudo frames will introduce unreasonable geometry, which will harm the final reconstruction quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for sparse-view outdoor reconstruction that achieves high-quality results through bidirectional pseudo frame restoration and scene perception Gaussian management. Specifically, we introduce a bidirectional pseudo frame restoration method that restores missing content by diffusion-based synthesis guided by adjacent frames with a lightweight pseudo-view deblur model and confidence mask inference algorithm. Then we propose a scene perception Gaussian management strategy that optimize Gaussians based on joint depth-density information. These designs significantly enhance reconstruction completeness, suppress floating artifacts and improve overall geometric consistency under extreme view sparsity. Experiments on outdoor benchmarks demonstrate substantial gains over existing methods in both fidelity and stability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IHF-Harmony is a scalable, invertible framework for multi-modality MRI harmonization using unpaired data, ensuring anatomical fidelity and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MRI harmonization methods lack scalability across modalities and rely on paired data, limiting their practical application.

Method: IHF-Harmony uses invertible hierarchy flow for hierarchical feature removal and artefact-aware normalization for accurate target transfer, combined with consistency loss objectives.

Result: The framework shows superior performance in anatomical fidelity and downstream task performance across multiple MRI modalities.

Conclusion: IHF-Harmony offers a robust solution for large-scale multi-site MRI harmonization, with plans to release code upon acceptance.

Abstract: Retrospective MRI harmonization is limited by poor scalability across modalities and reliance on traveling subject datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce IHF-Harmony, a unified invertible hierarchy flow framework for multi-modality harmonization using unpaired data. By decomposing the translation process into reversible feature transformations, IHF-Harmony guarantees bijective mapping and lossless reconstruction to prevent anatomical distortion. Specifically, an invertible hierarchy flow (IHF) performs hierarchical subtractive coupling to progressively remove artefact-related features, while an artefact-aware normalization (AAN) employs anatomy-fixed feature modulation to accurately transfer target characteristics. Combined with anatomy and artefact consistency loss objectives, IHF-Harmony achieves high-fidelity harmonization that retains source anatomy. Experiments across multiple MRI modalities demonstrate that IHF-Harmony outperforms existing methods in both anatomical fidelity and downstream task performance, facilitating robust harmonization for large-scale multi-site imaging studies. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: VasGuideNet introduces vascular topology-guided Couinaud liver segmentation, outperforming existing methods by leveraging graph-based features and a novel loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing liver segmentation methods lack explicit vascular topology modeling, leading to indistinct boundaries and poor generalization under anatomical variability.

Method: Proposes VasGuideNet, encoding vascular topology via GCNs and integrating it into a 3D encoder-decoder using cross-attention. Introduces Structural Contrastive Loss (SCL) for better inter-class separability.

Result: Achieves Dice scores of 83.68% and 76.65% on Task08_HepaticVessel and LASSD datasets, outperforming baselines like UNETR and Swin UNETR.

Conclusion: VasGuideNet demonstrates superior anatomically consistent segmentation, validated by higher Dice/mIoU and lower RVD metrics.

Abstract: Accurate Couinaud liver segmentation is critical for preoperative surgical planning and tumor localization.However, existing methods primarily rely on image intensity and spatial location cues, without explicitly modeling vascular topology. As a result, they often produce indistinct boundaries near vessels and show limited generalization under anatomical variability.We propose VasGuideNet, the first Couinaud segmentation framework explicitly guided by vascular topology. Specifically, skeletonized vessels, Euclidean distance transform (EDT)--derived geometry, and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) connectivity are encoded into topology features using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). These features are then injected into a 3D encoder--decoder backbone via a cross-attention fusion module. To further improve inter-class separability and anatomical consistency, we introduce a Structural Contrastive Loss (SCL) with a global memory bank.On Task08_HepaticVessel and our private LASSD dataset, VasGuideNet achieves Dice scores of 83.68% and 76.65% with RVDs of 1.68 and 7.08, respectively. It consistently outperforms representative baselines including UNETR, Swin UNETR, and G-UNETR++, delivering higher Dice/mIoU and lower RVD across datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for anatomically consistent segmentation.

*Changqing Zhou,Yueru Luo,Changhao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPOcc is a framework leveraging visual geometry priors for monocular 3D occupancy prediction, outperforming prior methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods rely on limited 3D cues and surface-level depth priors, motivating the need for better volumetric occupancy prediction.

Method: GPOcc extends surface points inward to create volumetric Gaussian primitives and uses a training-free incremental update strategy for streaming input.

Result: Achieves +9.99 mIoU improvement in monocular settings and +11.79 in streaming settings, running 2.65× faster than prior methods.

Conclusion: GPOcc effectively and efficiently leverages geometry priors for superior 3D occupancy prediction.

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene understanding is essential for embodied intelligence, with occupancy prediction emerging as a key task for reasoning about both objects and free space. Existing approaches largely rely on depth priors (e.g., DepthAnything) but make only limited use of 3D cues, restricting performance and generalization. Recently, visual geometry models such as VGGT have shown strong capability in providing rich 3D priors, but similar to monocular depth foundation models, they still operate at the level of visible surfaces rather than volumetric interiors, motivating us to explore how to more effectively leverage these increasingly powerful geometry priors for 3D occupancy prediction. We present GPOcc, a framework that leverages generalizable visual geometry priors (GPs) for monocular occupancy prediction. Our method extends surface points inward along camera rays to generate volumetric samples, which are represented as Gaussian primitives for probabilistic occupancy inference. To handle streaming input, we further design a training-free incremental update strategy that fuses per-frame Gaussians into a unified global representation. Experiments on Occ-ScanNet and EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet demonstrate significant gains: GPOcc improves mIoU by +9.99 in the monocular setting and +11.79 in the streaming setting over prior state of the art. Under the same depth prior, it achieves +6.73 mIoU while running 2.65$\times$ faster. These results highlight that GPOcc leverages geometry priors more effectively and efficiently. Code will be released at https://github.com/JuIvyy/GPOcc.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multi-character image animation framework using Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) addresses identity confusion and implausible occlusions by introducing Identifier Assigner and Adapter components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods are limited to single-character animation and struggle with identity confusion and occlusions in multi-character scenarios.

Method: Proposes an extensible framework with Identifier Assigner and Adapter to capture per-person cues and spatial relationships, using a mask-driven scheme and scalable training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-character animation, generalizing to more characters than seen in training while maintaining compatibility with single-character cases.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges in multi-character animation, outperforming existing diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Pose-guided human image animation aims to synthesize realistic videos of a reference character driven by a sequence of poses. While diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable success, most existing approaches are limited to single-character animation. We observe that naively extending these methods to multi-character scenarios often leads to identity confusion and implausible occlusions between characters. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an extensible multi-character image animation framework built upon modern Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for video generation. At its core, our framework introduces two novel components-Identifier Assigner and Identifier Adapter - which collaboratively capture per-person positional cues and inter-person spatial relationships. This mask-driven scheme, along with a scalable training strategy, not only enhances flexibility but also enables generalization to scenarios with more characters than those seen during training. Remarkably, trained on only a two-character dataset, our model generalizes to multi-character animation while maintaining compatibility with single-character cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-character image animation, surpassing existing diffusion-based baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inconsistency between camera and LiDAR modalities in HD maps caused by low-light conditions, occlusions, or sparse point clouds.

Method: Disentangles BEV features into four semantic subspaces, assigns dedicated experts, and uses uncertainty-aware gating and distribution-aware masking for robustness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by +4.2% and +4.8% in mAP on nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks.

Conclusion: SEFMAP provides a robust solution for multi-modal HD map prediction under diverse and degraded conditions.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, yet multi-modal fusion often suffers from inconsistency between camera and LiDAR modalities, leading to performance degradation under low-light conditions, occlusions, or sparse point clouds. To address this, we propose SEFMAP, a Subspace-Expert Fusion framework for robust multimodal HD map prediction. The key idea is to explicitly disentangle BEV features into four semantic subspaces: LiDAR-private, Image-private, Shared, and Interaction. Each subspace is assigned a dedicated expert, thereby preserving modality-specific cues while capturing cross-modal consensus. To adaptively combine expert outputs, we introduce an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism at the BEV-cell level, where unreliable experts are down-weighted based on predictive variance, complemented by a usage balance regularizer to prevent expert collapse. To enhance robustness in degraded conditions and promote role specialization, we further propose distribution-aware masking: during training, modality-drop scenarios are simulated using EMA-statistical surrogate features, and a specialization loss enforces distinct behaviors of private, shared, and interaction experts across complete and masked inputs. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks demonstrate that SEFMAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by +4.2% and +4.8% in mAP, respectively. SEF-MAPprovides a robust and effective solution for multi-modal HD map prediction under diverse and degraded conditions.

*Xihua Sheng,Lingyu Zhu,Tianyu Zhang,Dong Liu,Shiqi Wang,Jing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a content-adaptive diffusion-based image codec addressing three limitations in existing methods: uniform quantization, information bottleneck, and inefficient textual conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving realistic reconstruction at ultra-low bitrates requires dynamic alignment of encoder representation and decoder generative prior with image characteristics.

Method: Introduces three innovations: adaptive quantization, auxiliary decoder-guided information concentration, and bitrate-free textual conditioning.

Result: The proposed method improves content adaptation by addressing existing limitations.

Conclusion: The innovations enable better semantic guidance and alignment with content characteristics.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative image compression has demonstrated remarkable potential for achieving realistic reconstruction at ultra-low bitrates. The key to unlocking this potential lies in making the entire compression process content-adaptive, ensuring that the encoder's representation and the decoder's generative prior are dynamically aligned with the semantic and structural characteristics of the input image. However, existing methods suffer from three critical limitations that prevent effective content adaptation. First, isotropic quantization applies a uniform quantization step, failing to adapt to the spatially varying complexity of image content and creating a misalignment with the diffusion model's noise-dependent prior. Second, the information concentration bottleneck -- arising from the dimensional mismatch between the high-dimensional noisy latent and the diffusion decoder's fixed input -- prevents the model from adaptively preserving essential semantic information in the primary channels. Third, existing textual conditioning strategies either need significant textual bitrate overhead or rely on generic, content-agnostic textual prompts, thereby failing to provide adaptive semantic guidance efficiently. To overcome these limitations, we propose a content-adaptive diffusion-based image codec with three technical innovations: 1) an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Quantization method that learns spatial uncertainty maps to adaptively align quantization distortion with content characteristics; 2) an Auxiliary Decoder-Guided Information Concentration method that uses a lightweight auxiliary decoder to enforce content-aware information preservation in the primary latent channels; and 3) a Bitrate-Free Adaptive Textual Conditioning method that derives content-aware textual descriptions from the auxiliary reconstructed image, enabling semantic guidance without bitrate cost.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes redundancy in conditional embeddings of Diffusion Transformers, revealing extreme angular similarity and concentrated semantic information in a few dimensions. Pruning low-magnitude dimensions shows minimal impact on generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structure of conditional embeddings in Diffusion Transformers, which are widely used in class-conditional and multimodal generation tasks.

Method: Systematically study the embeddings, measure angular similarity, identify semantic concentration in certain dimensions, and prune low-magnitude dimensions to evaluate impact.

Result: Class-conditioned embeddings show extreme angular similarity (>99%), and semantic information is concentrated in a few dimensions. Pruning up to two-thirds of the embedding space barely affects generation quality.

Conclusion: The findings reveal a semantic bottleneck in Transformer-based diffusion models, suggesting opportunities for more efficient conditioning mechanisms.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in class-conditional and multimodal generation, yet the structure of their learned conditional embeddings remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first systematic study of these embeddings and uncover a notable redundancy: class-conditioned embeddings exhibit extreme angular similarity, exceeding 99\% on ImageNet-1K, while continuous-condition tasks such as pose-guided image generation and video-to-audio generation reach over 99.9\%. We further find that semantic information is concentrated in a small subset of dimensions, with head dimensions carrying the dominant signal and tail dimensions contributing minimally. By pruning low-magnitude dimensions--removing up to two-thirds of the embedding space--we show that generation quality and fidelity remain largely unaffected, and in some cases improve. These results reveal a semantic bottleneck in Transformer-based diffusion models, providing new insights into how semantics are encoded and suggesting opportunities for more efficient conditioning mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses non-invasive MRI-based pathology prediction for deep intracranial tumors, tackling data scarcity and annotation challenges with a new dataset and a Virtual Biopsy framework, achieving over 90% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep intracranial tumors in critical brain regions pose diagnostic challenges. Biopsy risks sampling bias and complications, necessitating non-invasive methods like MRI-based pathology prediction.

Method: The authors propose the ICT-MRI dataset (249 biopsy-verified cases) and a Virtual Biopsy framework with MRI-Processor, Tumor-Localizer (using vision-language models), and Adaptive-Diagnoser (with Masked Channel Attention).

Result: The framework achieves over 90% accuracy, outperforming baselines by more than 20%.

Conclusion: The approach offers a robust, non-invasive solution for tumor assessment, addressing data scarcity and improving clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Deep intracranial tumors situated in eloquent brain regions controlling vital functions present critical diagnostic challenges. Clinical practice has shifted toward stereotactic biopsy for pathological confirmation before treatment. Yet biopsy carries inherent risks of hemorrhage and neurological deficits and struggles with sampling bias due to tumor spatial heterogeneity, because pathological changes are typically region-selective rather than tumor-wide. Therefore, advancing non-invasive MRI-based pathology prediction is essential for holistic tumor assessment and modern clinical decision-making.
  The primary challenge lies in data scarcity: low tumor incidence requires long collection cycles, and annotation demands biopsy-verified pathology from neurosurgical experts. Additionally, tiny lesion volumes lacking segmentation masks cause critical features to be overwhelmed by background noise. To address these challenges, we construct the ICT-MRI dataset - the first public biopsy-verified benchmark with 249 cases across four categories. We propose a Virtual Biopsy framework comprising: MRI-Processor for standardization; Tumor-Localizer employing vision-language models for coarse-to-fine localization via weak supervision; and Adaptive-Diagnoser with a Masked Channel Attention mechanism fusing local discriminative features with global contexts. Experiments demonstrate over 90% accuracy, outperforming baselines by more than 20%.

TL;DR: A unified approach for semantic segmentation in images/videos using language modeling and RLE tokenization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify semantic segmentation by treating mask generation as a sequence prediction task and extend it feasibly to videos.

Method: Discretizes segmentation masks with RLE, uses modified Pix2Seq for autoregressive token output, and introduces novel tokenization strategies.

Result: Competitive performance on two datasets despite computational limitations.

Conclusion: The approach is viable for semantic and panoptic segmentation, even with resource constraints.

Abstract: This paper presents a new unified approach to semantic segmentation in both images and videos by using language modeling to output the masks as sequences of discrete tokens. We use run length encoding (RLE) to discretize the segmentation masks and then train a modified version of Pix2Seq \cite{p2s} to output these RLE tokens through autoregression. We propose novel tokenization strategies to compress the length of the token sequence to make it practicable to extend this approach to videos. We also show how instance information can be incorporated into the tokenization process to perform panoptic segmentation. We evaluate our proposed models on two datasets to show that they are competitive with the state of the art in spite of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources.

*Zhihao Sun,Tong Wu,Ruirui Tu,Daoguo Dong,Zuxuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniHand is a unified diffusion-based framework for both estimating and generating 4D hand motion, integrating heterogeneous inputs and overcoming limitations of separate approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for modeling 4D hand motion are divided into estimation and generation tasks, limiting the use of heterogeneous signals and knowledge transfer between tasks.

Method: UniHand uses a joint variational autoencoder to embed structured inputs into a shared latent space, encodes visual observations with a frozen vision backbone, and synthesizes motion with a latent diffusion model.

Result: UniHand demonstrates robust and accurate hand motion modeling, performing well under severe occlusions and incomplete inputs in multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: UniHand effectively unifies hand motion estimation and generation, improving performance and versatility in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Hand motion plays a central role in human interaction, yet modeling realistic 4D hand motion (i.e., 3D hand pose sequences over time) remains challenging. Research in this area is typically divided into two tasks: (1) Estimation approaches reconstruct precise motion from visual observations, but often fail under hand occlusion or absence; (2) Generation approaches focus on synthesizing hand poses by exploiting generative priors under multi-modal structured inputs and infilling motion from incomplete sequences. However, this separation not only limits the effective use of heterogeneous condition signals that frequently arise in practice, but also prevents knowledge transfer between the two tasks. We present UniHand, a unified diffusion-based framework that formulates both estimation and generation as conditional motion synthesis. UniHand integrates heterogeneous inputs by embedding structured signals into a shared latent space through a joint variational autoencoder, which aligns conditions such as MANO parameters and 2D skeletons. Visual observations are encoded with a frozen vision backbone, while a dedicated hand perceptron extracts hand-specific cues directly from image features, removing the need for complex detection and cropping pipelines. A latent diffusion model then synthesizes consistent motion sequences from these diverse conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UniHand delivers robust and accurate hand motion modeling, maintaining performance under severe occlusions and temporally incomplete inputs.

### [30] [Axial-Centric Cross-Plane Attention for 3D Medical Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21636)
*Doyoung Park,Jinsoo Kim,Lohendran Baskaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an axial-centric cross-plane attention architecture for 3D medical image classification, aligning with clinical workflows to improve accuracy and efficiency by leveraging asymmetric dependencies between anatomical planes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinicians prioritize the axial plane in 3D medical image interpretation, but existing deep learning methods treat all planes equally or holistically, missing this clinical nuance.

Method: The architecture uses MedDINOv3 as a frozen feature extractor, RICA blocks for plane-specific details, and axial-centric cross-plane transformers to fuse axial features with auxiliary planes.

Result: The model outperforms existing methods on six MedMNIST3D datasets in accuracy and AUC, validated through ablation studies.

Conclusion: Aligning architectural design with clinical workflows enhances 3D medical image analysis, emphasizing axial-centric features and directional cross-plane fusion.

Abstract: Clinicians commonly interpret three-dimensional (3D) medical images, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, using multiple anatomical planes rather than as a single volumetric representation. In this multi-planar approach, the axial plane typically serves as the primary acquisition and diagnostic reference, while the coronal and sagittal planes provide complementary spatial information to increase diagnostic confidence. However, many existing 3D deep learning methods either process volumetric data holistically or assign equal importance to all planes, failing to reflect the axial-centric clinical interpretation workflow. To address this gap, we propose an axial-centric cross-plane attention architecture for 3D medical image classification that captures the inherent asymmetric dependencies between different anatomical planes. Our architecture incorporates MedDINOv3, a medical vision foundation model pretrained via self-supervised learning on large-scale axial CT images, as a frozen feature extractor for the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. RICA blocks and intra-plane transformer encoders capture plane-specific positional and contextual information within each anatomical plane, while axial-centric cross-plane transformer encoders condition axial features on complementary information from auxiliary planes. Experimental results on six datasets from the MedMNIST3D benchmark demonstrate that the proposed architecture consistently outperforms existing 3D and multi-plane models in terms of accuracy and AUC. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of axial-centric query-key-value allocation and directional cross-plane fusion. These results highlight the importance of aligning architectural design with clinical interpretation workflows for robust and data-efficient 3D medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARE is a pathology foundation model that partitions WSIs into biologically relevant regions via a two-stage pretraining strategy, outperforming existing models with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models fail to capture coherent tissue architecture due to reliance on natural image backbones, limiting clinical relevance.

Method: CARE uses self-supervised pretraining on WSIs followed by cross-modal alignment with RNA/protein profiles to refine region construction.

Result: CARE achieves superior performance on 33 benchmarks, including classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis.

Conclusion: CARE effectively addresses the limitations of existing models by leveraging molecular guidance and adaptive region representation.

Abstract: Foundation models have recently achieved impressive success in computational pathology, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse histopathology tasks. However, existing models overlook the heterogeneous and non-uniform organization of pathological regions of interest (ROIs) because they rely on natural image backbones not tailored for tissue morphology. Consequently, they often fail to capture the coherent tissue architecture beyond isolated patches, limiting interpretability and clinical relevance. To address these challenges, we present Cross-modal Adaptive Region Encoder (CARE), a foundation model for pathology that automatically partitions WSIs into several morphologically relevant regions. Specifically, CARE employs a two-stage pretraining strategy: (1) a self-supervised unimodal pretraining stage that learns morphological representations from 34,277 whole-slide images (WSIs) without segmentation annotations, and (2) a cross-modal alignment stage that leverages RNA and protein profiles to refine the construction and representation of adaptive regions. This molecular guidance enables CARE to identify biologically relevant patterns and generate irregular yet coherent tissue regions, selecting the most representative area as ROI. CARE supports a broad range of pathology-related tasks, using either the ROI feature or the slide-level feature obtained by aggregating adaptive regions. Based on only one-tenth of the pretraining data typically used by mainstream foundation models, CARE achieves superior average performance across 33 downstream benchmarks, including morphological classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis, and outperforms other foundation model baselines overall.

TL;DR: LieFlow is a framework for 4D scene modeling that uses SE(3) Lie group to represent motion, improving physical consistency and motion coherence over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 4D scene modeling often fail to represent complex motions like rotations and articulated transformations accurately, leading to spatial and physical inconsistencies.

Method: LieFlow introduces a dynamic radiance representation framework that models motion within the SE(3) Lie group, ensuring unified geometric space for translations and rotations. It enforces motion continuity and geometric consistency.

Result: Evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets show LieFlow outperforms NeRF-based baselines in view-synthesis fidelity, temporal coherence, and physical realism.

Conclusion: SE(3)-based motion modeling in LieFlow provides a robust and physically grounded framework for dynamic 4D scenes, addressing limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Modeling 4D scenes requires capturing both spatial structure and temporal motion, which is challenging due to the need for physically consistent representations of complex rigid and non-rigid motions. Existing approaches mainly rely on translational displacements, which struggle to represent rotations, articulated transformations, often leading to spatial inconsistency and physically implausible motion. LieFlow, a dynamic radiance representation framework that explicitly models motion within the SE(3) Lie group, enabling coherent learning of translation and rotation in a unified geometric space. The SE(3) transformation field enforces physically inspired constraints to maintain motion continuity and geometric consistency. The evaluation includes a synthetic dataset with rigid-body trajectories and two real-world datasets capturing complex motion under natural lighting and occlusions. Across all datasets, LieFlow consistently improves view-synthesis fidelity, temporal coherence, and physical realism over NeRF-based baselines. These results confirm that SE(3)-based motion modeling offers a robust and physically grounded framework for representing dynamic 4D scenes.

### [33] [CCCaption: Dual-Reward Reinforcement Learning for Complete and Correct Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21655)
*Zhijiang Tang,Linhua Wang,Jiaxin Qi,Weihao Jiang,Peng Hou,Anxiang Zeng,Jianqiang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CCCaption, a framework optimizing image caption completeness and correctness using dual-reward reinforcement learning, outperforming human-annotated references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-annotated captions are often incomplete or incorrect, prompting the need for objective criteria (completeness and correctness) to improve caption quality.

Method: CCCaption uses LVLMs for visual queries (completeness) and sub-caption validation (correctness), with a dynamic sampling strategy and dual-reward optimization.

Result: The framework improves performance on standard benchmarks, demonstrating better caption quality.

Conclusion: CCCaption provides a principled approach to enhance captioning beyond human-annotation limitations.

Abstract: Image captioning remains a fundamental task for vision language understanding, yet ground-truth supervision still relies predominantly on human-annotated references. Because human annotations reflect subjective preferences and expertise, ground-truth captions are often incomplete or even incorrect, which in turn limits caption models. We argue that caption quality should be assessed by two objective aspects: completeness (does the caption cover all salient visual facts?) and correctness (are the descriptions true with respect to the image?). To this end, we introduce CCCaption: a dual-reward reinforcement learning framework with a dedicated fine-tuning corpus that explicitly optimizes these properties to generate \textbf{C}omplete and \textbf{C}orrect \textbf{Captions}. For completeness, we use diverse LVLMs to disentangle the image into a set of visual queries, and reward captions that answer more of these queries, with a dynamic query sampling strategy to improve training efficiency. For correctness, we penalize captions that contain hallucinations by validating the authenticity of sub-caption queries, which are derived from the caption decomposition. Our symmetric dual-reward optimization jointly maximizes completeness and correctness, guiding models toward captions that better satisfy these objective criteria. Extensive experiments across standard captioning benchmarks show consistent improvements, offering a principled path to training caption models beyond human-annotation imitation.

TL;DR: VCC-Net integrates radiologists' visual cognition with AI models using clinically compatible interfaces (e.g., eye-tracking) to improve chest X-ray diagnosis reliability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CAD systems lack integration with clinical workflows and interpretability, while human-AI collaboration faces challenges due to incompatible tools and semantic gaps.

Method: VCC-Net captures radiologists' visual search traces and attention patterns via eye-tracking/mouse inputs, learning hierarchical search strategies and co-editing a disease-aware graph.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 88.40% (SIIM-ACR), 85.05% (EGD-CXR), and 92.41% (TB-Mouse), with attention maps aligning well with radiologists' gaze patterns.

Conclusion: VCC-Net bridges radiologist-model gaps, enabling transparent, complementary decision-making and enhancing diagnostic reliability.

Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has significantly advanced automated chest X-ray diagnosis but remains isolated from clinical workflows and lacks reliable decision support and interpretability. Human-AI collaboration seeks to enhance the reliability of diagnostic models by integrating the behaviors of controllable radiologists. However, the absence of interactive tools seamlessly embedded within diagnostic routines impedes collaboration, while the semantic gap between radiologists' decision-making patterns and model representations further limits clinical adoption. To overcome these limitations, we propose a visual cognition-guided collaborative network (VCC-Net) to achieve the cooperative diagnostic paradigm. VCC-Net centers on visual cognition (VC) and employs clinically compatible interfaces, such as eye-tracking or the mouse, to capture radiologists' visual search traces and attention patterns during diagnosis. VCC-Net employs VC as a spatial cognition guide, learning hierarchical visual search strategies to localize diagnostically key regions. A cognition-graph co-editing module subsequently integrates radiologist VC with model inference to construct a disease-aware graph. The module captures dependencies among anatomical regions and aligns model representations with VC-driven features, mitigating radiologist bias and facilitating complementary, transparent decision-making. Experiments on the public datasets SIIM-ACR, EGD-CXR, and self-constructed TB-Mouse dataset achieved classification accuracies of 88.40%, 85.05%, and 92.41%, respectively. The attention maps produced by VCC-Net exhibit strong concordance with radiologists' gaze distributions, demonstrating a mutual reinforcement of radiologist and model inference.

*Wenjie Huang,Qi Yang,Shuting Xia,He Huang,Zhu Li,Yiling Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HybridINR-PCGC is a hybrid framework combining pretrained models and implicit neural representation (INR) for efficient point cloud compression, reducing bitrate and improving encoding efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either suffer from training data dependency (pretrained-based) or require time-consuming online training (INR-based). HybridINR-PCGC aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: The framework uses a Pretrained Prior Network (PPN) for fast inference and a Distribution Agnostic Refiner (DAR) with base and enhancement layers. Only the enhancement layer is packed into the bitstream, supervised by a compression module.

Result: Achieves significant Bpp reductions: ~20.43% vs. G-PCC, ~57.85% vs. UniPCGC in out-of-distribution scenarios, and ~15.193% vs. LINR-PCGC.

Conclusion: HybridINR-PCGC bridges pretrained models and INR, offering robust, efficient compression with improved time-rate trade-offs.

Abstract: Learning-based point cloud compression presents superior performance to handcrafted codecs. However, pretrained-based methods, which are based on end-to-end training and expected to generalize to all the potential samples, suffer from training data dependency. Implicit neural representation (INR) based methods are distribution-agnostic and more robust, but they require time-consuming online training and suffer from the bitstream overhead from the overfitted model. To address these limitations, we propose HybridINR-PCGC, a novel hybrid framework that bridges the pretrained model and INR. Our framework retains distribution-agnostic properties while leveraging a pretrained network to accelerate convergence and reduce model overhead, which consists of two parts: the Pretrained Prior Network (PPN) and the Distribution Agnostic Refiner (DAR). We leverage the PPN, designed for fast inference and stable performance, to generate a robust prior for accelerating the DAR's convergence. The DAR is decomposed into a base layer and an enhancement layer, and only the enhancement layer needed to be packed into the bitstream. Finally, we propose a supervised model compression module to further supervise and minimize the bitrate of the enhancement layer parameters. Based on experiment results, HybridINR-PCGC achieves a significantly improved compression rate and encoding efficiency. Specifically, our method achieves a Bpp reduction of approximately 20.43% compared to G-PCC on 8iVFB. In the challenging out-of-distribution scenario Cat1B, our method achieves a Bpp reduction of approximately 57.85% compared to UniPCGC. And our method exhibits a superior time-rate trade-off, achieving an average Bpp reduction of 15.193% relative to the LINR-PCGC on 8iVFB.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for collaborative perception struggle with bandwidth constraints and vulnerability to packet loss, limiting their practical application.

Method: QPoint2Comm quantizes point-cloud indices using a shared codebook for efficient communication, employs masked training for robustness against packet loss, and integrates a cascade attention fusion module for multi-vehicle data.

Result: QPoint2Comm achieves superior accuracy, communication efficiency, and resilience to packet loss compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: QPoint2Comm advances collaborative perception by offering a practical, efficient, and robust solution for connected vehicles.

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected vehicles to overcome occlusions and limited viewpoints by sharing sensory information. However, existing approaches struggle to achieve high accuracy under strict bandwidth constraints and remain highly vulnerable to random transmission packet loss. We introduce QPoint2Comm, a quantized point-cloud communication framework that dramatically reduces bandwidth while preserving high-fidelity 3D information. Instead of transmitting intermediate features, QPoint2Comm directly communicates quantized point-cloud indices using a shared codebook, enabling efficient reconstruction with lower bandwidth than feature-based methods. To ensure robustness to possible communication packet loss, we employ a masked training strategy that simulates random packet loss, allowing the model to maintain strong performance even under severe transmission failures. In addition, a cascade attention fusion module is proposed to enhance multi-vehicle information integration. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that QPoint2Comm sets a new state of the art in accuracy, communication efficiency, and resilience to packet loss.

Method: MoGaF employs motion-aware Gaussian grouping and group-wise optimization within a 4D Gaussian Splatting representation to ensure consistent motion. A lightweight forecasting module predicts future motion.

Result: MoGaF outperforms existing baselines in rendering quality, motion plausibility, and long-term forecasting stability on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: MoGaF effectively addresses the challenge of dynamic scene forecasting by leveraging structured space-time representation and motion-aware grouping.

Abstract: Forecasting dynamic scenes remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision, as limited observations make it difficult to capture coherent object-level motion and long-term temporal evolution. We present Motion Group-aware Gaussian Forecasting (MoGaF), a framework for long-term scene extrapolation built upon the 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. MoGaF introduces motion-aware Gaussian grouping and group-wise optimization to enforce physically consistent motion across both rigid and non-rigid regions, yielding spatially coherent dynamic representations. Leveraging this structured space-time representation, a lightweight forecasting module predicts future motion, enabling realistic and temporally stable scene evolution. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that MoGaF consistently outperforms existing baselines in rendering quality, motion plausibility, and long-term forecasting stability.

Conclusion: The framework and tools will be released to support future research in automated quality assessment for Chinese e-commerce posters.

Abstract: Generative AI is widely used to create commercial posters. However, rapid advances in generation have outpaced automated quality assessment. Existing models emphasize generic esthetics or low level distortions and lack the functional criteria required for e-commerce design.

TL;DR: SF3D-RGB is a deep learning model combining 2D images and 3D point clouds for accurate and efficient scene flow estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of single-modality methods by leveraging both 2D and 3D data for robust scene flow estimation.

Method: End-to-end architecture encoding and fusing features from monocular images and LiDAR point clouds, followed by graph matching and residual refinement.

Result: Outperforms single-modality methods, achieving better accuracy with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: SF3D-RGB provides a balanced, efficient solution for multimodal scene flow estimation.

Abstract: Scene flow estimation is an extremely important task in computer vision to support the perception of dynamic changes in the scene. For robust scene flow, learning-based approaches have recently achieved impressive results using either image-based or LiDAR-based modalities. However, these methods have tended to focus on the use of a single modality. To tackle these problems, we present a deep learning architecture, SF3D-RGB, that enables sparse scene flow estimation using 2D monocular images and 3D point clouds (e.g., acquired by LiDAR) as inputs. Our architecture is an end-to-end model that first encodes information from each modality into features and fuses them together. Then, the fused features enhance a graph matching module for better and more robust mapping matrix computation to generate an initial scene flow. Finally, a residual scene flow module further refines the initial scene flow. Our model is designed to strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, experiments show that our proposed method outperforms single-modality methods and achieves better scene flow accuracy on real-world datasets while using fewer parameters compared to other state-of-the-art methods with fusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The non-enhancing tumor compartment, often overlooked in recent challenges, is vital for understanding patient survival and tumor progression, necessitating automated segmentation tools.

Method: The study employs a U-Net architecture tailored for segmenting brain tumors across multiple MRI modalities.

Result: The model effectively segments the non-enhancing tumor compartment, addressing gaps left by recent segmentation challenges.

Conclusion: Automated segmentation of non-enhancing tumor regions is essential for improving patient prognosis and understanding tumor dynamics.

Abstract: A U-Net based deep learning architecture is designed to segment brain tumors as they appear on various MRI modalities. Special emphasis is lent to the non-enhancing tumor compartment. The latter has not been considered anymore in recent brain tumor segmentation challenges like the MICCAI challenges. However, it is considered to be indicative of the survival time of the patient as well as of areas of further tumor growth. Hence it deems essential to have means to automatically delineate its extension within the tumor.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Multimodal Activation Steering, a training-free method to reduce hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models by leveraging context-aware steering vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address hallucination issues in LVLMs by analyzing activation patterns and identifying distinct subsets of attention heads for truthfulness and visual perception.

Method: Construct a semantic-based truthfulness steering vector database and compute visual perception steering vectors for dynamic, context-aware interventions during inference.

Result: The approach significantly improves model performance across multiple datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Dynamic Multimodal Activation Steering effectively mitigates hallucination in LVLMs by leveraging semantic context and targeted attention head interventions.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit outstanding performance on vision-language tasks but struggle with hallucination problems. Through in-depth analysis of LVLM activation patterns, we reveal two key findings: 1) truthfulness and visual perception capabilities predominantly engage different subsets of attention heads within the model architecture; and 2) truthfulness steering vectors vary significantly across different semantic contexts. Based on these observations, we propose Dynamic Multimodal Activation Steering, a training-free approach for hallucination mitigation. Our method constructs a semantic-based truthfulness steering vector database and computes visual perception steering vectors, enabling context-aware interventions during inference by dynamically selecting the most relevant steering vectors based on input semantic similarity and applying them to the most influential attention heads. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple models and datasets, demonstrating that our approach significantly enhances model performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying safe operative zones in minimally invasive surgery by integrating visual cues, procedural phase, and anatomical context, which existing AI systems fail to do dynamically.

Method: Introduces ResGo benchmark and SurGo-R1, a model optimized via RLHF with a multi-turn phase-then-go architecture for phase identification and Go Zone reasoning.

Result: SurGo-R1 achieves 76.6% phase accuracy, 32.7 mIoU, and 54.8% hardcore accuracy, significantly outperforming generalist VLMs.

Conclusion: SurGo-R1 demonstrates substantial improvement over existing systems in handling phase-dependent reasoning tasks in laparoscopic surgery.

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery has dramatically improved patient operative outcomes, yet identifying safe operative zones remains challenging in critical phases, requiring surgeons to integrate visual cues, procedural phase, and anatomical context under high cognitive load. Existing AI systems offer binary safety verification or static detection, ignoring the phase-dependent nature of intraoperative reasoning. We introduce ResGo, a benchmark of laparoscopic frames annotated with Go Zone bounding boxes and clinician-authored rationales covering phase, exposure quality reasoning, next action and risk reminder. We introduce evaluation metrics that treat correct grounding under incorrect phase as failures, revealing that most vision-language models cannot handle such tasks and perform poorly. We then present SurGo-R1, a model optimized via RLHF with a multi-turn phase-then-go architecture where the model first identifies the surgical phase, then generates reasoning and Go Zone coordinates conditioned on that context. On unseen procedures, SurGo-R1 achieves 76.6% phase accuracy, 32.7 mIoU, and 54.8% hardcore accuracy, a 6.6$\times$ improvement over the mainstream generalist VLMs. Code, model and benchmark will be available at https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/SurGo-R1

TL;DR: The study evaluates deep learning for forest stand delineation using aerial imagery and ALS/DAP data, finding comparable performance despite variations in input quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forest stand delineation is crucial for forest management but is currently manual and subjective. Deep learning offers scalability but faces issues like temporal misalignment of data sources.

Method: A U-Net-based semantic segmentation framework was tested with municipality-level cross-validation in Norway, using aerial imagery combined with ALS-derived CHM, DAP-derived CHM, or DAP-CHM plus DTM.

Result: All data combinations achieved high accuracy (0.90-0.91). DAP-CHMs performed similarly to ALS-CHMs, and DTM inclusion did not improve results, showing model resilience to input variations.

Conclusion: Deep learning with temporally aligned ALS/DAP data is viable for large-scale forest stand delineation, reducing reliance on manual processes.

Abstract: Accurate forest stand delineation is essential for forest inventory and management but remains a largely manual and subjective process. A recent study has shown that deep learning can produce stand delineations comparable to expert interpreters when combining aerial imagery and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. However, temporal misalignment between data sources limits operational scalability. Canopy height models (CHMs) derived from digital photogrammetry (DAP) offer better temporal alignment but may smoothen canopy surface and canopy gaps, raising the question of whether they can reliably replace ALS-derived CHMs. Similarly, the inclusion of a digital terrain model (DTM) has been suggested to improve delineation performance, but has remained untested in published literature. Using expert-delineated forest stands as reference data, we assessed a U-Net-based semantic segmentation framework with municipality-level cross-validation across six municipalities in southeastern Norway. We compared multispectral aerial imagery combined with (i) an ALS-derived CHM, (ii) a DAP-derived CHM, and (iii) a DAP-derived CHM in combination with a DTM. Results showed comparable performance across all data combinations, reaching overall accuracy values between 0.90-0.91. Agreement between model predictions was substantially larger than agreement with the reference data, highlighting both model consistency and the inherent subjectivity of stand delineation. The similar performance of DAP-CHMs, despite the reduced structural detail, and the lack of improvements of the DTM indicate that the framework is resilient to variations in input data. These findings indicate that large datasets for deep learning-based stand delineations can be assembled using projects including temporally aligned ALS data and DAP point clouds.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a three-stage encoder with hierarchical feature representation for tooth image segmentation, improving accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods often fail in dental image segmentation due to fixed-resolution feature maps and high computational costs of transformer-based approaches.

Method: A three-stage encoder with hierarchical feature representation and cross-scale feature fusion is proposed, along with a bidirectional sequence modeling strategy.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches, achieving a 1.1% improvement in mIoU on the OralVision dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses challenges in dental image segmentation by balancing detailed and contextual information while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Tooth image segmentation is a cornerstone of dental digitization. However, traditional image encoders relying on fixed-resolution feature maps often lead to discontinuous segmentation and poor discrimination between target regions and background, due to insufficient modeling of environmental and global context. Moreover, transformer-based self-attention introduces substantial computational overhead because of its quadratic complexity (O(n^2)), making it inefficient for high-resolution dental images. To address these challenges, we introduce a three-stage encoder with hierarchical feature representation to capture scale-adaptive information in dental images. By jointly leveraging low-level details and high-level semantics through cross-scale feature fusion, the model effectively preserves fine structural information while maintaining strong contextual awareness. Furthermore, a bidirectional sequence modeling strategy is incorporated to enhance global spatial context understanding without incurring high computational cost.
  We validate our method on two dental datasets, with experimental results demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches. On the OralVision dataset, our model achieves a 1.1% improvement in mean intersection over union (mIoU).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated image technology threatens information integrity. Existing methods struggle due to attention dilution when fusing semantic and artifact features.

Method: Proposes TranX-Adapter with Task-aware Optimal-Transport Fusion and X-Fusion modules to enhance feature fusion.

Result: Experiments on AIGI benchmarks show significant accuracy improvements (up to +6%).

Conclusion: TranX-Adapter effectively addresses attention dilution and boosts AIGI detection performance.

Abstract: Rapid advances in AI-generated image (AIGI) technology enable highly realistic synthesis, threatening public information integrity and security. Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating texture-level artifact features alongside semantic features into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can enhance their AIGI detection capability. However, our preliminary analyses reveal that artifact features exhibit high intra-feature similarity, leading to an almost uniform attention map after the softmax operation. This phenomenon causes attention dilution, thereby hindering effective fusion between semantic and artifact features. To overcome this limitation, we propose a lightweight fusion adapter, TranX-Adapter, which integrates a Task-aware Optimal-Transport Fusion that leverages the Jensen-Shannon divergence between artifact and semantic prediction probabilities as a cost matrix to transfer artifact information into semantic features, and an X-Fusion that employs cross-attention to transfer semantic information into artifact features. Experiments on standard AIGI detection benchmarks upon several advanced MLLMs, show that our TranX-Adapter brings consistent and significant improvements (up to +6% accuracy).

Motivation: To address the limitations of fixed-size cropping or interpolation in training models for variable-resolution medical imaging datasets, which can cause information loss.

Method: Introduces SigVLP, a model using Rotary Position Embeddings for flexible z-axis processing. It samples CT volumes in chunks paired with localized text, enabling finer-grained supervision. Training employs the Muon optimizer.

Result: The model achieves improved precision in text-to-volume alignment and is evaluated on tasks like zero-shot classification, segmentation, and retrieval.

Conclusion: SigVLP effectively handles variable-resolution medical images, enhancing alignment and performance across diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large-scale, volumetric medical imaging datasets typically aggregate scans from different vendors and devices, resulting in highly variable resolution, slice thicknesses, and numbers of slices per study. Consequently, training representation models usually requires cropping or interpolating along the z-axis to obtain fixed-size blocks, which inevitably causes information loss. We propose a new training approach to overcome this limitation. Instead of absolute position embeddings, we interpret volumes as sequences of 3D chunks and adopt Rotary Position Embeddings, allowing us to treat the z-axis as an unconstrained temporal dimensions. Building on this idea, we introduce a new vision-language model: SigVLP. In SigVLP, we implement Rotary Position Embedding as the positional encoding method, which is applied directly within the attention operation, generating input-conditioned sine and cosine weights on the fly. This design ensures consistent alignment between query and key projections and adapts to any input sizes. To allow for variable input size during training, we sample Computed Tomography volumes in chunks and pair them with localized organ-wise textual observations. Compared to using entire reports for conditioning, chunkwise alignment provides finer-grained supervision, enabling the model to establish stronger correlations between the text and volume representations, thereby improving the precision of text-to-volume alignment. Our models are trained with the Muon optimizer and evaluated on a diverse set of downstream tasks, including zero-shot abnormality and organ classification, segmentation, and retrieval tasks.

*Juan Yang,Yuyan Zhang,Han Jia,Bing Hu,Wanzhong Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in monocular depth estimation (MDE) for colonoscopy by proposing a Structure-to-Image paradigm, improving realism and structure consistency while reducing RMSE by 44.18%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The domain gap between simulated and real-world colonoscopy images causes distortions and specular highlights in existing methods, motivating a new approach.

Method: Introduces a Structure-to-Image paradigm using phase congruency and cross-level structure constraints to co-optimize geometric structures and fine details.

Result: Achieved a 44.18% reduction in RMSE in zero-shot evaluations on a phantom dataset compared to competing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges the domain gap and enhances MDE performance in colonoscopy.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) for colonoscopy is hampered by the domain gap between simulated and real-world images. Existing image-to-image translation methods, which use depth as a posterior constraint, often produce structural distortions and specular highlights by failing to balance realism with structure consistency. To address this, we propose a Structure-to-Image paradigm that transforms the depth map from a passive constraint into an active generative foundation. We are the first to introduce phase congruency to colonoscopic domain adaptation and design a cross-level structure constraint to co-optimize geometric structures and fine-grained details like vascular textures. In zero-shot evaluations conducted on a publicly available phantom dataset, the MDE model that was fine-tuned on our generated data achieved a maximum reduction of 44.18% in RMSE compared to competing methods.

### [48] [Enhancing Multi-Modal LLMs Reasoning via Difficulty-Aware Group Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21743)
*Jinghan Li,Junfeng Fang,Jinda Lu,Yuan Wang,Xiaoyan Guo,Tianyu Zhang,Xiang Wang,Xiangnan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces difficulty-aware group normalization (Durian) to address instability in multimodal reinforcement learning caused by extreme reward samples, improving performance on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal reinforcement learning faces instability due to std-based normalization distortions from extreme reward samples, unlike pure-text LLMs, necessitating a solution that accounts for perceptual and reasoning complexities.

Method: The authors characterize samples by difficulty (perceptual complexity via visual entropy and reasoning uncertainty via model confidence) and propose Durian, which normalizes rewards within difficulty-level groups.

Result: Durian eliminates sensitivity to extreme cases while preserving intra-group distinctions, leading to significant performance gains on multimodal reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed Durian method effectively stabilizes multimodal reinforcement learning by addressing extreme reward distortions, enhancing reasoning capabilities in multimodal models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models. Extending these methods to multimodal settings, however, faces a critical challenge: the instability of std-based normalization, which is easily distorted by extreme samples with nearly positive or negative rewards. Unlike pure-text LLMs, multimodal models are particularly sensitive to such distortions, as both perceptual and reasoning errors influence their responses. To address this, we characterize each sample by its difficulty, defined through perceptual complexity (measured via visual entropy) and reasoning uncertainty (captured by model confidence). Building on this characterization, we propose difficulty-aware group normalization (Durian), which re-groups samples by difficulty levels and shares the std within each group. Our approach preserves GRPO's intra-group distinctions while eliminating sensitivity to extreme cases, yielding significant performance gains across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiREC-Net is a target-free, learning-based calibration network for joint multi-sensor alignment (LiDAR, RGB, event data) using shared LiDAR representations, achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing calibration methods are limited to single sensor pairs, creating a need for unified multi-modal calibration to enhance autonomous systems.

Method: Proposes LiREC-Net with shared LiDAR representations for efficient multi-sensor fusion.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on datasets like KITTI and DSEC.

Conclusion: LiREC-Net sets a strong baseline for tri-modal sensor calibration.

Abstract: Advanced autonomous systems rely on multi-sensor fusion for safer and more robust perception. To enable effective fusion, calibrating directly from natural driving scenes (i.e., target-free) with high accuracy is crucial for precise multi-sensor alignment. Existing learning-based calibration methods are typically designed for only a single pair of sensor modalities (i.e., a bi-modal setup). Unlike these methods, we propose LiREC-Net, a target-free, learning-based calibration network that jointly calibrates multiple sensor modality pairs, including LiDAR, RGB, and event data, within a unified framework. To reduce redundant computation and improve efficiency, we introduce a shared LiDAR representation that leverages features from both its 3D nature and projected depth map, ensuring better consistency across modalities. Trained and evaluated on established datasets, such as KITTI and DSEC, our LiREC-Net achieves competitive performance to bi-modal models and sets a new strong baseline for the tri-modal use case.

### [50] [Accelerating Diffusion via Hybrid Data-Pipeline Parallelism Based on Conditional Guidance Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21760)
*Euisoo Jung,Byunghyun Kim,Hyunjin Kim,Seonghye Cho,Jae-Gil Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid parallelism framework for accelerating diffusion models, combining a novel data parallel strategy with adaptive pipeline scheduling to reduce latency while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion acceleration methods suffer from generation artifacts and inefficient GPU utilization, limiting their practical application despite the computational expense of diffusion models.

Method: The framework uses a data parallel strategy called condition-based partitioning and adaptive parallelism switching to optimize pipeline scheduling, leveraging differences between conditional and unconditional denoising paths.

Result: Achieves 2.31× and 2.07× latency reductions on SDXL and SD3, respectively, with two NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs, while preserving image quality and outperforming existing methods in high-resolution synthesis.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid parallelism framework effectively accelerates diffusion models without compromising quality, demonstrating generality across U-Net and DiT-based architectures.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in high-fidelity image, video, and audio generation, yet inference remains computationally expensive. Nevertheless, current diffusion acceleration methods based on distributed parallelism suffer from noticeable generation artifacts and fail to achieve substantial acceleration proportional to the number of GPUs. Therefore, we propose a hybrid parallelism framework that combines a novel data parallel strategy, condition-based partitioning, with an optimal pipeline scheduling method, adaptive parallelism switching, to reduce generation latency and achieve high generation quality in conditional diffusion models. The key ideas are to (i) leverage the conditional and unconditional denoising paths as a new data-partitioning perspective and (ii) adaptively enable optimal pipeline parallelism according to the denoising discrepancy between these two paths. Our framework achieves $2.31\times$ and $2.07\times$ latency reductions on SDXL and SD3, respectively, using two NVIDIA RTX~3090 GPUs, while preserving image quality. This result confirms the generality of our approach across U-Net-based diffusion models and DiT-based flow-matching architectures. Our approach also outperforms existing methods in acceleration under high-resolution synthesis settings. Code is available at https://github.com/kaist-dmlab/Hybridiff.

*Zhaoyang Wei,Xumeng Han,Xuehui Yu,Xue Yang,Guorong Li,Zhenjun Han,Jianbin Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAPNet++, a network addressing granularity ambiguity and boundary uncertainty in point-prompted instance segmentation through novel modules like Point Distance Guidance and Multi-level Affinity Refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of single-point annotations in tasks requiring high precision, such as PPIS, which struggles with granularity ambiguity and boundary uncertainty.

Method: The proposed SAPNet++ integrates Point Distance Guidance, Box Mining Strategy, completeness scores (S-MIL), and Multi-level Affinity Refinement to enhance segmentation accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate SAPNet++'s effectiveness in improving segmentation performance by mitigating annotation-related issues.

Conclusion: SAPNet++ advances PPIS by resolving granularity ambiguity and boundary uncertainty, showcasing potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Single-point annotation is increasingly prominent in visual tasks for labeling cost reduction. However, it challenges tasks requiring high precision, such as the point-prompted instance segmentation (PPIS) task, which aims to estimate precise masks using single-point prompts to train a segmentation network. Due to the constraints of point annotations, granularity ambiguity and boundary uncertainty arise the difficulty distinguishing between different levels of detail (eg. whole object vs. parts) and the challenge of precisely delineating object boundaries. Previous works have usually inherited the paradigm of mask generation along with proposal selection to achieve PPIS. However, proposal selection relies solely on category information, failing to resolve the ambiguity of different granularity. Furthermore, mask generators offer only finite discrete solutions that often deviate from actual masks, particularly at boundaries. To address these issues, we propose the Semantic-Aware Point-Prompted Instance Segmentation Network (SAPNet). It integrates Point Distance Guidance and Box Mining Strategy to tackle group and local issues caused by the point's granularity ambiguity. Additionally, we incorporate completeness scores within proposals to add spatial granularity awareness, enhancing multiple instance learning (MIL) in proposal selection termed S-MIL. The Multi-level Affinity Refinement conveys pixel and semantic clues, narrowing boundary uncertainty during mask refinement. These modules culminate in SAPNet++, mitigating point prompt's granularity ambiguity and boundary uncertainty and significantly improving segmentation performance. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets validate the effectiveness of our methods, highlighting the potential to advance PPIS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysicEdit introduces a physics-aware image editing framework using a large-scale dataset (PhysicTran38K) and a dual-thinking mechanism, outperforming existing methods in physical realism and knowledge-grounded editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image editing models struggle with rendering physically plausible results for complex dynamics like refraction or material deformation, as they treat editing as discrete mapping without addressing transition dynamics.

Method: The paper reformulates editing as predictive physical state transitions, using the PhysicTran38K dataset and a textual-visual dual-thinking mechanism combining a frozen Qwen2.5-VL for reasoning and learnable transition queries for adaptive guidance.

Result: PhysicEdit improves physical realism by 5.9% and knowledge-grounded editing by 10.1% over Qwen-Image-Edit, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source methods.

Conclusion: The proposed PhysicEdit framework effectively addresses limitations in physics-aware image editing, achieving superior performance and competitiveness with proprietary models.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable success in semantic alignment, yet state-of-the-art models frequently fail to render physically plausible results when editing involves complex causal dynamics, such as refraction or material deformation. We attribute this limitation to the dominant paradigm that treats editing as a discrete mapping between image pairs, which provides only boundary conditions and leaves transition dynamics underspecified. To address this, we reformulate physics-aware editing as predictive physical state transitions and introduce PhysicTran38K, a large-scale video-based dataset comprising 38K transition trajectories across five physical domains, constructed via a two-stage filtering and constraint-aware annotation pipeline. Building on this supervision, we propose PhysicEdit, an end-to-end framework equipped with a textual-visual dual-thinking mechanism. It combines a frozen Qwen2.5-VL for physically grounded reasoning with learnable transition queries that provide timestep-adaptive visual guidance to a diffusion backbone. Experiments show that PhysicEdit improves over Qwen-Image-Edit by 5.9% in physical realism and 10.1% in knowledge-grounded editing, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, while remaining competitive with leading proprietary models.

TL;DR: FAQ benchmark enhances VLMs' temporal deepfake detection by structured evaluation and instruction-tuning, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs miss temporal inconsistencies in deepfake detection, prompting FAQ's hierarchical evaluation approach.

Method: Proposes FAQ benchmark with three levels: Facial Perception, Temporal Deepfake Grounding, Forensic Reasoning; includes FAQ-IT instruction-tuning.

Result: VLMs fine-tuned on FAQ-IT show superior in-domain and cross-dataset detection performance.

Conclusion: FAQ effectively equips VLMs with temporal reasoning for deepfake detection, validated by ablation studies.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for deepfake detection excel at identifying spatial artifacts but overlook a critical dimension: temporal inconsistencies in video forgeries. Adapting VLMs to reason about these dynamic cues remains a distinct challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Forensic Answer-Questioning (FAQ), a large-scale benchmark that formulates temporal deepfake analysis as a multiple-choice task. FAQ introduces a three-level hierarchy to progressively evaluate and equip VLMs with forensic capabilities: (1) Facial Perception, testing the ability to identify static visual artifacts; (2) Temporal Deepfake Grounding, requiring the localization of dynamic forgery artifacts across frames; and (3) Forensic Reasoning, challenging models to synthesize evidence for final authenticity verdicts. We evaluate a range of VLMs on FAQ and generate a corresponding instruction-tuning set, FAQ-IT. Extensive experiments show that models fine-tuned on FAQ-IT achieve advanced performance on both in-domain and cross-dataset detection benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the impact of our key design choices, confirming that FAQ is the driving force behind the temporal reasoning capabilities of these VLMs.

*Zunhai Su,Weihao Ye,Hansen Feng,Keyu Fan,Jing Zhang,Dahai Yu,Zhengwu Liu,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XStreamVGGT introduces pruning and quantization to compress KV cache in StreamVGGT, reducing memory and latency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unbounded KV cache growth in StreamVGGT limits scalability for long-horizon applications due to high memory and latency.

Method: Proposes tuning-free KV cache compression via pruning (using token-importance) and dimension-adaptive quantization.

Result: Reduces memory by 4.42x, speeds up inference by 5.48x with negligible performance loss.

Conclusion: XStreamVGGT enables scalable and efficient streaming 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Learning-based 3D visual geometry models have significantly advanced with the advent of large-scale transformers. Among these, StreamVGGT leverages frame-wise causal attention to deliver robust and efficient streaming 3D reconstruction. However, it suffers from unbounded growth in the Key-Value (KV) cache due to the massive influx of vision tokens from multi-image and long-video inputs, leading to increased memory consumption and inference latency as input frames accumulate. This ultimately limits its scalability for long-horizon applications. To address this gap, we propose XStreamVGGT, a tuning-free approach that seamlessly integrates pruning and quantization to systematically compress the KV cache, enabling extremely memory-efficient streaming inference. Specifically, redundant KVs generated from multi-frame inputs are initially pruned to conform to a fixed KV memory budget using an efficient token-importance identification mechanism that maintains full compatibility with high-performance attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention). Additionally, leveraging the inherent distribution patterns of KV tensors, we apply dimension-adaptive KV quantization within the pruning pipeline to further minimize memory overhead while preserving numerical accuracy. Extensive evaluations show that XStreamVGGT achieves mostly negligible performance degradation while substantially reducing memory usage by 4.42$\times$ and accelerating inference by 5.48$\times$, enabling practical and scalable streaming 3D applications.

TL;DR: A fully learning-based approach for motion segmentation uses attention mechanisms to bypass noisy motion cues, achieving state-of-the-art performance efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations of conventional methods that rely on noisy motion cues and multi-stage pipelines prone to cumulative errors.

Method: Directly infers moving objects from latent features via attention mechanisms, leveraging reliable camera poses and spatial-temporal priors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art motion segmentation performance with high efficiency, eliminating complex pre-processing.

Conclusion: The proposed learning-based method outperforms traditional approaches by implicitly disentangling motion cues.

Abstract: Motion segmentation in dynamic scenes is highly challenging, as conventional methods heavily rely on estimating camera poses and point correspondences from inherently noisy motion cues. Existing statistical inference or iterative optimization techniques that struggle to mitigate the cumulative errors in multi-stage pipelines often lead to limited performance or high computational cost. In contrast, we propose a fully learning-based approach that directly infers moving objects from latent feature representations via attention mechanisms, thus enabling end-to-end feed-forward motion segmentation. Our key insight is to bypass explicit correspondence estimation and instead let the model learn to implicitly disentangle object and camera motion. Supported by recent advances in 4D scene geometry reconstruction (e.g., $π^3$), the proposed method leverages reliable camera poses and rich spatial-temporal priors, which ensure stable training and robust inference for the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by eliminating complex pre-processing and iterative refinement, our approach achieves state-of-the-art motion segmentation performance with high efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified model capable of handling diverse video and audio tasks (generation, inpainting, editing) with multimodal inputs while maintaining efficiency and quality at high resolutions.

Method: Employs a dual-stream Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture with shared text encoder, combining MMLM capabilities and in-context learning. Uses low-resolution full sequences and high-resolution keyframes for efficiency.

Result: Supports 1080p resolution, 32 FPS, and 15-second duration, enabling high-fidelity video with synchronized audio. Efficiently handles complex tasks like inpainting and editing.

Conclusion: SkyReels V4 is groundbreaking as the first video foundation model unifying multimodal input, joint video-audio tasks, and high-resolution efficiency.

Abstract: SkyReels V4 is a unified multi modal video foundation model for joint video audio generation, inpainting, and editing. The model adopts a dual stream Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture, where one branch synthesizes video and the other generates temporally aligned audio, while sharing a powerful text encoder based on the Multimodal Large Language Models (MMLM). SkyReels V4 accepts rich multi modal instructions, including text, images, video clips, masks, and audio references. By combining the MMLMs multi modal instruction following capability with in context learning in the video branch MMDiT, the model can inject fine grained visual guidance under complex conditioning, while the audio branch MMDiT simultaneously leverages audio references to guide sound generation. On the video side, we adopt a channel concatenation formulation that unifies a wide range of inpainting style tasks, such as image to video, video extension, and video editing under a single interface, and naturally extends to vision referenced inpainting and editing via multi modal prompts. SkyReels V4 supports up to 1080p resolution, 32 FPS, and 15 second duration, enabling high fidelity, multi shot, cinema level video generation with synchronized audio. To make such high resolution, long-duration generation computationally feasible, we introduce an efficiency strategy: Joint generation of low resolution full sequences and high-resolution keyframes, followed by dedicated super-resolution and frame interpolation models. To our knowledge, SkyReels V4 is the first video foundation model that simultaneously supports multi-modal input, joint video audio generation, and a unified treatment of generation, inpainting, and editing, while maintaining strong efficiency and quality at cinematic resolutions and durations.

TL;DR: SemVideo is a novel fMRI-to-video reconstruction framework addressing inconsistencies in object representation and temporal coherence by leveraging hierarchical semantic cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in fMRI-to-video reconstruction, such as appearance mismatches and poor temporal coherence.

Method: SemVideo uses hierarchical semantic guidance (SemMiner) with three key components: Semantic Alignment Decoder, Motion Adaptation Decoder, and Conditional Video Render.

Result: SemVideo outperforms existing methods in semantic alignment and temporal consistency on CC2017 and HCP datasets.

Conclusion: SemVideo sets a new benchmark in fMRI-to-video reconstruction by improving semantic and motion fidelity.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic visual experiences from brain activity provides a compelling avenue for exploring the neural mechanisms of human visual perception. While recent progress in fMRI-based image reconstruction has been notable, extending this success to video reconstruction remains a significant challenge. Current fMRI-to-video reconstruction approaches consistently encounter two major shortcomings: (i) inconsistent visual representations of salient objects across frames, leading to appearance mismatches; (ii) poor temporal coherence, resulting in motion misalignment or abrupt frame transitions. To address these limitations, we introduce SemVideo, a novel fMRI-to-video reconstruction framework guided by hierarchical semantic information. At the core of SemVideo is SemMiner, a hierarchical guidance module that constructs three levels of semantic cues from the original video stimulus: static anchor descriptions, motion-oriented narratives, and holistic summaries. Leveraging this semantic guidance, SemVideo comprises three key components: a Semantic Alignment Decoder that aligns fMRI signals with CLIP-style embeddings derived from SemMiner, a Motion Adaptation Decoder that reconstructs dynamic motion patterns using a novel tripartite attention fusion architecture, and a Conditional Video Render that leverages hierarchical semantic guidance for video reconstruction. Experiments conducted on the CC2017 and HCP datasets demonstrate that SemVideo achieves superior performance in both semantic alignment and temporal consistency, setting a new state-of-the-art in fMRI-to-video reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGI maps encode light-aware occlusion from monocular depth, enabling physically consistent shadow generation and relighting without full 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models often produce inconsistent illumination and shadows due to lack of physics-inspired priors. LGI addresses this by tying illumination direction to geometry.

Method: Proposes LGI maps computed from 2.5D depth maps and integrates them into a bridge-matching generative backbone for joint shadow generation and relighting.

Result: Experiments show improved realism and consistency in shadow generation and relighting across synthetic and real images.

Conclusion: LGI bridges geometry-inspired rendering with generative modeling, enabling efficient and physically consistent light-shadow interactions.

Abstract: We propose Light-Geometry Interaction (LGI) maps, a novel representation that encodes light-aware occlusion from monocular depth. Unlike ray tracing, which requires full 3D reconstruction, LGI captures essential light-shadow interactions reliably and accurately, computed from off-the-shelf 2.5D depth map predictions. LGI explicitly ties illumination direction to geometry, providing a physics-inspired prior that constrains generative models. Without such prior, these models often produce floating shadows, inconsistent illumination, and implausible shadow geometry. Building on this representation, we propose a unified pipeline for joint shadow generation and relighting - unlike prior methods that treat them as disjoint tasks - capturing the intrinsic coupling of illumination and shadowing essential for modeling indirect effects. By embedding LGI into a bridge-matching generative backbone, we reduce ambiguity and enforce physically consistent light-shadow reasoning. To enable effective training, we curated the first large-scale benchmark dataset for joint shadow and relighting, covering reflections, transparency, and complex interreflections. Experiments show significant gains in realism and consistency across synthetic and real images. LGI thus bridges geometry-inspired rendering with generative modeling, enabling efficient, physically consistent shadow generation and relighting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address hallucination of semantic relationships in visual storytelling by ensuring correct dialogue attribution and character interactions through alignment of scripts and subtitles.

Method: Align screenplay dialogue with subtitle timestamps using LCS matching, fine-tune Qwen Storyteller3 on the StoryMovie dataset, and evaluate using DeepSeek V3.

Result: Storyteller3 achieves an 89.9% win rate against base Qwen2.5-VL 7B and outperforms Storyteller (48.5% vs. 38.0%) in dialogue attribution.

Conclusion: Semantic alignment of scripts and subtitles enhances visual storytelling models beyond visual grounding alone.

Abstract: Visual storytelling models that correctly ground entities in images may still hallucinate semantic relationships, generating incorrect dialogue attribution, character interactions, or emotional states. We introduce StoryMovie, a dataset of 1,757 stories aligned with movie scripts and subtitles through LCS matching. Our alignment pipeline synchronizes screenplay dialogue with subtitle timestamps, enabling dialogue attribution by linking character names from scripts to temporal positions from subtitles. Using this aligned content, we generate stories that maintain visual grounding tags while incorporating authentic character names, dialogue, and relationship dynamics. We fine-tune Qwen Storyteller3 on this dataset, building on prior work in visual grounding and entity re-identification. Evaluation using DeepSeek V3 as judge shows that Storyteller3 achieves an 89.9% win rate against base Qwen2.5-VL 7B on subtitle alignment. Compared to Storyteller, trained without script grounding,
  Storyteller3 achieves 48.5% versus 38.0%, confirming that semantic alignment progressively improves dialogue attribution beyond visual grounding alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are fragmented and limited, failing to assess the unified capabilities of video foundation models.

Method: UniVBench incorporates 200 diverse, multi-shot videos with detailed captions and editing instructions, evaluated via a unified system (UniV-Eval).

Result: The benchmark enables fair, scalable, and reproducible comparisons, aligning evaluation with human judgment.

Conclusion: UniVBench provides a robust framework for measuring the integrated capabilities of video foundation models, advancing video intelligence.

Abstract: Video foundation models aim to integrate video understanding, generation, editing, and instruction following within a single framework, making them a central direction for next-generation multimodal systems. However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain fragmented and limited in scope, as they each target a single task, rely on task-specific metrics, and typically use short or simple video clips. As a result, they do not capture the unified capabilities that these models are designed to deliver. To address this gap, we introduce UniVBench, a benchmark purpose-built for evaluating video foundation models across four core abilities: video understanding, video generation, video editing, and a newly proposed task, video reconstruction, which assesses how faithfully a model can reproduce video content it has encountered. Our benchmark substantially expands the complexity of evaluation by incorporating 200 high-quality, diverse and multi-shot videos, each paired with detailed captions, multi-format editing instructions, and reference images. All videos are human-created and carefully validated, offering richer cinematic information than prior benchmarks. In addition, we develop a unified agentic evaluation system (UniV-Eval) that standardizes prompting, instruction parsing, and scoring across all tasks, enabling fair, scalable, and reproducible comparisons of unified video models. By grounding evaluation in instruction-based multi-shot video tasks, UniVBench provides the first framework for measuring the integrated capabilities that video foundation models aim to achieve. Extensive human annotations ensure our evaluation aligns with human judgment, enabling rigorous assessment and accelerating progress toward robust video intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Meta-FC, a meta-learning training strategy with feature consistency, to improve watermarking model robustness and generalization by addressing limitations of the single random distortion (SRD) strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SRD training neglects relationships among distortions, causing optimization conflicts and limiting robustness. Meta-FC aims to mitigate this by leveraging meta-learning and feature consistency.

Method: The Meta-FC strategy samples multiple distortions for meta-training, holds out one for meta-testing, and uses feature consistency loss to stabilize activations across distortions.

Result: Meta-FC improves robustness by 1.59%, 4.71%, and 2.38% under high-intensity, combined, and unknown distortions compared to SRD.

Conclusion: Meta-FC effectively enhances watermarking model robustness and generalization by leveraging meta-learning and feature consistency.

Abstract: Deep learning-based watermarking has made remarkable progress in recent years. To achieve robustness against various distortions, current methods commonly adopt a training strategy where a \underline{\textbf{s}}ingle \underline{\textbf{r}}andom \underline{\textbf{d}}istortion (SRD) is chosen as the noise layer in each training batch. However, the SRD strategy treats distortions independently within each batch, neglecting the inherent relationships among different types of distortions and causing optimization conflicts across batches. As a result, the robustness and generalizability of the watermarking model are limited. To address this issue, we propose a novel training strategy that enhances robustness and generalization via \underline{\textbf{meta}}-learning with \underline{\textbf{f}}eature \underline{\textbf{c}}onsistency (Meta-FC). Specifically, we randomly sample multiple distortions from the noise pool to construct a meta-training task, while holding out one distortion as a simulated ``unknown'' distortion for the meta-testing phase. Through meta-learning, the model is encouraged to identify and utilize neurons that exhibit stable activations across different types of distortions, mitigating the optimization conflicts caused by the random sampling of diverse distortions in each batch. To further promote the transformation of stable activations into distortion-invariant representations, we introduce a feature consistency loss that constrains the decoded features of the same image subjected to different distortions to remain consistent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to the SRD training strategy, Meta-FC improves the robustness and generalization of various watermarking models by an average of 1.59\%, 4.71\%, and 2.38\% under high-intensity, combined, and unknown distortions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate annotation of endoscopic videos is essential yet time-consuming, particularly for challenging datasets such as dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus, where the affected regions are irregular and lack clear boundaries. Semi-automatic tools like Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can ease this process by propagating annotations across frames, but small errors often accumulate and reduce accuracy, requiring expert review and correction. To address this, we systematically study how annotation errors propagate across different prompt types, namely masks, boxes, and points, and propose Learning-to-Re-Prompt (L2RP), a cost-aware framework that learns when and where to seek expert input. By tuning a human-cost parameter, our method balances annotation effort and segmentation accuracy. Experiments on a private Barrett's dysplasia dataset and the public SUN-SEG benchmark demonstrate improved temporal consistency and superior performance over baseline strategies.

*Yanbin Wei,Jiangyue Yan,Chun Kang,Yang Chen,Hua Liu,James Kwok,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynamicGTR dynamically selects optimal graph topology representations for VLMs to improve zero-shot graph QA performance, offering customizable accuracy and brevity trade-offs while showing strong transferability across tasks and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with accurately and efficiently comprehending structured graphs for QA due to rigid single graph topology representations, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The proposed DynamicGTR framework dynamically selects the most suitable graph topology representation per query during inference, enhancing VLMs' capabilities without additional training.

Result: DynamicGTR improves VLM performance in graph QA tasks and successfully transfers knowledge from synthetic to real-world applications like link prediction and node classification.

Conclusion: DynamicGTR is a flexible, effective solution for enhancing VLMs' zero-shot graph QA abilities, demonstrating broad applicability and transferability across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as versatile solutions for zero-shot question answering (QA) across various domains. However, enabling VLMs to effectively comprehend structured graphs and perform accurate, efficient QA remains challenging. Existing approaches typically rely on one single graph topology representation (GTR), such as fixed-style visual images or unified text descriptions. This ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy often neglects model-specific and task-specific preferences, resulting in inaccurate or over-lengthy responses to graph-related queries. To address this, we propose the $\mbox{DynamicGTR}$ framework, which dynamically selects the optimal GTR for each query during inference, thereby enhancing the zero-shot graph QA capabilities of VLMs with a customizable accuracy and brevity trade-off. Extensive experiments show that DynamicGTR not only improves VLM-based graph algorithm QA performance but also successfully transfers the experience trained from synthetic graph algorithm tasks to real-world applications like link prediction and node classification, without any additional training. Additionally, DynamicGTR demonstrates strong transferability across tasks, domains, and models, suggesting its potential as a flexible solution for broad graph scenarios.

*Lingfeng Ren,Weihao Yu,Runpeng Yu,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates object hallucination in LVLMs, attributing it to language decoder priors, and proposes NoLan, a training-free framework to reduce hallucinations by dynamically suppressing these priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object hallucination in LVLMs raises questions about the roles of vision encoders and language decoders in generating hallucinations.

Method: A systematic experiment analyzes hallucination sources, leading to the NoLan framework, which modulates language priors based on output distribution differences.

Result: NoLan significantly reduces hallucinations, improving accuracy on benchmarks like POPE for models such as LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-VL.

Conclusion: Language decoder priors are the primary source of hallucinations, and NoLan offers an effective, training-free solution.

Abstract: Object hallucination is a critical issue in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where outputs include objects that do not appear in the input image. A natural question arises from this phenomenon: Which component of the LVLM pipeline primarily contributes to object hallucinations? The vision encoder to perceive visual information, or the language decoder to generate text responses? In this work, we strive to answer this question through designing a systematic experiment to analyze the roles of the vision encoder and the language decoder in hallucination generation. Our observations reveal that object hallucinations are predominantly associated with the strong priors from the language decoder. Based on this finding, we propose a simple and training-free framework, No-Language-Hallucination Decoding, NoLan, which refines the output distribution by dynamically suppressing language priors, modulated based on the output distribution difference between multimodal and text-only inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that NoLan effectively reduces object hallucinations across various LVLMs on different tasks. For instance, NoLan achieves substantial improvements on POPE, enhancing the accuracy of LLaVA-1.5 7B and Qwen-VL 7B by up to 6.45 and 7.21, respectively. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/lingfengren/NoLan.

*Shiwei Lu,Yuhang He,Jiashuo Li,Qiang Wang,Yihong Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Generative Federated Prototype Learning (GFPL) to address challenges in federated learning (FL), such as biased model updates and high communication costs, by using prototype generation and aggregation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL struggles with biased model updates favoring majority-class features and high communication overhead from frequent parameter transmissions.

Method: GFPL uses a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for prototype generation, Bhattacharyya distance for prototype aggregation, and a dual-classifier architecture with hybrid loss for feature alignment.

Result: GFPL improves accuracy by 3.6% under imbalanced data while keeping communication costs low.

Conclusion: GFPL effectively tackles FL challenges, achieving better performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) facilitates the secure utilization of decentralized images, advancing applications in medical image recognition and autonomous driving. However, conventional FL faces two critical challenges in real-world deployment: ineffective knowledge fusion caused by model updates biased toward majority-class features, and prohibitive communication overhead due to frequent transmissions of high-dimensional model parameters. Inspired by the human brain's efficiency in knowledge integration, we propose a novel Generative Federated Prototype Learning (GFPL) framework to address these issues. Within this framework, a prototype generation method based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) captures the statistical information of class-wise features, while a prototype aggregation strategy using Bhattacharyya distance effectively fuses semantically similar knowledge across clients. In addition, these fused prototypes are leveraged to generate pseudo-features, thereby mitigating feature distribution imbalance across clients. To further enhance feature alignment during local training, we devise a dual-classifier architecture, optimized via a hybrid loss combining Dot Regression and Cross-Entropy. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show that GFPL improves model accuracy by 3.6% under imbalanced data settings while maintaining low communication cost.

*Francesco Laiti,Davide Talon,Jacopo Staiano,Elisa Ricci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Memorability Feedback (MemFeed) and MemCoach, a method to provide actionable guidance for improving image memorability using MLLMs, evaluated on MemBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image memorability studies focus on prediction or generative methods, lacking real-time user support for enhancing memorability during photo capture.

Method: MemCoach employs MLLMs with a teacher-student steering strategy to align model activations toward memorable patterns, providing natural language suggestions.

Result: Experiments show MemCoach outperforms zero-shot models, demonstrating its ability to not just predict but also guide memorability improvement.

Conclusion: The work shifts focus from memorability prediction to actionable feedback, proving memorability can be taught and instructed effectively.

Abstract: Image memorability, i.e., how likely an image is to be remembered, has traditionally been studied in computer vision either as a passive prediction task, with models regressing a scalar score, or with generative methods altering the visual input to boost the image likelihood of being remembered. Yet, none of these paradigms supports users at capture time, when the crucial question is how to improve a photo memorability. We introduce the task of Memorability Feedback (MemFeed), where an automated model should provide actionable, human-interpretable guidance to users with the goal to enhance an image future recall. We also present MemCoach, the first approach designed to provide concrete suggestions in natural language for memorability improvement (e.g., "emphasize facial expression," "bring the subject forward"). Our method, based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), is training-free and employs a teacher-student steering strategy, aligning the model internal activations toward more memorable patterns learned from a teacher model progressing along least-to-most memorable samples. To enable systematic evaluation on this novel task, we further introduce MemBench, a new benchmark featuring sequence-aligned photoshoots with annotated memorability scores. Our experiments, considering multiple MLLMs, demonstrate the effectiveness of MemCoach, showing consistently improved performance over several zero-shot models. The results indicate that memorability can not only be predicted but also taught and instructed, shifting the focus from mere prediction to actionable feedback for human creators.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EndoDDC, a depth completion method for endoscopic surgery that combines images, sparse depth data, and depth gradient features with a diffusion model to improve accuracy in challenging endoscopic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate depth estimation is crucial for endoscopic surgical robots, but existing methods struggle with weak textures and variable lighting. Depth completion can enhance accuracy, but its application in endoscopy is limited.

Method: Proposes EndoDDC, integrating images, sparse depth info, and depth gradient features optimized via a diffusion model to address texture and lighting issues in endoscopy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models in depth accuracy and robustness on two public endoscopy datasets.

Conclusion: EndoDDC shows promise in reducing visual errors in complex endoscopic environments, with code to be released openly.

Abstract: Accurate depth estimation plays a critical role in the navigation of endoscopic surgical robots, forming the foundation for 3D reconstruction and safe instrument guidance. Fine-tuning pretrained models heavily relies on endoscopic surgical datasets with precise depth annotations. While existing self-supervised depth estimation techniques eliminate the need for accurate depth annotations, their performance degrades in environments with weak textures and variable lighting, leading to sparse reconstruction with invalid depth estimation. Depth completion using sparse depth maps can mitigate these issues and improve accuracy. Despite the advances in depth completion techniques in general fields, their application in endoscopy remains limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose EndoDDC, an endoscopy depth completion method that integrates images, sparse depth information with depth gradient features, and optimizes depth maps through a diffusion model, addressing the issues of weak texture and light reflection in endoscopic environments. Extensive experiments on two publicly available endoscopy datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in both depth accuracy and robustness. This demonstrates the potential of our method to reduce visual errors in complex endoscopic environments. Our code will be released at https://github.com/yinheng-lin/EndoDDC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TIRAuxCloud, a multi-modal dataset combining thermal infrared and other spectral data to improve day and night cloud detection, addressing challenges like limited spectral information and low resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clouds obstruct Earth observation, affecting applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring. Current methods rely on solar illumination, failing at night.

Method: TIRAuxCloud integrates thermal infrared, optical, and near-infrared bands with auxiliary data (elevation, land cover, etc.) and includes automated and manual cloud masks.

Result: The dataset enables better cloud segmentation day and night, with benchmarks showing its utility for supervised and transfer learning.

Conclusion: TIRAuxCloud advances cloud detection methods by providing comprehensive multi-modal data, reducing ambiguity, and improving accuracy.

Abstract: Clouds are a major obstacle in Earth observation, limiting the usability and reliability of critical remote sensing applications such as fire disaster response, urban heat island monitoring, and snow and ice cover mapping. Therefore, the ability to detect clouds 24/7 is of paramount importance. While visible and near-infrared bands are effective for daytime cloud detection, their dependence on solar illumination makes them unsuitable for nighttime monitoring. In contrast, thermal infrared (TIR) imagery plays a crucial role in detecting clouds at night, when sunlight is absent. Due to their generally lower temperatures, clouds emit distinct thermal signatures that are detectable in TIR bands. Despite this, accurate nighttime cloud detection remains challenging due to limited spectral information and the typically lower spatial resolution of TIR imagery. To address these challenges, we present TIRAuxCloud, a multi-modal dataset centered around thermal spectral data to facilitate cloud segmentation under both daytime and nighttime conditions. The dataset comprises a unique combination of multispectral data (TIR, optical, and near-infrared bands) from Landsat and VIIRS, aligned with auxiliary information layers. Elevation, land cover, meteorological variables, and cloud-free reference images are included to help reduce surface-cloud ambiguity and cloud formation uncertainty. To overcome the scarcity of manual cloud labels, we include a large set of samples with automated cloud masks and a smaller manually annotated subset to further evaluate and improve models. Comprehensive benchmarks are presented to establish performance baselines through supervised and transfer learning, demonstrating the dataset's value in advancing the development of innovative methods for day and night time cloud detection.

Motivation: To enable scalable cardiovascular screening using routine chest imaging by extending CAC scoring to non-gated CT scans without additional scans or annotations.

Method: Developed CARD-ViT, a self-supervised Vision Transformer trained on gated CT data using DINO, applied to both gated and non-gated scans.

Result: Achieved 0.707 accuracy on non-gated scans (Cohen's kappa: 0.528) and 0.910 accuracy on gated scans (Cohen's kappa: 0.871/0.874), matching direct training performance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of cross-domain CAC scoring, supporting broader cardiovascular risk assessment in routine imaging.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is a key predictor of cardiovascular risk, but it relies on ECG-gated CT scans, restricting its use to specialized cardiac imaging settings. We introduce an automated framework for CAC detection and lesion-specific Agatston scoring that operates across both gated and non-gated CT scans. At its core is CARD-ViT, a self-supervised Vision Transformer trained exclusively on gated CT data using DINO. Without any non-gated training data, our framework achieves 0.707 accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.528 on the Stanford non-gated dataset, matching models trained directly on non-gated scans. On gated test sets, the framework achieves 0.910 accuracy with Cohen's kappa scores of 0.871 and 0.874 across independent datasets, demonstrating robust risk stratification. These results demonstrate the feasibility of cross-domain CAC scoring from gated to non-gated domains, supporting scalable cardiovascular screening in routine chest imaging without additional scans or annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance cryo-EM reconstruction by incorporating protein-structure priors and leveraging geometric regularization.

Method: Uses a GNN autodecoder mapping latent variables to 3D displacements of a template conformation, combined with ESL pose estimation and geometric regularization.

Result: Outperforms MLP in accuracy on synthetic datasets derived from molecular dynamics trajectories.

Conclusion: Geometry-informed inductive bias via GNN improves cryo-EM reconstruction.

Abstract: We present a geometry-aware method for heterogeneous single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction that predicts atomic backbone conformations. To incorporate protein-structure priors, we represent the backbone as a graph and use a graph neural network (GNN) autodecoder that maps per-image latent variables to 3D displacements of a template conformation. The objective combines a data-discrepancy term based on a differentiable cryo-EM forward model with geometric regularization, and it supports unknown orientations via ellipsoidal support lifting (ESL) pose estimation. On synthetic datasets derived from molecular dynamics trajectories, the proposed GNN achieves higher accuracy compared to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) of comparable size, highlighting the benefits of a geometry-informed inductive bias.

Motivation: Medical images often suffer from noise due to various factors, degrading their quality. Existing methods either lose fine details or are computationally expensive, limiting clinical use.

Method: PatchDenoiser decomposes denoising into local texture extraction and global context aggregation, using a spatially aware patch fusion strategy for efficient noise suppression.

Result: PatchDenoiser outperforms CNN- and GAN-based methods in PSNR and SSIM, reduces parameters by ~9x, and energy consumption by ~27x, while generalizing across scanners.

Conclusion: PatchDenoiser offers a practical, efficient solution for medical image denoising, balancing performance and clinical deployability.

Abstract: Medical images are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and research, but their quality is often degraded by noise from low-dose acquisition, patient motion, or scanner limitations, affecting both clinical interpretation and downstream analysis. Traditional filtering approaches often over-smooth and lose fine anatomical details, while deep learning methods, including CNNs, GANs, and transformers, may struggle to preserve such details or require large, computationally expensive models, limiting clinical practicality.
  We propose PatchDenoiser, a lightweight, energy-efficient multi-scale patch-based denoising framework. It decomposes denoising into local texture extraction and global context aggregation, fused via a spatially aware patch fusion strategy. This design enables effective noise suppression while preserving fine structural and anatomical details. PatchDenoiser is ultra-lightweight, with far fewer parameters and lower computational complexity than CNN-, GAN-, and transformer-based denoisers.
  On the 2016 Mayo Low-Dose CT dataset, PatchDenoiser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN- and GAN-based methods in PSNR and SSIM. It is robust to variations in slice thickness, reconstruction kernels, and HU windows, generalizes across scanners without fine-tuning, and reduces parameters by ~9x and energy consumption per inference by ~27x compared with conventional CNN denoisers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'geometry-as-context' for scene-consistent video generation, using an autoregressive model to estimate geometry and restore novel views, outperforming previous methods in consistency and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of prior methods like error accumulation and non-differentiable processes in 3D scene video generation.

Method: Proposes 'geometry-as-context', combining geometry estimation and novel view simulation with a camera gated attention module.

Result: Outperforms previous approaches in maintaining scene consistency and camera control.

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages camera poses and geometry to generate consistent and controlled scene videos.

Abstract: Scene-consistent video generation aims to create videos that explore 3D scenes based on a camera trajectory. Previous methods rely on video generation models with external memory for consistency, or iterative 3D reconstruction and inpainting, which accumulate errors during inference due to incorrect intermediary outputs, non-differentiable processes, and separate models. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ``geometry-as-context". It iteratively completes the following steps using an autoregressive camera-controlled video generation model: (1) estimates the geometry of the current view necessary for 3D reconstruction, and (2) simulates and restores novel view images rendered by the 3D scene. Under this multi-task framework, we develop the camera gated attention module to enhance the model's capability to effectively leverage camera poses. During the training phase, text contexts are utilized to ascertain whether geometric or RGB images should be generated. To ensure that the model can generate RGB-only outputs during inference, the geometry context is randomly dropped from the interleaved text-image-geometry training sequence. The method has been tested on scene video generation with one-direction and forth-and-back trajectories. The results show its superiority over previous approaches in maintaining scene consistency and camera control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operators for PDEs rely on single architectures, limiting their ability to handle heterogeneous features and complex dependencies, which hinders large-scale pre-training.

Method: The proposed approach uses a nested MoE framework with image-level MoE for global dependencies and token-level Sub-MoE for local dependencies, selectively activating expert networks.

Result: The model was pre-trained on twelve PDE datasets and successfully transferred to downstream tasks, demonstrating improved effectiveness.

Conclusion: The nested MoE framework enhances neural operators' capacity for PDE solutions, addressing limitations of single-architecture approaches and enabling large-scale pre-training.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as an efficient paradigm for solving PDEs, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical methods and significantly improving computational efficiency. However, due to the diversity and complexity of PDE systems, existing neural operators typically rely on a single network architecture, which limits their capacity to fully capture heterogeneous features and complex system dependencies. This constraint poses a bottleneck for large-scale PDE pre-training based on neural operators. To address these challenges, we propose a large-scale PDE pre-trained neural operator based on a nested Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework. In particular, the image-level MoE is designed to capture global dependencies, while the token-level Sub-MoE focuses on local dependencies. Our model can selectively activate the most suitable expert networks for a given input, thereby enhancing generalization and transferability. We conduct large-scale pre-training on twelve PDE datasets from diverse sources and successfully transfer the model to downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: D-ODR introduces a directed flow feature space to model Diabetic Retinopathy progression, outperforming existing ordinal regression methods by preventing biologically inconsistent transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ordinal regression methods ignore the unidirectional nature of DR progression, leading to biologically implausible feature representations.

Method: Proposes Directed Ordinal Diffusion Regularization (D-ODR), which constructs a progression-constrained directed graph and performs multi-scale diffusion to enforce forward disease evolution.

Result: D-ODR achieves superior grading performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, ensuring clinically reliable severity assessment.

Conclusion: D-ODR aligns feature representation with DR's natural trajectory, offering a more accurate and biologically plausible model for disease progression.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) progresses as a continuous and irreversible deterioration of the retina, following a well-defined clinical trajectory from mild to severe stages. However, most existing ordinal regression approaches model DR severity as a set of static, symmetric ranks, capturing relative order while ignoring the inherent unidirectional nature of disease progression. As a result, the learned feature representations may violate biological plausibility, allowing implausible proximity between non-consecutive stages or even reverse transitions. To bridge this gap, we propose Directed Ordinal Diffusion Regularization (D-ODR), which explicitly models the feature space as a directed flow by constructing a progression-constrained directed graph that strictly enforces forward disease evolution. By performing multi-scale diffusion on this directed structure, D-ODR imposes penalties on score inversions along valid progression paths, thereby effectively preventing the model from learning biologically inconsistent reverse transitions. This mechanism aligns the feature representation with the natural trajectory of DR worsening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-ODR yields superior grading performance compared to state-of-the-art ordinal regression and DR-specific grading methods, offering a more clinically reliable assessment of disease severity.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of vision impairment worldwide. However, manual diagnosis is often time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to delays in screening. This paper presents a lightweight automated deep learning framework for efficient assessment of DR severity from digital fundus images. We use a MobileNetV3 architecture with a Consistent Rank Logits (CORAL) head to model the ordered progression of disease while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained environments. The model is trained and validated on a combined dataset of APTOS 2019 and IDRiD images using a preprocessing pipeline including circular cropping and illumination normalization. Extensive experiments including 3-fold cross-validation and ablation studies demonstrate strong performance. The model achieves a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) score of 0.9019 and an accuracy of 80.03 percent. Additionally, we address real-world deployment challenges through model calibration to reduce overconfidence and optimization for mobile devices. The proposed system provides a scalable and practical tool for early-stage diabetic retinopathy screening.

TL;DR: MVGFDR is a multi-view graph fusion framework for diabetic retinopathy grading, addressing overlooked inter-view correlations in existing methods by disentangling shared and view-specific features through frequency-domain integration and masked reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate diabetic retinopathy grading is crucial for timely intervention, and existing methods fail to fully exploit inter-view correlations in multi-view fundus images.

Method: MVGFDR uses a Multi-View Graph Fusion module with graph initialization, fusion based on frequency-domain relevance, and masked cross-view reconstruction to learn shared and view-specific features.

Result: MVGFDR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the MFIDDR dataset, demonstrating superior performance in diabetic retinopathy grading.

Conclusion: The proposed MVGFDR framework effectively captures inter-view correlations and improves DR grading accuracy, showcasing its potential for clinical applications.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of vision loss worldwide, making early and accurate DR grading critical for timely intervention. Recent clinical practices leverage multi-view fundus images for DR detection with a wide coverage of the field of view (FOV), motivating deep learning methods to explore the potential of multi-view learning for DR grading. However, existing methods often overlook the inter-view correlations when fusing multi-view fundus images, failing to fully exploit the inherent consistency across views originating from the same patient. In this work, we present MVGFDR, an end-to-end Multi-View Graph Fusion framework for DR grading. Different from existing methods that directly fuse visual features from multiple views, MVGFDR is equipped with a novel Multi-View Graph Fusion (MVGF) module to explicitly disentangle the shared and view-specific visual features. Specifically, MVGF comprises three key components: (1) Multi-view Graph Initialization, which constructs visual graphs via residual-guided connections and employs Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients as frequency-domain anchors; (2) Multi-view Graph Fusion, which integrates selective nodes across multi-view graphs based on frequency-domain relevance to capture complementary view-specific information; and (3) Masked Cross-view Reconstruction, which leverages masked reconstruction of shared information across views to facilitate view-invariant representation learning. Extensive experimental results on MFIDDR, by far the largest multi-view fundus image dataset, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over existing state-of-the-art approaches in diabetic retinopathy grading.

TL;DR: MindDriver is a progressive multimodal reasoning framework for autonomous driving that bridges the gap between textual reasoning and physical trajectory planning using aligned multimodal data and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with aligning text semantics to physical trajectory planning, lacking clear objectives for accurate scene evolution.

Method: MindDriver introduces a framework with three stages: semantic understanding, semantic-to-physical space imagination, and trajectory planning, supported by a feedback-guided data annotation pipeline and progressive reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: MindDriver outperforms existing methods in both nuScenes (open-loop) and Bench2Drive (closed-loop) evaluations.

Conclusion: MindDriver effectively enhances VLM reasoning for autonomous driving by aligning multimodal reasoning processes and optimizing planning accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLM) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, showing promise for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Chain-of-Thought (CoT), as VLM's widely used reasoning strategy, is facing critical challenges. Existing textual CoT has a large gap between text semantic space and trajectory physical space. Although the recent approach utilizes future image to replace text as CoT process, it lacks clear planning-oriented objective guidance to generate images with accurate scene evolution. To address these, we innovatively propose MindDriver, a progressive multimodal reasoning framework that enables VLM to imitate human-like progressive thinking for autonomous driving. MindDriver presents semantic understanding, semantic-to-physical space imagination, and physical-space trajectory planning. To achieve aligned reasoning processes in MindDriver, we develop a feedback-guided automatic data annotation pipeline to generate aligned multimodal reasoning training data. Furthermore, we develop a progressive reinforcement fine-tuning method to optimize the alignment through progressive high- level reward-based learning. MindDriver demonstrates superior performance in both nuScences open-loop and Bench2Drive closed-loop evaluation. Codes are available at https://github.com/hotdogcheesewhite/MindDriver.

TL;DR: GLoTran improves TIMT by integrating global and local visual perception with multimodal large language models, addressing issues like text omission and semantic drift in high-resolution, text-rich images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TIMT methods struggle with high-resolution, text-rich images due to cluttered layouts and non-textual distractions, leading to text omission and semantic drift.

Method: Proposes GLoTran, a global-local dual visual perception framework integrating low-resolution global images with multi-scale text slices, guided by instructions to maintain contextual consistency and capture textual details.

Result: GLoTran significantly improves translation completeness and accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art MLLMs, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: GLoTran offers a new paradigm for fine-grained TIMT under high-resolution and text-rich conditions, enhancing visual-linguistic integration.

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate text embedded in images in the source-language into target-language, requiring synergistic integration of visual perception and linguistic understanding. Existing TIMT methods, whether cascaded pipelines or end-to-end multimodal large language models (MLLMs),struggle with high-resolution text-rich images due to cluttered layouts, diverse fonts, and non-textual distractions, resulting in text omission, semantic drift, and contextual inconsistency. To address these challenges, we propose GLoTran, a global-local dual visual perception framework for MLLM-based TIMT. GLoTran integrates a low-resolution global image with multi-scale region-level text image slices under an instruction-guided alignment strategy, conditioning MLLMs to maintain scene-level contextual consistency while faithfully capturing fine-grained textual details. Moreover, to realize this dual-perception paradigm, we construct GLoD, a large-scale text-rich TIMT dataset comprising 510K high-resolution global-local image-text pairs covering diverse real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GLoTran substantially improves translation completeness and accuracy over state-of-the-art MLLMs, offering a new paradigm for fine-grained TIMT under high-resolution and text-rich conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces edge prioritization for pose graph initialization in SfM, improving reconstruction accuracy by leveraging globally consistent edge reliability and connectivity-aware score modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SfM pipelines rely on sparse pose graphs and independent image retrieval methods, which ignore global consistency, leading to less reliable reconstructions.

Method: The proposed method includes a GNN for predicting edge reliability, multi-minimal-spanning-tree-based pose graph construction, and connectivity-aware score modulation to enhance graph reliability and compactness.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in ambiguous scenes and improves reconstruction accuracy in sparse and high-speed settings.

Conclusion: Globally informed initialization via edge prioritization yields more reliable and compact pose graphs, enhancing SfM performance.

Abstract: The pose graph is a core component of Structure-from-Motion (SfM), where images act as nodes and edges encode relative poses. Since geometric verification is expensive, SfM pipelines restrict the pose graph to a sparse set of candidate edges, making initialization critical. Existing methods rely on image retrieval to connect each image to its $k$ nearest neighbors, treating pairs independently and ignoring global consistency. We address this limitation through the concept of edge prioritization, ranking candidate edges by their utility for SfM. Our approach has three components: (1) a GNN trained with SfM-derived supervision to predict globally consistent edge reliability; (2) multi-minimal-spanning-tree-based pose graph construction guided by these ranks; and (3) connectivity-aware score modulation that reinforces weak regions and reduces graph diameter. This globally informed initialization yields more reliable and compact pose graphs, improving reconstruction accuracy in sparse and high-speed settings and outperforming SOTA retrieval methods on ambiguous scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MasqLoRA is a stealthy attack framework exploiting LoRA modules in text-to-image diffusion models to inject malicious behavior via trigger words, achieving 99.8% success with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight the security risks posed by the modular flexibility of LoRA in text-to-image diffusion models, which expands the attack surface.

Method: Freeze the base model and train a standalone LoRA module using trigger word-target image pairs to embed hidden cross-modal mappings.

Result: MasqLoRA achieves a high attack success rate of 99.8% with minimal training overhead, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: MasqLoRA exposes significant threats in the AI supply chain, calling for dedicated defenses for LoRA-based sharing ecosystems.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a leading technique for efficiently fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models, and its widespread adoption on open-source platforms has fostered a vibrant culture of model sharing and customization. However, the same modular and plug-and-play flexibility that makes LoRA appealing also introduces a broader attack surface. To highlight this risk, we propose Masquerade-LoRA (MasqLoRA), the first systematic attack framework that leverages an independent LoRA module as the attack vehicle to stealthily inject malicious behavior into text-to-image diffusion models. MasqLoRA operates by freezing the base model parameters and updating only the low-rank adapter weights using a small number of "trigger word-target image" pairs. This enables the attacker to train a standalone backdoor LoRA module that embeds a hidden cross-modal mapping: when the module is loaded and a specific textual trigger is provided, the model produces a predefined visual output; otherwise, it behaves indistinguishably from the benign model, ensuring the stealthiness of the attack. Experimental results demonstrate that MasqLoRA can be trained with minimal resource overhead and achieves a high attack success rate of 99.8%. MasqLoRA reveals a severe and unique threat in the AI supply chain, underscoring the urgent need for dedicated defense mechanisms for the LoRA-centric sharing ecosystem.

TL;DR: PanoEnv introduces a VQA benchmark for 3D spatial reasoning on 360° images, revealing VLMs' limitations. A reinforcement learning framework improves performance, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with 3D spatial reasoning on equirectangular images due to distortions and lack of supervision.

Method: PanoEnv is a large-scale benchmark with 14.8K questions. A GRPO-based RL framework with geometry-aware strategies and a two-stage curriculum enhances 3D reasoning.

Result: The 7B model improves overall accuracy to 52.93% (+3.59%) and OE accuracy to 14.83%, outperforming larger models.

Conclusion: PanoEnv-QA and the RL framework effectively improve VLMs' 3D spatial intelligence.

Abstract: 360 panoramic images are increasingly used in virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics for holistic scene understanding. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with 3D spatial reasoning on Equirectangular Projection (ERP) images due to geometric distortion and limited 3D supervision. We introduce PanoEnv, a large-scale VQA benchmark built from synthetic 3D environments, containing 14.8K questions across five categories (e.g., relative position, volume comparison) grounded in accurate 3D annotations including depth, segmentation, and bounding boxes. Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals limited 3D understanding, achieving only 49.34% overall accuracy and 8.36% on open-ended (OE) questions. To enhance 3D reasoning, we propose a reinforcement learning post-training framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a ground-truth-guided reward that incorporates five geometry-aware strategies such as distance tolerance and spatial consistency. A two-stage curriculum further mitigates catastrophic forgetting: Stage 1 trains on structured tasks (true/false and multiple choice), and Stage 2 fine-tunes on mixed open-ended data to improve generalization. Our 7B model achieves new state-of-the-art performance, improving overall accuracy to 52.93% (+3.59%) and open-ended accuracy to 14.83% while maintaining structured-task performance. It also achieves top semantic evaluation scores (Q-Score 6.24, P-Score 5.95), surpassing 32B models. These results demonstrate that PanoEnv-QA and our curriculum-based RL framework effectively instill 3D spatial intelligence in VLMs for omnidirectional perception.

TL;DR: Off-the-shelf GenAI models can bypass image protection schemes by acting as generic denoisers, outperforming specialized attacks and exposing vulnerabilities in current defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal the inadequacy of existing image protection methods against repurposed GenAI models.

Method: Repurposing image-to-image GenAI models as denoisers using simple text prompts to remove protective perturbations.

Result: Successfully bypassed 8 protection schemes across 6 diverse methods, outperforming specialized attacks.

Conclusion: Current image protection schemes are vulnerable, necessitating robust defenses and benchmarking against GenAI-based attacks.

Abstract: Advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to the development of various protection strategies to prevent the unauthorized use of images. These methods rely on adding imperceptible protective perturbations to images to thwart misuse such as style mimicry or deepfake manipulations. Although previous attacks on these protections required specialized, purpose-built methods, we demonstrate that this is no longer necessary. We show that off-the-shelf image-to-image GenAI models can be repurposed as generic ``denoisers" using a simple text prompt, effectively removing a wide range of protective perturbations. Across 8 case studies spanning 6 diverse protection schemes, our general-purpose attack not only circumvents these defenses but also outperforms existing specialized attacks while preserving the image's utility for the adversary. Our findings reveal a critical and widespread vulnerability in the current landscape of image protection, indicating that many schemes provide a false sense of security. We stress the urgent need to develop robust defenses and establish that any future protection mechanism must be benchmarked against attacks from off-the-shelf GenAI models.

TL;DR: RobustVisRAG enhances VisRAG by addressing performance degradation caused by visual distortions through a causality-guided dual-path framework, improving robustness while maintaining efficiency and zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VisRAG models struggle with distorted visual inputs due to entangled semantic and degradation factors in pretrained encoders, leading to retrieval and generation errors.

Method: RobustVisRAG introduces a dual-path framework: a non-causal path detects degradation signals, and a causal path learns purified semantics guided by these signals, supported by Non-Causal Distortion Modeling and Causal Semantic Alignment objectives.

Result: RobustVisRAG improves retrieval, generation, and end-to-end performance by 7.35%, 6.35%, and 12.40% on real-world degradations, respectively, while maintaining accuracy on clean inputs.

Conclusion: RobustVisRAG effectively separates semantics from degradations, enhancing VisRAG robustness under challenging visual conditions without sacrificing performance on clean inputs.

Abstract: Vision-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VisRAG) leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to jointly retrieve relevant visual documents and generate grounded answers based on multimodal evidence. However, existing VisRAG models degrade in performance when visual inputs suffer from distortions such as blur, noise, low light, or shadow, where semantic and degradation factors become entangled within pretrained visual encoders, leading to errors in both retrieval and generation stages. To address this limitation, we introduce RobustVisRAG, a causality-guided dual-path framework that improves VisRAG robustness while preserving efficiency and zero-shot generalization. RobustVisRAG uses a non-causal path to capture degradation signals through unidirectional attention and a causal path to learn purified semantics guided by these signals. Together with the proposed Non-Causal Distortion Modeling and Causal Semantic Alignment objectives, the framework enforces a clear separation between semantics and degradations, enabling stable retrieval and generation under challenging visual conditions. To evaluate robustness under realistic conditions, we introduce the Distortion-VisRAG dataset, a large-scale benchmark containing both synthetic and real-world degraded documents across seven domains, with 12 synthetic and 5 real distortion types that comprehensively reflect practical visual degradations. Experimental results show that RobustVisRAG improves retrieval, generation, and end-to-end performance by 7.35%, 6.35%, and 12.40%, respectively, on real-world degradations, while maintaining comparable accuracy on clean inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of real-world datasets with reliable albedo and shading supervision has limited progress in outdoor IID. Olbedo addresses this gap.

Method: Olbedo includes 5,664 UAV images with annotations derived from inverse-rendering refinement over multi-view stereo reconstructions and calibrated sky illumination.

Result: Fine-tuning on Olbedo improves single-view outdoor albedo prediction on benchmarks and supports applications like multi-view relighting and material editing.

Conclusion: Olbedo advances outdoor IID research by providing a robust dataset and demonstrating its utility for real-world applications.

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition (IID) of outdoor scenes is crucial for relighting, editing, and understanding large-scale environments, but progress has been limited by the lack of real-world datasets with reliable albedo and shading supervision. We introduce Olbedo, a large-scale aerial dataset for outdoor albedo--shading decomposition in the wild. Olbedo contains 5,664 UAV images captured across four landscape types, multiple years, and diverse illumination conditions. Each view is accompanied by multi-view consistent albedo and shading maps, metric depth, surface normals, sun and sky shading components, camera poses, and, for recent flights, measured HDR sky domes. These annotations are derived from an inverse-rendering refinement pipeline over multi-view stereo reconstructions and calibrated sky illumination, together with per-pixel confidence masks. We demonstrate that Olbedo enables state-of-the-art diffusion-based IID models, originally trained on synthetic indoor data, to generalize to real outdoor imagery: fine-tuning on Olbedo significantly improves single-view outdoor albedo prediction on the MatrixCity benchmark. We further illustrate applications of Olbedo-trained models to multi-view consistent relighting of 3D assets, material editing, and scene change analysis for urban digital twins. We release the dataset, baseline models, and an evaluation protocol to support future research in outdoor intrinsic decomposition and illumination-aware aerial vision.

Motivation: The limitations of Referring Multi-Object Tracking in low-visibility conditions (e.g., nighttime, smoke) inspired the fusion of RGB and thermal modalities for robust all-day tracking.

Result: Experiments on the RefRT dataset confirm RTrack's effectiveness, showcasing improved target perception completeness and accuracy.

Conclusion: The RT-RMOT task and RTrack framework advance multi-object tracking in challenging conditions, supported by the novel RefRT dataset and optimization techniques.

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking has attracted increasing attention due to its human-friendly interactive characteristics, yet it exhibits limitations in low-visibility conditions, such as nighttime, smoke, and other challenging scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new RGB-Thermal RMOT task, named RT-RMOT, which aims to fuse RGB appearance features with the illumination robustness of the thermal modality to enable all-day referring multi-object tracking. To promote research on RT-RMOT, we construct the first Referring Multi-Object Tracking dataset under RGB-Thermal modality, named RefRT. It contains 388 language descriptions, 1,250 tracked targets, and 166,147 Language-RGB-Thermal (L-RGB-T) triplets. Furthermore, we propose RTrack, a framework built upon a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that integrates RGB, thermal, and textual features. Since the initial framework still leaves room for improvement, we introduce a Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) strategy to further exploit the model's potential. To alleviate training instability during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a Clipped Advantage Scaling (CAS) strategy to suppress gradient explosion. In addition, we design Structured Output Reward and Comprehensive Detection Reward to balance exploration and exploitation, thereby improving the completeness and accuracy of target perception. Extensive experiments on the RefRT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RTrack framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating garment assembly is challenging due to lack of standardized annotations and reliance on handcrafted heuristics. AutoSew addresses this by relying solely on geometric input.

Method: AutoSew formulates stitching prediction as a graph matching task using a Graph Neural Network and differentiable optimal transport solver. It updates the GarmentCodeData dataset with realistic annotations.

Result: AutoSew achieves a 96% F1-score and successfully assembles 73.3% of test garments without error, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Geometry alone can robustly guide stitching prediction, enabling scalable garment assembly without manual input.

Abstract: Automating garment assembly from sewing patterns remains a significant challenge due to the lack of standardized annotation protocols and the frequent absence of semantic cues. Existing methods often rely on panel labels or handcrafted heuristics, which limit their applicability to real-world, non-conforming patterns. We present AutoSew, a fully automatic, geometry-based approach for predicting stitch correspondences directly from 2D pattern contours. AutoSew formulates the problem as a graph matching task, leveraging a Graph Neural Network to capture local and global geometric context, and employing a differentiable optimal transport solver to infer stitching relationships-including multi-edge connections. To support this task, we update the GarmentCodeData dataset modifying over 18k patterns with realistic multi-edge annotations, reflecting industrial assembly scenarios. AutoSew achieves 96% F1-score and successfully assembles 73.3% of test garments without error, outperforming existing methods while relying solely on geometric input. Our results demonstrate that geometry alone can robustly guide stitching prediction, enabling scalable garment assembly without manual input.

TL;DR: AdaSpot is a framework for Precise Event Spotting in videos, using adaptive high-resolution processing of informative regions to improve efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods inefficiently process all video frames uniformly, missing fine details and wasting computation on non-informative areas.

Method: AdaSpot processes low-resolution videos globally and adaptively selects key regions for high-resolution processing using an unsupervised, task-aware strategy.

Result: AdaSpot achieves state-of-the-art performance (+3.96 and +2.26 mAP@0 frames on benchmarks like Tennis and FineDiving) with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: AdaSpot efficiently balances computational cost and precision, outperforming uniform processing methods.

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting aims to localize fast-paced actions or events in videos with high temporal precision, a key task for applications in sports analytics, robotics, and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically process all frames uniformly, overlooking the inherent spatio-temporal redundancy in video data. This leads to redundant computation on non-informative regions while limiting overall efficiency. To remain tractable, they often spatially downsample inputs, losing fine-grained details crucial for precise localization. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{AdaSpot}, a simple yet effective framework that processes low-resolution videos to extract global task-relevant features while adaptively selecting the most informative region-of-interest in each frame for high-resolution processing. The selection is performed via an unsupervised, task-aware strategy that maintains spatio-temporal consistency across frames and avoids the training instability of learnable alternatives. This design preserves essential fine-grained visual cues with a marginal computational overhead compared to low-resolution-only baselines, while remaining far more efficient than uniform high-resolution processing. Experiments on standard PES benchmarks demonstrate that \textbf{AdaSpot} achieves state-of-the-art performance under strict evaluation metrics (\eg, $+3.96$ and $+2.26$ mAP$@0$ frames on Tennis and FineDiving), while also maintaining strong results under looser metrics.

Result: LFG surpasses multi-camera and LiDAR baselines on NAVSIM and performs well on semantic, geometric, and motion prediction tasks.

Conclusion: LFG is a promising video-centric foundation model for autonomous driving, offering scalable learning from raw videos.

Abstract: Ego-centric driving videos available online provide an abundant source of visual data for autonomous driving, yet their lack of annotations makes it difficult to learn representations that capture both semantic structure and 3D geometry. Recent advances in large feedforward spatial models demonstrate that point maps and ego-motion can be inferred in a single forward pass, suggesting a promising direction for scalable driving perception. We therefore propose a label-free, teacher-guided framework for learning autonomous driving representations directly from unposed videos. Unlike prior self-supervised approaches that focus primarily on frame-to-frame consistency, we posit that safe and reactive driving depends critically on temporal context. To this end, we leverage a feedforward architecture equipped with a lightweight autoregressive module, trained using multi-modal supervisory signals that guide the model to jointly predict current and future point maps, camera poses, semantic segmentation, and motion masks. Multi-modal teachers provide sequence-level pseudo-supervision, enabling LFG to learn a unified pseudo-4D representation from raw YouTube videos without poses, labels, or LiDAR. The resulting encoder not only transfers effectively to downstream autonomous driving planning on the NAVSIM benchmark, surpassing multi-camera and LiDAR baselines with only a single monocular camera, but also yields strong performance when evaluated on a range of semantic, geometric, and qualitative motion prediction tasks. These geometry and motion-aware features position LFG as a compelling video-centric foundation model for autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The CXR-LT 2026 challenge introduces a multi-center dataset to address issues in CXR interpretation, focusing on robust multi-label classification and open-world generalization for rare diseases. Top teams achieved notable results using vision-language pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CXR benchmarks lack representation of rare diseases and novel findings due to closed-set classes and single-institution data. This challenge aims to improve generalization and robustness in real-world clinical settings.

Method: The challenge uses a multi-center dataset (PadChest and NIH Chest X-ray) with 145,000+ images. It defines two tasks: multi-label classification on 30 known classes and open-world generalization to 6 unseen rare disease classes.

Result: Top-performing teams achieved an mAP of 0.5854 for Task 1 and 0.4315 for Task 2. Vision-language pre-training helped reduce performance drops in zero-shot diagnosis.

Conclusion: Large-scale vision-language pre-training enhances robustness and generalization in CXR interpretation, particularly for rare and unseen diseases.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation is hindered by the long-tailed distribution of pathologies and the open-world nature of clinical environments. Existing benchmarks often rely on closed-set classes from single institutions, failing to capture the prevalence of rare diseases or the appearance of novel findings. To address this, we present the CXR-LT 2026 challenge. This third iteration of the benchmark introduces a multi-center dataset comprising over 145,000 images from PadChest and NIH Chest X-ray datasets. The challenge defines two core tasks: (1) Robust Multi-Label Classification on 30 known classes and (2) Open-World Generalization to 6 unseen (out-of-distribution) rare disease classes. We report the results of the top-performing teams, evaluating them via mean Average Precision (mAP), AUROC, and F1-score. The winning solutions achieved an mAP of 0.5854 on Task 1 and 0.4315 on Task 2, demonstrating that large-scale vision-language pre-training significantly mitigates the performance drop typically associated with zero-shot diagnosis.

*Wenhua Wu,Huai Guan,Zhe Liu,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeatherCity is a novel framework for high-fidelity 4D urban scene reconstruction and weather editing, addressing limitations in existing methods by enabling flexible weather control and object-level manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack diverse weather simulation capabilities and suffer from artifacts or poor controllability. WeatherCity aims to overcome these limitations for autonomous driving applications.

Method: The framework uses a text-guided image editing model for weather backgrounds, introduces a weather Gaussian representation with shared features and dedicated decoders, and employs physics-driven models for dynamic weather effects.

Result: Experiments show WeatherCity achieves flexible controllability, high fidelity, and temporal consistency in 4D reconstruction and weather editing, supporting fine-grained control and object-level manipulation.

Conclusion: WeatherCity provides a robust solution for 4D scene reconstruction and weather editing, enhancing realism and control for autonomous driving simulations.

Abstract: Editable high-fidelity 4D scenes are crucial for autonomous driving, as they can be applied to end-to-end training and closed-loop simulation. However, existing reconstruction methods are primarily limited to replicating observed scenes and lack the capability for diverse weather simulation. While image-level weather editing methods tend to introduce scene artifacts and offer poor controllability over the weather effects. To address these limitations, we propose WeatherCity, a novel framework for 4D urban scene reconstruction and weather editing. Specifically, we leverage a text-guided image editing model to achieve flexible editing of image weather backgrounds. To tackle the challenge of multi-weather modeling, we introduce a novel weather Gaussian representation based on shared scene features and dedicated weather-specific decoders. This representation is further enhanced with a content consistency optimization, ensuring coherent modeling across different weather conditions. Additionally, we design a physics-driven model that simulates dynamic weather effects through particles and motion patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and various scenes demonstrate that WeatherCity achieves flexible controllability, high fidelity, and temporal consistency in 4D reconstruction and weather editing. Our framework not only enables fine-grained control over weather conditions (e.g., light rain and heavy snow) but also supports object-level manipulation within the scene.

TL;DR: Brain3D is a 3D vision-language framework for generating radiology reports from brain tumor MRIs, outperforming 2D baselines by maintaining spatial context and leveraging staged alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs fragment spatial context in volumetric brain MRIs, leading to inaccurate interpretations. Brain3D addresses this by preserving 3D context for neuroradiology.

Method: Inflates a pretrained 2D encoder into 3D, aligning it with a language model via contrastive grounding, projector warmup, and LoRA specialization.

Result: Achieves Clinical Pathology F1 of 0.951 vs. 0.413 for 2D baselines, with perfect specificity on healthy scans.

Conclusion: Staged alignment (contrastive grounding, warmup, LoRA) is key for structured clinical reports, outperforming fragmented 2D approaches.

Abstract: Current medical vision-language models (VLMs) process volumetric brain MRI using 2D slice-based approximations, fragmenting the spatial context required for accurate neuroradiological interpretation. We developed \textbf{Brain3D}, a staged vision-language framework for automated radiology report generation from 3D brain tumor MRI. Our approach inflates a pretrained 2D medical encoder into a native 3D architecture and progressively aligns it with a causal language model through three stages: contrastive grounding, supervised projector warmup, and LoRA-based linguistic specialization. Unlike generalist 3D medical VLMs, \textbf{Brain3D} is tailored to neuroradiology, where hemispheric laterality, tumor infiltration patterns, and anatomical localization are critical. Evaluated on 468 subjects (BraTS pathological cases plus healthy controls), our model achieves a Clinical Pathology F1 of 0.951 versus 0.413 for a strong 2D baseline while maintaining perfect specificity on healthy scans. The staged alignment proves essential: contrastive grounding establishes visual-textual correspondence, projector warmup stabilizes conditioning, and LoRA adaptation shifts output from verbose captions to structured clinical reports\footnote{Our code is publicly available for transparency and reproducibility

TL;DR: GeoDiv framework evaluates geographical diversity in T2I models, uncovering biases and lack of diversity in depictions of countries like India, Nigeria, and Colombia.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of geographical diversity and biases in T2I models, which misrepresent regions and reinforce stereotypes.

Method: Introduces GeoDiv, using large language and vision-language models to assess diversity via Socio-Economic Visual Index (SEVI) and Visual Diversity Index (VDI).

Result: Reveals consistent lack of diversity and biased portrayals, especially in countries like India, Nigeria, and Colombia.

Conclusion: GeoDiv offers a systematic, interpretable framework to measure biases, promoting fairer and more inclusive generative systems.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are rapidly gaining popularity, yet their outputs often lack geographical diversity, reinforce stereotypes, and misrepresent regions. Given their broad reach, it is critical to rigorously evaluate how these models portray the world. Existing diversity metrics either rely on curated datasets or focus on surface-level visual similarity, limiting interpretability. We introduce GeoDiv, a framework leveraging large language and vision-language models to assess geographical diversity along two complementary axes: the Socio-Economic Visual Index (SEVI), capturing economic and condition-related cues, and the Visual Diversity Index (VDI), measuring variation in primary entities and backgrounds. Applied to images generated by models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX.1-dev across $10$ entities and $16$ countries, GeoDiv reveals a consistent lack of diversity and identifies fine-grained attributes where models default to biased portrayals. Strikingly, depictions of countries like India, Nigeria, and Colombia are disproportionately impoverished and worn, reflecting underlying socio-economic biases. These results highlight the need for greater geographical nuance in generative models. GeoDiv provides the first systematic, interpretable framework for measuring such biases, marking a step toward fairer and more inclusive generative systems.

TL;DR: WeaveTime addresses Time-Agnosticism in Video-LLMs by teaching chronological order awareness and dynamically managing past and present focus, improving accuracy and latency in streaming settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) struggle with streaming due to quadratic attention and offline training, leading to temporal order ambiguity and focus blindness.

Method: WeaveTime introduces a Temporal Reconstruction objective for order awareness and a Past-Current Dynamic Focus Cache for efficient retrieval during inference.

Result: WeaveTime improves accuracy and reduces latency on streaming benchmarks without architectural changes to existing Video-LLMs.

Conclusion: WeaveTime provides a practical solution for time-aware streaming Video-LLMs, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have greatly improved visual understanding and reasoning, yet their quadratic attention and offline training protocols make them ill-suited for streaming settings where frames arrive sequentially and future observations are inaccessible. We diagnose a core limitation of current Video-LLMs, namely Time-Agnosticism, in which videos are treated as an unordered bag of evidence rather than a causally ordered sequence, yielding two failures in streams: temporal order ambiguity, in which the model cannot follow or reason over the correct chronological order, and past-current focus blindness where it fails to distinguish present observations from accumulated history. We present WeaveTime, a simple, efficient, and model agnostic framework that first teaches order and then uses order. We introduce a lightweight Temporal Reconstruction objective-our Streaming Order Perception enhancement-that instills order aware representations with minimal finetuning and no specialized streaming data. At inference, a Past-Current Dynamic Focus Cache performs uncertainty triggered, coarse-to-fine retrieval, expanding history only when needed. Plugged into exsiting Video-LLM without architectural changes, WeaveTime delivers consistent gains on representative streaming benchmarks, improving accuracy while reducing latency. These results establish WeaveTime as a practical path toward time aware stream Video-LLMs under strict online, time causal constraints. Code and weights will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: MedTri is a normalization framework for medical vision-language pretraining that standardizes free-text reports into structured triplets, improving pretraining quality and enabling modular text-level augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raw medical reports have stylistic heterogeneity and image-irrelevant content, necessitating systematic text normalization for better vision-language pretraining.

Method: MedTri converts free-text reports into unified [Anatomical Entity: Radiologic Description + Diagnosis Category] triplets, preserving essential information while removing noise.

Result: Across X-ray and CT datasets, MedTri consistently improves pretraining quality over raw reports and existing normalization methods, supporting modular augmentation strategies.

Conclusion: Structured text normalization is critical for medical vision-language learning, with MedTri providing a deployable platform.

Abstract: Medical vision-language pretraining increasingly relies on medical reports as large-scale supervisory signals; however, raw reports often exhibit substantial stylistic heterogeneity, variable length, and a considerable amount of image-irrelevant content. Although text normalization is frequently adopted as a preprocessing step in prior work, its design principles and empirical impact on vision-language pretraining remain insufficiently and systematically examined. In this study, we present MedTri, a deployable normalization framework for medical vision-language pretraining that converts free-text reports into a unified [Anatomical Entity: Radiologic Description + Diagnosis Category] triplet. This structured, anatomy-grounded normalization preserves essential morphological and spatial information while removing stylistic noise and image-irrelevant content, providing consistent and image-grounded textual supervision at scale. Across multiple datasets spanning both X-ray and computed tomography (CT) modalities, we demonstrate that structured, anatomy-grounded text normalization is an important factor in medical vision-language pretraining quality, yielding consistent improvements over raw reports and existing normalization baselines. In addition, we illustrate how this normalization can easily support modular text-level augmentation strategies, including knowledge enrichment and anatomy-grounded counterfactual supervision, which provide complementary gains in robustness and generalization without altering the core normalization process. Together, our results position structured text normalization as a critical and generalizable preprocessing component for medical vision-language learning, while MedTri provides this normalization platform.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoLoGen is a unified diffusion framework addressing the concept-localization conflict in image generation by progressively learning and reconciling these dualities through a staged curriculum and Progressive Representation Weaving (PRW).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge arises from the differing internal representations required for tasks involving conceptual understanding versus spatial precision, leading to conflicts when forced to share a single representation.

Method: CoLoGen employs a staged curriculum: building core abilities, adapting to visual conditions, and refining synergy for complex tasks. PRW dynamically routes features to specialized experts and integrates outputs.

Result: Experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance in editing, controllable generation, and customized generation tasks.

Conclusion: CoLoGen provides a principled representational approach for unified image generation, effectively addressing concept-localization conflicts.

Abstract: Unified conditional image generation remains difficult because different tasks depend on fundamentally different internal representations. Some require conceptual understanding for semantic synthesis, while others rely on localization cues for spatial precision. Forcing these heterogeneous tasks to share a single representation leads to concept`-`localization representational conflict. To address this issue, we propose CoLoGen, a unified diffusion framework that progressively learns and reconciles this concept`-`localization duality. CoLoGen uses a staged curriculum that first builds core conceptual and localization abilities, then adapts them to diverse visual conditions, and finally refines their synergy for complex instruction`-`driven tasks. Central to this process is the Progressive Representation Weaving (PRW) module, which dynamically routes features to specialized experts and stably integrates their outputs across stages. Experiments on editing, controllable generation, and customized generation show that CoLoGen achieves competitive or superior performance, offering a principled representational perspective for unified image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CASR is a cyclic SR framework addressing cross-scale distribution shift in arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASISR) by reformulating ultra-magnification as in-distribution scale transitions, using SDAM for structural alignment and SARM for texture restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of cross-scale distribution shift in ASISR, where noise, blur, and artifacts accumulate when inference scales exceed the training range.

Method: CASR introduces a cyclic framework with SDAM for structural alignment via superpixel aggregation and SARM for high-frequency texture restoration using autocorrelation and LR self-similarity priors.

Result: CASR reduces distribution drift, maintains texture consistency, and generalizes well even at extreme magnification, all while using a single model.

Conclusion: CASR offers a stable and efficient solution for arbitrary-scale SR, outperforming existing methods by addressing key bottlenecks like distribution drift and patch-wise inconsistencies.

Abstract: Arbitrary-Scale SR (ASISR) remains fundamentally limited by cross-scale distribution shift: once the inference scale leaves the training range, noise, blur, and artifacts accumulate sharply. We revisit this challenge from a cross-scale distribution transition perspective and propose CASR, a simple yet highly efficient cyclic SR framework that reformulates ultra-magnification as a sequence of in-distribution scale transitions. This design ensures stable inference at arbitrary scales while requiring only a single model. CASR tackles two major bottlenecks: distribution drift across iterations and patch-wise diffusion inconsistencies. The proposed SDAM module aligns structural distributions via superpixel aggregation, preventing error accumulation, while SARM module restores high-frequency textures by enforcing autocorrelation and embedding LR self-similarity priors. Despite using only a single model, our approach significantly reduces distribution drift, preserves long-range texture consistency, and achieves superior generalization even at extreme magnification.

TL;DR: A new mixed-magnification region-level encoder is proposed to better capture multi-resolution features in computational pathology, reducing tile numbers and improving biomarker prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard workflows use single-magnification tiles, missing multi-resolution features and creating excessive tiles. A mixed-magnification approach could improve efficiency and accuracy.

Method: A region-level mixing encoder fuses tile representations from a mixed-magnification foundation model, pretrained with masked embedding modeling.

Result: Improved predictive performance in biomarker tasks across cancer types, emphasizing the value of spatial context.

Conclusion: The mixed-magnification approach enhances computational pathology by capturing multi-resolution features and reducing representation complexity.

Abstract: In recent years, a standard computational pathology workflow has emerged where whole slide images are cropped into tiles, these tiles are processed using a foundation model, and task-specific models are built using the resulting representations. At least 15 different foundation models have been proposed, and the vast majority are trained exclusively with tiles using the 20$\times$ magnification. However, it is well known that certain histologic features can only be discerned with larger context windows and requires a pathologist to zoom in and out when analyzing a whole slide image. Furthermore, creating 224$\times$224 pixel crops at 20$\times$ leads to a large number of tiles per slide, which can be gigapixel in size. To more accurately capture multi-resolution features and investigate the possibility of reducing the number of representations per slide, we propose a region-level mixing encoder. Our approach jointly fuses image tile representations of a mixed magnification foundation model using a masked embedding modeling pretraining step. We explore a design space for pretraining the proposed mixed-magnification region aggregators and evaluate our models on transfer to biomarker prediction tasks representing various cancer types. Results demonstrate cancer dependent improvements in predictive performance, highlighting the importance of spatial context and understanding.

TL;DR: Solaris introduces a multiplayer video world model simulating multi-view observations, outperforming existing baselines with a staged training pipeline and a unique data collection system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video world models lack multi-agent interaction capabilities, which Solaris aims to address by simulating consistent multi-view observations.

Method: Solaris collects multiplayer data via a custom system for Minecraft, uses a staged training pipeline (single-player to multiplayer), and employs bidirectional, causal, and Self Forcing training techniques, including Checkpointed Self Forcing.

Result: Solaris outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating superior performance in multiplayer movement, memory, grounding, building, and view consistency tasks.

Conclusion: Solaris advances multi-agent world modeling, with open-sourced systems and models paving the way for future developments.

Abstract: Existing action-conditioned video generation models (video world models) are limited to single-agent perspectives, failing to capture the multi-agent interactions of real-world environments. We introduce Solaris, a multiplayer video world model that simulates consistent multi-view observations. To enable this, we develop a multiplayer data system designed for robust, continuous, and automated data collection on video games such as Minecraft. Unlike prior platforms built for single-player settings, our system supports coordinated multi-agent interaction and synchronized videos + actions capture. Using this system, we collect 12.64 million multiplayer frames and propose an evaluation framework for multiplayer movement, memory, grounding, building, and view consistency. We train Solaris using a staged pipeline that progressively transitions from single-player to multiplayer modeling, combining bidirectional, causal, and Self Forcing training. In the final stage, we introduce Checkpointed Self Forcing, a memory-efficient Self Forcing variant that enables a longer-horizon teacher. Results show our architecture and training design outperform existing baselines. Through open-sourcing our system and models, we hope to lay the groundwork for a new generation of multi-agent world models.

TL;DR: WHOLE is a method for holistic reconstruction of hand and object motion from egocentric videos, outperforming independent approaches by jointly reasoning about their interactions using a generative prior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with occlusions, object entries/exits, and inconsistent hand-object relations in egocentric videos.

Method: WHOLE learns a generative prior over hand-object motion to jointly reconstruct their interactions, guided by video observations.

Result: WHOLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand motion estimation, 6D object pose estimation, and interaction reconstruction.

Conclusion: Joint generative reconstruction of hand-object motion outperforms independent approaches, demonstrating effectiveness in challenging egocentric scenarios.

Abstract: Egocentric manipulation videos are highly challenging due to severe occlusions during interactions and frequent object entries and exits from the camera view as the person moves. Current methods typically focus on recovering either hand or object pose in isolation, but both struggle during interactions and fail to handle out-of-sight cases. Moreover, their independent predictions often lead to inconsistent hand-object relations. We introduce WHOLE, a method that holistically reconstructs hand and object motion in world space from egocentric videos given object templates. Our key insight is to learn a generative prior over hand-object motion to jointly reason about their interactions. At test time, the pretrained prior is guided to generate trajectories that conform to the video observations. This joint generative reconstruction substantially outperforms approaches that process hands and objects separately followed by post-processing. WHOLE achieves state-of-the-art performance on hand motion estimation, 6D object pose estimation, and their relative interaction reconstruction. Project website: https://judyye.github.io/whole-www

TL;DR: Neu-PiG introduces a fast deformation optimization method using preconditioned latent-grid encoding for drift-free, high-fidelity surface reconstruction of dynamic 3D objects from point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic 3D surface reconstruction face challenges like drift, long runtimes, or reliance on complex, category-specific learned models. Neu-PiG aims to address these limitations.

Method: Neu-PiG employs a novel preconditioned latent-grid encoding that distributes spatial features based on keyframe surface position and normal direction. It encodes multi-resolution deformations into a latent grid and decodes them into per-frame deformations via a lightweight MLP, using Sobolev preconditioning for efficient training.

Result: Neu-PiG outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and scalability for long sequences, running 60x faster than training-free methods and matching inference speeds of heavy pretrained models.

Conclusion: Neu-PiG offers a scalable, efficient, and high-fidelity solution for dynamic 3D surface reconstruction, overcoming challenges of drift and computational cost.

Abstract: Temporally consistent surface reconstruction of dynamic 3D objects from unstructured point cloud data remains challenging, especially for very long sequences. Existing methods either optimize deformations incrementally, risking drift and requiring long runtimes, or rely on complex learned models that demand category-specific training. We present Neu-PiG, a fast deformation optimization method based on a novel preconditioned latent-grid encoding that distributes spatial features parameterized on the position and normal direction of a keyframe surface. Our method encodes entire deformations across all time steps at various spatial scales into a multi-resolution latent grid, parameterized by the position and normal direction of a reference surface from a single keyframe. This latent representation is then augmented for time modulation and decoded into per-frame 6-DoF deformations via a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). To achieve high-fidelity, drift-free surface reconstructions in seconds, we employ Sobolev preconditioning during gradient-based training of the latent space, completely avoiding the need for any explicit correspondences or further priors. Experiments across diverse human and animal datasets demonstrate that Neu-PiG outperforms state-the-art approaches, offering both superior accuracy and scalability to long sequences while running at least 60x faster than existing training-free methods and achieving inference speeds on the same order as heavy pretrained models.

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' abilities in persuasion and vigilance using Sokoban, finding these capacities are distinct from task performance and highlighting the need for independent monitoring in AI safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the risks of LLMs as advisors in high-stakes decision-making, focusing on their social capacities of vigilance and persuasion.

Method: Study LLMs' vigilance and persuasion using Sokoban, a multi-turn puzzle-solving game, analyzing their token use and decision outcomes.

Result: LLMs show dissociable capacities in puzzle-solving, persuasion, and vigilance; they adapt token use but still fall for deceptive advice.

Conclusion: Independent monitoring of persuasion, vigilance, and performance is crucial for AI safety, as these capacities do not inherently align.

Abstract: With increasing integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into areas of high-stakes human decision-making, it is important to understand the risks they introduce as advisors. To be useful advisors, LLMs must sift through large amounts of content, written with both benevolent and malicious intent, and then use this information to convince a user to take a specific action. This involves two social capacities: vigilance (the ability to determine which information to use, and which to discard) and persuasion (synthesizing the available evidence to make a convincing argument). While existing work has investigated these capacities in isolation, there has been little prior investigation of how these capacities may be linked. Here, we use a simple multi-turn puzzle-solving game, Sokoban, to study LLMs' abilities to persuade and be rationally vigilant towards other LLM agents. We find that puzzle-solving performance, persuasive capability, and vigilance are dissociable capacities in LLMs. Performing well on the game does not automatically mean a model can detect when it is being misled, even if the possibility of deception is explicitly mentioned. % as part of the prompt. However, LLMs do consistently modulate their token use, using fewer tokens to reason when advice is benevolent and more when it is malicious, even if they are still persuaded to take actions leading them to failure. To our knowledge, our work presents the first investigation of the relationship between persuasion, vigilance, and task performance in LLMs, and suggests that monitoring all three independently will be critical for future work in AI safety.

Motivation: Address confusion and misinformation in disaster response by providing accurate, domain-specific answers leveraging Japanese disaster situations.

Method: Combines cl-tohoku/bert-base-japanese-v3 + Bi-LSTM + Enhanced Position Heads with LoRA efficiency optimization.

Result: Achieved 70.4% End Position accuracy (6.7M/117M parameters) and a 0.885 Span F1 score.

Conclusion: The system is suitable for real disaster scenarios but requires further development in datasets, edge AI, and continual learning.

Abstract: Natural disasters such as earthquakes, torrential rainfall, floods, and volcanic eruptions occur with extremely low frequency and affect limited geographic areas. When individuals face disaster situations, they often experience confusion and lack the domain-specific knowledge and experience necessary to determine appropriate responses and actions. While disaster information is continuously updated, even when utilizing RAG search and large language models for inquiries, obtaining relevant domain knowledge about natural disasters and experiences similar to one's specific situation is not guaranteed. When hallucinations are included in disaster question answering, artificial misinformation may spread and exacerbate confusion. This work introduces a disaster-focused question answering system based on Japanese disaster situations and response experiences. Utilizing the cl-tohoku/bert-base-japanese-v3 + Bi-LSTM + Enhanced Position Heads architecture with LoRA efficiency optimization, we achieved 70.4\% End Position accuracy with only 5.7\% of the total parameters (6.7M/117M). Experimental results demonstrate that the combination of Japanese BERT-base optimization and Bi-LSTM contextual understanding achieves accuracy levels suitable for real disaster response scenarios, attaining a 0.885 Span F1 score. Future challenges include: establishing natural disaster Q\&A benchmark datasets, fine-tuning foundation models with disaster knowledge, developing lightweight and power-efficient edge AI Disaster Q\&A applications for situations with insufficient power and communication during disasters, and addressing disaster knowledge base updates and continual learning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Token-level steering allows fine-grained control of LLMs during inference without parameter updates. Existing dense intervention methods are computationally costly and risk output quality. Proposed Sparse Inference-time Alignment (SIA) intervenes only at critical decision points, achieving superior alignment-efficiency trade-offs with minimal token intervention (20%-80%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense intervention at every decoding step is inefficient and risks drifting from the model's intrinsic distribution. Sparse intervention at high-entropy junctions preserves generation quality while reducing computational overhead.

Method: Sparse Inference-time Alignment (SIA) identifies and intervenes only at critical high-entropy decision points during generation, avoiding dense manipulation.

Result: For strong base models like Qwen3, intervening on 20% of tokens matches or surpasses heavily post-trained models. Computational costs reduce by up to 6x, and alignment-efficiency trade-offs improve.

Conclusion: Sparse intervention (SIA) is more efficient and effective than dense methods, preserving model distribution while enabling stronger guidance and seamless integration with search-based approaches.

Abstract: Token-level steering has emerged as a pivotal approach for inference-time alignment, enabling fine grained control over large language models by modulating their output distributions without parameter updates. While effective, existing methods rely on dense intervention at every decoding step. This persistent manipulation not only incurs substantial computational overhead but also risks compromising generation quality by excessively drifting from the model's intrinsic distribution. In this work, we show that dense intervention is unnecessary and propose Sparse Inference time Alignment (SIA), which performs sparse junction steering by intervening only at critical decision points along the generation trajectory. Our key insight is that high entropy junctions mark pivotal decision points in the generation trajectory and are particularly susceptible to misalignment, indicating the need to introduce alignment related reward signals at these points. Extensive experiments across different model families and alignment objectives show that steering only 20% to 80% of tokens achieves superior alignment-efficiency trade offs. For strong base models such as Qwen3, intervening on as few as 20% of tokens matches or even surpasses heavily post-trained instruct models. This sparsity enables stronger guidance while better preserving the model's native distribution, integrates seamlessly with search based methods such as Best-of-N, and reduces computational cost by up to 6x.

*Zhyar Rzgar K Rostam,Gábor Kertész*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning pre-trained language models enriched with biomedical entities improves EQ-5D detection in abstracts, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual screening for EQ-5D usage in systematic reviews is inefficient and error-prone, prompting the need for automated solutions.

Method: Fine-tuned BERT, SciBERT, and BioBERT models were combined with scispaCy-extracted biomedical entities and evaluated across nine setups, including a MIL approach.

Result: Achieved F1-scores of 0.82 and near-perfect recall at study-level, surpassing baseline methods.

Conclusion: Entity enrichment enhances domain adaptation and generalization, enabling accurate automated screening for systematic reviews.

Abstract: The EQ-5D (EuroQol 5-Dimensions) is a standardized instrument for the evaluation of health-related quality of life. In health economics, systematic literature reviews (SLRs) depend on the correct identification of publications that use the EQ-5D, but manual screening of large volumes of scientific literature is time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent. In this study, we investigate fine-tuning of general-purpose (BERT) and domain-specific (SciBERT, BioBERT) pre-trained language models (PLMs), enriched with biomedical entity information extracted through scispaCy models for each statement, to improve EQ-5D detection from abstracts. We conduct nine experimental setups, including combining three scispaCy models with three PLMs, and evaluate their performance at both the sentence and study levels. Furthermore, we explore a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach with attention pooling to aggregate sentence-level information into study-level predictions, where each abstract is represented as a bag of enriched sentences (by scispaCy). The findings indicate consistent improvements in F1-scores (reaching 0.82) and nearly perfect recall at the study-level, significantly exceeding classical bag-of-words baselines and recently reported PLM baselines. These results show that entity enrichment significantly improves domain adaptation and model generalization, enabling more accurate automated screening in systematic reviews.

### [109] [EPSVec: Efficient and Private Synthetic Data Generation via Dataset Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21218)
*Amin Banayeeanzade,Qingchuan Yang,Deqing Fu,Spencer Hong,Erin Babinsky,Alfy Samuel,Anoop Kumar,Robin Jia,Sai Praneeth Karimireddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EPSVec is a differentially-private, lightweight method for generating synthetic text using LLMs by steering generation with sanitized dataset vectors, enabling efficient and high-fidelity synthetic data production without additional privacy costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality synthetic data is needed for machine learning, especially when original data is sensitive. Existing methods are inefficient, requiring large datasets or computational resources.

Method: EPSVec introduces dataset vectors to steer LLM generation, extracting and sanitizing these vectors once. It decouples privacy budget from generation, uses pretrained models, and employs fixed-shot prompting for diversity.

Result: EPSVec outperforms existing methods in distributional alignment and downstream utility, especially in low-data scenarios, while reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: EPSVec provides an efficient, privacy-preserving solution for synthetic data generation, enhancing fidelity and diversity with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: High-quality data is essential for modern machine learning, yet many valuable corpora are sensitive and cannot be freely shared. Synthetic data offers a practical substitute for downstream development, and large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful engines for generating it. However, existing private text generation methods are severely inefficient: they are data-intensive, computationally slow, and often require large private corpora or batch sizes to achieve usable quality. We introduce EPSVec, a differentially-private lightweight alternative that steers LLM generation using *dataset vectors*--directions in activation space that capture the distributional gap between private data and public priors. EPSVec extracts and sanitizes steering vectors just once and then performs standard decoding. This decouples the privacy budget from generation, enabling arbitrarily many synthetic samples without additional privacy cost and yielding strong fidelity even in low-data regimes. Furthermore, we enhance our method by utilizing pretrained (base) models and introducing fixed-shot prompting to boost generation diversity and fidelity. Our experiments demonstrate that EPSVec outperforms existing baselines in distributional alignment and downstream utility, particularly in low-data regimes, while significantly reducing computational overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraSPer enhances personalized text generation for users with sparse histories by predicting future interactions and aligning reasoning, improving performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of sparse user interaction histories in LLM personalization, particularly for cold-start users.

Method: GraSPer augments user context by predicting future interactions, generates synthetic histories, and produces personalized outputs aligned with user preferences.

Result: GraSPer shows significant performance improvements on three benchmark datasets for personalized generation.

Conclusion: GraSPer effectively improves personalized text generation in sparse user context scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) personalization holds great promise for tailoring responses by leveraging personal context and history. However, real-world users usually possess sparse interaction histories with limited personal context, such as cold-start users in social platforms and newly registered customers in online E-commerce platforms, compromising the LLM-based personalized generation. To address this challenge, we introduce GraSPer (Graph-based Sparse Personalized Reasoning), a novel framework for enhancing personalized text generation under sparse context. GraSPer first augments user context by predicting items that the user would likely interact with in the future. With reasoning alignment, it then generates texts for these interactions to enrich the augmented context. In the end, it generates personalized outputs conditioned on both the real and synthetic histories, ensuring alignment with user style and preferences. Extensive experiments on three benchmark personalized generation datasets show that GraSPer achieves significant performance gain, substantially improving personalization in sparse user context settings.

*Subhadip Mitra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A memory system for AI agents uses continuous fields governed by partial differential equations instead of discrete database entries, showing significant improvements in multi-session reasoning, temporal reasoning, and retrieval recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve AI memory systems by modeling information as continuous fields, inspired by classical field theory, enabling better diffusion, decay, and interaction of memories.

Method: The method treats memories as continuous fields using partial differential equations, allowing memories to diffuse semantically, decay based on importance, and interact in multi-agent scenarios.

Result: The system achieved +116% F1 on multi-session reasoning, +43.8% on temporal reasoning, and +27.8% on retrieval recall. Multi-agent experiments showed >99.8% collective intelligence.

Conclusion: The field-theoretic approach significantly outperforms traditional methods in memory tasks, demonstrating its potential for advanced AI memory systems.

Abstract: We present a memory system for AI agents that treats stored information as continuous fields governed by partial differential equations rather than discrete entries in a database. The approach draws from classical field theory: memories diffuse through semantic space, decay thermodynamically based on importance, and interact through field coupling in multi-agent scenarios. We evaluate the system on two established long-context benchmarks: LoCoMo (ACL 2024) with 300-turn conversations across 35 sessions, and LongMemEval (ICLR 2025) testing multi-session reasoning over 500+ turns. On LongMemEval, the field-theoretic approach achieves significant improvements: +116% F1 on multi-session reasoning (p<0.01, d= 3.06), +43.8% on temporal reasoning (p<0.001, d= 9.21), and +27.8% retrieval recall on knowledge updates (p<0.001, d= 5.00). Multi-agent experiments show near-perfect collective intelligence (>99.8%) through field coupling. Code is available at github.com/rotalabs/rotalabs-fieldmem.

*Riya Adsul,Balachandra Devarangadi Sunil,Isha Nalawade,Sudharshan Govindan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework for dynamic LoRA adapter composition using similarity retrieval enables zero-shot generalization across diverse NLP tasks, outperforming single-task baselines without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently composing multiple specialized LoRA adapters for unseen tasks is challenging, and this work aims to address this gap.

Method: The approach constructs a task-aware vector database from 22 datasets, retrieves similar examples at inference, computes task similarity, and dynamically merges adapters using retrieval-weighted fusion strategies.

Result: Linear merging achieved 70.95% on PIQA and 77.62% on RTE, outperforming single-task baselines (46% and 52%).

Conclusion: Retrieval-based dynamic merging is scalable and efficient for multitask learning without full model retraining.

Abstract: Parameter efficient fine tuning methods like LoRA have enabled task specific adaptation of large language models, but efficiently composing multiple specialized adapters for unseen tasks remains challenging. We present a novel framework for dynamic LoRA adapter composition that leverages similarity retrieval in vector databases to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse NLP tasks. Our approach constructs a task-aware vector database by embedding training examples from 22 datasets spanning commonsense reasoning, question answering, natural language inference, and sentiment analysis. At inference time, we retrieve the most similar training examples, compute task similarity distributions via nucleus sampling, and dynamically merge relevant LoRA adapters using retrieval weighted fusion strategies. We evaluated four merging methods Linear, Concatenation, TIES, and Magnitude Prune demonstrating that our dataset centric retrieval approach often matches or exceeds the performance of individually fine-tuned task-specific adapters. Notably, Linear merging achieves 70.95% on PIQA and 77.62% on RTE, substantially outperforming single-task baselines (46% and 52%, respectively). Our framework requires no additional retriever training, operates with frozen embeddings, and enables efficient, interpretable adapter composition. These results suggest that retrieval based dynamic merging offers a promising direction for scalable, parameter-efficient multitask learning without requiring full model retraining for each new task.

### [113] [Measuring Pragmatic Influence in Large Language Model Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21223)
*Yilin Geng,Omri Abend,Eduard Hovy,Lea Frermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how pragmatic framing—contextual cues like urgency or authority—affects LLM behavior without changing task content. It introduces a framework to measure this influence systematically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work treats framing cues as tools for optimization or security risks, but lacks systematic measurement of their impact on instruction-following.

Method: The framework includes: (1) separating framing context from task specification, (2) a taxonomy classifying 400 framing examples into 13 strategies, and (3) priority-based measurement to quantify shifts in directive prioritization.

Result: Five LLMs showed consistent shifts in directive prioritization due to framing, moving from impartiality to favoring framed directives.

Conclusion: Pragmatic framing is measurable and predictable, establishing it as a key factor in LLM instruction-following.

Abstract: It is not only what we ask large language models (LLMs) to do that matters, but also how we prompt. Phrases like "This is urgent" or "As your supervisor" can shift model behavior without altering task content. We study this effect as pragmatic framing, contextual cues that shape directive interpretation rather than task specification. While prior work exploits such cues for prompt optimization or probes them as security vulnerabilities, pragmatic framing itself has not been treated as a measurable property of instruction following. Measuring this influence systematically remains challenging, requiring controlled isolation of framing cues. We introduce a framework with three novel components: directive-framing decomposition separating framing context from task specification; a taxonomy organizing 400 instantiations of framing into 13 strategies across 4 mechanism clusters; and priority-based measurement that quantifies influence through observable shifts in directive prioritization. Across five LLMs of different families and sizes, influence mechanisms cause consistent and structured shifts in directive prioritization, moving models from baseline impartiality toward favoring the framed directive. This work establishes pragmatic framing as a measurable and predictable factor in instruction-following systems.

*Yuetao Chen,Xuliang Wang,Xinzhou Zheng,Ming Li,Peng Wang,Hong Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel system to reuse discarded draft tokens in speculative decoding, improving compute efficiency by up to 3.3x compared to standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the compute inefficiency caused by discarded draft tokens in speculative decoding, the authors aim to recollect wasted computation by reusing hidden states.

Method: The system introduces: (1) an auto-regressive hidden states draft model, (2) a token information injection mechanism for draft token trees, and (3) overhead elimination for hardware optimization.

Result: Evaluations show up to a 3.3x speedup against standard speculative decoding.

Conclusion: Hidden state reuse effectively reduces compute waste, significantly accelerating LLM inference.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a pivotal technique to accelerate LLM inference by employing a lightweight draft model to generate candidate tokens that are subsequently verified by the target model in parallel. However, while this paradigm successfully increases the arithmetic intensity of memory-bound inference, it causes significant compute inefficiency: the majority of draft tokens fail verification and are discarded, resulting in waste of computation. Motivated by the goal of recollecting this wasted computation, we propose a novel system that transforms discarded drafts into reusable tokens. Our key insight is to perform auto-regressive prediction at the hidden states level and postpone the integrating token information after the hidden states generation, so the draft hidden states are not contaminated by incorrect tokens, enabling hidden state reuse. To implement such a system, first we introduce a draft model architecture based on auto-regressive hidden states, which preserves richer semantics than token-based drafters to facilitate draft repurposing. Second, we design an efficient token information injection mechanism that leverages our specialized draft model to construct high-quality draft token trees and enables resampling tokens from verification failures. Third, we eliminate the overhead hidden in our design to further maximize hardware utilization. We conducted extensive evaluations against various baselines, demonstrating up to a 3.3x speedup against standard speculative decoding.

*Mohammed Hamdan,Vincenzo Dentamaro,Giuseppe Pirlo,Mohamed Cheriet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Progressive data scheduling reduces training time by ~33% and shows genuine benefits for capacity-constrained models like BERT, but not for multimodal models like LayoutLMv3, with benefits dependent on model-task interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if progressive data scheduling consistently improves efficiency across different document understanding models.

Method: Evaluated BERT and LayoutLMv3 on FUNSD and CORD benchmarks using progressive scheduling (33%→67%→100% data) and matched-compute baselines.

Result: Reduced training time by ~33%, significant F1 improvement for BERT but not LayoutLMv3, and no benefit on CORD due to performance ceiling.

Conclusion: Progressive scheduling reliably reduces compute, with benefits dependent on model capacity and task complexity.

Abstract: We investigate whether progressive data scheduling -- a curriculum learning strategy that incrementally increases training data exposure (33\%$\rightarrow$67\%$\rightarrow$100\%) -- yields consistent efficiency gains across architecturally distinct document understanding models. By evaluating BERT (text-only, 110M parameters) and LayoutLMv3 (multimodal, 126M parameters) on the FUNSD and CORD benchmarks, we establish that this schedule reduces wall-clock training time by approximately 33\%, commensurate with the reduction from 6.67 to 10.0 effective epoch-equivalents of data. To isolate curriculum effects from compute reduction, we introduce matched-compute baselines (Standard-7) that control for total gradient updates. On the FUNSD dataset, the curriculum significantly outperforms the matched-compute baseline for BERT ($Δ$F1 = +0.023, $p=0.022$, $d_z=3.83$), constituting evidence for a genuine scheduling benefit in capacity-constrained models. In contrast, no analogous benefit is observed for LayoutLMv3 ($p=0.621$), whose multimodal representations provide sufficient inductive bias. On the CORD dataset, all conditions converge to equivalent F1 scores ($\geq$0.947) irrespective of scheduling, indicating a performance ceiling. Schedule ablations comparing progressive, two-phase, reverse, and random pacing confirm that the efficiency gain derives from reduced data volume rather than ordering. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that progressive scheduling is a reliable compute-reduction strategy across model families, with curriculum-specific benefits contingent on the interaction between model capacity and task complexity.

TL;DR: IslamicLegalBench evaluates LLMs' reasoning on Islamic law across seven schools, revealing significant limitations in correctness and high hallucination rates, with minimal improvement from few-shot prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of LLMs in providing accurate Islamic legal guidance due to their increasing use by Muslims.

Method: Development of IslamicLegalBench, a benchmark with 718 instances across seven schools of jurisprudence, evaluating nine state-of-the-art models.

Result: Best model achieves only 68% correctness with 21% hallucination; few-shot prompting offers minimal gains. High errors in moderate-complexity tasks risky sycophancy.

Conclusion: Prompt-based methods cannot replace foundational knowledge, exposing critical gaps in AI tools relied on for spiritual guidance.

Abstract: As millions of Muslims turn to LLMs like GPT, Claude, and DeepSeek for religious guidance, a critical question arises: Can these AI systems reliably reason about Islamic law? We introduce IslamicLegalBench, the first benchmark evaluating LLMs across seven schools of Islamic jurisprudence, with 718 instances covering 13 tasks of varying complexity. Evaluation of nine state-of-the-art models reveals major limitations: the best model achieves only 68% correctness with 21% hallucination, while several models fall below 35% correctness and exceed 55% hallucination. Few-shot prompting provides minimal gains, improving only 2 of 9 models by >1%. Moderate-complexity tasks requiring exact knowledge show the highest errors, whereas high-complexity tasks display apparent competence through semantic reasoning. False premise detection indicates risky sycophancy, with 6 of 9 models accepting misleading assumptions at rates above 40%. These results highlight that prompt-based methods cannot compensate for missing foundational knowledge. IslamicLegalBench offers the first systematic framework to evaluate Islamic legal reasoning in AI, revealing critical gaps in tools increasingly relied on for spiritual guidance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Budget-Aware Agentic Routing to optimize cost-success trade-offs in autonomous agents by dynamically selecting between cheap and expensive models, leveraging boundary-guided training and policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of using large language models (LLMs) for every step in autonomous agent workflows necessitates a more economical and efficient routing strategy.

Method: Proposes Boundary-Guided Training and Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization (BoPO) to dynamically route between models, using boundary policies and stratified sampling.

Result: The method improves efficiency, matches baseline performance at lower cost, and generalizes to strict budget constraints.

Conclusion: The work shifts agentic routing from static model selection to dynamic, budget-aware decision-making.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents that execute long-horizon workflows, invoking a high-capability model at every step becomes economically unsustainable. While model routing is effective for single-turn queries, agentic routing is a sequential, path-dependent problem: early mistakes compound, feedback is often at the end of the episode, and deployments often demand strict per-task spending limits. We propose Budget-Aware Agentic Routing, which selects between a cheap and an expensive model at each step to optimize the cost--success frontier and to operate under strict per-task budgets. We propose Boundary-Guided Training, which leverages two boundary policies (always-small vs.\ always-large) to build a difficulty taxonomy and to anchor learning under sparse rewards. Our approach warms start with boundary-guided SFT data synthesis via stratified sampling of cost-efficient trajectories, then applies Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization (BoPO), combining boundary-relative rewards with a reference-guided advantage to avoid degenerate cheap-failure solutions. Experiment results show that our method improves the efficiency frontier, matching strong routing baselines at substantially lower cost while demonstrating generalization to strict inference-time budget constraints. Overall, our work establishes a foundational framework for agentic routing, shifting the paradigm from static model selection to dynamic, budget-aware sequential decision-making.

TL;DR: ImpRIF enhances LLMs' ability to follow complex instructions by improving their understanding of implicit reasoning structures, using verifiable reasoning graphs and reinforcement learning, achieving superior performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for robust complex instruction following capabilities in LLMs is increasing, necessitating a deeper understanding of latent reasoning structures within instructions.

Method: Proposes ImpRIF, formalizing implicit reasoning instructions as verifiable reasoning graphs, synthesizing large-scale data, fine-tuning with graph reasoning, and applying reinforcement learning for explicit reasoning training.

Result: Substantially outperforms base models on five complex instruction following benchmarks, showing significant improvement in implicit reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Enhancing implicit reasoning can significantly improve complex instruction following in LLMs; ImpRIF will be open-sourced.

Abstract: As applications of large language models (LLMs) become increasingly complex, the demand for robust complex instruction following capabilities is growing accordingly. We argue that a thorough understanding of the instruction itself, especially the latent reasoning structure embedded between the lines, is crucial for improving instruction following. Therefore we target complex instructions that involve implicit reasoning, intricate logical relations, and multi-constraint dependencies. We propose ImpRIF, a method to enhance LLMs' understanding of implicit reasoning instructions, thereby improving its ability to follow complex instructions. We formalize such instructions as verifiable reasoning graphs, enabling programmatic verification and graph-driven chain-of-thought reasoning. Based on this formulation, we synthesize large-scale single- and multi-turn data, propose fine-tuning with graph reasoning, and apply reinforcement learning to explicitly train models to reason along the graph. On five complex instruction following benchmarks, our models substantially outperform their base models. These results demonstrate that enhancing implicit reasoning capabilities can significantly improve complex instruction following. This project will be open-sourced in the near future.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRACE is a framework addressing the limitations of current Deep Research Agent evaluations by holistically assessing problem-solving trajectories, introducing novel metrics for efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations rely on singular metrics and static benchmarks, failing to capture reasoning quality, robustness, and latent capabilities.

Method: TRACE uses a Hierarchical Trajectory Utility Function and Scaffolded Capability Assessment to quantify process efficiency, cognitive quality, and latent ability.

Result: TRACE provides granular rankings revealing trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and robustness, outperforming singular metrics.

Conclusion: TRACE offers a comprehensive evaluation framework for Deep Research Agents, overcoming limitations of conventional metrics.

Abstract: The evaluation of Deep Research Agents is a critical challenge, as conventional outcome-based metrics fail to capture the nuances of their complex reasoning. Current evaluation faces two primary challenges: 1) a reliance on singular metrics like Pass@1, creating a "high-score illusion" that ignores the quality, efficiency, and soundness of the reasoning process; and 2) the failure of static benchmarks to quantify crucial attributes like robustness and latent capability. To address these gaps, we introduce TRACE (Trajectory-Aware Comprehensive Evaluation), a framework that holistically assesses the entire problem-solving trajectory. To counter the "high-score illusion", we propose a Hierarchical Trajectory Utility Function that quantifies process efficiency and cognitive quality, including evidence grounding, alongside accuracy. To measure deeper attributes, TRACE introduces a Scaffolded Capability Assessment protocol, quantifying an agent's latent ability by determining the minimum guidance needed for success. Our contributions include the TRACE framework, its novel metrics, and the accompanying DeepResearch-Bench with controllable complexity. Experiments show TRACE delivers a granular ranking that uncovers critical trade-offs between agent accuracy, efficiency, and robustness entirely missed by singular metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolMATH is a benchmark evaluating tool-augmented language models in multi-tool environments, focusing on reliability and failure modes in reasoning and tool-use protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess model reliability in realistic scenarios with overlapping tool catalogs and absent capabilities, providing diagnostic insights into failure modes.

Method: Converts math problems into a controlled benchmark with tool sets, including a hard-set (ToolMATHHard), totaling 8k questions and 12k tools.

Result: Key failures stem from reasoning inability, causing error accumulation and execution drift. Distractor tools can mislead or substitute partially.

Conclusion: Improvements rely more on long-range coherence and disciplined observation use than local action selection.

Abstract: We introduce \ToolMATH, a math-grounded benchmark that evaluates tool-augmented language models in realistic multi-tool environments where the output depends on calling schema-specified tools and sustaining multi-step execution. It turns math problems into a controlled, correctness-checkable benchmark with tool sets, enabling systematic evaluation of model reliability under (1) large, overlapping tool catalogs and (2) the absence of the intended capability. \ToolMATH provides actionable diagnostic evidence of failure modes in tool-augmented agents, helping identify the control mechanisms required for robustness. \ToolMATH roughly contains 8k questions and 12k tools; we provide an additional hard-set \ToolMATHHard with questions and tools. Our evaluation reveals that the key failure factor is due to the inability to reason, leading to the accumulation of intermediate results' errors and constrain later decisions. Tool-list redundancy do not simply add noise, but amplify small early deviations into irreversible execution drift. The benchmark highlights that when the intended capability is missing, distractor tools can sometimes serve as partial substitutes in solution paths, yet they can also mislead models into ungrounded tool trajectories. Finally, comparisons between tool-use protocols emphasize that improvements come less from local action selection and more from long-range plan coherence and disciplined use of observations.

TL;DR: The paper addresses vulnerabilities in LLMs to jailbreak attacks despite existing alignment techniques. It proposes reasoning-aware post-training and Alignment-Weighted DPO to enhance safety and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in alignment techniques like SFT, RLHF, and DPO, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks due to shallow alignment mechanisms lacking deep reasoning. The study aims to mitigate this by improving alignment through reasoning-based methods.

Method: The authors use causal intervention to identify vulnerabilities and propose reasoning-aware post-training with a novel CoT fine-tuning dataset. They also introduce Alignment-Weighted DPO, targeting problematic output segments for finer-grained updates.

Result: Fine-tuning on the CoT dataset improves principled refusals, and Alignment-Weighted DPO outperforms standard SFT baselines. The method enhances robustness to jailbreak attacks while maintaining model utility.

Conclusion: Reasoning-aware post-training and Alignment-Weighted DPO significantly improve alignment robustness in LLMs, offering a solution to shallow alignment vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in alignment techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have improved the safety of large language models (LLMs). However, these LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that disguise harmful intent through indirect or deceptive phrasing. Using causal intervention, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from shallow alignment mechanisms that lack deep reasoning, often rejecting harmful prompts without truly understanding why they are harmful. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose enhancing alignment through reasoning-aware post-training. We construct and release a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning dataset that includes both utility-oriented and safety-critical prompts with step-by-step rationales. Fine-tuning on this dataset encourages models to produce principled refusals grounded in reasoning, outperforming standard SFT baselines. Furthermore, inspired by failure patterns in CoT fine-tuning, we introduce Alignment-Weighted DPO, which targets the most problematic parts of an output by assigning different preference weights to the reasoning and final-answer segments. This produces finer-grained, targeted updates than vanilla DPO and improves robustness to diverse jailbreak strategies. Extensive experiments across multiple safety and utility benchmarks show that our method consistently improves alignment robustness while maintaining overall model utility.

TL;DR: The study evaluates a bilingual pipeline using Persian-to-English translation and small language models (SLMs) for extracting clinical features from Persian medical transcripts, highlighting performance metrics and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of extracting clinical information from low-resource language medical transcripts, focusing on Persian cancer palliative care call center data.

Method: Used a two-step pipeline: Persian-to-English translation (Aya-expanse-8B) followed by binary feature extraction with five SLMs. Few-shot prompting without fine-tuning was applied.

Result: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct performed best (macro-F1: 0.899; MCC: 0.797), while Gemma-3-1B-it was weakest. Larger models outperformed smaller ones. Translation improved sensitivity but lowered specificity.

Conclusion: The study provides a blueprint for multilingual clinical NLP with SLMs, emphasizing model scale and language strategy optimization for healthcare.

Abstract: Extracting clinical information from medical transcripts in low-resource languages remains a significant challenge in healthcare natural language processing (NLP). This study evaluates a two-step pipeline combining Aya-expanse-8B as a Persian-to-English translation model with five open-source small language models (SLMs) -- Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-1B-it -- for binary extraction of 13 clinical features from 1,221 anonymized Persian transcripts collected at a cancer palliative care call center. Using a few-shot prompting strategy without fine-tuning, models were assessed on macro-averaged F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), sensitivity, and specificity to account for class imbalance. Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct achieved the highest overall performance (median macro-F1: 0.899; MCC: 0.797), while Gemma-3-1B-it showed the weakest results. Larger models (7B--8B parameters) consistently outperformed smaller counterparts in sensitivity and MCC. A bilingual analysis of Aya-expanse-8B revealed that translating Persian transcripts to English improved sensitivity, reduced missing outputs, and boosted metrics robust to class imbalance, though at the cost of slightly lower specificity and precision. Feature-level results showed reliable extraction of physiological symptoms across most models, whereas psychological complaints, administrative requests, and complex somatic features remained challenging. These findings establish a practical, privacy-preserving blueprint for deploying open-source SLMs in multilingual clinical NLP settings with limited infrastructure and annotation resources, and highlight the importance of jointly optimizing model scale and input language strategy for sensitive healthcare applications.

*Felix Schneider,Maria Gogolev,Sven Sickert,Joachim Denzler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Rich Character Embeddings (RCE), a transformer-based approach that computes word vectors from character strings to address limitations of tokenization in NLP tasks, especially for under-resourced languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization-based models like BERT and GPT struggle with orthographic similarities and morphological variations, particularly in inflected and under-resourced languages.

Method: The paper introduces RCE, which generates word vectors directly from character strings, integrating semantic and syntactic info, and a hybrid transformer-convolutional model.

Result: RCE outperforms token-based methods on tasks like SWAG, declension prediction, and metaphor detection, using metrics like OddOneOut and TopK.

Conclusion: RCE is a promising drop-in replacement for traditional embeddings, improving performance for both large and small models in under-resourced languages.

Abstract: Tokenization and sub-tokenization based models like word2vec, BERT and the GPTs are the state-of-the-art in natural language processing. Typically, these approaches have limitations with respect to their input representation. They fail to fully capture orthographic similarities and morphological variations, especially in highly inflected and under-resource languages. To mitigate this problem, we propose to computes word vectors directly from character strings, integrating both semantic and syntactic information. We denote this transformer-based approach Rich Character Embeddings (RCE). Furthermore, we propose a hybrid model that combines transformer and convolutional mechanisms. Both vector representations can be used as a drop-in replacement for dictionary- and subtoken-based word embeddings in existing model architectures. It has the potential to improve performance for both large context-based language models like BERT and small models like word2vec for under-resourced and morphologically rich languages. We evaluate our approach on various tasks like the SWAG, declension prediction for inflected languages, metaphor and chiasmus detection for various languages. Our experiments show that it outperforms traditional token-based approaches on limited data using OddOneOut and TopK metrics.

TL;DR: VecGlypher is a multimodal language model that generates vector glyphs directly from text or images, outperforming existing methods and simplifying font creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of current learning-based pipelines that rely on curated exemplars and raster-to-vector postprocessing, enabling more accessible and editable font design.

Method: VecGlypher uses a two-stage training approach: (i) large-scale training on noisy fonts to master SVG syntax, followed by (ii) post-training on expert-annotated fonts with descriptive tags and exemplars. It autoregressively emits SVG path tokens without raster intermediates.

Result: VecGlypher outperforms general-purpose LLMs and specialized baselines in text-only generation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in image-referenced generation. Key factors include model scale, two-stage training, and absolute-coordinate serialization.

Conclusion: VecGlypher simplifies font creation by enabling design via text or images and provides a scalable foundation for future multimodal design tools.

Abstract: Vector glyphs are the atomic units of digital typography, yet most learning-based pipelines still depend on carefully curated exemplar sheets and raster-to-vector postprocessing, which limits accessibility and editability. We introduce VecGlypher, a single multimodal language model that generates high-fidelity vector glyphs directly from text descriptions or image exemplars. Given a style prompt, optional reference glyph images, and a target character, VecGlypher autoregressively emits SVG path tokens, avoiding raster intermediates and producing editable, watertight outlines in one pass. A typography-aware data and training recipe makes this possible: (i) a large-scale continuation stage on 39K noisy Envato fonts to master SVG syntax and long-horizon geometry, followed by (ii) post-training on 2.5K expert-annotated Google Fonts with descriptive tags and exemplars to align language and imagery with geometry; preprocessing normalizes coordinate frames, canonicalizes paths, de-duplicates families, and quantizes coordinates for stable long-sequence decoding. On cross-family OOD evaluation, VecGlypher substantially outperforms both general-purpose LLMs and specialized vector-font baselines for text-only generation, while image-referenced generation reaches a state-of-the-art performance, with marked gains over DeepVecFont-v2 and DualVector. Ablations show that model scale and the two-stage recipe are critical and that absolute-coordinate serialization yields the best geometry. VecGlypher lowers the barrier to font creation by letting users design with words or exemplars, and provides a scalable foundation for future multimodal design tools.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs often misrepresent AAVE, underusing its features and perpetuating stereotypes, highlighting the need for diverse training data and fairness methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how accurately LLMs represent AAVE compared to native speakers and identify potential biases.

Method: Analyzed human AAVE usage from interviews and Twitter, prompted LLMs to generate AAVE text, and compared usage patterns and sentiment.

Result: LLMs underused and misused AAVE features and replicated stereotypes about African Americans.

Conclusion: More diverse training data and fairness methods are needed to improve AAVE representation and reduce biases.

Abstract: In AI, most evaluations of natural language understanding tasks are conducted in standardized dialects such as Standard American English (SAE). In this work, we investigate how accurately large language models (LLMs) represent African American Vernacular English (AAVE). We analyze three LLMs to compare their usage of AAVE to the usage of humans who natively speak AAVE. We first analyzed interviews from the Corpus of Regional African American Language and TwitterAAE to identify the typical contexts where people use AAVE grammatical features such as ain't. We then prompted the LLMs to produce text in AAVE and compared the model-generated text to human usage patterns. We find that, in many cases, there are substantial differences between AAVE usage in LLMs and humans: LLMs usually underuse and misuse grammatical features characteristic of AAVE. Furthermore, through sentiment analysis and manual inspection, we found that the models replicated stereotypes about African Americans. These results highlight the need for more diversity in training data and the incorporation of fairness methods to mitigate the perpetuation of stereotypes.

*Barah Fazili,Koustava Goswami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Training pretrained models for cross-lingual alignment with a multi-way parallel corpus improves multilingual and cross-lingual representations, achieving significant gains in NLU tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multilingual pretraining lacks explicit alignment signals, leading to suboptimal cross-lingual alignment in representations.

Method: Construct a multi-way parallel dataset using translations of English text via NMT, and use contrastive learning for alignment.

Result: Substantial performance gains in tasks like bitext mining (21.3%), semantic similarity (5.3%), and classification (28.4%).

Conclusion: Multi-way parallel corpora and contrastive learning significantly enhance cross-lingual alignment and task performance.

Abstract: Multilingual pretraining typically lacks explicit alignment signals, leading to suboptimal cross-lingual alignment in the representation space. In this work, we show that training standard pretrained models for cross-lingual alignment with a multi-way parallel corpus in a diverse pool of languages can substantially improve multilingual and cross-lingual representations for NLU tasks. We construct a multi-way parallel dataset using translations of English text from an off-the-shelf NMT model for a pool of six target languages and achieve strong cross-lingual alignment through contrastive learning. This leads to substantial performance gains across both seen and unseen languages for multiple tasks from the MTEB benchmark evaluated for XLM-Roberta and multilingual BERT base models. Using a multi-way parallel corpus for contrastive training yields substantial gains on bitext mining (21.3%), semantic similarity (5.3%), and classification (28.4%) compared to English-centric (En-X) bilingually parallel data, where X is sampled from a pool of multiple target languages. Furthermore, finetuning mE5 model on a small dataset with multi-way parallelism significantly improves bitext mining compared to one without, underscoring the importance of multi-way cross-lingual supervision even for models already pretrained for high-quality sentence embeddings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MixSarc is the first Bangla-English code-mixed corpus for identifying implicit meanings like humor and sarcasm, addressing gaps in existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sentiment models fail to handle transliteration, cultural references, and language switching in Bangla-English code-mixed texts.

Method: Created a dataset of 9,087 annotated sentences via social media collection, filtering, and multi-annotator validation. Evaluated transformer and zero-shot models.

Result: Strong humor detection but weaker sarcasm/offense/vulgarity performance due to class imbalance. Zero-shot models show competitive micro-F1 but low exact match.

Conclusion: MixSarc aids culturally aware NLP and improves multi-label modeling in code-mixed contexts.

Abstract: Bangla-English code-mixing is widespread across South Asian social media, yet resources for implicit meaning identification in this setting remain scarce. Existing sentiment and sarcasm models largely focus on monolingual English or high-resource languages and struggle with transliteration variation, cultural references, and intra-sentential language switching. To address this gap, we introduce MixSarc, the first publicly available Bangla-English code-mixed corpus for implicit meaning identification. The dataset contains 9,087 manually annotated sentences labeled for humor, sarcasm, offensiveness, and vulgarity. We construct the corpus through targeted social media collection, systematic filtering, and multi-annotator validation. We benchmark transformer-based models and evaluate zero-shot large language models under structured prompting. Results show strong performance on humor detection but substantial degradation on sarcasm, offense, and vulgarity due to class imbalance and pragmatic complexity. Zero-shot models achieve competitive micro-F1 scores but low exact match accuracy. Further analysis reveals that over 42\% of negative sentiment instances in an external dataset exhibit sarcastic characteristics. MixSarc provides a foundational resource for culturally aware NLP and supports more reliable multi-label modeling in code-mixed environments.

*Muku Akasaka,Soyeon Caren Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how injecting additional information (like spatial cues, commonsense knowledge, or CoT reasoning) affects visual spatial reasoning (VSR) in VLMs, finding that more information isn't always better and selective injection is key.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding when additional information genuinely improves VSR in VLMs and when it introduces noise, given current reliance on strategies like spatial cues and CoT prompting.

Method: Hypothesis-driven analysis across three VLMs and two benchmarks, examining spatial contexts, commonsense knowledge relevance, and spatial-CoT interaction.

Result: Targeted spatial cues outperform multi-context; excessive commonsense harms performance; CoT improves accuracy only with precise spatial grounding.

Conclusion: Selective, task-aligned information injection is crucial for reliable multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Visual spatial reasoning (VSR) remains challenging for modern vision-language models (VLMs), despite advances in multimodal architectures. A common strategy is to inject additional information at inference time, such as explicit spatial cues, external commonsense knowledge, or chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning instructions. However, it remains unclear when such information genuinely improves reasoning and when it introduces noise. In this paper, we conduct a hypothesis-driven analysis of information injection for VSR across three representative VLMs and two public benchmarks. We examine (i) the type and number of spatial contexts, (ii) the amount and relevance of injected commonsense knowledge, and (iii) the interaction between spatial grounding and CoT prompting. Our results reveal a consistent pattern: more information does not necessarily yield better reasoning. Targeted single spatial cues outperform multi-context aggregation, excessive or weakly relevant commonsense knowledge degrades performance, and CoT prompting improves accuracy only when spatial grounding is sufficiently precise. These findings highlight the importance of selective, task-aligned information injection and provide practical guidance for designing reliable multimodal reasoning pipelines.

TL;DR: RuCL introduces stratified rubric-based curriculum learning to improve MLLMs by dynamically adjusting rubric weights, enhancing reasoning from foundational to advanced levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reward hacking and inefficiencies in rubric-based approaches for MLLMs by improving training dynamics and computational efficiency.

Method: RuCL stratifies rubrics based on model competence and dynamically adjusts their weights during training, focusing on reward design.

Result: Achieves a +7.83% average improvement over Qwen2.5-VL-7B, reaching a state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.06%.

Conclusion: RuCL effectively enhances reasoning in MLLMs by combining generalized rubrics with stratified curriculum learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a prevailing paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, relying solely on outcome supervision risks reward hacking, where models learn spurious reasoning patterns to satisfy final answer checks. While recent rubric-based approaches offer fine-grained supervision signals, they suffer from high computational costs of instance-level generation and inefficient training dynamics caused by treating all rubrics as equally learnable. In this paper, we propose Stratified Rubric-based Curriculum Learning (RuCL), a novel framework that reformulates curriculum learning by shifting the focus from data selection to reward design. RuCL generates generalized rubrics for broad applicability and stratifies them based on the model's competence. By dynamically adjusting rubric weights during training, RuCL guides the model from mastering foundational perception to tackling advanced logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on various visual reasoning benchmarks show that RuCL yields a remarkable +7.83% average improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, achieving a state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.06%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline for evaluating counselor responses to client resistance in text-based therapy using a theory-driven framework and expert-annotated data, achieving superior performance over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NLP research lacks granular evaluations of high-stakes moments in counseling, particularly client resistance, highlighting the need for scalable feedback for practitioners.

Method: A theory-driven framework decomposes counselor responses into four communication mechanisms, and an expert-annotated dataset is used to fine-tune a Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model.

Result: The model outperforms GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet (77-81% F1 vs. 45-59% F1) and produces high-quality explanations, validated by human experts (2.8-2.9/3.0).

Conclusion: AI-generated feedback significantly improves counselors' effectiveness in addressing client resistance, demonstrating the model's practical utility in psychological counseling.

Abstract: Effectively addressing client resistance is a sophisticated clinical skill in psychological counseling, yet practitioners often lack timely and scalable supervisory feedback to refine their approaches. Although current NLP research has examined overall counseling quality and general therapeutic skills, it fails to provide granular evaluations of high-stakes moments where clients exhibit resistance. In this work, we present a comprehensive pipeline for the multi-dimensional evaluation of human counselors' interventions specifically targeting client resistance in text-based therapy. We introduce a theory-driven framework that decomposes counselor responses into four distinct communication mechanisms. Leveraging this framework, we curate and share an expert-annotated dataset of real-world counseling excerpts, pairing counselor-client interactions with professional ratings and explanatory rationales. Using this data, we perform full-parameter instruction tuning on a Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone to model fine-grained evaluative judgments of response quality and generate explanations underlying. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively distinguish the quality of different communication mechanisms (77-81% F1), substantially outperforming GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet (45-59% F1). Moreover, the model produces high-quality explanations that closely align with expert references and receive near-ceiling ratings from human experts (2.8-2.9/3.0). A controlled experiment with 43 counselors further confirms that receiving these AI-generated feedback significantly improves counselors' ability to respond effectively to client resistance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An optimized cascaded Nepali speech-to-English text translation system is presented, focusing on reducing structural noise from ASR. The system uses advanced ASR and NMT models, and a Punctuation Restoration Module (PRM) to improve translation quality, achieving a significant BLEU score gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to mitigate structural noise in Nepali speech-to-English text translation caused by unpunctuated ASR output, which significantly degrades translation quality.

Method: The approach combines a Wav2Vec2-XLS-R-300m ASR model and a multi-stage fine-tuned MarianMT NMT model. A Punctuation Restoration Module (PRM) is introduced to improve ASR output quality before translation.

Result: The optimal configuration with PRM improved translation quality by 4.90 BLEU points (36.38 vs. 31.48) and showed superior human-assessed Adequacy (3.673) and Fluency (3.804).

Conclusion: Targeted punctuation restoration effectively mitigates structural noise in the Nepali S2TT pipeline, providing a critical insight for low-resource language translation systems.

Abstract: This paper presents and evaluates an optimized cascaded Nepali speech-to-English text translation (S2TT) system, focusing on mitigating structural noise introduced by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We first establish highly proficient ASR and NMT components: a Wav2Vec2-XLS-R-300m model achieved a state-of-the-art 2.72% CER on OpenSLR-54, and a multi-stage fine-tuned MarianMT model reached a 28.32 BLEU score on the FLORES-200 benchmark. We empirically investigate the influence of punctuation loss, demonstrating that unpunctuated ASR output significantly degrades translation quality, causing a massive 20.7% relative BLEU drop on the FLORES benchmark. To overcome this, we propose and evaluate an intermediate Punctuation Restoration Module (PRM). The final S2TT pipeline was tested across three configurations on a custom dataset. The optimal configuration, which applied the PRM directly to ASR output, achieved a 4.90 BLEU point gain over the direct ASR-to-NMT baseline (BLEU 36.38 vs. 31.48). This improvement was validated by human assessment, which confirmed the optimized pipeline's superior Adequacy (3.673) and Fluency (3.804). This work validates that targeted punctuation restoration is the most effective intervention for mitigating structural noise in the Nepali S2TT pipeline. It establishes an optimized baseline and demonstrates a critical architectural insight for developing cascaded speech translation systems for similar low-resource languages.

*Minhao Jiang,Zhikai Li,Xuewen Liu,Jing Zhang,Mengjuan Chen,Qingyi Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sparsity Induction improves post-training sparsity by promoting higher sparsity at distribution and feature levels before pruning, enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in computational and memory costs of large language models by improving post-training sparsity techniques.

Method: Proposes Sparsity Induction with scaling transformations for distribution-level sparsity and Spectral Norm Loss for feature-level sparsity.

Result: Achieves superior pruning performance across diverse models and tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Sparsity Induction effectively enhances sparsity-friendliness and outperforms traditional pruning approaches.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated capabilities in text generation, while their increasing parameter scales present challenges in computational and memory efficiency. Post-training sparsity (PTS), which reduces model cost by removing weights from dense networks, is an effective approach. However, native dense matrices lack high sparsity, making existing approaches that directly remove weights disrupt model states, resulting in unsatisfactory performance recovery even with post-tuning. We propose Sparsity Induction, which promotes models toward higher sparsity at both distribution and feature levels before pruning, to push the limits of PTS. At the distribution level, we enhance distributional sparsity through mathematically equivalent scaling transformations, which are fully absorbable and incur no extra parameters or inference-time overhead. At the feature level, we introduce Spectral Norm Loss to promote feature sparsity from a low-rank perspective. Experiments across diverse model architectures and tasks demonstrate that our method further enhances sparsity-friendliness, achieving superior pruning performance over existing approaches.

TL;DR: DWA-KD improves cross-tokenizer knowledge distillation by combining dual-space entropy weighting and Soft-DTW alignment for better token-wise and sequence-level distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-tokenizer KD methods are limited by suboptimal token and sequence alignment, prompting the development of DWA-KD for enhanced performance.

Method: DWA-KD uses dual-space entropy-based weighting for token-level distillation and Soft-DTW for sequence-level alignment of lexical and semantic information.

Result: DWA-KD outperforms state-of-the-art KD baselines across NLP benchmarks, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its components.

Conclusion: DWA-KD provides a robust framework for cross-tokenizer KD, achieving superior performance through dual-space weighting and Soft-DTW alignment.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a crucial technique for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs). Although existing cross-tokenizer KD methods have made notable progress, their effectiveness remains constrained by suboptimal alignment across sequence and vocabulary levels. To address these limitations, we introduce Dual-Space Weighting and Time-Warped Alignment (DWA-KD), a novel cross-tokenizer distillation framework that enhances token-wise distillation through dual-space entropy-based weighting and achieves precise sequence-level alignment by leveraging both lexical and semantic information. At the token level, DWA-KD maps teacher representations into the student space and vice versa, performing dual-space KD via Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL). The process is modulated by dual-space weights that up-weight tokens where the student is uncertain and the teacher is confident, thereby focusing learning on informative tokens rather than treating all positions equally. At the sequence level, DWA-KD applies Soft Dynamic Time Warping (Soft-DTW) to both the embedding and final hidden-state layers, enabling robust alignment of lexical and contextual semantics between teacher and student sequences. Extensive experiments across diverse NLP benchmarks demonstrate that DWA-KD outperforms state-of-the-art KD baselines, while ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of entropy-based token weighting and embedding and final hidden state layer Soft-DTW alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human numeral systems, like English base-10, are highly regular. This study explores if regularity aids learning, confirming that regular systems are easier to learn than irregular ones, especially for generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates whether the regularity of human numeral systems enhances their learnability, linking cross-linguistic patterns to learning biases.

Method: Using Reinforcement Learning methods, the study compares learnability of regular vs. irregular numeral systems under assumptions of generalization from limited data.

Result: Regular numeral systems are easier to learn than irregular ones, while highly irregular systems' learnability is influenced by signal length.

Conclusion: Regularity facilitates learning in numeral systems, contributing to their cross-linguistic prevalence, while different pressures affect irregular systems.

Abstract: Human recursive numeral systems (i.e., counting systems such as English base-10 numerals), like many other grammatical systems, are highly regular. Following prior work that relates cross-linguistic tendencies to biases in learning, we ask whether regular systems are common because regularity facilitates learning. Adopting methods from the Reinforcement Learning literature, we confirm that highly regular human(-like) systems are easier to learn than unattested but possible irregular systems. This asymmetry emerges under the natural assumption that recursive numeral systems are designed for generalisation from limited data to represent all integers exactly. We also find that the influence of regularity on learnability is absent for unnatural, highly irregular systems, whose learnability is influenced instead by signal length, suggesting that different pressures may influence learnability differently in different parts of the space of possible numeral systems. Our results contribute to the body of work linking learnability to cross-linguistic prevalence.

TL;DR: EoG enhances LLM reasoning on KGs using reinforcement learning for diverse path exploration, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KG-enhanced methods limit LLM reasoning to prior data, reducing generalizability for out-of-distribution tasks.

Method: Proposes Explore-on-Graph (EoG), incentivizing diverse reasoning paths via reinforcement learning with correctness and path-based rewards.

Result: Outperforms open-source and closed-source LLMs across five KGQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: EoG successfully broadens LLM reasoning capabilities autonomously, improving performance and generalizability.

Abstract: The reasoning process of Large Language Models (LLMs) is often plagued by hallucinations and missing facts in question-answering tasks. A promising solution is to ground LLMs' answers in verifiable knowledge sources, such as Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Prevailing KG-enhanced methods typically constrained LLM reasoning either by enforcing rules during generation or by imitating paths from a fixed set of demonstrations. However, they naturally confined the reasoning patterns of LLMs within the scope of prior experience or fine-tuning data, limiting their generalizability to out-of-distribution graph reasoning problems. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose Explore-on-Graph (EoG), a novel framework that encourages LLMs to autonomously explore a more diverse reasoning space on KGs. To incentivize exploration and discovery of novel reasoning paths, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning during training, whose reward is the correctness of the reasoning paths' final answers. To enhance the efficiency and meaningfulness of the exploration, we propose to incorporate path information as additional reward signals to refine the exploration process and reduce futile efforts. Extensive experiments on five KGQA benchmark datasets demonstrate that, to the best of our knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming not only open-source but also even closed-source LLMs.

*MD. Sagor Chowdhury,Adiba Fairooz Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents an end-to-end system for Bengali ASR and speaker diarization, addressing challenges like phoneme diversity and dialect variation. Key techniques include fine-tuning Whisper for ASR and modifying pyannote.audio for diarization, achieving competitive WER and DER scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bengali poses unique challenges for speech recognition and diarization due to its phoneme complexity, dialect variations, and limited labeled data. The goal was to develop effective solutions for these tasks in a low-resource setting.

Method: For ASR, the system combines a fine-tuned Whisper model with Demucs source separation and silence-aware chunking. For diarization, it replaces pyannote.audio's segmentation model with a Bengali-fine-tuned version and uses wespeaker embeddings with clustering.

Result: Achieved a WER of 0.37738 (private) and 0.36137 (public) for ASR, and a DER of 0.27671 (private) and 0.20936 (public) for diarization.

Conclusion: Domain-specific fine-tuning, vocal separation, and silence-aware chunking are critical for improving Bengali speech processing performance.

Abstract: We describe our end-to-end system for Bengali long-form speech recognition (ASR) and speaker diarization submitted to the DL Sprint 4.0 competition on Kaggle. Bengali presents substantial challenges for both tasks: a large phoneme inventory, significant dialectal variation, frequent code-mixing with English, and a relative scarcity of large-scale labelled corpora. For ASR we achieve a best private Word Error Rate (WER) of 0.37738 and public WER of 0.36137, combining a BengaliAI fine-tuned Whisper medium model with Demucs source separation for vocal isolation, silence-boundary chunking, and carefully tuned generation hyperparameters. For speaker diarization we reach a best private Diarization Error Rate (DER) of 0.27671 and public DER of 0.20936 by replacing the default segmentation model inside the pyannote.audio pipeline with a Bengali-fine-tuned variant, pairing it with wespeaker-voxceleb-resnet34-LM embeddings and centroid-based agglomerative clustering. Our experiments demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning of the segmentation component, vocal source separation, and natural silence-aware chunking are the three most impactful design choices for low-resource Bengali speech processing.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition (IDRR) remains a challenging task due to the requirement for deep semantic understanding in the absence of explicit discourse markers. A further limitation is that existing methods only predict relations without providing any supporting explanations. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities in both deep language understanding and natural language explanation generation. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach to distill the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into lightweight IDRR models to improve both performance and interpretability. Specifically, we first prompt an LLM to generate explanations for each training instance conditioned on its gold label. Then, we introduce a novel classification-generation framework that jointly performs relation prediction and explanation generation, and train it with the additional supervision of LLM-generated explanations. Our framework is plug-and-play, enabling easy integration with most existing IDRR models. Experimental results on PDTB demonstrate that our approach significantly improves IDRR performance, while human evaluation further confirms that the generated explanations enhance model interpretability. Furthermore, we validate the generality of our approach on sentiment classification and natural language inference

*Shunsuke Ubukata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: D-CoT, a novel framework, improves Small Language Models' performance by enforcing structured reasoning with control tags during training, reducing computational costs and boosting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought distillation often causes 'overthinking' in Small Language Models, leading to performance degradation and high token usage.

Method: Proposes Disciplined Chain-of-Thought (D-CoT), using control tags (<TEMP_LOW>, <TEMP_HIGH>) to structure reasoning during training.

Result: Achieves significant accuracy boosts (9.9% on GPQA-diamond, 9.1% on MMLU-Pro) and reduces computational costs with 5,000 training samples.

Conclusion: D-CoT effectively internalizes disciplined reasoning, maintaining performance even without explicit control tags during inference.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) often induces "overthinking" in Small Language Models (SLMs), leading to performance degradation and excessive token consumption. In this study, we propose Disciplined Chain-of-Thought (D-CoT), a novel framework that enforces a structured reasoning process using control tags -- such as <TEMP_LOW> for fact-checking and <TEMP_HIGH> for multi-perspective exploration -- as auxiliary scaffolding during training. By optimizing the CoT trajectory, D-CoT suppresses reasoning drift and simultaneously achieves token reduction and performance improvement. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on Qwen3-8B: with only 5,000 training samples, D-CoT significantly boosts accuracy on GPQA-diamond by 9.9% and MMLU-Pro (0-shot) by 9.1%, while drastically reducing computational costs. Furthermore, we confirm that the model internalizes this disciplined thought structure, maintaining high performance even without explicit control tags during inference.

TL;DR: FewMMBench is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate few-shot learning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), revealing limited gains from demonstrations and CoT prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of assessing few-shot learning capabilities in MLLMs, particularly for interleaved image-text data.

Method: Developed FewMMBench, a benchmark evaluating 26 MLLMs across diverse tasks, focusing on In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.

Result: Instruction-tuned models showed strong zero-shot performance but minimal or negative improvement with demonstrations or CoT. Retrieval-based methods and larger context sizes offered limited benefits.

Conclusion: FewMMBench serves as a rigorous tool for diagnosing and advancing few-shot learning in multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance in handling interleaved image-text data, assessing their few-shot learning capabilities remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce FewMMBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs under few-shot conditions, with a focus on In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Covering a diverse suite of multimodal understanding tasks, from attribute recognition to temporal reasoning, FewMMBench enables systematic analysis across task types, model families, and prompting strategies. We evaluate 26 open-weight MLLMs from six model families across zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT-augmented few-shot settings. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuned models exhibit strong zero-shot performance but benefit minimally, or even regress, with additional demonstrations or CoT reasoning. Retrieval-based demonstrations and increased context size also yield limited gains. These results highlight FewMMBench as a rigorous testbed for diagnosing and advancing few-shot capabilities in multimodal LLMs. The data is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/mustafaa/FewMMBench

TL;DR: A framework using LLMs and personal knowledge graphs improves memory recall by identifying forgotten events efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory recall systems rely on deep learning, which struggles with data scarcity and adaptability to new lifelog data. LLMs offer potential solutions due to their versatility.

Method: The framework integrates LLMs with personal knowledge graphs for proactive information access, refining decision-making processes. It allows flexible model updates and fact retrieval modifications.

Result: Experiments show the framework effectively detects forgotten events, aiding users in recalling past experiences.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-based framework enhances memory recall by addressing data scarcity and adaptability challenges.

Abstract: Since individuals may struggle to recall all life details and often confuse events, establishing a system to assist users in recalling forgotten experiences is essential. While numerous studies have proposed memory recall systems, these primarily rely on deep learning techniques that require extensive training and often face data scarcity due to the limited availability of personal lifelogs. As lifelogs grow over time, systems must also adapt quickly to newly accumulated data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, making them promising for personalized applications. In this work, we present a framework that leverages LLMs for proactive information access, integrating personal knowledge graphs to enhance the detection of access needs through a refined decision-making process. Our framework offers high flexibility, enabling the replacement of base models and the modification of fact retrieval methods for continuous improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies forgotten events, supporting users in recalling past experiences more efficiently.

TL;DR: ExpLang is a novel LLM post-training pipeline that uses multilingual thinking to enhance RL performance, outperforming English-only models with the same training budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LRMs focus on English reasoning, missing the potential advantages of multilingual thinking and native thinking traces for global users.

Method: ExpLang introduces on-policy thinking language selection during RL, leveraging multiple languages to improve exploration and exploitation.

Result: The method consistently outperforms English-only training, showing high compliance with both seen and unseen languages.

Conclusion: ExpLang extends RL exploration and improves exploitation, offering a new approach to enhancing LRMs through multilingualism.

Abstract: Current large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown strong ability on challenging tasks after reinforcement learning (RL) based post-training. However, previous work mainly focuses on English reasoning in expectation of the strongest performance, despite the demonstrated potential advantage of multilingual thinking, as well as the requirement for native thinking traces by global users. In this paper, we propose ExpLang, a novel LLM post-training pipeline that enables on-policy thinking language selection to improve exploration and exploitation during RL with the use of multiple languages. The results show that our method steadily outperforms English-only training with the same training budget, while showing high thinking language compliance for both seen and unseen languages. Analysis shows that, by enabling on-policy thinking language selection as an action during RL, ExpLang effectively extends the RL exploration space with diversified language preference and improves the RL exploitation outcome with leveraged non-English advantage. The method is orthogonal to most RL algorithms and opens up a new perspective on using multilinguality to improve LRMs.

TL;DR: Smaller fine-tuned DistilBERT outperforms larger LLMs in sarcasm detection for Hinglish text, achieving 84% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sarcasm detection in multilingual and code-mixed environments is challenging due to informal expressions and low-resource languages.

Method: Comparison of four LLMs (Llama 3.1, Mistral, Gemma 3, Phi-4) and fine-tuned DistilBERT for sarcasm detection in Hinglish.

Result: DistilBERT achieved 84% accuracy, outperforming LLMs in zero and few-shot setups.

Conclusion: Domain-adaptive fine-tuning of smaller models improves sarcasm detection over general LLMs in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Sarcasm detection in multilingual and code-mixed environments remains a challenging task for natural language processing models due to structural variations, informal expressions, and low-resource linguistic availability. This study compares four large language models, Llama 3.1, Mistral, Gemma 3, and Phi-4, with a fine-tuned DistilBERT model for sarcasm detection in code-mixed Hinglish text. The results indicate that the smaller, sequentially fine-tuned DistilBERT model achieved the highest overall accuracy of 84%, outperforming all of the LLMs in zero and few-shot set ups, using minimal LLM generated code-mixed data used for fine-tuning. These findings indicate that domain-adaptive fine-tuning of smaller transformer based models may significantly improve sarcasm detection over general LLM inference, in low-resource and data scarce settings.

### [144] [MERRY: Semantically Decoupled Evaluation of Multimodal Emotional and Role Consistencies of Role-Playing Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21941)
*Zhenyu Wang,Xiaofen Xing,Yirong Chen,Xiangmin Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MERRY, a semantically decoupled evaluation framework for Multimodal Role-Playing Agents (MRPAs), addressing ambiguities in existing evaluation methods. It proposes refined metrics for emotional and role consistency, improves human agreement in evaluations, and reveals insights about training datasets and model limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for MRPAs conflate semantic assessment with modality generation and rely heavily on human judgment, leading to ambiguous error attribution and limitations. The paper aims to address these issues with a more effective framework.

Method: The authors propose MERRY, a framework featuring five metrics for emotional consistency (EC) and three for role consistency (RC). It replaces subjective scoring with a bidirectional-evidence-finding task to enhance human agreement in evaluations.

Result: Key findings include: (1) Synthetic datasets reduce emotional consistency, while real-world datasets improve it; (2) Models exhibit emotional templatization and positive-bias; (3) Simple prompting helps weak models but limits strong ones, and fine-tuning lacks role generalization.

Conclusion: MERRY provides a robust evaluation framework for MRPAs, uncovering limitations in current models and training approaches. It highlights the need for better datasets and methods to enhance emotional and role consistency.

Abstract: Multimodal Role-Playing Agents (MRPAs) are attracting increasing attention due to their ability to deliver more immersive multimodal emotional interactions. However, existing studies still rely on pure textual benchmarks to evaluate the text responses of MRPAs, while delegating the assessment of their multimodal expressions solely to modality-synthesis metrics. This evaluation paradigm, on the one hand, entangles semantic assessment with modality generation, leading to ambiguous error attribution, and on the other hand remains constrained by the heavy reliance on human judgment. To this end, we propose MERRY, a semantically decoupled evaluation framework for assessing Multimodal Emotional and Role consistencies of Role-playing agents. This framework introduce five refined metrics for EC and three for RC. Notably, we transform the traditional subjective scoring approach into a novel bidirectional-evidence-finding task, significantly improving the human agreement of LLM-as-Judge evaluations. Based on MERRY, we conduct extensive evaluations. Our empirical results primarily reveal that: (1) Training on synthetic datasets tends to reduce emotional consistency, whereas training on real-world datasets improves it; (2) Existing models suffer from emotional templatization and simplification, exhibiting positive-bias and performance bottleneck in fine-grained negative emotions; (3) Simple prompting method strengthens the weak models but constrains the strong ones, while simple fine-tuning method suffers from poor role generalization. Codes and dataset are available.

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with reasoning about computational processes, termed 'algorithmic blindness,' performing worse than random guessing despite their broad knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLMs' reasoning abilities is crucial for practitioners relying on them for algorithm selection and deployment.

Method: Evaluated eight frontier LLMs using causal discovery as a testbed, comparing results to ground truth from large-scale algorithm executions.

Result: LLMs showed systematic failure, producing wider confidence intervals than true ones and often missing the true algorithmic mean. Most performed worse than random guessing.

Conclusion: LLMs lack calibrated procedural prediction, highlighting a gap between declarative knowledge and reasoning about algorithms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable breadth of knowledge, yet their ability to reason about computational processes remains poorly understood. Closing this gap matters for practitioners who rely on LLMs to guide algorithm selection and deployment. We address this limitation using causal discovery as a testbed and evaluate eight frontier LLMs against ground truth derived from large-scale algorithm executions and find systematic, near-total failure. Models produce ranges far wider than true confidence intervals yet still fail to contain the true algorithmic mean in the majority of instances; most perform worse than random guessing and the marginal above-random performance of the best model is most consistent with benchmark memorization rather than principled reasoning. We term this failure algorithmic blindness and argue it reflects a fundamental gap between declarative knowledge about algorithms and calibrated procedural prediction.

TL;DR: MEDSYN introduces a multilingual, multimodal benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on complex clinical cases, revealing gaps in synthesizing heterogeneous evidence compared to human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing real-world clinical complexity, prompting the creation of MEDSYN to better assess MLLMs.

Method: MEDSYN evaluates 18 MLLMs on differential diagnosis generation and final diagnosis selection using diverse clinical evidence types per case.

Result: Top MLLMs match or surpass human experts in DDx but show larger DDx-FDx performance gaps due to overreliance on textual evidence and cross-modal utilization issues.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights MLLMs' limitations in synthesizing heterogeneous evidence and proposes Evidence Sensitivity to guide improvements.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in medical applications, yet existing benchmarks inadequately capture real-world clinical complexity. We introduce MEDSYN, a multilingual, multimodal benchmark of highly complex clinical cases with up to 7 distinct visual clinical evidence (CE) types per case. Mirroring clinical workflow, we evaluate 18 MLLMs on differential diagnosis (DDx) generation and final diagnosis (FDx) selection. While top models often match or even outperform human experts on DDx generation, all MLLMs exhibit a much larger DDx--FDx performance gap compared to expert clinicians, indicating a failure mode in synthesis of heterogeneous CE types. Ablations attribute this failure to (i) overreliance on less discriminative textual CE ($\it{e.g.}$, medical history) and (ii) a cross-modal CE utilization gap. We introduce Evidence Sensitivity to quantify the latter and show that a smaller gap correlates with higher diagnostic accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate how it can be used to guide interventions to improve model performance. We will open-source our benchmark and code.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RADAR improves KGR by switching from generative to discriminative reasoning, using reinforcement learning for better entity separability, achieving better performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KGR methods using LLMs often memorize surface-level patterns instead of learning genuine relational semantics, limiting generalization.

Method: RADAR reformulates KGR as discriminative entity selection, using reinforcement learning to enhance entity separability and inference in representation space.

Result: RADAR achieves 5-6% relative gains on benchmarks and increases task-relevant mutual information by 62.9%, showing more robust reasoning.

Conclusion: Discriminative reasoning outperforms generative paradigms in KGR, offering better generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) infers missing facts, with recent advances increasingly harnessing the semantic priors and reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevailing generative paradigms are prone to memorizing surface-level co-occurrences rather than learning genuine relational semantics, limiting out-of-distribution generalization. To address this, we propose RADAR, which reformulates KGR from generative pattern matching to discriminative relational reasoning. We recast KGR as discriminative entity selection, where reinforcement learning enforces relative entity separability beyond token-likelihood imitation. Leveraging this separability, inference operates directly in representation space, ensuring consistency with the discriminative optimization and bypassing generation-induced hallucinations. Across four benchmarks, RADAR achieves 5-6% relative gains on link prediction and triple classification over strong LLM baselines, while increasing task-relevant mutual information in intermediate representations by 62.9%, indicating more robust and transferable relational reasoning.

TL;DR: TL;DR: The paper introduces CxMP, a benchmark to evaluate how well language models understand form-meaning pairings (constructions) in language, revealing gaps in their ability despite early syntactic competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on grammatical acceptability but overlook the interpretation of meanings conveyed by grammatical forms. The authors aim to address this gap by evaluating models' understanding of constructions—form-meaning pairings—grounded in Construction Grammar.

Method: The authors introduce CxMP, a benchmark using a minimal-pair design across nine construction types (e.g., let-alone, caused motion, ditransitive) to assess whether models can interpret semantic relations implied by constructions.

Result: Results indicate that while syntactic competence develops early in language models, their constructional understanding grows more slowly and remains limited, even in large language models (LLMs).

Conclusion: CxMP highlights persistent gaps in how language models integrate form and meaning, offering a framework to study constructional understanding and learning trajectories in these models.

Abstract: Recent work has examined language models from a linguistic perspective to better understand how they acquire language. Most existing benchmarks focus on judging grammatical acceptability, whereas the ability to interpret meanings conveyed by grammatical forms has received much less attention. We introduce the Linguistic Minimal-Pair Benchmark for Evaluating Constructional Understanding in Language Models (CxMP), a benchmark grounded in Construction Grammar that treats form-meaning pairings, or constructions, as fundamental linguistic units. CxMP evaluates whether models can interpret the semantic relations implied by constructions, using a controlled minimal-pair design across nine construction types, including the let-alone, caused motion, and ditransitive constructions. Our results show that while syntactic competence emerges early, constructional understanding develops more gradually and remains limited even in large language models (LLMs). CxMP thus reveals persistent gaps in how language models integrate form and meaning, providing a framework for studying constructional understanding and learning trajectories in language models.

Motivation: Investigate the impact of diversity on ModernBERT pre-training to reduce dataset size without losing performance.

Method: Compare diversity-driven sampling algorithms for pre-training dataset selection.

Result: Diversity-driven sampling improves performance by up to 10 points in some tasks and reduces training time significantly.

Conclusion: Diversity-driven sampling is effective for efficient NLP model pre-training.

Abstract: Diversity has been gaining interest in the NLP community in recent years. At the same time, state-of-the-art transformer models such as ModernBERT use very large pre-training datasets, which are driven by size rather than by diversity. This summons for an investigation of the impact of diversity on the ModernBERT pre-training. We do so in this study, with the express intent of reducing pre-training dataset size, while retaining at least comparable performance. We compare diversity-driven sampling algorithms, so as to pick the best one. We find that diversity-driven sampling allows in some tasks to gain 10 points relative to randomly-sampled pre-training data of commensurate size. We also see that a model pre-trained for 483h on a diversity-driven dataset of 150M tokens can yield a commensurate performance to a model pre-trained for 1,775h on a randomly-driven dataset of 2.4B tokens.

Motivation: Existing NLP resources for DLT are limited, focusing narrowly on cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, leaving broader domain-specific language underexplored despite the sector's significance.

Method: DLT-Corpus was created by compiling 2.98 billion tokens from scientific literature, USPTO patents, and social media posts. Its utility was demonstrated by analyzing technology emergence and market-innovation correlations.

Result: Technologies originate in scientific literature before reaching patents and social media, following traditional transfer patterns. Research and patent activity grow independently of market fluctuations, enabling economic growth.

Conclusion: DLT-Corpus and LedgerBERT (a domain-adapted model) are publicly released, offering valuable tools for DLT research and demonstrating the virtuous cycle of innovation driving economic growth.

Abstract: We introduce DLT-Corpus, the largest domain-specific text collection for Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) research to date: 2.98 billion tokens from 22.12 million documents spanning scientific literature (37,440 publications), United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) patents (49,023 filings), and social media (22 million posts). Existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources for DLT focus narrowly on cryptocurrencies price prediction and smart contracts, leaving domain-specific language under explored despite the sector's ~$3 trillion market capitalization and rapid technological evolution.
  We demonstrate DLT-Corpus' utility by analyzing technology emergence patterns and market-innovation correlations. Findings reveal that technologies originate in scientific literature before reaching patents and social media, following traditional technology transfer patterns. While social media sentiment remains overwhelmingly bullish even during crypto winters, scientific and patent activity grow independently of market fluctuations, tracking overall market expansion in a virtuous cycle where research precedes and enables economic growth that funds further innovation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs' Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities are tested under perturbations; while Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generally improves performance, it can degrade accuracy in certain cases, suggesting selective use is needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if LLMs genuinely possess Theory of Mind (ToM) by evaluating robustness through perturbed tasks and exploring CoT prompting's impact.

Method: Use a handcrafted ToM dataset with classic/perturbed false-belief tasks, valid reasoning chains, and metrics to evaluate CoT faithfulness and correctness.

Result: LLMs show significant ToM performance drops under perturbations. CoT improves overall ToM faithfulness but reduces accuracy for some perturbed tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs lack robust ToM; CoT helps but must be applied selectively due to inconsistent effects on perturbed tasks.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to an agent's ability to model the internal states of others. Contributing to the debate whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit genuine ToM capabilities, our study investigates their ToM robustness using perturbations on false-belief tasks and examines the potential of Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT) to enhance performance and explain the LLM's decision. We introduce a handcrafted, richly annotated ToM dataset, including classic and perturbed false belief tasks, the corresponding spaces of valid reasoning chains for correct task completion, subsequent reasoning faithfulness, task solutions, and propose metrics to evaluate reasoning chain correctness and to what extent final answers are faithful to reasoning traces of the generated CoT. We show a steep drop in ToM capabilities under task perturbation for all evaluated LLMs, questioning the notion of any robust form of ToM being present. While CoT prompting improves the ToM performance overall in a faithful manner, it surprisingly degrades accuracy for some perturbation classes, indicating that selective application is necessary.

Motivation: Large models incur high computational costs; optimizing model selection based on confidence can balance performance and efficiency.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable to largest models while cutting costs by 20-40% and reducing GPT-4o API token usage by ~60%.

Conclusion: Confidence-based model selection enhances LLM deployment efficiency, especially in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized inference across diverse natural language tasks, with larger models performing better but at higher computational costs. We propose a confidence-driven strategy that dynamically selects the most suitable model based on confidence estimates. By assessing a model's confidence in handling the task and response accuracy, tasks that are likely to be solved correctly are retained, while more uncertain or complex cases are delegated to a larger model, ensuring reliability while minimizing computation. Specifically, we evaluate a model's likelihood of knowing the correct answer and the probability that its response is accurate. Experiments on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark show that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to the largest model while reducing computational costs by 20\% to 40\%. When applied to GPT-4o API calls, it reduces token usage by approximately 60\%, further improving cost efficiency. These findings indicate the potential of confidence-based model selection to enhance real-world LLM deployment, particularly in resource-constrained settings such as edge devices and commercial API applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IndicIFEval is a benchmark evaluating LLMs' constrained generation across 14 Indic languages, revealing gaps in lexical and cross-lingual tasks compared to English.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of instruction-following benchmarks for Indic languages, serving hundreds of millions of speakers.

Method: Use rule-based, verifiable instructions with 800 human-verified examples per language, split into translated and synthetically generated subsets.

Result: Models excel in formatting constraints but struggle with lexical and cross-lingual tasks, lagging behind English performance.

Conclusion: IndicIFEval highlights gaps in multilingual LLM performance and aims to advance constrained generation for Indic languages.

Abstract: Instruction-following benchmarks remain predominantly English-centric, leaving a critical evaluation gap for the hundreds of millions of Indic language speakers. We introduce IndicIFEval, a benchmark evaluating constrained generation of LLMs across 14 Indic languages using automatically verifiable, rule-based instructions. It comprises around 800 human-verified examples per language spread across two complementary subsets: IndicIFEval-Ground, translated prompts from IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023) carefully localized for Indic contexts, and IndicIFEval-Ground, synthetically generated instructions grounded in native Indic content. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of major open-weight and proprietary models spanning both reasoning and non-reasoning models. While models maintain strong adherence to formatting constraints, they struggle significantly with lexical and cross-lingual tasks -- and despite progress in high-resource languages, instruction-following across the broader Indic family lags significantly behind English. We release IndicIFEval and its evaluation scripts to support progress on multilingual constrained generation (http://github.com/ai4bharat/IndicIFEval).

*Leon Pielage,Ole Hätscher,Mitja Back,Bernhard Marschall,Benjamin Risse*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model-agnostic framework for dynamic personality simulation in LLMs, using state machines and continuous scoring to adapt personality states based on conversational context, validated in medical education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to adjust personality expression dynamically in interactive contexts, limiting their effectiveness. This work aims to address this gap.

Method: A modular framework with state machines represents latent personality states, adapting transition probabilities to context. A scoring pipeline evaluates dialogues dynamically, reconfiguring the system prompt.

Result: The framework successfully adapts personality states and influences user behavior in medical education, achieving comparable precision with lightweight classifiers.

Conclusion: The work shows feasibility for adaptive personality architectures in education, customer support, and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: The inability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to modulate their personality expression in response to evolving dialogue dynamics hinders their performance in complex, interactive contexts. We propose a model-agnostic framework for dynamic personality simulation that employs state machines to represent latent personality states, where transition probabilities are dynamically adapted to the conversational context. Part of our architecture is a modular pipeline for continuous personality scoring that evaluates dialogues along latent axes while remaining agnostic to the specific personality models, their dimensions, transition mechanisms, or LLMs used. These scores function as dynamic state variables that systematically reconfigure the system prompt, steering behavioral alignment throughout the interaction.We evaluate this framework by operationalizing the Interpersonal Circumplex (IPC) in a medical education setting. Results demonstrate that the system successfully adapts its personality state to user inputs, but also influences user behavior, thereby facilitating de-escalation training. Notably, the scoring pipeline maintains comparable precision even when utilizing lightweight, fine-tuned classifiers instead of large-scale LLMs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of modular, personality-adaptive architectures for education, customer support, and broader human-computer interaction.

*Xi Ye,Wuwei Zhang,Fangcong Yin,Howard Yen,Danqi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DySCO is a decoding algorithm that improves long-context reasoning in LMs by dynamically adjusting attention using retrieval heads, enhancing accuracy without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of deteriorating LM accuracy with increasing input length by improving attention alignment.

Method: DySCO uses retrieval heads to identify relevant tokens and up-weights them dynamically during decoding.

Result: DySCO improves performance by up to 25% on benchmarks like MRCR and LongBenchV2 at 128K context length.

Conclusion: DySCO effectively enhances long-context reasoning without training, offering interpretability and consistent gains.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long contexts is a crucial capability for language models (LMs). Although recent models support increasingly long context windows, their accuracy often deteriorates as input length grows. In practice, models often struggle to keep attention aligned with the most relevant context throughout decoding. In this work, we propose DySCO, a novel decoding algorithm for improving long-context reasoning. DySCO leverages retrieval heads--a subset of attention heads specialized for long-context retrieval--to identify task-relevant tokens at each decoding step and explicitly up-weight them. By doing so, DySCO dynamically adjusts attention during generation to better utilize relevant context. The method is training-free and can be applied directly to any off-the-shelf LMs. Across multiple instruction-tuned and reasoning models, DySCO consistently improves performance on challenging long-context reasoning benchmarks, yielding relative gains of up to 25% on MRCR and LongBenchV2 at 128K context length with modest additional compute. Further analysis highlights the importance of both dynamic attention rescaling and retrieval-head-guided selection for the effectiveness of the method, while providing interpretability insights into decoding-time attention behavior.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LiCQA is an unsupervised QA model outperforming recent systems with lower latency, addressing complex questions without expensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex QA remains challenging despite progress; existing systems rely on costly knowledge graphs or neural models.

Method: LiCQA uses corpus evidence, comparing with two recent QA systems empirically.

Result: LiCQA outperforms state-of-the-art systems on benchmarks with reduced latency.

Conclusion: LiCQA offers an efficient, effective alternative for complex QA without costly resources.

Abstract: Over the last twenty years, significant progress has been made in designing and implementing Question Answering (QA) systems. However, addressing complex questions, the answers to which are spread across multiple documents, remains a challenging problem. Recent QA systems that are designed to handle complex questions work either on the basis of knowledge graphs, or utilise contem- porary neural models that are expensive to train, in terms of both computational resources and the volume of training data required. In this paper, we present LiCQA, an unsupervised question answer- ing model that works primarily on the basis of corpus evidence. We empirically compare the effectiveness and efficiency of LiCQA with two recently presented QA systems, which are based on different underlying principles. The results of our experiments show that LiCQA significantly outperforms these two state-of-the-art systems on benchmark data with noteworthy reduction in latency.

### [157] [Improving Parametric Knowledge Access in Reasoning Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22193)
*Melody Ma,John Hewitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how language models access their stored world knowledge through reasoning, finding that models improve knowledge recall with simple cues but not math tasks. Training with world-knowledge question answering as reward enhances performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve how language models reason over their parametric knowledge, as current models may not optimally access or utilize stored world knowledge despite being trained for reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors propose training models using reinforcement learning with world-knowledge question answering as a reward, tested on datasets like TriviaQA, Natural Questions, HotpotQA, SimpleQA, and StrategyQA.

Result: Adding a "think step-by-step" cue improves knowledge recall significantly. Reinforcement learning on TriviaQA boosts performance by +9.9%, with positive spillover effects on other datasets (4.2%, 2.1%, 0.6%, 3.0%).

Conclusion: Reasoning models are under-optimized for accessing parametric knowledge but can be trained effectively to reason better, as demonstrated by performance improvements across diverse question-answering tasks.

Abstract: We study reasoning for accessing world knowledge stored in a language model's parameters. For example, recalling that Canberra is Australia's capital may benefit from thinking through major cities and the concept of purpose-built capitals. While reasoning language models are trained via reinforcement learning to produce reasoning traces on tasks such as mathematics, they may not reason well for accessing their own world knowledge. We first find that models do not generate their best world knowledge reasoning by default: adding a simple "think step-by-step" cue demonstrates statistically significant improvement in knowledge recall but not math. Motivated by this, we propose training models to reason over their parametric knowledge using world-knowledge question answering as a verifiable reward. After reinforcement learning on TriviaQA (+9.9%), performance also improves on Natural Questions, HotpotQA, SimpleQA, and StrategyQA by 4.2%, 2.1%, 0.6%, and 3.0%, respectively. Reasoning models are under-optimized for parametric knowledge access, but can be easily trained to reason better.

*Cole Simmons,Richard Diehl Martinez,Dan Jurafsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SumTablets is a dataset pairing Unicode cuneiform glyphs with Oracc transliterations, enabling NLP methods for Sumerian transliteration. It includes baselines and achieves high accuracy with a fine-tuned language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a comprehensive dataset linking Sumerian transliterations to cuneiform glyphs hinders NLP applications in Assyriology.

Method: SumTablets pairs 91,606 tablets' Unicode glyphs with Oracc transliterations, preprocessing and retaining structural data. Two baselines (weighted sampling and fine-tuned language model) were evaluated.

Result: The fine-tuned model achieved a 97.55 chrF score, showing high accuracy for automated transliteration.

Conclusion: SumTablets facilitates NLP-driven Sumerian transliteration, reducing manual effort with transformer models.

Abstract: Sumerian transliteration is a conventional system for representing a scholar's interpretation of a tablet in the Latin script. Thanks to visionary digital Assyriology projects such as ETCSL, CDLI, and Oracc, a large number of Sumerian transliterations have been published online, and these data are well-structured for a variety of search and analysis tasks. However, the absence of a comprehensive, accessible dataset pairing transliterations with a digital representation of the tablet's cuneiform glyphs has prevented the application of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to the task of Sumerian transliteration.
  To address this gap, we present SumTablets, a dataset pairing Unicode representations of 91,606 Sumerian cuneiform tablets (totaling 6,970,407 glyphs) with the associated transliterations published by Oracc. We construct SumTablets by first preprocessing and standardizing the Oracc transliterations before mapping each reading back to the Unicode representation of the source glyph. Further, we retain parallel structural information (e.g., surfaces, newlines, broken segments) through the use of special tokens. We release SumTablets as a Hugging Face Dataset (CC BY 4.0) and open source data preparation code via GitHub.
  Additionally, we leverage SumTablets to implement and evaluate two transliteration baselines: (1) weighted sampling from a glyph's possible readings, and (2) fine-tuning an autoregressive language model. Our fine-tuned language model achieves an average transliteration character-level F-score (chrF) of 97.55, demonstrating the immediate potential of transformer-based transliteration models in allowing experts to rapidly verify generated transliterations rather than manually transliterating tablets one-by-one.

TL;DR: A framework is introduced to improve multilingual LLM evaluation by addressing translation quality issues in benchmarks, using USI and T-RANK methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual LLM evaluations are unreliable due to poor-quality translations in benchmarks, causing semantic drift and context loss.

Method: Developed an automated framework employing USI and T-RANK for scalable, high-quality benchmark translation.

Result: Translated benchmarks into eight languages showed superior quality via reference-based metrics and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework and improved benchmarks enhance multilingual AI development reliability and reproducibility.

Abstract: The reliability of multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation is currently compromised by the inconsistent quality of translated benchmarks. Existing resources often suffer from semantic drift and context loss, which can lead to misleading performance metrics. In this work, we present a fully automated framework designed to address these challenges by enabling scalable, high-quality translation of datasets and benchmarks. We demonstrate that adapting test-time compute scaling strategies, specifically Universal Self-Improvement (USI) and our proposed multi-round ranking method, T-RANK, allows for significantly higher quality outputs compared to traditional pipelines. Our framework ensures that benchmarks preserve their original task structure and linguistic nuances during localization. We apply this approach to translate popular benchmarks and datasets into eight Eastern and Southern European languages (Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Slovak, Romanian, Lithuanian, Estonian, Turkish, Greek). Evaluations using both reference-based metrics and LLM-as-a-judge show that our translations surpass existing resources, resulting in more accurate downstream model assessment. We release both the framework and the improved benchmarks to facilitate robust and reproducible multilingual AI development.

### [160] [Latent Context Compilation: Distilling Long Context into Compact Portable Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21221)
*Zeju Li,Yizhou Zhou,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent Context Compilation (LCC) is a novel framework for efficient long-context LLM deployment by compiling contexts into stateless, plug-and-play buffer tokens, eliminating synthetic data costs and preserving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiencies in long-context LLM deployment, where existing methods like amortized compression struggle with generalization and Test-Time Training incurs high costs and complexity.

Method: Latent Context Compilation shifts context processing from adaptation to compilation, using a disposable LoRA module to distill long contexts into portable buffer tokens. It introduces a self-aligned optimization strategy with context-agnostic random queries.

Result: Experiments with Llama-3.1-8B show LCC preserves detail and reasoning at a 16x compression ratio, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: LCC effectively decouples memory density from model parameters, offering a scalable and efficient solution for long-context LLM deployment.

Abstract: Efficient long-context LLM deployment is stalled by a dichotomy between amortized compression, which struggles with out-of-distribution generalization, and Test-Time Training, which incurs prohibitive synthetic data costs and requires modifying model weights, creating stateful parameters that complicate concurrent serving. We propose Latent Context Compilation, a framework that fundamentally shifts context processing from adaptation to compilation. By utilizing a disposable LoRA module as a compiler, we distill long contexts into compact buffer tokens -- stateless, portable memory artifacts that are plug-and-play compatible with frozen base models. Crucially, we introduce a self-aligned optimization strategy that eliminates the need for synthetic context-relevant QA pairs. By regularizing context reconstruction task with context-agnostic random queries, we force compressed tokens to reside within the model's existing instruction-following manifold. Experiments with Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that Latent Context Compilation preserves fine-grained details and reasoning capabilities where prior methods falter, effectively decoupling memory density from model parameters even at a 16x compression ratio.

*Ramchand Kumaresan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACAR is a framework for routing tasks across models using self-consistency variance, achieving better accuracy than baselines while avoiding full ensembling. It highlights pitfalls like retrieval noise and model agreement on incorrect answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study multi-model orchestration under auditable conditions and provide insights into routing, retrieval, and attribution in model ensembles.

Method: ACAR uses self-consistency variance (sigma) from probe samples to route tasks across single-model, two-model, and three-model execution modes on the TEAMLLM substrate.

Result: Sigma-based routing achieves 55.6% accuracy, surpassing the two-model baseline (54.4%) and avoiding full ensembling on 54.2% of tasks. Negative results include retrieval noise and limitations of model agreement on incorrect answers.

Conclusion: ACAR provides actionable insights into multi-model routing and attribution, identifying practical challenges and setting falsifiable baselines for future research.

Abstract: We present ACAR (Adaptive Complexity and Attribution Routing), a measurement framework for studying multi-model orchestration under auditable conditions. ACAR uses self-consistency variance (sigma) computed from N=3 probe samples to route tasks across single-model, two-model, and three-model execution modes. The system is implemented on top of TEAMLLM, a deterministic execution substrate with immutable artifacts and complete decision traces. We evaluate ACAR on 1,510 tasks spanning four benchmarks: MathArena, Reasoning Gym, LiveCodeBench, and SuperGPQA, using Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, producing more than 7,550 auditable runs. Results show that sigma-based routing achieves 55.6 percent accuracy, exceeding the two-model baseline of 54.4 percent while avoiding full ensembling on 54.2 percent of tasks. The routing mechanism is model-agnostic and requires no learned components. We also document negative results. First, retrieval augmentation reduced accuracy by 3.4 percentage points, as median retrieval similarity was only 0.167, demonstrating that experience injection without semantic alignment introduces noise rather than grounding. Second, when models agree on incorrect answers (sigma equals zero), no downstream ensemble can recover; this agreement-but-wrong failure mode is intrinsic to self-consistency and bounds achievable accuracy at approximately eight percentage points below full ensembling. Third, attribution estimates based on proxy signals such as response similarity and entropy showed weak correlation with ground-truth leave-one-out values, indicating that practical attribution requires explicit counterfactual computation. This work documents which assumptions fail in practice and provides falsifiable baselines for future research on routing, retrieval, and multi-model attribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a MARL algorithm incorporating strategic risk aversion to improve collaboration robustness with unseen partners, reducing free-riding and outperforming classical game-theoretic solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing policy learning approaches fail in collaborative settings with new partners due to free-riding and lack of strategic robustness.

Method: Developed a MARL algorithm embedding strategic risk aversion into policy optimization for improved partner adaptability.

Result: Empirical tests showed reliable collaboration with unseen partners and better equilibrium outcomes than Nash solutions.

Conclusion: Strategic risk aversion enhances generalizable cooperation in multi-agent systems, validated across collaborative tasks.

Abstract: Many emerging agentic paradigms require agents to collaborate with one another (or people) to achieve shared goals. Unfortunately, existing approaches to learning policies for such collaborative problems produce brittle solutions that fail when paired with new partners. We attribute these failures to a combination of free-riding during training and a lack of strategic robustness. To address these problems, we study the concept of strategic risk aversion and interpret it as a principled inductive bias for generalizable cooperation with unseen partners. While strategically risk-averse players are robust to deviations in their partner's behavior by design, we show that, in collaborative games, they also (1) can have better equilibrium outcomes than those at classical game-theoretic concepts like Nash, and (2) exhibit less or no free-riding. Inspired by these insights, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that integrates strategic risk aversion into standard policy optimization methods. Our empirical results across collaborative benchmarks (including an LLM collaboration task) validate our theory and demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves reliable collaboration with heterogeneous and previously unseen partners across collaborative tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance traffic prediction models by capturing dynamic human activity in urban spaces through Urban Vibrancy embeddings.

Method: Combines variational autoencoders (VAE) with LSTM networks to compress and forecast embeddings, integrated into a sequence-to-sequence framework for traffic prediction.

Result: Improved accuracy in traffic prediction models (RNN, DCRNN, GTS, GMAN) and revealed temporal patterns like weekday-weekend distinctions.

Conclusion: Urban Vibrancy embeddings advance traffic prediction and provide deeper insights into urban mobility.

Abstract: Urban vibrancy reflects the dynamic human activity within urban spaces and is often measured using mobile data that captures floating population trends. This study proposes a novel approach to derive Urban Vibrancy embeddings from real-time floating population data to enhance traffic prediction models. Specifically, we utilize variational autoencoders (VAE) to compress this data into actionable embeddings, which are then integrated with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to predict future embeddings. These are subsequently applied in a sequence-to-sequence framework for traffic forecasting. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We use principal component analysis (PCA) to interpret the embeddings, revealing temporal patterns such as weekday versus weekend distinctions and seasonal patterns; (2) We propose a method that combines VAE and LSTM, enabling forecasting dynamic urban knowledge embedding; and (3) Our approach improves accuracy and responsiveness in traffic prediction models, including RNN, DCRNN, GTS, and GMAN. This study demonstrates the potential of Urban Vibrancy embeddings to advance traffic prediction and offer a more nuanced analysis of urban mobility.

TL;DR: AgentLTV is an agent-based framework automating LTV modeling using LLM-driven agents, MCTS for broad exploration, and EA for refinement, showing strong performance in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners face challenges in building scenario-specific LTV pipelines due to varying data patterns and high costs. AgentLTV aims to automate and unify this process.

Method: AgentLTV uses LLM-driven agents to generate and repair pipeline programs. It employs MCTS for broad exploration under budget constraints and EA for refining top candidates.

Result: Experiments on proprietary and public datasets demonstrate AgentLTV's effectiveness in discovering strong models, improving ranking consistency, and calibrating values.

Conclusion: AgentLTV successfully automates LTV modeling, with MCTS aiding rapid adaptation and EA ensuring stable refinement. It has been deployed online with practical takeaways for practitioners.

Abstract: Lifetime Value (LTV) prediction is critical in advertising, recommender systems, and e-commerce. In practice, LTV data patterns vary across decision scenarios. As a result, practitioners often build complex, scenario-specific pipelines and iterate over feature processing, objective design, and tuning. This process is expensive and hard to transfer. We propose AgentLTV, an agent-based unified search-and-evolution framework for automated LTV modeling. AgentLTV treats each candidate solution as an {executable pipeline program}. LLM-driven agents generate code, run and repair pipelines, and analyze execution feedback. Two decision agents coordinate a two-stage search. The Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) stage explores a broad space of modeling choices under a fixed budget, guided by the Polynomial Upper Confidence bounds for Trees criterion and a Pareto-aware multi-metric value function. The Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) stage refines the best MCTS program via island-based evolution with crossover, mutation, and migration. Experiments on a large-scale proprietary dataset and a public benchmark show that AgentLTV consistently discovers strong models across ranking and error metrics. Online bucket-level analysis further indicates improved ranking consistency and value calibration, especially for high-value and negative-LTV segments. We summarize practitioner-oriented takeaways: use MCTS for rapid adaptation to new data patterns, use EA for stable refinement, and validate deployment readiness with bucket-level ranking and calibration diagnostics. The proposed AgentLTV has been successfully deployed online.

Conclusion: AngelSlim bridges algorithm research and industrial deployment with versatile compression strategies.

Abstract: This technical report introduces AngelSlim, a comprehensive and versatile toolkit for large model compression developed by the Tencent Hunyuan team. By consolidating cutting-edge algorithms, including quantization, speculative decoding, token pruning, and distillation. AngelSlim provides a unified pipeline that streamlines the transition from model compression to industrial-scale deployment. To facilitate efficient acceleration, we integrate state-of-the-art FP8 and INT8 Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) algorithms alongside pioneering research in ultra-low-bit regimes, featuring HY-1.8B-int2 as the first industrially viable 2-bit large model. Beyond quantization, we propose a training-aligned speculative decoding framework compatible with multimodal architectures and modern inference engines, achieving 1.8x to 2.0x throughput gains without compromising output correctness. Furthermore, we develop a training-free sparse attention framework that reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) in long-context scenarios by decoupling sparse kernels from model architectures through a hybrid of static patterns and dynamic token selection. For multimodal models, AngelSlim incorporates specialized pruning strategies, namely IDPruner for optimizing vision tokens via Maximal Marginal Relevance and Samp for adaptive audio token merging and pruning. By integrating these compression strategies from low-level implementations, AngelSlim enables algorithm-focused research and tool-assisted deployment.

Motivation: Current MARL approaches are limited to either local or global perspectives, lacking integration of both for better coordination.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Lead Critic (HLC), a multi-hierarchy architecture inspired by natural team structures, combining high-level objectives with low-level execution.

Result: HLC outperforms single hierarchy baselines in cooperative, non-communicative, and partially observable MARL tasks, showing high sample efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: Integrating multiple hierarchies in MARL enhances performance and robustness, making HLC a promising approach for complex multi-agent tasks.

Abstract: Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) solves complex tasks that require coordination from multiple agents, but is often limited to either local (independent learning) or global (centralized learning) perspectives. In this paper, we introduce a novel sequential training scheme and MARL architecture, which learns from multiple perspectives on different hierarchy levels. We propose the Hierarchical Lead Critic (HLC) - inspired by natural emerging distributions in team structures, where following high-level objectives combines with low-level execution. HLC demonstrates that introducing multiple hierarchies, leveraging local and global perspectives, can lead to improved performance with high sample efficiency and robust policies. Experimental results conducted on cooperative, non-communicative, and partially observable MARL benchmarks demonstrate that HLC outperforms single hierarchy baselines and scales robustly with increasing amounts of agents and difficulty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GOPO is a novel alignment algorithm for large language models that leverages Hilbert space geometry to avoid exponential curvature issues, enforce sparsity, and maintain stable gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of traditional alignment methods, such as exponential curvature from Kullback-Leibler divergence and unstable gradients, by using Hilbert space geometry.

Method: GOPO lifts alignment into Hilbert space L2(pi_k), enforces orthogonality conditions, and projects to finite empirical subspaces via group sampling, resulting in a bounded Hilbert projection.

Result: Experiments show GOPO achieves competitive generalization, stable gradient dynamics, and entropy preservation, outperforming clipping-based methods.

Conclusion: GOPO provides a theoretically grounded and practical solution for alignment, ensuring robustness and efficiency in large language models.

Abstract: We present Group Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (GOPO), a new alignment algorithm for large language models derived from the geometry of Hilbert function spaces. Instead of optimizing on the probability simplex and inheriting the exponential curvature of Kullback-Leibler divergence, GOPO lifts alignment into the Hilbert space L2(pi_k) of square-integrable functions with respect to the reference policy. Within this space, the simplex constraint reduces to a linear orthogonality condition <v, 1> = 0, defining a codimension-one subspace H0. Minimizing distance to an unconstrained target u_star yields the work-dissipation functional J(v) = <g, v> - (mu / 2) ||v||^2, whose maximizer follows directly from the Hilbert projection theorem. Enforcing the boundary v >= -1 produces a bounded Hilbert projection that induces exact sparsity, assigning zero probability to catastrophically poor actions through a closed-form threshold. To connect this functional theory with practice, GOPO projects from infinite-dimensional L2(pi_k) to a finite empirical subspace induced by group sampling. Because group-normalized advantages sum to zero, the Lagrange multiplier enforcing probability conservation vanishes exactly, reducing the constrained projection to an unconstrained empirical loss. The resulting objective has constant Hessian curvature mu I, non-saturating linear gradients, and an intrinsic dead-zone mechanism without heuristic clipping. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that GOPO achieves competitive generalization while maintaining stable gradient dynamics and entropy preservation in regimes where clipping-based methods plateau.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how different optimization methods affect neural network performance and solution landscapes.

Method: Investigation using SGD and quasi-Newton methods, analyzed with tools like kernel PCA and FourierPathFinder.

Result: SGD solutions have lower barriers and smoother basins; quasi-Newton finds deeper, isolated minima but generalizes less.

Conclusion: Optimizer choice impacts solution topography and model robustness, with SGD favoring generalizability.

Abstract: Neural networks are trained by optimizing multi-dimensional sets of fitting parameters on non-convex loss landscapes. Low-loss regions of the landscapes correspond to the parameter sets that perform well on the training data. A key issue in machine learning is the performance of trained neural networks on previously unseen test data. Here, we investigate neural network training by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) - a non-convex global optimization algorithm which relies only on the gradient of the objective function. We contrast SGD solutions with those obtained via a non-stochastic quasi-Newton method, which utilizes curvature information to determine step direction and Golden Section Search to choose step size. We use several computational tools to investigate neural network parameters obtained by these two optimization methods, including kernel Principal Component Analysis and a novel, general-purpose algorithm for finding low-height paths between pairs of points on loss or energy landscapes, FourierPathFinder. We find that the choice of the optimizer profoundly affects the nature of the resulting solutions. SGD solutions tend to be separated by lower barriers than quasi-Newton solutions, even if both sets of solutions are regularized by early stopping to ensure adequate performance on test data. When allowed to fit extensively on the training data, quasi-Newton solutions occupy deeper minima on the loss landscapes that are not reached by SGD. These solutions are less generalizable to the test data however. Overall, SGD explores smooth basins of attraction, while quasi-Newton optimization is capable of finding deeper, more isolated minima that are more spread out in the parameter space. Our findings help understand both the topography of the loss landscapes and the fundamental role of landscape exploration strategies in creating robust, transferrable neural network models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Symbolic distillation replaces neural networks, or components thereof, with interpretable, closed-form mathematical expressions. This approach has shown promise in discovering physical laws and mathematical relationships directly from trained deep learning models, yet adoption remains limited due to the engineering barrier of integrating symbolic regression into deep learning workflows. We introduce SymTorch, a library that automates this distillation by wrapping neural network components, collecting their input-output behavior, and approximating them with human-readable equations via PySR. SymTorch handles the engineering challenges that have hindered adoption: GPU-CPU data transfer, input-output caching, model serialization, and seamless switching between neural and symbolic forward passes. We demonstrate SymTorch across diverse architectures including GNNs, PINNs and transformer models. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept for accelerating LLM inference by replacing MLP layers with symbolic surrogates, achieving an 8.3\% throughput improvement with moderate performance degradation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate and uncertainty-aware trajectory prediction remains a core challenge for autonomous driving, driven by complex multi-agent interactions, diverse scene contexts and the inherently stochastic nature of future motion. Diffusion-based generative models have recently shown strong potential for capturing multimodal futures, yet existing approaches such as cVMD suffer from slow sampling, limited exploitation of generative diversity and brittle scenario encodings.
  This work introduces cVMDx, an enhanced diffusion-based trajectory prediction framework that improves efficiency, robustness and multimodal predictive capability. Through DDIM sampling, cVMDx achieves up to a 100x reduction in inference time, enabling practical multi-sample generation for uncertainty estimation. A fitted Gaussian Mixture Model further provides tractable multimodal predictions from the generated trajectories. In addition, a CVQ-VAE variant is evaluated for scenario encoding. Experiments on the publicly available highD dataset show that cVMDx achieves higher accuracy and significantly improved efficiency over cVMD, enabling fully stochastic, multimodal trajectory prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tool-R0, a self-play RL framework for training general-purpose tool-calling agents without pre-existing data, achieving significant improvements over base models and supervised baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based agent training relies on controlled setups and human supervision, limiting open-ended evolution toward advanced systems. Tool-R0 addresses this by enabling self-evolving agents.

Method: Tool-R0 uses self-play RL to co-evolve a Generator and Solver from the same base LLM, with complementary rewards for proposing and solving tasks, respectively. No pre-existing data is needed.

Result: Tool-R0 achieves a 92.5% relative improvement over the base model and outperforms supervised baselines in tool-use benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of self-play RL for autonomous agent evolution, offering insights into co-evolution, curriculum dynamics, and scaling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming the foundation for autonomous agents that can use tools to solve complex tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a common approach for injecting such agentic capabilities, but typically under tightly controlled training setups. It often depends on carefully constructed task-solution pairs and substantial human supervision, which creates a fundamental obstacle to open-ended self-evolution toward superintelligent systems. In this paper, we propose Tool-R0 framework for training general purpose tool-calling agents from scratch with self-play RL, under a zero-data assumption. Initialized from the same base LLM, Tool-R0 co-evolves a Generator and a Solver with complementary rewards: one proposes targeted challenging tasks at the other's competence frontier and the other learns to solve them with real-world tool calls. This creates a self-evolving cycle that requires no pre-existing tasks or datasets. Evaluation on different tool-use benchmarks show that Tool-R0 yields 92.5 relative improvement over the base model and surpasses fully supervised tool-calling baselines under the same setting. Our work further provides empirical insights into self-play LLM agents by analyzing co-evolution, curriculum dynamics, and scaling behavior.

### [172] [Dynamic Symmetric Point Tracking: Tackling Non-ideal Reference in Analog In-memory Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21321)
*Quan Xiao,Jindan Li,Zhaoxian Wu,Tayfun Gokmen,Tianyi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of training analog in-memory computing (AIMC) devices due to non-ideal analog properties, specifically update asymmetry causing weight drift. It proposes a dynamic method to estimate the symmetric point (SP) during training and an enhanced variant using signal processing techniques, proving its efficacy experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of AIMC devices, particularly the systematic drift caused by update asymmetry, which complicates training and requires costly pre-calibration. Existing methods assume known SP and pre-calibrate it, but residual errors degrade accuracy. The paper aims to provide a dynamic solution.

Method: The paper presents a theoretical characterization of SP calibration's pulse complexity and estimation error. It introduces a dynamic SP estimation method that tracks SP during training, ensuring convergence, and develops an enhanced variant using chopping and filtering techniques from digital signal processing.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate the proposed method's efficiency and effectiveness, showing improved training accuracy by dynamically estimating and correcting SP bias without costly pre-calibration.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic SP estimation method mitigates the bias introduced by AIMC device asymmetry, offering a practical solution with theoretical guarantees and enhanced performance over traditional pre-calibration approaches.

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) performs computation directly within resistive crossbar arrays, offering an energy-efficient platform to scale large vision and language models. However, non-ideal analog device properties make the training on AIMC devices challenging. In particular, its update asymmetry can induce a systematic drift of weight updates towards a device-specific symmetric point (SP), which typically does not align with the optimum of the training objective. To mitigate this bias, most existing works assume the SP is known and pre-calibrate it to zero before training by setting the reference point as the SP. Nevertheless, calibrating AIMC devices requires costly pulse updates, and residual calibration error can directly degrade training accuracy. In this work, we present the first theoretical characterization of the pulse complexity of SP calibration and the resulting estimation error. We further propose a dynamic SP estimation method that tracks the SP during model training, and establishes its convergence guarantees. In addition, we develop an enhanced variant based on chopping and filtering techniques from digital signal processing. Numerical experiments demonstrate both the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An AI system is developed to fairly assess job-seekers' skills by mitigating biases from self-presentation styles, using synthetic data and equitable evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately comparing job-seekers with varying self-presentation styles (e.g., self-promotion vs. modesty) by eliminating biases inherent in self-reports.

Method: An interactive AI system is built for skill elicitation, leveraging synthetic data generated by an LLM to train the system. Equitability is enforced mathematically to minimize bias.

Result: The AI system provides fair and accurate skill evaluations while allowing individuals to express themselves naturally, applicable in scenarios like professional networking or company reorganizations.

Conclusion: The proposed AI-driven approach effectively reduces biases in skill assessment, offering a more equitable solution for evaluating individuals with diverse self-presentation styles.

Abstract: Individuals with similar qualifications and skills may vary in their demeanor, or outward manner: some tend toward self-promotion while others are modest to the point of omitting crucial information. Comparing the self-descriptions of equally qualified job-seekers with different self-presentation styles is therefore problematic.
  We build an interactive AI for skill elicitation that provides accurate determination of skills while simultaneously allowing individuals to speak in their own voice. Such a system can be deployed, for example, when a new user joins a professional networking platform, or when matching employees to needs during a company reorganization. To obtain sufficient training data, we train an LLM to act as synthetic humans.
  Elicitation mitigates endogenous bias arising from individuals' own self-reports. To address systematic model bias we enforce a mathematically rigorous notion of equitability ensuring that the covariance between self-presentation manner and skill evaluation error is small.

*Teodor Vanislavov Marinov,Mehryar Mohri,Princewill Okoroafor,Jon Schneider,Julian Zimmert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Opportunistic approachability is studied, aiming for stronger guarantees when adversaries limit their actions. Efficient algorithms achieving O(T^{-1/4}) and O(T^{-1/2}) rates are introduced, bypassing costly calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon existing algorithms for opportunistic approachability by eliminating the need for computationally expensive calibration subroutines.

Method: Develops efficient algorithms for opportunistic approachability, achieving sublinear rates without calibration. An optimal rate of O(T^{-1/2}) is shown for 2D cases.

Result: Efficient algorithm achieves O(T^{-1/4}), while an inefficient one achieves O(T^{-1/3}). For 2D, optimal O(T^{-1/2}) rate is proven.

Conclusion: Proposed algorithms outperform previous methods by avoiding calibration, with optimal rates achievable in low dimensions.

Abstract: We study the problem of opportunistic approachability: a generalization of Blackwell approachability where the learner would like to obtain stronger guarantees (i.e., approach a smaller set) when their adversary limits themselves to a subset of their possible action space. Bernstein et al. (2014) introduced this problem in 2014 and presented an algorithm that guarantees sublinear approachability rates for opportunistic approachability. However, this algorithm requires the ability to produce calibrated online predictions of the adversary's actions, a problem whose standard implementations require time exponential in the ambient dimension and result in approachability rates that scale as $T^{-O(1/d)}$. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for opportunistic approachability that achieves a rate of $O(T^{-1/4})$ (and an inefficient one that achieves a rate of $O(T^{-1/3})$), bypassing the need for an online calibration subroutine. Moreover, in the case where the dimension of the adversary's action set is at most two, we show it is possible to obtain the optimal rate of $O(T^{-1/2})$.

*Nikolaos Nakis,Chrysoula Kosma,Panagiotis Promponas,Michail Chatzianastasis,Giannis Nikolentzos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphHull is an explainable generative model using convex hulls for graph representation, offering multi-scale explanations and competitive performance in link prediction and community detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for self-explainable models in graph machine learning, emphasizing the importance of understanding prediction patterns.

Method: GraphHull uses a two-level convex hull approach: global archetypes for pure communities and local prototypical hulls for community-specific variation, with MAP estimation and priors like determinantal point processes.

Result: Experiments show GraphHull recovers multi-level community structure and performs competitively or better in link prediction and community detection.

Conclusion: GraphHull provides interpretable predictions with clear multi-scale explanations while maintaining competitive performance in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Representation learning has been essential for graph machine learning tasks such as link prediction, community detection, and network visualization. Despite recent advances in achieving high performance on these downstream tasks, little progress has been made toward self-explainable models. Understanding the patterns behind predictions is equally important, motivating recent interest in explainable machine learning. In this paper, we present GraphHull, an explainable generative model that represents networks using two levels of convex hulls. At the global level, the vertices of a convex hull are treated as archetypes, each corresponding to a pure community in the network. At the local level, each community is refined by a prototypical hull whose vertices act as representative profiles, capturing community-specific variation. This two-level construction yields clear multi-scale explanations: a node's position relative to global archetypes and its local prototypes directly accounts for its edges. The geometry is well-behaved by design, while local hulls are kept disjoint by construction. To further encourage diversity and stability, we place principled priors, including determinantal point processes, and fit the model under MAP estimation with scalable subsampling. Experiments on real networks demonstrate the ability of GraphHull to recover multi-level community structure and to achieve competitive or superior performance in link prediction and community detection, while naturally providing interpretable predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an entropy-adaptive, online model-merging method for medical imaging to handle unseen test-time distribution shifts without labels, outperforming mean averaging and other baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of unreliable model merging under unseen test-time distribution shifts in medical imaging, where models vary by clinic-specific factors like scanner, protocol, and population.

Method: Introduces an entropy-adaptive online model-merging method using forward passes, decouples encoder and classification head for merging with separate coefficients.

Result: Achieves consistent gains across nine datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while retaining single-model inference at test-time.

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages target information and mitigates encoder-classifier mismatch, demonstrating its practical utility in heterogeneous domain shifts.

Abstract: Model merging under unseen test-time distribution shifts often renders naive strategies, such as mean averaging unreliable. This challenge is especially acute in medical imaging, where models are fine-tuned locally at clinics on private data, producing domain-specific models that differ by scanner, protocol, and population. When deployed at an unseen clinical site, test cases arrive in unlabeled, non-i.i.d. batches, and the model must adapt immediately without labels. In this work, we introduce an entropy-adaptive, fully online model-merging method that yields a batch-specific merged model via only forward passes, effectively leveraging target information. We further demonstrate why mean merging is prone to failure and misaligned under heterogeneous domain shifts. Next, we mitigate encoder classifier mismatch by decoupling the encoder and classification head, merging with separate merging coefficients. We extensively evaluate our method with state-of-the-art baselines using two backbones across nine medical and natural-domain generalization image classification datasets, showing consistent gains across standard evaluation and challenging scenarios. These performance gains are achieved while retaining single-model inference at test-time, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: VCDF is a robust, method-agnostic framework for time series causal discovery that improves stability and accuracy without changing base algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for time series causal discovery are sensitive to noise, non-stationarity, and sampling variability, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: The VCDF framework evaluates the stability of causal relations across blocked temporal subsets, enhancing robustness without modifying base algorithms like VAR-LiNGAM and PCMCI.

Result: VCDF improves VAR-LiNGAM by 0.08-0.12 in F1 scores, with greater benefits for longer sequences (up to 0.18 improvement for lengths ≥1000). It also shows enhanced stability in fMRI and IT-monitoring scenarios.

Conclusion: VCDF provides a reliable layer for time series causal discovery, maintaining modeling assumptions while improving performance under diverse and noisy conditions.

Abstract: Time series causal discovery is essential for understanding dynamic systems, yet many existing methods remain sensitive to noise, non-stationarity, and sampling variability. We propose the Validated Consensus-Driven Framework (VCDF), a simple and method-agnostic layer that improves robustness by evaluating the stability of causal relations across blocked temporal subsets. VCDF requires no modification to base algorithms and can be applied to methods such as VAR-LiNGAM and PCMCI. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that VCDF improves VAR-LiNGAM by approximately 0.08-0.12 in both window and summary F1 scores across diverse data characteristics, with gains most pronounced for moderate-to-long sequences. The framework also benefits from longer sequences, yielding up to 0.18 absolute improvement on time series of length 1000 and above. Evaluations on simulated fMRI data and IT-monitoring scenarios further demonstrate enhanced stability and structural accuracy under realistic noise conditions. VCDF provides an effective reliability layer for time series causal discovery without altering underlying modeling assumptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of producing generative models that cannot be falsified by computational tests and observed data.

Method: Expands on RKHS-based multicalibration and variational inequalities for efficient algorithms, applied to outcome indistinguishability.

Result: Defensive Generation efficiently produces unfalsifiable models for non-Bernoulli outcomes, handles infinite test classes, and achieves optimal generation error rates.

Conclusion: The method advances online generative modeling by combining multicalibration and indistinguishability, offering efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently producing, in an online fashion, generative models of scalar, multiclass, and vector-valued outcomes that cannot be falsified on the basis of the observed data and a pre-specified collection of computational tests. Our contributions are twofold. First, we expand on connections between online high-dimensional multicalibration with respect to an RKHS and recent advances in expected variational inequality problems, enabling efficient algorithms for the former. We then apply this algorithmic machinery to the problem of outcome indistinguishability. Our procedure, Defensive Generation, is the first to efficiently produce online outcome indistinguishable generative models of non-Bernoulli outcomes that are unfalsifiable with respect to infinite classes of tests, including those that examine higher-order moments of the generated distributions. Furthermore, our method runs in near-linear time in the number of samples and achieves the optimal, vanishing T^{-1/2} rate for generation error.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedVG is a gradient-based federated aggregation framework that uses a global validation set to improve model generalization in heterogeneous FL settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address client drift caused by data heterogeneity in FL, where conventional methods overemphasize poorly performing clients.

Method: Leverages a global validation set to compute layerwise gradient norms, deriving client-specific scores for adaptive aggregation.

Result: Outperforms traditional FL methods, especially in heterogeneous settings, and integrates well with existing FL algorithms.

Conclusion: FedVG offers a modular, effective solution to improve generalization in FL without compromising privacy.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing their private data. However, data heterogeneity across clients leads to client drift, which degrades the overall generalization performance of the model. This effect is further compounded by overemphasis on poorly performing clients. To address this problem, we propose FedVG, a novel gradient-based federated aggregation framework that leverages a global validation set to guide the optimization process. Such a global validation set can be established using readily available public datasets, ensuring accessibility and consistency across clients without compromising privacy. In contrast to conventional approaches that prioritize client dataset volume, FedVG assesses the generalization ability of client models by measuring the magnitude of validation gradients across layers. Specifically, we compute layerwise gradient norms to derive a client-specific score that reflects how much each client needs to adjust for improved generalization on the global validation set, thereby enabling more informed and adaptive federated aggregation. Extensive experiments on both natural and medical image benchmarking datasets, across diverse model architectures, demonstrate that FedVG consistently improves performance, particularly in highly heterogeneous settings. Moreover, FedVG is modular and can be seamlessly integrated with various state-of-the-art FL algorithms, often further improving their results. Our code is available at https://github.com/alinadevkota/FedVG.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GBC via IQNs addresses GP limitations like cubic cost and stationarity, improving performance on benchmarks and scaling better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome GP surrogates' cubic cost, stationarity assumptions, and Gaussian predictive limitations.

Method: Uses IQNs to learn conditional quantile functions from input-output pairs, enabling predictive distribution draws via single forward passes.

Result: Outperforms GPs on benchmarks (11-26% CRPS improvement), scales linearly to 90k points, and excels in active learning.

Conclusion: GBC is superior for non-smooth or high-dimensional tasks, while GPs remain better for smooth surfaces.

Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) surrogates are the default tool for emulating expensive computer experiments, but cubic cost, stationarity assumptions, and Gaussian predictive distributions limit their reach. We propose Generative Bayesian Computation (GBC) via Implicit Quantile Networks (IQNs) as a surrogate framework that targets all three limitations. GBC learns the full conditional quantile function from input--output pairs; at test time, a single forward pass per quantile level produces draws from the predictive distribution.
  Across fourteen benchmarks we compare GBC to four GP-based methods. GBC improves CRPS by 11--26\% on piecewise jump-process benchmarks, by 14\% on a ten-dimensional Friedman function, and scales linearly to 90,000 training points where dense-covariance GPs are infeasible. A boundary-augmented variant matches or outperforms Modular Jump GPs on two-dimensional jump datasets (up to 46\% CRPS improvement). In active learning, a randomized-prior IQN ensemble achieves nearly three times lower RMSE than deep GP active learning on Rocket LGBB. Overall, GBC records a favorable point estimate in 12 of 14 comparisons. GPs retain an edge on smooth surfaces where their smoothness prior provides effective regularization.

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks five neural architectures for power grid forecasting, showing their performance varies with data inputs and tasks, guiding operators on model selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in selecting the right deep learning model for power grid forecasting due to varying performance based on available data.

Method: Five models (PowerMamba, S-Mamba, iTransformer, PatchTST, LSTM) are evaluated on hourly electricity demand across six US grids. Each model is adapted with temporal processing and weather integration.

Result: No single model outperforms all; PatchTST and state space models excel with historical load, while iTransformer improves with weather data. Rankings vary by task (solar, wind, price).

Conclusion: The benchmark offers actionable guidelines for grid operators to choose models based on their specific data and forecasting needs.

Abstract: Selecting the right deep learning model for power grid forecasting is challenging, as performance heavily depends on the data available to the operator. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of five modern neural architectures: two state space models (PowerMamba, S-Mamba), two Transformers (iTransformer, PatchTST), and a traditional LSTM. We evaluate these models on hourly electricity demand across six diverse US power grids for forecast windows between 24 and 168 hours. To ensure a fair comparison, we adapt each model with specialized temporal processing and a modular layer that cleanly integrates weather covariates. Our results reveal that there is no single best model for all situations. When forecasting using only historical load, PatchTST and the state space models provide the highest accuracy. However, when explicit weather data is added to the inputs, the rankings reverse: iTransformer improves its accuracy three times more efficiently than PatchTST. By controlling for model size, we confirm that this advantage stems from the architecture's inherent ability to mix information across different variables. Extending our evaluation to solar generation, wind power, and wholesale prices further demonstrates that model rankings depend on the forecast task: PatchTST excels on highly rhythmic signals like solar, while state space models are better suited for the chaotic fluctuations of wind and price. Ultimately, this benchmark provides grid operators with actionable guidelines for selecting the optimal forecasting architecture based on their specific data environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR improves reasoning in LLMs but reduces diversity. The paper proposes ACE, a method to penalize errors asymmetrically, enhancing both accuracy and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLVR algorithms improve accuracy but narrow reasoning boundaries and reduce generation diversity due to uniform error penalization.

Method: Introduces Asymmetric Confidence-aware Error Penalty (ACE), using a confidence shift metric to dynamically modulate negative advantages.

Result: ACE improves Pass@k performance across multiple models and benchmarks, maintaining accuracy while enhancing diversity.

Conclusion: ACE addresses the limitations of uniform error penalization, offering a robust solution for balancing accuracy and diversity in RLVR for LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become the leading paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard RLVR algorithms suffer from a well-documented pathology: while they improve Pass@1 accuracy through sharpened sampling, they simultaneously narrow the model's reasoning boundary and reduce generation diversity. We identify a root cause that existing methods overlook: the uniform penalization of errors. Current approaches -- whether data-filtering methods that select prompts by difficulty, or advantage normalization schemes -- treat all incorrect rollouts within a group identically. We show that this uniformity allows overconfident errors (incorrect reasoning paths that the RL process has spuriously reinforced) to persist and monopolize probability mass, ultimately suppressing valid exploratory trajectories. To address this, we propose the Asymmetric Confidence-aware Error Penalty (ACE). ACE introduces a per-rollout confidence shift metric, c_i = log(pi_theta(y_i|x) / pi_ref(y_i|x)), to dynamically modulate negative advantages. Theoretically, we demonstrate that ACE's gradient can be decomposed into the gradient of a selective regularizer restricted to overconfident errors, plus a well-characterized residual that partially moderates the regularizer's strength. We conduct extensive experiments fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen3-8B-Base, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the DAPO-Math-17K dataset using GRPO and DAPO within the VERL framework. Evaluated on MATH-500 and AIME 2025, ACE composes seamlessly with existing methods and consistently improves the full Pass@k spectrum across all three model families and benchmarks.

*Alexander Galozy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes behavioral dependency in RL agents under partial observability, introduces probe-relative equivalence and behavioral distance, and analyzes structural properties and experimental results related to policy transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how RL agents' actions depend on internal information under partial observability and to analyze the effects of policy transformations like convex aggregation and gradient ascent on behavioral separation.

Method: The study formalizes behavioral dependency, introduces probe-relative equivalence and behavioral distance, and provides theoretical structural results and minimal experimental setups (bandit and gridworld) to validate mechanisms.

Result: Key findings include non-closure of policies under convex aggregation, contraction of behavioral distance under convex combination, and conditions where gradient ascent decreases behavioral distance. Experiments confirm these mechanisms.

Conclusion: Behavioral separation conditioned on probes is not preserved under common policy transformations, as shown by structural and experimental evidence.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents under partial observability often condition actions on internally accumulated information such as memory or inferred latent context. We formalise such information-conditioned interaction patterns as behavioural dependency: variation in action selection with respect to internal information under fixed observations. This induces a probe-relative notion of $ε$-behavioural equivalence and a within-policy behavioural distance that quantifies probe sensitivity. We establish three structural results. First, the set of policies exhibiting non-trivial behavioural dependency is not closed under convex aggregation. Second, behavioural distance contracts under convex combination. Third, we prove a sufficient local condition under which gradient ascent on a skewed mixture objective decreases behavioural distance when a dominant-mode gradient aligns with the direction of steepest contraction. Minimal bandit and partially observable gridworld experiments provide controlled witnesses of these mechanisms. In the examined settings, behavioural distance decreases under convex aggregation and under continued optimisation with skewed latent priors, and in these experiments it precedes degradation under latent prior shift. These results identify structural conditions under which probe-conditioned behavioural separation is not preserved under common policy transformations.

Motivation: Bayesian inverse problems often face challenges in sampling from exact posteriors due to computational expense, prompting the need for efficient alternatives.

Method: The Proximal-IMH algorithm corrects samples from cheaper, biased approximate posteriors through an auxiliary optimization problem, balancing exact model adherence and stability.

Result: Proximal-IMH tightens the match between approximate and exact posteriors, enhancing acceptance rates and mixing, and outperforms other IMH variants in numerical tests.

Conclusion: Proximal-IMH is effective for Bayesian inverse problems, especially with expensive exact posteriors, offering improved performance over traditional IMH methods.

Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a posterior distribution arising in Bayesian inverse problems in science, engineering, and imaging. Our method belongs to the family of independence Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) sampling algorithms, which are common in Bayesian inference. Relying on the existence of an approximate posterior distribution that is cheaper to sample from but may have significant bias, we introduce Proximal-IMH, a scheme that removes this bias by correcting samples from the approximate posterior through an auxiliary optimization problem. This yields a local adjustment that trades off adherence to the exact model against stability around the approximate reference point. For idealized settings, we prove that the proximal correction tightens the match between approximate and exact posteriors, thereby improving acceptance rates and mixing. The method applies to both linear and nonlinear input-output operators and is particularly suitable for inverse problems where exact posterior sampling is too expensive. We present numerical experiments including multimodal and data-driven priors with nonlinear input-output operators. The results show that Proximal-IMH reliably outperforms existing IMH variants.

*Darshan Gadginmath,Ahmed Allibhoy,Fabio Pasqualetti*

TL;DR: A safety filtering framework for flow-based generative models ensures hard constraint satisfaction via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and convex Quadratic Programming (QP), maintaining semantic fidelity without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-based generative models lack formal guarantees for hard constraint satisfaction, limiting their deployment in safety-critical domains.

Method: The framework introduces a safety tube relaxed initially and tightened progressively, using CBFs and QP to enforce constraints minimally disruptively.

Result: Validated across tasks like constrained image generation and safe robotic policies, it achieved 100% constraint satisfaction while preserving model fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework guarantees safe sampling without modifying or retraining pre-trained models, bridging a critical gap for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models, such as diffusion models and flow matching models, have achieved remarkable success in learning complex data distributions. However, a critical gap remains for their deployment in safety-critical domains: the lack of formal guarantees that generated samples will satisfy hard constraints. We address this by proposing a safety filtering framework that acts as an online shield for any pre-trained generative model. Our key insight is to cooperate with the generative process rather than override it. We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program (QP) at each sampling step. As the tube is loosest when noise is high and intervention is cheapest in terms of control energy, most constraint enforcement occurs when it least disrupts the model's learned structure. We prove that this mechanism guarantees safe sampling while minimizing the distributional shift from the original model at each sampling step, as quantified by the KL divergence. Our framework applies to any pre-trained flow-based generative scheme requiring no retraining or architectural modifications. We validate the approach across constrained image generation, physically-consistent trajectory sampling, and safe robotic manipulation policies, achieving 100% constraint satisfaction while preserving semantic fidelity.

*Shiwei Tan,Hengyi Wang,Weiyi Qin,Qi Xu,Zhigang Hua,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A causal decoding framework reduces object hallucination in MLLMs while maintaining output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for addressing object hallucination in MLLMs are heuristic and ineffective, limiting reliability.

Method: Proposes a causal decoding framework that intervenes during generation to reduce false object mentions.

Result: Lowers hallucination rates significantly and achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness without degrading quality.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses hallucination by reshaping decoding dynamics.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) deliver detailed responses on vision-language tasks, yet remain susceptible to object hallucination (introducing objects not present in the image), undermining reliability in practice. Prior efforts often rely on heuristic penalties, post-hoc correction, or generic decoding tweaks, which do not directly intervene in the mechanisms that trigger object hallucination and thus yield limited gains. To address this challenge, we propose a causal decoding framework that applies targeted causal interventions during generation to curb spurious object mentions. By reshaping the decoding dynamics to attenuate spurious dependencies, our approach reduces false object tokens while maintaining descriptive quality. Across captioning and QA benchmarks, our framework substantially lowers object-hallucination rates and achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness without degrading overall output quality.

TL;DR: MINAR is a toolbox combining mechanistic interpretability with neural algorithmic reasoning to discover circuits in GNNs trained on algorithmic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between mechanistic interpretability and neural algorithmic reasoning by developing a method to uncover neuron-level circuits in GNNs.

Method: Adapts attribution patching from mechanistic interpretability to GNNs, introduced as MINAR toolbox.

Result: MINAR successfully identifies faithful neuron-level circuits in GNNs and provides insights into circuit formation and multitask reuse.

Conclusion: MINAR offers a novel approach to understanding GNN behavior in algorithmic tasks, revealing circuit dynamics and multitask efficiency.

Abstract: The recent field of neural algorithmic reasoning (NAR) studies the ability of graph neural networks (GNNs) to emulate classical algorithms like Bellman-Ford, a phenomenon known as algorithmic alignment. At the same time, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spawned the study of mechanistic interpretability, which aims to identify granular model components like circuits that perform specific computations. In this work, we introduce Mechanistic Interpretability for Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (MINAR), an efficient circuit discovery toolbox that adapts attribution patching methods from mechanistic interpretability to the GNN setting. We show through two case studies that MINAR recovers faithful neuron-level circuits from GNNs trained on algorithmic tasks. Our study sheds new light on the process of circuit formation and pruning during training, as well as giving new insight into how GNNs trained to perform multiple tasks in parallel reuse circuit components for related tasks.

### [188] [When Learning Hurts: Fixed-Pole RNN for Real-Time Online Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21454)
*Alexander Morgan,Ummay Sumaya Khan,Lingjia Liu,Lizhong Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores why learning recurrent poles in RNNs is impractical in data-constrained scenarios, showing fixed-pole architectures like ESNs perform better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why optimizing recurrent poles in RNNs is computationally heavy and often ineffective compared to fixed-pole methods.

Method: Analytical and empirical examination of recurrent pole learning vs. fixed-pole architectures, focusing on non-convexity and gradient descent challenges.

Result: Fixed-pole networks like ESNs outperform pole-learning RNNs in stability and efficiency, especially with limited data.

Conclusion: Fixed-pole architectures are more suitable for real-time tasks due to better performance and lower computational complexity.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be interpreted as discrete-time state-space models, where the state evolution corresponds to an infinite-impulse-response (IIR) filtering operation governed by both feedforward weights and recurrent poles. While, in principle, all parameters including pole locations can be optimized via backpropagation through time (BPTT), such joint learning incurs substantial computational overhead and is often impractical for applications with limited training data. Echo state networks (ESNs) mitigate this limitation by fixing the recurrent dynamics and training only a linear readout, enabling efficient and stable online adaptation. In this work, we analytically and empirically examine why learning recurrent poles does not provide tangible benefits in data-constrained, real-time learning scenarios. Our analysis shows that pole learning renders the weight optimization problem highly non-convex, requiring significantly more training samples and iterations for gradient-based methods to converge to meaningful solutions. Empirically, we observe that for complex-valued data, gradient descent frequently exhibits prolonged plateaus, and advanced optimizers offer limited improvement. In contrast, fixed-pole architectures induce stable and well-conditioned state representations even with limited training data. Numerical results demonstrate that fixed-pole networks achieve superior performance with lower training complexity, making them more suitable for online real-time tasks.

*Alan F. Karr,Regina Ruane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how classifier performance deteriorates with degraded training data quality, focusing on four classifiers in metagenomic assembly, revealing breakdown-like behavior and spatial heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the often-overlooked impact of training data quality on classifier performance, especially in metagenomics.

Method: Numerical experiments degrading training data quality for four classifiers (Bayes, neural nets, partition models, random forests), analyzing individual and collective behavior.

Result: All classifiers exhibit breakdown-like behavior as data quality degrades, becoming wrong similarly. Spatial heterogeneity emerges, with decisions degenerating and congruence increasing.

Conclusion: Training data quality critically affects classifier performance, with degradation leading to consistent failure patterns across classifiers.

Abstract: We describe extensive numerical experiments assessing and quantifying how classifier performance depends on the quality of the training data, a frequently neglected component of the analysis of classifiers.
  More specifically, in the scientific context of metagenomic assembly of short DNA reads into "contigs," we examine the effects of degrading the quality of the training data by multiple mechanisms, and for four classifiers -- Bayes classifiers, neural nets, partition models and random forests. We investigate both individual behavior and congruence among the classifiers. We find breakdown-like behavior that holds for all four classifiers, as degradation increases and they move from being mostly correct to only coincidentally correct, because they are wrong in the same way. In the process, a picture of spatial heterogeneity emerges: as the training data move farther from analysis data, classifier decisions degenerate, the boundary becomes less dense, and congruence increases.

*YuQing Xie,Ameya Daigavane,Mit Kotak,Tess Smidt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a complete algorithm for Clebsch-Gordan tensor products (CGTP) with improved runtime complexity, addressing limitations of prior methods like the Gaunt tensor product.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for accelerating tensor products in $E(3)$-equivariant neural networks sacrifice expressivity or miss interactions. This work aims for a true asymptotic speedup without these drawbacks.

Method: The authors generalize fast Fourier-based convolution to handle tensor spherical harmonics, prove a generalized Gaunt formula, and extend the approach to vector-valued signals to capture missing interactions.

Result: The proposed algorithm reduces runtime complexity from $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^4\log^2 L)$, close to the theoretical lower bound of $O(L^4)$.

Conclusion: This work provides the first complete and efficient solution for CGTP, enabling scalable and expressive $E(3)$-equivariant neural networks.

Abstract: $E(3)$-equivariant neural networks have proven to be effective in a wide range of 3D modeling tasks. A fundamental operation of such networks is the tensor product, which allows interaction between different feature types. Because this operation scales poorly, there has been considerable work towards accelerating this interaction. However, recently \citet{xieprice} have pointed out that most speedups come from a reduction in expressivity rather than true algorithmic improvements on computing Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. A modification of Gaunt tensor product \citep{gaunt} can give a true asymptotic speedup but is incomplete and misses many interactions. In this work, we provide the first complete algorithm which truly provides asymptotic benefits Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. For full CGTP, our algorithm brings runtime complexity from the naive $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^4\log^2 L)$, close to the lower bound of $O(L^4)$. We first show how generalizing fast Fourier based convolution naturally leads to the previously proposed Gaunt tensor product \citep{gaunt}. To remedy antisymmetry issues, we generalize from scalar signals to irrep valued signals, giving us tensor spherical harmonics. We prove a generalized Gaunt formula for the tensor harmonics. Finally, we show that we only need up to vector valued signals to recover the missing interactions of Gaunt tensor product.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of unstructured neural networks in world models, such as poor interpretability, low sample efficiency, and limited generalization, the authors propose a structured approach inspired by VSA and geometric priors.

Method: The approach uses learnable FHRR encoders to map states and actions into a high-dimensional complex vector space, modeling transitions with element-wise complex multiplication. The framework is grounded in group theory, emphasizing approximate invariance for better generalization.

Result: The model achieves 87.5% zero-shot accuracy on unseen state-action pairs, 53.6% higher accuracy on 20-timestep rollouts, and 4x higher robustness to noise compared to an MLP baseline in a discrete grid world environment.

Conclusion: The structured approach yields generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable world models, offering a principled pathway for real-world planning and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: A key challenge in artificial intelligence and neuroscience is understanding how neural systems learn representations that capture the underlying dynamics of the world. Most world models represent the transition function with unstructured neural networks, limiting interpretability, sample efficiency, and generalization to unseen states or action compositions. We address these issues with a generalizable world model grounded in Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) principles as geometric priors. Our approach utilizes learnable Fourier Holographic Reduced Representation (FHRR) encoders to map states and actions into a high dimensional complex vector space with learned group structure and models transitions with element-wise complex multiplication. We formalize the framework's group theoretic foundation and show how training such structured representations to be approximately invariant enables strong multi-step composition directly in latent space and generalization performances over various experiments. On a discrete grid world environment, our model achieves 87.5% zero shot accuracy to unseen state-action pairs, obtains 53.6% higher accuracy on 20-timestep horizon rollouts, and demonstrates 4x higher robustness to noise relative to an MLP baseline. These results highlight how training to have latent group structure yields generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable world models, providing a principled pathway toward structured models for real-world planning and reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper explores training-free conditional generation for scientific inverse problems using Flow Matching (FM) priors, introducing D-Flow SGLD for scalable posterior sampling without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for uncertainty-aware posterior samples in high-dimensional scientific inverse problems, leveraging FM priors where traditional methods are under-explored.

Method: Analyzes two inference-time strategies: guided transport dynamics and source-distribution inference, proposing D-Flow SGLD for scalable source-space posterior sampling.

Result: Benchmarks on 2D toy posteriors, chaotic trajectories, and turbulence reconstruction show D-Flow SGLD as practical, balancing measurement assimilation, posterior diversity, and fidelity.

Conclusion: D-Flow SGLD effectively samples posteriors for scientific inverse problems without modifying FM dynamics, offering a practical solution.

Abstract: Data assimilation and scientific inverse problems require reconstructing high-dimensional physical states from sparse and noisy observations, ideally with uncertainty-aware posterior samples that remain faithful to learned priors and governing physics. While training-free conditional generation is well developed for diffusion models, corresponding conditioning and posterior sampling strategies for Flow Matching (FM) priors remain comparatively under-explored, especially on scientific benchmarks where fidelity must be assessed beyond measurement misfit. In this work, we study training-free conditional generation for scientific inverse problems under FM priors and organize existing inference-time strategies by where measurement information is injected: (i) guided transport dynamics that perturb sampling trajectories using likelihood information, and (ii) source-distribution inference that performs posterior inference over the source variable while keeping the learned transport fixed. Building on the latter, we propose D-Flow SGLD, a source-space posterior sampling method that augments differentiable source inference with preconditioned stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, enabling scalable exploration of the source posterior induced by new measurement operators without retraining the prior or modifying the learned FM dynamics. We benchmark representative methods from both families on a hierarchy of problems: 2D toy posteriors, chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky trajectories, and wall-bounded turbulence reconstruction. Across these settings, we quantify trade-offs among measurement assimilation, posterior diversity, and physics/statistics fidelity, and establish D-Flow SGLD as a practical FM-compatible posterior sampler for scientific inverse problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend diffusion models beyond unimodal or bimodal generation by introducing a tri-modal approach and systematically studying scaling laws and optimizations.

Method: The authors pretrain a tri-modal masked diffusion model from scratch, focusing on scaling laws, modality mixing ratios, noise schedules, and batch-size effects. They introduce an SDE-based reparameterization to optimize batch size.

Result: The model achieves strong results in text generation, text-to-image, and text-to-speech tasks, showcasing scalability and performance across modalities.

Conclusion: This study advances multimodal diffusion models by providing insights into scaling behaviors and demonstrating the effectiveness of a unified tri-modal design.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as strong alternatives to autoregressive language models, with recent work initializing and fine-tuning a base unimodal model for bimodal generation. Diverging from previous approaches, we introduce the first tri-modal masked diffusion model pretrained from scratch on text, image-text, and audio-text data. We systematically analyze multimodal scaling laws, modality mixing ratios, noise schedules, and batch-size effects, and we provide optimized inference sampling defaults. Our batch-size analysis yields a novel stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based reparameterization that eliminates the need for tuning the optimal batch size as reported in recent work. This reparameterization decouples the physical batch size, often chosen based on compute constraints (GPU saturation, FLOP efficiency, wall-clock time), from the logical batch size, chosen to balance gradient variance during stochastic optimization. Finally, we pretrain a preliminary 3B-parameter tri-modal model on 6.4T tokens, demonstrating the capabilities of a unified design and achieving strong results in text generation, text-to-image tasks, and text-to-speech tasks. Our work represents the largest-scale systematic open study of multimodal discrete diffusion models conducted to date, providing insights into scaling behaviors across multiple modalities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradAlign is a gradient-aligned data selection method for LLM reinforcement learning, outperforming baselines by prioritizing training problems with aligned policy and validation gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning for LLMs is sensitive to training problem quality, often relying on manual curation or heuristic filters, which can be suboptimal.

Method: GradAlign uses a small validation set to prioritize training problems whose gradients align with validation gradients, creating an adaptive curriculum.

Result: GradAlign outperforms baselines in unreliable reward signals, distribution imbalance, and low-utility training scenarios, improving stability and performance.

Conclusion: Directional gradient signals are crucial for non-stationary policy optimization, with GradAlign proving effective in challenging data regimes.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central post-training paradigm for large language models (LLMs), but its performance is highly sensitive to the quality of training problems. This sensitivity stems from the non-stationarity of RL: rollouts are generated by an evolving policy, and learning is shaped by exploration and reward feedback, unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with fixed trajectories. As a result, prior work often relies on manual curation or simple heuristic filters (e.g., accuracy), which can admit incorrect or low-utility problems. We propose GradAlign, a gradient-aligned data selection method for LLM reinforcement learning that uses a small, trusted validation set to prioritize training problems whose policy gradients align with validation gradients, yielding an adaptive curriculum. We evaluate GradAlign across three challenging data regimes: unreliable reward signals, distribution imbalance, and low-utility training corpus, showing that GradAlign consistently outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the importance of directional gradient signals in navigating non-stationary policy optimization and yielding more stable training and improved final performance. We release our implementation at https://github.com/StigLidu/GradAlign

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReIMTS is a recursive multi-scale modeling approach for Irregular Multivariate Time Series forecasting that preserves original timestamps and captures global-to-local dependencies without resampling, achieving a 27.1% performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-scale IMTS methods often alter timestamps through resampling, disrupting valuable sampling pattern information. ReIMTS aims to address this by preserving timestamps and leveraging their irregularity for better dependency learning.

Method: ReIMTS recursively splits samples into subsamples with shorter time periods, maintaining original timestamps. It uses an irregularity-aware representation fusion mechanism to capture global-to-local dependencies.

Result: Experiments show ReIMTS improves forecasting performance by an average of 27.1% across models and datasets.

Conclusion: ReIMTS effectively preserves sampling patterns and captures multi-scale dependencies, outperforming existing methods in IMTS forecasting.

Abstract: Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) are characterized by uneven intervals between consecutive timestamps, which carry sampling pattern information valuable and informative for learning temporal and variable dependencies. In addition, IMTS often exhibit diverse dependencies across multiple time scales. However, many existing multi-scale IMTS methods use resampling to obtain the coarse series, which can alter the original timestamps and disrupt the sampling pattern information. To address the challenge, we propose ReIMTS, a Recursive multi-scale modeling approach for Irregular Multivariate Time Series forecasting. Instead of resampling, ReIMTS keeps timestamps unchanged and recursively splits each sample into subsamples with progressively shorter time periods. Based on the original sampling timestamps in these long-to-short subsamples, an irregularity-aware representation fusion mechanism is proposed to capture global-to-local dependencies for accurate forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate an average performance improvement of 27.1\% in the forecasting task across different models and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WaterVIB, a robust watermarking framework using Variational Information Bottleneck to protect against regeneration-based attacks by focusing on minimal sufficient statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods are vulnerable to regeneration-based AIGC attacks because they rely on high-frequency cover textures, which are easily rewritten.

Method: WaterVIB reformulates the encoder as an information sieve using Variational Information Bottleneck, filtering out redundant cover nuances and retaining essential signals.

Result: WaterVIB outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior zero-shot resilience against diffusion-based editing.

Conclusion: Optimizing the Variational Information Bottleneck is proven essential for robustness, making WaterVIB highly effective against generative purification attacks.

Abstract: Robust watermarking is critical for intellectual property protection, whereas existing methods face a severe vulnerability against regeneration-based AIGC attacks. We identify that existing methods fail because they entangle the watermark with high-frequency cover texture, which is susceptible to being rewritten during generative purification. To address this, we propose WaterVIB, a theoretically grounded framework that reformulates the encoder as an information sieve via the Variational Information Bottleneck. Instead of overfitting to fragile cover details, our approach forces the model to learn a Minimal Sufficient Statistic of the message. This effectively filters out redundant cover nuances prone to generative shifts, retaining only the essential signal invariant to regeneration. We theoretically prove that optimizing this bottleneck is a necessary condition for robustness against distribution-shifting attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WaterVIB significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior zero-shot resilience against unknown diffusion-based editing.

Conclusion: Muon+ is a practical enhancement to Muon, offering improved performance in pre-training large language models, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has demonstrated promising performance in pre-training large language models through gradient (or momentum) orthogonalization. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective enhancement to Muon, namely Muon+, which introduces an additional normalization step after orthogonalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gene expression prediction improves by focusing on proximal epigenomic signals rather than extending sequence length, mitigated via Prism framework integrating multimodal signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with long sequences and overlook integrating proximal epigenomic signals, which are crucial for accurate gene expression prediction.

Method: Propose Prism, learning combinations of epigenomic features to represent chromatin states and using backdoor adjustment to reduce confounding effects.

Result: Properly modeling multimodal epigenomic signals achieves state-of-the-art performance with short sequences.

Conclusion: Focusing on proximal epigenomic signals and mitigating confounding via Prism enhances gene expression prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Gene expression prediction, which predicts mRNA expression levels from DNA sequences, presents significant challenges. Previous works often focus on extending input sequence length to locate distal enhancers, which may influence target genes from hundreds of kilobases away. Our work first reveals that for current models, long sequence modeling can decrease performance. Even carefully designed algorithms only mitigate the performance degradation caused by long sequences. Instead, we find that proximal multimodal epigenomic signals near target genes prove more essential. Hence we focus on how to better integrate these signals, which has been overlooked. We find that different signal types serve distinct biological roles, with some directly marking active regulatory elements while others reflect background chromatin patterns that may introduce confounding effects. Simple concatenation may lead models to develop spurious associations with these background patterns. To address this challenge, we propose Prism, a framework that learns multiple combinations of high-dimensional epigenomic features to represent distinct background chromatin states and uses backdoor adjustment to mitigate confounding effects. Our experimental results demonstrate that proper modeling of multimodal epigenomic signals achieves state-of-the-art performance using only short sequences for gene expression prediction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural operators and Transformer-based models for fluid dynamics lack interpretability, struggle with high-frequency structures, and have high computational costs.

Method: The method represents fields with Gaussian bases (centers, scales, weights) and introduces a Gaussian Particle Operator for modal space actions, enabling efficient cross-scale coupling.

Result: The approach achieves near-linear complexity, supports irregular geometries, and attains competitive accuracy on PDE benchmarks and real datasets.

Conclusion: The Gaussian Particle Operator offers interpretable, efficient, and scalable fluid dynamics modeling with state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics for fluids increasingly relies on neural operators and Transformer-based models, yet these approaches often lack interpretability and struggle with localized, high-frequency structures while incurring quadratic cost in spatial samples. We propose representing fields with a Gaussian basis, where learned atoms carry explicit geometry (centers, anisotropic scales, weights) and form a compact, mesh-agnostic, directly visualizable state. Building on this representation, we introduce a Gaussian Particle Operator that acts in modal space: learned Gaussian modal windows perform a Petrov-Galerkin measurement, and PG Gaussian Attention enables global cross-scale coupling. This basis-to-basis design is resolution-agnostic and achieves near-linear complexity in N for a fixed modal budget, supporting irregular geometries and seamless 2D-to-3D extension. On standard PDE benchmarks and real datasets, our method attains state-of-the-art competitive accuracy while providing intrinsic interpretability.

Result: The method achieves comparable performance to retraining-based baselines on synthetic and real-world tasks (e.g., molecule generation).

Conclusion: The framework offers efficient, flexible adaptation for multi-objective GFlowNets, broadening their practical applicability.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) learn to sample diverse candidates in proportion to a reward function, making them well-suited for scientific discovery, where exploring multiple promising solutions is crucial. Further extending GFlowNets to multi-objective settings has attracted growing interest since real-world applications often involve multiple, conflicting objectives. However, existing approaches require additional training for each set of objectives, limiting their applicability and incurring substantial computational overhead. We propose a training-free mixing policy that composes pre-trained GFlowNets at inference time, enabling rapid adaptation without finetuning or retraining. Importantly, our framework is flexible, capable of handling diverse reward combinations ranging from linear scalarization to complex non-linear logical operators, which are often handled separately in previous literature. We prove that our method exactly recovers the target distribution for linear scalarization and quantify the approximation quality for nonlinear operators through a distortion factor. Experiments on a synthetic 2D grid and real-world molecule-generation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to baselines that require additional training.

### [201] [Duel-Evolve: Reward-Free Test-Time Scaling via LLM Self-Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21585)
*Sweta Karlekar,Carolina Zheng,Magnus Saebo,Nicolas Beltran-Velez,Shuyang Yu,John Bowlan,Michal Kucer,David Blei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Duel-Evolve is an evolutionary algorithm using LLM-generated pairwise preferences for optimization, outperforming existing methods without needing external rewards or labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing LLM outputs often requires scalar evaluators, which are unreliable or unavailable; pairwise comparisons offer a viable alternative.

Method: Duel-Evolve uses Bayesian Bradley-Terry modeling and Double Thompson Sampling to aggregate and guide comparisons for evolutionary optimization.

Result: Achieves 20% higher accuracy on MathBench and 12% improvement on LiveCodeBench over baselines.

Conclusion: Pairwise self-preferences effectively guide optimization in large discrete output spaces without external supervision.

Abstract: Many applications seek to optimize LLM outputs at test time by iteratively proposing, scoring, and refining candidates over a discrete output space. Existing methods use a calibrated scalar evaluator for the target objective to guide search, but for many tasks such scores are unavailable, too sparse, or unreliable. Pairwise comparisons, by contrast, are often easier to elicit, still provide useful signal on improvement directions, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision. Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates. We evaluate Duel-Evolve on MathBench, where it achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines, and on LiveCodeBench, where it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points. Notably, the method requires no reward model, no ground-truth labels during search, and no hand-crafted scoring function. Results show that pairwise self-preferences provide strong optimization signal for test-time improvement over large, discrete output spaces.

*Sharv Murgai,Utkarsh Utkarsh,Kyle C. Nguyen,Alan Edelman,Erin C. S. Acquesta,Christopher Vincent Rackauckas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ABM surrogates using UDEs improve speed and accuracy for epidemic modeling, enabling faster planning with calibrated uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between slow agent-based epidemic models (ABMs) and fast nightly hospital planning needs.

Method: Developed county-ready surrogates using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), incorporating neural-parameterized contact rates and stabilizing techniques like multiple shooting and PEM.

Result: PEM-UDE reduced mean MSE by 77% vs. single-shooting UDE and improved reliability with calibrated uncertainty. Inference runs in seconds on commodity CPUs.

Conclusion: UDEs provide fast, accurate, and interpretable surrogates for ABMs, useful for epidemic and other scientific modeling.

Abstract: Agent-based epidemic models (ABMs) encode behavioral and policy heterogeneity but are too slow for nightly hospital planning. We develop county-ready surrogates that learn directly from exascale ABM trajectories using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs): mechanistic SEIR-family ODEs with a neural-parameterized contact rate $κ_φ(u,t)$ (no additive residual). Our contributions are threefold: we adapt multiple shooting and an observer-based prediction-error method (PEM) to stabilize identification of neural-augmented epidemiological dynamics across intervention-driven regime shifts; we enforce positivity and mass conservation and show the learned contact-rate parameterization yields a well-posed vector field; and we quantify accuracy, calibration, and compute against ABM ensembles and UDE baselines. On a representative ExaEpi scenario, PEM-UDE reduces mean MSE by 77% relative to single-shooting UDE (3.00 vs. 13.14) and by 20% relative to MS-UDE (3.75). Reliability improves in parallel: empirical coverage of ABM $10$-$90$% and $25$-$75$% bands rises from 0.68/0.43 (UDE) and 0.79/0.55 (MS-UDE) to 0.86/0.61 with PEM-UDE and 0.94/0.69 with MS+PEM-UDE, indicating calibrated uncertainty rather than overconfident fits. Inference runs in seconds on commodity CPUs (20-35 s per $\sim$90-day forecast), enabling nightly ''what-if'' sweeps on a laptop. Relative to a $\sim$100 CPU-hour ABM reference run, this yields $\sim10^{4}\times$ lower wall-clock per scenario. This closes the realism-cadence gap, supports threshold-aware decision-making (e.g., maintaining ICU occupancy $<75$%), preserves mechanistic interpretability, and enables calibrated, risk-aware scenario planning on standard institutional hardware. Beyond epidemics, the ABM$\to$UDE recipe provides a portable path to distill agent-based simulators into fast, trustworthy surrogates for other scientific domains.

### [203] [Breaking Semantic-Aware Watermarks via LLM-Guided Coherence-Preserving Semantic Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21593)
*Zheng Gao,Xiaoyu Li,Zhicheng Bao,Xiaoyan Feng,Jiaojiao Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights a vulnerability in semantic watermarking schemes for generative images, where LLMs can bypass protections by manipulating semantics while preserving coherence. A new attack (CSI) exploits this, outperforming existing methods and exposing security flaws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of semantic watermarking schemes to LLM-driven semantic manipulation, which can bypass current protections while maintaining image coherence.

Method: Introduces the Coherence-Preserving Semantic Injection (CSI) attack, using LLM-guided semantic manipulation under similarity constraints to selectively alter watermark-relevant semantics.

Result: CSI consistently outperforms existing attack baselines, demonstrating the security weakness of current semantic watermarking designs against LLM-driven perturbations.

Conclusion: The study reveals a critical flaw in semantic watermarking, showing that LLMs can undermine protections by exploiting semantic coherence. This calls for improved security measures.

Abstract: Generative images have proliferated on Web platforms in social media and online copyright distribution scenarios, and semantic watermarking has increasingly been integrated into diffusion models to support reliable provenance tracking and forgery prevention for web content. Traditional noise-layer-based watermarking, however, remains vulnerable to inversion attacks that can recover embedded signals. To mitigate this, recent content-aware semantic watermarking schemes bind watermark signals to high-level image semantics, constraining local edits that would otherwise disrupt global coherence. Yet, large language models (LLMs) possess structured reasoning capabilities that enable targeted exploration of semantic spaces, allowing locally fine-grained but globally coherent semantic alterations that invalidate such bindings. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we introduce a Coherence-Preserving Semantic Injection (CSI) attack that leverages LLM-guided semantic manipulation under embedding-space similarity constraints. This alignment enforces visual-semantic consistency while selectively perturbing watermark-relevant semantics, ultimately inducing detector misclassification. Extensive empirical results show that CSI consistently outperforms prevailing attack baselines against content-aware semantic watermarking, revealing a fundamental security weakness of current semantic watermark designs when confronted with LLM-driven semantic perturbations.

*Zhongwei Xie,Jiaxin Bai,Shujie Liu,Haoyu Huang,Yufei Li,Yisen Gao,Hong Ting Tsang,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NGDB-Zoo improves neural graph databases by enabling operator-level training and semantic augmentation, boosting throughput and GPU utilization while handling hybrid reasoning efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural graph databases suffer from inefficiencies due to rigid query-level batching and lack of semantic integration, limiting their performance and expressivity.

Method: NGDB-Zoo introduces operator-level training and dynamic scheduling for data-flow execution, along with integrating semantic priors from pre-trained text encoders without I/O or memory issues.

Result: The framework achieves 1.8× to 6.8× higher throughput than baselines and maintains high GPU utilization across benchmarks like ogbl-wikikg2 and ATLAS-Wiki.

Conclusion: NGDB-Zoo resolves training and expressivity bottlenecks in neural graph databases, enhancing performance and hybrid reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Neural Graph Databases (NGDBs) facilitate complex logical reasoning over incomplete knowledge structures, yet their training efficiency and expressivity are constrained by rigid query-level batching and structure-exclusive embeddings. We present NGDB-Zoo, a unified framework that resolves these bottlenecks by synergizing operator-level training with semantic augmentation. By decoupling logical operators from query topologies, NGDB-Zoo transforms the training loop into a dynamically scheduled data-flow execution, enabling multi-stream parallelism and achieving a $1.8\times$ - $6.8\times$ throughput compared to baselines. Furthermore, we formalize a decoupled architecture to integrate high-dimensional semantic priors from Pre-trained Text Encoders (PTEs) without triggering I/O stalls or memory overflows. Extensive evaluations on six benchmarks, including massive graphs like ogbl-wikikg2 and ATLAS-Wiki, demonstrate that NGDB-Zoo maintains high GPU utilization across diverse logical patterns and significantly mitigates representation friction in hybrid neuro-symbolic reasoning.

*Kart Leong Lim,Ji Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a boundary-decoder (BD) net combined with deep clustering to model stress in 3D heterogeneous IC packages under thermal cycling, outperforming baseline methods in error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High stress at material interfaces in 3D IC packages under extreme temperatures necessitates accurate modeling. Traditional deep generative models (DGMs) lack supervised training, prompting the use of boundary conditions for better stress prediction.

Method: A boundary-decoder (BD) net maps material parameters to a latent space shared with stress images, enhanced by deep clustering to address dimensionality issues. This is tested on a simulated dataset of 1825 stress images.

Result: The proposed BD net with deep clustering achieves lower train and test errors compared to baseline methods and BD net variants.

Conclusion: The combined BD net and deep clustering approach effectively models stress in IC packages, offering improved accuracy over existing methods.

Abstract: High stress occurs when 3D heterogeneous IC packages are subjected to thermal cycling at extreme temperatures. Stress mainly occurs at the interface between different materials. We investigate stress image using latent space representation which is based on using deep generative model (DGM). However, most DGM approaches are unsupervised, meaning they resort to image pairing (input and output) to train DGM. Instead, we rely on a recent boundary-decoder (BD) net, which uses boundary condition and image pairing for stress modeling. The boundary net maps material parameters to the latent space co-shared by its image counterpart. Because such a setup is dimensionally wise ill-posed, we further couple BD net with deep clustering. To access the performance of our proposed method, we simulate an IC chip dataset comprising of 1825 stress images. We compare our new approach using variants of BD net as well as a baseline approach. We show that our approach is able to outperform all the comparison in terms of train and test error reduction.

*Toktam Khatibi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for predicting 5-year breast cancer survival using clinical and genomic data, comparing CoxNet and XGBoost models, with strong performance and fairness across subgroups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like poor calibration and subgroup disparities in clinical risk prediction, especially in high-dimensional cancer datasets.

Method: Integration of clinical and genomic data, dimensionality reduction, and comparison of CoxNet and XGBoost survival models with stratified validation.

Result: High AUC and AP scores for both models (CoxNet: AUC 96.6, AP 80.4; XGBoost: AUC 92.5, AP 79.9) and stable performance across subgroups.

Conclusion: The framework prioritizes calibration, fairness, robustness, and reproducibility for clinical machine learning in cancer survival prediction.

Abstract: Clinical risk prediction models often underperform in real-world settings due to poor calibration, limited transportability, and subgroup disparities. These challenges are amplified in high-dimensional multimodal cancer datasets characterized by complex feature interactions and a p >> n structure. We present a fully reproducible multimodal machine learning framework for 5-year overall survival prediction in breast cancer, integrating clinical variables with high-dimensional transcriptomic and copy-number alteration (CNA) features from the METABRIC cohort.
  After variance- and sparsity-based filtering and dimensionality reduction, models were trained using stratified train/validation/test splits with validation-based hyperparameter tuning. Two survival approaches were compared: an elastic-net regularized Cox model (CoxNet) and a gradient-boosted survival tree model implemented using XGBoost. CoxNet provides embedded feature selection and stable estimation, whereas XGBoost captures nonlinear effects and higher-order interactions.
  Performance was assessed using time-dependent area under the ROC curve (AUC), average precision (AP), calibration curves, Brier score, and bootstrapped 95 percent confidence intervals. CoxNet achieved validation and test AUCs of 98.3 and 96.6, with AP values of 90.1 and 80.4. XGBoost achieved validation and test AUCs of 98.6 and 92.5, with AP values of 92.5 and 79.9. Fairness diagnostics showed stable discrimination across age groups, estrogen receptor status, molecular subtypes, and menopausal state.
  This work introduces a governance-oriented multimodal survival framework emphasizing calibration, fairness auditing, robustness, and reproducibility for high-dimensional clinical machine learning.

### [207] [Error-awareness Accelerates Active Automata Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21674)
*Loes Kruger,Sebastian Junges,Jurriaan Rot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses improving Active Automata Learning (AAL) algorithms to scale better with systems having many inputs, especially when most inputs lead to observable errors. It proposes adaptations of the L# algorithm leveraging varying levels of domain knowledge about non-error-producing inputs, showing significant speedups in learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main challenge addressed is scaling AAL algorithms for larger systems with many inputs, particularly when most inputs cause observable errors. The research is motivated by practical problems where such errors are common.

Method: The study examines different levels of knowledge about non-error-producing inputs and adapts the state-of-the-art L# algorithm accordingly. Each adaptation maximizes the use of available domain knowledge.

Result: Empirical results show the adapted methods significantly accelerate learning, ranging from orders of magnitude with strong domain knowledge to a single order of magnitude with limited knowledge.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptations of the L# algorithm effectively address scalability challenges in AAL by leveraging domain knowledge about non-error-producing inputs, leading to substantial improvements in learning efficiency.

Abstract: Active automata learning (AAL) algorithms can learn a behavioral model of a system from interacting with it. The primary challenge remains scaling to larger models, in particular in the presence of many possible inputs to the system. Modern AAL algorithms fail to scale even if, in every state, most inputs lead to errors. In various challenging problems from the literature, these errors are observable, i.e., they emit a known error output. Motivated by these problems, we study learning these systems more efficiently. Further, we consider various degrees of knowledge about which inputs are non-error producing at which state. For each level of knowledge, we provide a matching adaptation of the state-of-the-art AAL algorithm L# to make the most of this domain knowledge. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the methods accelerate learning by orders of magnitude with strong but realistic domain knowledge to a single order of magnitude with limited domain knowledge.

TL;DR: TiMi integrates multimodal data (text and numerical) for time series forecasting by leveraging LLMs and a Mixture-of-Experts module, achieving state-of-the-art results without explicit modality alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve forecasting accuracy by effectively incorporating causal textual information (e.g., emergency reports) alongside numerical data, addressing challenges in modality alignment.

Method: Proposes TiMi, a model combining LLM-generated inferences with a Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE) module to integrate exogenous factors and time series data seamlessly.

Result: TiMi outperforms baselines on sixteen real-world benchmarks, offering strong adaptability and interpretability.

Conclusion: TiMi successfully leverages multimodal data for causal reasoning in forecasting, eliminating the need for explicit alignment and achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting has garnered significant attention for its potential to provide more accurate predictions than traditional single-modality models by leveraging rich information inherent in other modalities. However, due to fundamental challenges in modality alignment, existing methods often struggle to effectively incorporate multimodal data into predictions, particularly textual information that has a causal influence on time series fluctuations, such as emergency reports and policy announcements. In this paper, we reflect on the role of textual information in numerical forecasting and propose Time series transformers with Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts, TiMi, to unleash the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Concretely, TiMi utilizes LLMs to generate inferences on future developments, which serve as guidance for time series forecasting. To seamlessly integrate both exogenous factors and time series into predictions, we introduce a Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE) module as a lightweight plug-in to empower Transformer-based time series models for multimodal forecasting, eliminating the need for explicit representation-level alignment. Experimentally, our proposed TiMi demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance on sixteen real-world multimodal forecasting benchmarks, outperforming advanced baselines while offering both strong adaptability and interpretability.

*Michele Cazzola,Alberto Ghione,Lucia Sargentini,Julien Nespoulous,Riccardo Finotello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in representing multi-regime physical systems in scientific ML, using UQ to guide learning and improve predictions, with a focus on the CHF benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ML techniques often fail in multi-regime systems due to varying responses and stochasticity. UQ is needed to internalize data behavior for reliable predictions.

Method: Comparative analysis of UQ methods, including post-hoc (conformal prediction) and end-to-end (Bayesian heteroscedastic regression, quality-driven losses) approaches.

Result: Coverage-oriented learning effectively reshapes model representation to match physical regimes, ensuring high accuracy and consistent uncertainty estimation.

Conclusion: UQ should be integrated into the learning process to handle multi-regime behaviors, with coverage-oriented methods outperforming post-hoc approaches in aligning with physical variability.

Abstract: A central challenge in scientific machine learning (ML) is the correct representation of physical systems governed by multi-regime behaviours. In these scenarios, standard data analysis techniques often fail to capture the nature of the data, as the system's response varies significantly across the state space due to its stochasticity and the different physical regimes. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) should thus not be viewed merely as a safety assessment, but as a support to the learning task itself, guiding the model to internalise the behaviour of the data. We address this by focusing on the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) benchmark and dataset presented by the OECD/NEA Expert Group on Reactor Systems Multi-Physics. This case study represents a test for scientific ML due to the non-linear dependence of CHF on the inputs and the existence of distinct microscopic physical regimes. These regimes exhibit diverse statistical profiles, a complexity that requires UQ techniques to internalise the data behaviour and ensure reliable predictions. In this work, we conduct a comparative analysis of UQ methodologies to determine their impact on physical representation. We contrast post-hoc methods, specifically conformal prediction, against end-to-end coverage-oriented pipelines, including (Bayesian) heteroscedastic regression and quality-driven losses. These approaches treat uncertainty not as a final metric, but as an active component of the optimisation process, modelling the prediction and its behaviour simultaneously. We show that while post-hoc methods ensure statistical calibration, coverage-oriented learning effectively reshapes the model's representation to match the complex physical regimes. The result is a model that delivers not only high predictive accuracy but also a physically consistent uncertainty estimation that adapts dynamically to the intrinsic variability of the CHF.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C$^{2}$TC introduces a training-free framework for tabular dataset condensation, improving efficiency and handling class imbalance and heterogeneous features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing scale of tabular data creates computational challenges, necessitating data-efficient learning. Existing methods are computationally intensive and overlook tabular data characteristics.

Method: C$^{2}$TC reformulates condensation into a class-adaptive cluster allocation problem (CCAP), using HFILS for optimization and HCFE for heterogeneous feature clustering.

Result: C$^{2}$TC improves efficiency by 2 orders of magnitude and achieves superior performance on 10 real-world datasets.

Conclusion: C$^{2}$TC effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering scalable and efficient tabular dataset condensation.

Abstract: Tabular data is the primary data format in industrial relational databases, underpinning modern data analytics and decision-making. However, the increasing scale of tabular data poses significant computational and storage challenges to learning-based analytical systems. This highlights the need for data-efficient learning, which enables effective model training and generalization using substantially fewer samples. Dataset condensation (DC) has emerged as a promising data-centric paradigm that synthesizes small yet informative datasets to preserve data utility while reducing storage and training costs. However, existing DC methods are computationally intensive due to reliance on complex gradient-based optimization. Moreover, they often overlook key characteristics of tabular data, such as heterogeneous features and class imbalance. To address these limitations, we introduce C$^{2}$TC (Class-Adaptive Clustering for Tabular Condensation), the first training-free tabular dataset condensation framework that jointly optimizes class allocation and feature representation, enabling efficient and scalable condensation. Specifically, we reformulate the dataset condensation objective into a novel class-adaptive cluster allocation problem (CCAP), which eliminates costly training and integrates adaptive label allocation to handle class imbalance. To solve the NP-hard CCAP, we develop HFILS, a heuristic local search that alternates between soft allocation and class-wise clustering to efficiently obtain high-quality solutions. Moreover, a hybrid categorical feature encoding (HCFE) is proposed for semantics-preserving clustering of heterogeneous discrete attributes. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that C$^{2}$TC improves efficiency by at least 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art baselines, while achieving superior downstream performance.

TL;DR: PLMs show depth inefficiency similar to LLMs, with later layers contributing less to output predictions, suggesting a need for more efficient architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates whether PLMs, like LLMs, suffer from depth inefficiency, where deeper layers contribute minimally to predictions, despite their diverse training objectives and inputs.

Method: Analyzed six popular PLMs across various scales and training objectives (autoregressive, masked, diffusion) using probing and perturbation-based measurements to assess layer contributions.

Result: Consistent depth-dependent inefficiency found in PLMs: later layers refine outputs minimally and depend less on earlier computations, especially in deeper models.

Conclusion: PLMs exhibit depth inefficiency, highlighting the potential for developing more depth-efficient architectures and training methods.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have become widely adopted as general-purpose models, demonstrating strong performance in protein engineering and de novo design. Like large language models (LLMs), they are typically trained as deep transformers with next-token or masked-token prediction objectives on massive sequence corpora and are scaled by increasing model depth. Recent work on autoregressive LLMs has identified the Curse of Depth: later layers contribute little to the final output predictions. These findings naturally raise the question of whether a similar depth inefficiency also appears in PLMs, where many widely used models are not autoregressive, and some are multimodal, accepting both protein sequence and structure as input. In this work, we present a depth analysis of six popular PLMs across model families and scales, spanning three training objectives, namely autoregressive, masked, and diffusion, and quantify how layer contributions evolve with depth using a unified set of probing- and perturbation-based measurements. Across all models, we observe consistent depth-dependent patterns that extend prior findings on LLMs: later layers depend less on earlier computations and mainly refine the final output distribution, and these effects are increasingly pronounced in deeper models. Taken together, our results suggest that PLMs exhibit a form of depth inefficiency, motivating future work on more depth-efficient architectures and training methods.

*Xiannan Huang,Quan Yuan,Chao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FORESEE is a lightweight online adaptation framework for accurate and robust short-term traffic demand prediction without retraining, using error correction and adaptive smoothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models degrade in accuracy under distribution shifts from external events or urban dynamics, and retraining is computationally expensive.

Method: FORESEE corrects forecasts using yesterday's error, stabilized by exponential smoothing and a mixture-of-experts mechanism, with adaptive spatiotemporal smoothing for coherent shifts.

Result: Experiments show FORESEE improves accuracy, maintains robustness, and has low computational overhead compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: FORESEE enables reliable, real-time traffic forecasting with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Accurately predicting short-term traffic demand is critical for intelligent transportation systems. While deep learning models achieve strong performance under stationary conditions, their accuracy often degrades significantly when faced with distribution shifts caused by external events or evolving urban dynamics. Frequent model retraining to adapt to such changes incurs prohibitive computational costs, especially for large-scale or foundation models. To address this challenge, we propose FORESEE (Forecasting Online with Residual Smoothing and Ensemble Experts), a lightweight online adaptation framework that is accurate, robust, and computationally efficient. FORESEE operates without any parameter updates to the base model. Instead, it corrects today's forecast in each region using yesterday's prediction error, stabilized through exponential smoothing guided by a mixture-of-experts mechanism that adapts to recent error dynamics. Moreover, an adaptive spatiotemporal smoothing component propagates error signals across neighboring regions and time slots, capturing coherent shifts in demand patterns. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets with three backbone models demonstrate that FORESEE consistently improves prediction accuracy, maintains robustness even when distribution shifts are minimal (avoiding performance degradation), and achieves the lowest computational overhead among existing online methods. By enabling real-time adaptation of traffic forecasting models with negligible computational cost, FORESEE paves the way for deploying reliable, up-to-date prediction systems in dynamic urban environments.

*Kenton Tang,Yuzhu Chen,Fengxiang He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a generalization theory for RLHF in large language models, addressing reward shift and clipped KL regularization, and provides practical implications for KL clipping and budget allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the generalizability of RLHF, especially considering reward shift and KL regularization clipping, which are not well-theorized.

Method: Develop generalization theory for RLHF accounting for reward shift and clipped KL regularization, analyzing sampling errors, reward shift errors, and KL clipping errors. Special cases include uniform prior initialization and SGD training.

Result: Generalization bounds show errors stem from sampling, reward shift, and KL clipping. Practical implications include optimal KL clipping thresholds and budget allocation strategies.

Conclusion: The theory provides insights into RLHF's generalizability and offers practical guidelines for improving RLHF processes.

Abstract: Alignment and adaptation in large language models heavily rely on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF); yet, theoretical understanding of its generalisability remains premature, especially when the learned reward could shift, and the KL control is estimated and clipped. To address this issue, we develop generalisation theory for RLHF that explicitly accounts for (1) \emph{reward shift}: reward models are trained on preference data from earlier or mixed behaviour policies while RLHF optimises the current policy on its own rollouts; and (2) \emph{clipped KL regularisation}: the KL regulariser is estimated from sampled log-probability ratios and then clipped for stabilisation, resulting in an error to RLHF. We present generalisation bounds for RLHF, suggesting that the generalisation error stems from a sampling error from prompts and rollouts, a reward shift error, and a KL clipping error. We also discuss special cases of (1) initialising RLHF parameters with a uniform prior over a finite space, and (2) training RLHF by stochastic gradient descent, as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The theory yields practical implications in (1) optimal KL clipping threshold, and (2) budget allocation in prompts, rollouts, and preference data.

*JuneHyoung Kwon,MiHyeon Kim,Eunju Lee,Yoonji Lee,Seunghoon Lee,YoungBin Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the challenge of unlearning biases in models, introducing 'shortcut unlearning' and proposing CUPID, a framework to mitigate it by partitioning data and disentangling model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine unlearning is vital for data privacy and model reliability, but its effectiveness is compromised when models learn unintended biases. The study explores this issue and introduces a novel phenomenon called 'shortcut unlearning.'

Method: The paper proposes CUPID, a framework that partitions biased data into subsets based on sharpness, disentangles model parameters into causal and bias pathways, and performs targeted updates with refined gradients.

Result: Experiments on datasets like Waterbirds, BAR, and Biased NICO++ show CUPID achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance and effectively addresses 'shortcut unlearning.'

Conclusion: The study highlights the challenges of unlearning biases and presents CUPID as an effective solution to improve model unlearning in biased scenarios.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, which enables a model to forget specific data, is crucial for ensuring data privacy and model reliability. However, its effectiveness can be severely undermined in real-world scenarios where models learn unintended biases from spurious correlations within the data. This paper investigates the unique challenges of unlearning from such biased models. We identify a novel phenomenon we term ``shortcut unlearning," where models exhibit an ``easy to learn, yet hard to forget" tendency. Specifically, models struggle to forget easily-learned, bias-aligned samples; instead of forgetting the class attribute, they unlearn the bias attribute, which can paradoxically improve accuracy on the class intended to be forgotten. To address this, we propose CUPID, a new unlearning framework inspired by the observation that samples with different biases exhibit distinct loss landscape sharpness. Our method first partitions the forget set into causal- and bias-approximated subsets based on sample sharpness, then disentangles model parameters into causal and bias pathways, and finally performs a targeted update by routing refined causal and bias gradients to their respective pathways. Extensive experiments on biased datasets including Waterbirds, BAR, and Biased NICO++ demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance and effectively mitigates the shortcut unlearning problem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Excitation is a novel optimizer for sparse architectures like MoEs, dynamically modulating updates based on expert utilization to improve specialization and training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimizers treat all parameters uniformly, struggling with structural confusion in MoEs. Excitation addresses this by sharpening routing specialization and enabling stable training.

Method: Excitation dynamically modulates updates using batch-level expert utilization, amplifying updates for highly-utilized experts and suppressing low-utilization ones. It requires minimal integration and no additional memory overhead.

Result: Excitation improves convergence speed and final performance in MoE models across language and vision tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in conditional computation.

Conclusion: Active update modulation, as introduced by Excitation, is crucial for effective conditional computation in sparse architectures, offering a memory-efficient and versatile solution.

Abstract: We propose Excitation, a novel optimization framework designed to accelerate learning in sparse architectures such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs). Unlike traditional optimizers that treat all parameters uniformly, Excitation dynamically modulates updates using batch-level expert utilization. It introduces a competitive update dynamic that amplifies updates to highly-utilized experts and can selectively suppress low-utilization ones, effectively sharpening routing specialization. Notably, we identify a phenomenon of "structural confusion" in deep MoEs, where standard optimizers fail to establish functional signal paths; Excitation acts as a specialization catalyst, "rescuing" these models and enabling stable training where baselines remain trapped. Excitation is optimizer-, domain-, and model-agnostic, requires minimal integration effort, and introduces neither additional per-parameter optimizer state nor learnable parameters, making it highly viable for memory-constrained settings. Across language and vision tasks, Excitation consistently improves convergence speed and final performance in MoE models, indicating that active update modulation is a key mechanism for effective conditional computation.

TL;DR: DocDjinn is a framework using Vision-Language Models to generate synthetic, annotated documents from unlabeled seeds, addressing data privacy and scarcity issues. It achieves 87% performance of real datasets using only 100 samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in procuring annotated training data (labor-intensive, costly, privacy concerns) drive the need for synthetic document generation.

Method: Uses VLMs for controllable generation via clustering-based seed selection, diffusion-based handwriting, and semantic-visual decoupling.

Result: Achieves 87% performance of real datasets with just 100 samples, validated across 11 benchmarks.

Conclusion: DocDjinn demonstrates VLMs can effectively generate synthetic documents, offering a scalable, privacy-preserving solution.

Abstract: Effective document intelligence models rely on large amounts of annotated training data. However, procuring sufficient and high-quality data poses significant challenges due to the labor-intensive and costly nature of data acquisition. Additionally, leveraging language models to annotate real documents raises concerns about data privacy. Synthetic document generation has emerged as a promising, privacy-preserving alternative. We propose DocDjinn, a novel framework for controllable synthetic document generation using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that produces annotated documents from unlabeled seed samples. Our approach generates visually plausible and semantically consistent synthetic documents that follow the distribution of an existing source dataset through clustering-based seed selection with parametrized sampling. By enriching documents with realistic diffusion-based handwriting and contextual visual elements via semantic-visual decoupling, we generate diverse, high-quality annotated synthetic documents. We evaluate across eleven benchmarks spanning key information extraction, question answering, document classification, and document layout analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating that VLMs can generate faithful annotated document datasets at scale from unlabeled seeds that can effectively enrich or approximate real, manually annotated data for diverse document understanding tasks. We show that with only 100 real training samples, our framework achieves on average $87\%$ of the performance of the full real-world dataset. We publicly release our code and 140k+ synthetic document samples.

TL;DR: The paper introduces xai-cola, an open-source Python library for sparsifying counterfactual explanations (CEs) to reduce redundancy while maintaining validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CE generators often produce redundant explanations, and xai-cola aims to address this by providing a tool to sparsify these explanations.

Method: xai-cola offers an end-to-end pipeline with APIs for inputting tabular data, preprocessing objects, and trained models (scikit-learn or PyTorch). It includes built-in/external CE generators, sparsification policies, and visualization routines.

Result: Empirical experiments show xai-cola reduces modified features by up to 50%, producing sparser CEs across various generators.

Conclusion: xai-cola is a practical tool released under MIT license, available on PyPI, and proven effective in sparsifying CEs.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanation (CE) is an important domain within post-hoc explainability. However, the explanations generated by most CE generators are often highly redundant. This work introduces an open-source Python library xai-cola, which provides an end-to-end pipeline for sparsifying CEs produced by arbitrary generators, reducing superfluous feature changes while preserving their validity. It offers a documented API that takes as input raw tabular data in pandas DataFrame form, a preprocessing object (for standardization and encoding), and a trained scikit-learn or PyTorch model. On this basis, users can either employ the built-in or externally imported CE generators. The library also implements several sparsification policies and includes visualization routines for analysing and comparing sparsified counterfactuals. xai-cola is released under the MIT license and can be installed from PyPI. Empirical experiments indicate that xai-cola produces sparser counterfactuals across several CE generators, reducing the number of modified features by up to 50% in our setting.

### [218] [The Error of Deep Operator Networks Is the Sum of Its Parts: Branch-Trunk and Mode Error Decompositions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21910)
*Alexander Heinlein,Johannes Taraz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes performance limitations of DeepONets, showing that branch network errors dominate and trunk networks can be replaced by classical basis functions. A modified DeepONet reveals spectral bias, singular-value scaling effects, and mode coupling issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepONets face accuracy and generalization challenges despite their potential in scientific computing. Understanding these limitations is key to advancing their adoption.

Method: A modified DeepONet replaces the trunk network with left singular vectors of the training solution matrix, revealing insights into branch network behavior.

Result: Key findings include spectral bias in branch networks, singular-value scaling effects, improved generalization with shared branch networks, and detrimental mode coupling.

Conclusion: The study highlights critical limitations in DeepONets and suggests directions for improving their accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Operator learning has the potential to strongly impact scientific computing by learning solution operators for differential equations, potentially accelerating multi-query tasks such as design optimization and uncertainty quantification by orders of magnitude. Despite proven universal approximation properties, deep operator networks (DeepONets) often exhibit limited accuracy and generalization in practice, which hinders their adoption. Understanding these limitations is therefore crucial for further advancing the approach.
  This work analyzes performance limitations of the classical DeepONet architecture. It is shown that the approximation error is dominated by the branch network when the internal dimension is sufficiently large, and that the learned trunk basis can often be replaced by classical basis functions without a significant impact on performance.
  To investigate this further, a modified DeepONet is constructed in which the trunk network is replaced by the left singular vectors of the training solution matrix. This modification yields several key insights. First, a spectral bias in the branch network is observed, with coefficients of dominant, low-frequency modes learned more effectively. Second, due to singular-value scaling of the branch coefficients, the overall branch error is dominated by modes with intermediate singular values rather than the smallest ones. Third, using a shared branch network for all mode coefficients, as in the standard architecture, improves generalization of small modes compared to a stacked architecture in which coefficients are computed separately. Finally, strong and detrimental coupling between modes in parameter space is identified.

*Cuong Anh Pham,Praneeth Vepakomma,Samuel Horváth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NESS, a continual learning method that leverages small singular values to construct an approximate null space for task-specific updates, reducing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning by using orthogonality principles derived from small singular values.

Method: NESS approximates a null space using small singular values of input representations and constrains updates to this subspace via a low-rank adaptation formulation.

Result: Experiments on three benchmark datasets show NESS achieves competitive performance, low forgetting, and stable accuracy across tasks.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of small singular values in continual learning, demonstrating NESS's effectiveness.

Abstract: Alleviating catastrophic forgetting while enabling further learning is a primary challenge in continual learning (CL). Orthogonal-based training methods have gained attention for their efficiency and strong theoretical properties, and many existing approaches enforce orthogonality through gradient projection. In this paper, we revisit orthogonality and exploit the fact that small singular values correspond to directions that are nearly orthogonal to the input space of previous tasks. Building on this principle, we introduce NESS (Null-space Estimated from Small Singular values), a CL method that applies orthogonality directly in the weight space rather than through gradient manipulation. Specifically, NESS constructs an approximate null space using the smallest singular values of each layer's input representation and parameterizes task-specific updates via a compact low-rank adaptation (LoRA-style) formulation constrained to this subspace. The subspace basis is fixed to preserve the null-space constraint, and only a single trainable matrix is learned for each task. This design ensures that the resulting updates remain approximately in the null space of previous inputs while enabling adaptation to new tasks. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate competitive performance, low forgetting, and stable accuracy across tasks, highlighting the role of small singular values in continual learning.

TL;DR: GUI-Libra introduces a tailored training recipe to address limitations in open-source GUI agents, improving step-wise accuracy and task completion through curated data and action-aware methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source GUI agents lag behind closed-source systems due to insufficient action-aligned reasoning data and generic post-training pipelines that ignore GUI-specific challenges.

Method: GUI-Libra includes a data construction pipeline (81K dataset), action-aware SFT mixing reasoning and direct-action data, and KL-regularized RLVR with success-adaptive scaling.

Result: GUI-Libra improves step-wise accuracy and end-to-end task completion across web and mobile benchmarks.

Conclusion: Careful post-training and data curation enhance GUI agent capabilities without costly online data collection, with released resources for further research.

Abstract: Open-source native GUI agents still lag behind closed-source systems on long-horizon navigation tasks. This gap stems from two limitations: a shortage of high-quality, action-aligned reasoning data, and the direct adoption of generic post-training pipelines that overlook the unique challenges of GUI agents. We identify two fundamental issues in these pipelines: (i) standard SFT with CoT reasoning often hurts grounding, and (ii) step-wise RLVR-tyle training faces partial verifiability, where multiple actions can be correct but only a single demonstrated action is used for verification. This makes offline step-wise metrics weak predictors of online task success. In this work, we present GUI-Libra, a tailored training recipe that addresses these challenges. First, to mitigate the scarcity of action-aligned reasoning data, we introduce a data construction and filtering pipeline and release a curated 81K GUI reasoning dataset. Second, to reconcile reasoning with grounding, we propose action-aware SFT that mixes reasoning-then-action and direct-action data and reweights tokens to emphasize action and grounding. Third, to stabilize RL under partial verifiability, we identify the overlooked importance of KL regularization in RLVR and show that a KL trust region is critical for improving offline-to-online predictability; we further introduce success-adaptive scaling to downweight unreliable negative gradients. Across diverse web and mobile benchmarks, GUI-Libra consistently improves both step-wise accuracy and end-to-end task completion. Our results suggest that carefully designed post-training and data curation can unlock significantly stronger task-solving capabilities without costly online data collection. We release our dataset, code, and models to facilitate further research on data-efficient post-training for reasoning-capable GUI agents.

*Ayush Mohanty,Paritosh Ramanan,Nagi Gebraeel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a federated cross-client interdependency learning method for RCA in networked industrial systems, addressing challenges like heterogeneous data and proprietary models, while ensuring privacy and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical RCA methods struggle with unknown and evolving interdependencies in complex networks, and existing FL methods don't handle heterogeneous data or proprietary models. This paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: A federated learning approach is proposed, where proprietary client models are augmented with ML models for interdependency learning. A global server coordinates these models with representation consistency and differential privacy.

Result: The method achieves theoretical convergence and is validated through simulations and a real-world industrial cybersecurity dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses RCA challenges in networked industrial systems without modifying proprietary models or compromising privacy.

Abstract: Root cause analysis (RCA) in networked industrial systems, such as supply chains and power networks, is notoriously difficult due to unknown and dynamically evolving interdependencies among geographically distributed clients. These clients represent heterogeneous physical processes and industrial assets equipped with sensors that generate large volumes of nonlinear, high-dimensional, and heterogeneous IoT data. Classical RCA methods require partial or full knowledge of the system's dependency graph, which is rarely available in these complex networks. While federated learning (FL) offers a natural framework for decentralized settings, most existing FL methods assume homogeneous feature spaces and retrainable client models. These assumptions are not compatible with our problem setting. Different clients have different data features and often run fixed, proprietary models that cannot be modified. This paper presents a federated cross-client interdependency learning methodology for feature-partitioned, nonlinear time-series data, without requiring access to raw sensor streams or modifying proprietary client models. Each proprietary local client model is augmented with a Machine Learning (ML) model that encodes cross-client interdependencies. These ML models are coordinated via a global server that enforces representation consistency while preserving privacy through calibrated differential privacy noise. RCA is performed using model residuals and anomaly flags. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees and validate our approach on extensive simulations and a real-world industrial cybersecurity dataset.

TL;DR: Introducing GACTGAN, a Bayesian-enhanced CTGAN for tabular data synthesis, achieving better utility-risk balance with reduced computational cost post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CTGAN struggles with the risk-utility trade-off in tabular data synthesis, and Bayesian GANs, though promising, face computational challenges.

Method: GACTGAN integrates Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG) into CTGAN's generator for Bayesian posterior approximation, reducing computational overhead.

Result: GACTGAN outperforms CTGAN in preserving tabular structure and inferential statistics while minimizing privacy risks.

Conclusion: GACTGAN offers a simpler, effective Bayesian approach for tabular data synthesis, balancing utility and risk efficiently.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been used in many studies to synthesise mixed tabular data. Conditional tabular GAN (CTGAN) have been the most popular variant but struggle to effectively navigate the risk-utility trade-off. Bayesian GAN have received less attention for tabular data, but have been explored with unstructured data such as images and text. The most used technique employed in Bayesian GAN is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), but it is computationally intensive, particularly in terms of weight storage. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian Approximation of CTGAN (GACTGAN), an integration of the Bayesian posterior approximation technique using Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG) within the CTGAN generator to synthesise tabular data, reducing computational overhead after the training phase. We demonstrate that GACTGAN yields better synthetic data compared to CTGAN, achieving better preservation of tabular structure and inferential statistics with less privacy risk. These results highlight GACTGAN as a simpler, effective implementation of Bayesian tabular synthesis.

Our novel contributions include categorizing fuel oil consumption \& estimation methods into physics-based, machine-learning, and hybrid models, exploring their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of data fusion techniques, which combine AIS, onboard sensors, and meteorological data to enhance accuracy. We make the first attempt to discuss the emerging role of Explainable AI in enhancing model transparency for decision-making. Uniquely, key challenges, including data quality, availability, and the need for real-time optimization, are identified, and future research directions are proposed to address these gaps, with a focus on hybrid models, real-time optimization, and the standardization of datasets.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy and maintains robustness under perturbations like link removal and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Adaptive sparse networks offer efficiency and reliability, presenting a promising direction for deep learning models.

Abstract: We investigate the robustness of sparse artificial neural networks trained with adaptive topology. We focus on a simple yet effective architecture consisting of three sparse layers with 99% sparsity followed by a dense layer, applied to image classification tasks such as MNIST and Fashion MNIST. By updating the topology of the sparse layers between each epoch, we achieve competitive accuracy despite the significantly reduced number of weights. Our primary contribution is a detailed analysis of the robustness of these networks, exploring their performance under various perturbations including random link removal, adversarial attack, and link weight shuffling. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that adaptive topology not only enhances efficiency but also maintains robustness. This work highlights the potential of adaptive sparse networks as a promising direction for developing efficient and reliable deep learning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for compact, uncertainty-aware neural networks in resource-constrained deployments like medicine and robotics.

Method: Parameterizing filters in the frequency domain using spectral circulant and BCCB layers, enabling structured variational inference, exact Lipschitz bounds, and spectral priors.

Result: Empirical validation shows spectral layers match strong baselines with fewer parameters and tighter Lipschitz certificates.

Conclusion: Spectral layers are effective compact building blocks for Bayesian and deterministic neural networks.

Abstract: Critical applications in areas such as medicine, robotics and autonomous systems require compact (i.e., memory efficient), uncertainty-aware neural networks suitable for edge and other resource-constrained deployments. We study compact spectral circulant and block-circulant-with-circulant-blocks (BCCB) layers: FFT-diagonalizable circular convolutions whose weights live directly in the real FFT (RFFT) half (1D) or half-plane (2D). Parameterizing filters in the frequency domain lets us impose simple spectral structure, perform structured variational inference in a low-dimensional weight space, and calculate exact layer spectral norms, enabling inexpensive global Lipschitz bounds and margin-based robustness diagnostics. By placing independent complex Gaussians on the Hermitian support we obtain a discrete instance of the spectral representation of stationary kernels, inducing an exact stationary Gaussian-process prior over filters on the discrete circle/torus. We exploit this to define a practical spectral prior and a Hermitian-aware low-rank-plus-diagonal variational posterior in real coordinates. Empirically, spectral circulant/BCCB layers are effective compact building blocks in both (variational) Bayesian and point estimate regimes: compact Bayesian neural networks on MNIST->Fashion-MNIST, variational heads on frozen CIFAR-10 features, and deterministic ViT projections on CIFAR-10/Tiny ImageNet; spectral layers match strong baselines while using substantially fewer parameters and with tighter Lipschitz certificates.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient computation of Wasserstein geodesics and velocity fields in machine learning using optimal transport.

Method: Recasts OT as a minimax problem, approximating functions with deep neural networks to compute geodesics and recover the OT map.

Result: Successfully computes Wasserstein geodesics and velocity fields, enabling direct sampling and learning the full velocity field.

Conclusion: The framework is versatile, effective for synthetic and real data, and generalizable to different cost functions.

Abstract: In recent years, the machine learning community has increasingly embraced the optimal transport (OT) framework for modeling distributional relationships. In this work, we introduce a sample-based neural solver for computing the Wasserstein geodesic between a source and target distribution, along with the associated velocity field. Building on the dynamical formulation of the optimal transport (OT) problem, we recast the constrained optimization as a minimax problem, using deep neural networks to approximate the relevant functions. This approach not only provides the Wasserstein geodesic but also recovers the OT map, enabling direct sampling from the target distribution. By estimating the OT map, we obtain velocity estimates along particle trajectories, which in turn allow us to learn the full velocity field. The framework is flexible and readily extends to general cost functions, including the commonly used quadratic cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Gaussian priors in function-space variational inference fail to capture heavy-tailed characteristics of neural network outputs, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: Proposes ST-FS-EB, a framework using Student's $t$ priors in parameter and function spaces, approximated via variational inference with MC dropout for posterior estimation.

Result: Outperforms existing VI-based BDL methods in in-distribution prediction, OOD detection, and handling distribution shifts.

Conclusion: ST-FS-EB effectively addresses limitations of Gaussian priors, enhancing uncertainty estimation in Bayesian deep learning.

Abstract: Bayesian deep learning (BDL) has emerged as a principled approach to produce reliable uncertainty estimates by integrating deep neural networks with Bayesian inference, and the selection of informative prior distributions remains a significant challenge. Various function-space variational inference (FSVI) regularisation methods have been presented, assigning meaningful priors over model predictions. However, these methods typically rely on a Gaussian prior, which fails to capture the heavy-tailed statistical characteristics inherent in neural network outputs. By contrast, this work proposes a novel function-space empirical Bayes regularisation framework -- termed ST-FS-EB -- which employs heavy-tailed Student's $t$ priors in both parameter and function spaces. Also, we approximate the posterior distribution through variational inference (VI), inducing an evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective based on Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated against various VI-based BDL baselines, and the results demonstrate its robust performance in in-distribution prediction, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and handling distribution shifts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional physics-based models (lack of adaptability) and purely data-driven approaches (lack of interpretability) in maritime transportation.

Method: Introduces PI-KAN, integrating interpretable univariate feature transformations, a physics-informed loss function, and a leakage-free chained prediction pipeline.

Result: PI-KAN outperforms traditional methods with lower MAE and RMSE, higher R^2, and physically consistent predictions for shaft power and fuel consumption.

Conclusion: PI-KAN offers a balanced solution for accurate and interpretable maritime performance monitoring, validated by domain-consistent dependencies.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of shaft rotational speed, shaft power, and fuel consumption is crucial for enhancing operational efficiency and sustainability in maritime transportation. Conventional physics-based models provide interpretability but struggle with real-world variability, while purely data-driven approaches achieve accuracy at the expense of physical plausibility. This paper introduces a Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PI-KAN), a hybrid method that integrates interpretable univariate feature transformations with a physics-informed loss function and a leakage-free chained prediction pipeline. Using operational and environmental data from five cargo vessels, PI-KAN consistently outperforms the traditional polynomial method and neural network baselines. The model achieves the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), and the highest coefficient of determination (R^2) for shaft power and fuel consumption across all vessels, while maintaining physically consistent behavior. Interpretability analysis reveals rediscovery of domain-consistent dependencies, such as cubic-like speed-power relationships and cosine-like wave and wind effects. These results demonstrate that PI-KAN achieves both predictive accuracy and interpretability, offering a robust tool for vessel performance monitoring and decision support in operational settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models are limited to single data types; Mixed-SuStaIn addresses this by handling mixed datasets for broader use.

Method: Implemented within SuStaIn, Mixed-SuStaIn models disease progression and subtypes for mixed data types.

Result: Simulations and Alzheimer's data show Mixed-SuStaIn performs well on mixed datasets.

Conclusion: Mixed-SuStaIn broadens disease progression modeling to mixed data, validated effectively.

Abstract: Disease progression modeling provides a robust framework to identify long-term disease trajectories from short-term biomarker data. It is a valuable tool to gain a deeper understanding of diseases with a long disease trajectory, such as Alzheimer's disease. A key limitation of most disease progression models is that they are specific to a single data type (e.g., continuous data), thereby limiting their applicability to heterogeneous, real-world datasets. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixed Events model, a novel disease progression model that handles both discrete and continuous data types. This model is implemented within the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) framework, resulting in Mixed-SuStaIn, enabling subtype and progression modeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Mixed-SuStaIn through simulation experiments and real-world data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, showing that it performs well on mixed datasets.

TL;DR: DualWeaver adapts univariate time-series foundation models (TSFMs) for multivariate forecasting using learnable surrogate series, achieving superior accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite strong univariate forecasting performance by TSFMs, extending this to multivariate scenarios remains challenging, prompting the development of DualWeaver.

Method: DualWeaver employs structurally symmetric surrogate series generated by a shared feature-fusion module, enabling multivariate forecasting without additional parametric decoding.

Result: Experiments show DualWeaver outperforms state-of-the-art multivariate forecasters in accuracy and stability.

Conclusion: DualWeaver successfully bridges the gap between univariate TSFMs and multivariate forecasting, offering robust performance.

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have achieved strong univariate forecasting through large-scale pre-training, yet effectively extending this success to multivariate forecasting remains challenging. To address this, we propose DualWeaver, a novel framework that adapts univariate TSFMs (Uni-TSFMs) for multivariate forecasting by using a pair of learnable, structurally symmetric surrogate series. Generated by a shared auxiliary feature-fusion module that captures cross-variable dependencies, these surrogates are mapped to TSFM-compatible series via the forecasting objective. The symmetric structure enables parameter-free reconstruction of final predictions directly from the surrogates, without additional parametric decoding. A theoretically grounded regularization term is further introduced to enhance robustness against adaptation collapse. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that DualWeaver outperforms state-of-the-art multivariate forecasters in both accuracy and stability. We release the code at https://github.com/li-jinpeng/DualWeaver.

### [231] [On Imbalanced Regression with Hoeffding Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22101)
*Pantia-Marina Alchirch,Dimitrios I. Diochnos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper adapts kernel density estimation (KDE) and hierarchical shrinkage (HS) for streaming regression tasks using incremental decision trees, finding KDE beneficial early in the stream but HS offers little improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance incremental decision trees for streaming regression by adapting batch learning methods (KDE and HS) and evaluating their effectiveness in online settings.

Method: Extends KDE to streaming environments and implements HS for incremental decision trees, testing their performance on online regression datasets.

Result: KDE improves performance early in the data stream, while HS provides minimal or no benefits.

Conclusion: KDE is useful for streaming regression early on, but HS has limited impact; the code is publicly available.

Abstract: Many real-world applications provide a continuous stream of data that is subsequently used by machine learning models to solve regression tasks of interest. Hoeffding trees and their variants have a long-standing tradition due to their effectiveness, either alone or as base models in broader ensembles. At the same time a recent line of work in batch learning has shown that kernel density estimation (KDE) is an effective approach for smoothed predictions in imbalanced regression tasks [Yang et al., 2021]. Moreover, another recent line of work for batch learning, called hierarchical shrinkage (HS) [Agarwal et al., 2022], has introduced a post-hoc regularization method for decision trees that does not alter the structure of the learned tree. Using a telescoping argument we cast KDE to streaming environments and extend the implementation of HS to incremental decision tree models. Armed with these extensions we investigate the performance of decision trees that may enjoy such options in datasets commonly used for regression in online settings. We conclude that KDE is beneficial in the early parts of the stream, while HS hardly, if ever, offers performance benefits. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/marinaAlchirch/DSFA_2026.

*Andrea Apicella,Francesco Isgrò,Andrea Pollastro,Roberto Prevete*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Validation criteria impact test performance in neural classifiers. Avoid validation accuracy for model selection; loss-based criteria perform better and more consistently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how the validation criterion used for model selection affects test performance in neural classifiers, with a focus on early stopping.

Method: Empirical and statistical study using fully connected networks on standard benchmarks under k-fold evaluation, comparing early stopping with patience and post-hoc selection. Models trained with cross-entropy, C-Loss, or PolyLoss; validation selection made using accuracy or one of three loss functions.

Result: (1) Early stopping based on validation accuracy performs worst. (2) Loss-based criteria yield comparable and more stable test accuracy. (3) Single validation rules often underperform the test-optimal checkpoint.

Conclusion: Validation accuracy, especially with early stopping, should be avoided for model selection; loss-based criteria are more reliable.

Abstract: Despite the extensive literature on training loss functions, the evaluation of generalization on the validation set remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical and statistical study of how the validation criterion used for model selection affects test performance in neural classifiers, with attention to early stopping. Using fully connected networks on standard benchmarks under $k$-fold evaluation, we compare: (i) early stopping with patience and (ii) post-hoc selection over all epochs (i.e. no early stopping). Models are trained with cross-entropy, C-Loss, or PolyLoss; the model parameter selection on the validation set is made using accuracy or one of the three loss functions, each considered independently. Three main findings emerge. (1) Early stopping based on validation accuracy performs worst, consistently selecting checkpoints with lower test accuracy than both loss-based early stopping and post-hoc selection. (2) Loss-based validation criteria yield comparable and more stable test accuracy. (3) Across datasets and folds, any single validation rule often underperforms the test-optimal checkpoint. Overall, the selected model typically achieves test-set performance statistically lower than the best performance across all epochs, regardless of the validation criterion. Our results suggest avoiding validation accuracy (in particular with early stopping) for parameter selection, favoring loss-based validation criteria.

### [233] [Sample Complexity Bounds for Robust Mean Estimation with Mean-Shift Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22130)
*Ilias Diakonikolas,Giannis Iakovidis,Daniel M. Kane,Sihan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the sample complexity of mean estimation under mean-shift contamination, providing upper and lower bounds for general base distributions under mild spectral conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work addressed mean estimation under contamination for specific distributions (Gaussian, Laplace), leaving the general case open. This work aims to resolve this gap.

Method: The authors use Fourier analysis, introducing the concept of a Fourier witness, to derive sample-efficient algorithms and matching lower bounds.

Result: They show that consistent mean estimation is possible under mild spectral conditions on the base distribution's characteristic function.

Conclusion: The study resolves the open question, demonstrating feasibility and limits of mean estimation in the mean-shift contamination model for general distributions.

Abstract: We study the basic task of mean estimation in the presence of mean-shift contamination. In the mean-shift contamination model, an adversary is allowed to replace a small constant fraction of the clean samples by samples drawn from arbitrarily shifted versions of the base distribution. Prior work characterized the sample complexity of this task for the special cases of the Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Specifically, it was shown that consistent estimation is possible in these cases, a property that is provably impossible in Huber's contamination model. An open question posed in earlier work was to determine the sample complexity of mean estimation in the mean-shift contamination model for general base distributions. In this work, we study and essentially resolve this open question. Specifically, we show that, under mild spectral conditions on the characteristic function of the (potentially multivariate) base distribution, there exists a sample-efficient algorithm that estimates the target mean to any desired accuracy. We complement our upper bound with a qualitatively matching sample complexity lower bound. Our techniques make critical use of Fourier analysis, and in particular introduce the notion of a Fourier witness as an essential ingredient of our upper and lower bounds.

*Qunyou Liu,Pengbo Yu,Marina Zapater,David Atienza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SigmaQuant is an adaptive layer-wise heterogeneous quantization framework that optimizes DNN deployment on edge devices by balancing accuracy and resource usage without exhaustive search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization methods for DNNs struggle with accuracy degradation, inefficiency, or lack of adaptability to diverse hardware constraints on edge devices.

Method: SigmaQuant employs adaptive layer-wise heterogeneous quantization, assigning different bitwidths to layers based on their robustness, avoiding brute-force search.

Result: The framework effectively balances accuracy and resource usage, overcoming limitations of uniform and existing heterogeneous quantization methods.

Conclusion: SigmaQuant offers an efficient solution for deploying DNNs on resource-constrained edge devices.}

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are essential for performing advanced tasks on edge or mobile devices, yet their deployment is often hindered by severe resource constraints, including limited memory, energy, and computational power. While uniform quantization provides a straightforward approach to compress model and reduce hardware requirement, it fails to fully leverage the varying robustness across layers, and often lead to accuracy degradation or suboptimal resource usage, particularly at low bitwidths. In contrast, heterogeneous quantization, which allocates different bitwidths to individual layers, can mitigate these drawbacks. Nonetheless, current heterogeneous quantization methods either needs huge brute-force design space search or lacks the adaptability to meet different hardware conditions, such as memory size, energy budget, and latency requirement. Filling these gaps, this work introduces \textbf{\textit{SigmaQuant}}, an adaptive layer-wise heterogeneous quantization framework designed to efficiently balance accuracy and resource usage for varied edge environments without exhaustive search.

### [235] [Provable Last-Iterate Convergence for Multi-Objective Safe LLM Alignment via Optimistic Primal-Dual](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22146)
*Yining Li,Peizhong Ju,Ness Shroff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a universal primal-dual framework for safe RLHF, introducing an optimistic primal-dual algorithm to stabilize convergence and ensure last-iterate guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing instability and divergence issues in standard primal-dual methods for RLHF, the work aims to unify existing alignment algorithms and improve theoretical guarantees.

Method: Develops a universal primal-dual framework and an optimistic primal-dual (OPD) algorithm with predictive updates for primal and dual variables.

Result: Demonstrates last-iterate convergence guarantees for exact policy optimization and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution under parameterized policies.

Conclusion: The optimistic approach mitigates oscillations in constrained alignment, bridging theoretical gaps between constrained RL and practical RLHF applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a significant role in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While RLHF with expected reward constraints can be formulated as a primal-dual optimization problem, standard primal-dual methods only guarantee convergence with a distributional policy where the saddle-point problem is in convex-concave form. Moreover, standard primal-dual methods may exhibit instability or divergence in the last iterate under policy parameterization in practical applications. In this work, we propose a universal primal-dual framework for safe RLHF that unifies a broad class of existing alignment algorithms, including safe-RLHF, one-shot, and multi-shot based methods. Building on this framework, we introduce an optimistic primal-dual (OPD) algorithm that incorporates predictive updates for both primal and dual variables to stabilize saddle-point dynamics. We establish last-iterate convergence guarantees for the proposed method, covering both exact policy optimization in the distributional space and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose gap is related to approximation error and bias under parameterized policies. Our analysis reveals that optimism plays a crucial role in mitigating oscillations inherent to constrained alignment objectives, thereby closing a key theoretical gap between constrained RL and practical RLHF.

### [236] [Surrogate models for Rock-Fluid Interaction: A Grid-Size-Invariant Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22188)
*Nathalie C. Pinheiro,Donghu Guo,Hannah P. Menke,Aniket C. Joshi,Claire E. Heaney,Ahmed H. ElSheikh,Christopher C. Pain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops surrogate models for rock-fluid interaction predictions, comparing UNet and UNet++ architectures and introducing grid-size-invariant neural networks to reduce computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity models for rock-fluid interaction are computationally expensive, limiting their use for multi-query problems like uncertainty quantification and optimization.

Method: Eight surrogate models are developed: four reduced-order models (ROMs) using neural networks and four grid-size-invariant single neural networks. UNet and UNet++ architectures are compared.

Result: UNet++ outperforms UNet for surrogate models, and grid-size-invariant models reduce memory consumption while maintaining good predictive accuracy. Grid-size-invariant models also outperform ROMs.

Conclusion: The grid-size-invariant framework is reliable for reducing computational costs and memory usage while achieving accurate predictions, making it suitable for challenging applications like fluid-induced rock dissolution.

Abstract: Modelling rock-fluid interaction requires solving a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) to predict the flow behaviour and the reactions of the fluid with the rock on the interfaces. Conventional high-fidelity numerical models require a high resolution to obtain reliable results, resulting in huge computational expense. This restricts the applicability of these models for multi-query problems, such as uncertainty quantification and optimisation, which require running numerous scenarios. As a cheaper alternative to high-fidelity models, this work develops eight surrogate models for predicting the fluid flow in porous media. Four of these are reduced-order models (ROM) based on one neural network for compression and another for prediction. The other four are single neural networks with the property of grid-size invariance; a term which we use to refer to image-to-image models that are capable of inferring on computational domains that are larger than those used during training. In addition to the novel grid-size-invariant framework for surrogate models, we compare the predictive performance of UNet and UNet++ architectures, and demonstrate that UNet++ outperforms UNet for surrogate models. Furthermore, we show that the grid-size-invariant approach is a reliable way to reduce memory consumption during training, resulting in good correlation between predicted and ground-truth values and outperforming the ROMs analysed. The application analysed is particularly challenging because fluid-induced rock dissolution results in a non-static solid field and, consequently, it cannot be used to help in adjustments of the future prediction.

TL;DR: Sysurv is a non-parametric, differentiable method for identifying subgroups with exceptional survival characteristics using random survival forests and interpretable rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing methods that require restrictive assumptions, pre-discretized features, and overlook individual deviations in survival analysis.

Method: Sysurv leverages random survival forests to learn individual survival curves, automatically learns conditions, and combines these into interpretable rules.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows Sysurv effectively identifies insightful and actionable survival subgroups across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Sysurv is a robust tool for discovering exceptional survival subgroups without restrictive assumptions, validated by practical applications.

Abstract: In many applications, it is important to identify subpopulations that survive longer or shorter than the rest of the population. In medicine, for example, it allows determining which patients benefit from treatment, and in predictive maintenance, which components are more likely to fail. Existing methods for discovering subgroups with exceptional survival characteristics require restrictive assumptions about the survival model (e.g. proportional hazards), pre-discretized features, and, as they compare average statistics, tend to overlook individual deviations. In this paper, we propose Sysurv, a fully differentiable, non-parametric method that leverages random survival forests to learn individual survival curves, automatically learns conditions and how to combine these into inherently interpretable rules, so as to select subgroups with exceptional survival characteristics. Empirical evaluation on a wide range of datasets and settings, including a case study on cancer data, shows that Sysurv reveals insightful and actionable survival subgroups.

*Shanshan Mao,Peter Tino*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores how individual variation and mutation amplitude influence the emergence of hierarchical organization in multi-agent systems, showing that mutation amplitude is more critical than initial heterogeneity for stable hierarchy formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the minimal conditions under which hierarchy arises in dynamic systems, focusing on the roles of initial differences between agents and mutation over generations.

Method: An agent-based model (ABM) is used to simulate interactions, with hierarchy measured using the Trophic Incoherence (TI) metric to assess directional asymmetries in networks.

Result: Small individual differences can amplify into hierarchies through local interactions, but mutation amplitude is more influential than initial heterogeneity for long-term stability.

Conclusion: Simple interaction rules can lead to hierarchical organization, highlighting how structured inequality can emerge from initially homogeneous populations.

Abstract: A central premise in evolutionary biology is that individual variation can generate information asymmetries that facilitate the emergence of hierarchical organisation. To examine this process, we develop an agent-based model (ABM) to identify the minimal conditions under which hierarchy arises in dynamic multi-agent systems, focusing on the roles of initial heterogeneity and mutation amplitude across generations. Hierarchical organisation is quantified using the Trophic Incoherence (TI) metric, which captures directional asymmetries in interaction networks. Our results show that even small individual differences can be amplified through repeated local interactions involving reproduction, competition, and cooperation, but that hierarchical order is markedly more sensitive to mutation amplitude than to initial heterogeneity. Across repeated trials, stable hierarchies reliably emerge only when mutation amplitude is sufficiently high, while initial heterogeneity primarily affects early formation rather than long-term persistence. Overall, these findings demonstrate how simple interaction rules can give rise to both the emergence and persistence of hierarchical organisation, providing a quantitative account of how structured inequality can develop from initially homogeneous populations.

Conclusion: Pancake effectively addresses ANN search challenges in LLM serving, offering significant performance gains.

Abstract: In this work, we identify and address the core challenges of agentic memory management in LLM serving, where large-scale storage, frequent updates, and multiple coexisting agents jointly introduce complex and high-cost approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) searching problems. We present Pancake, a multi-tier agentic memory system that unifies three key techniques: (i) multi-level index caching for single agents, (ii) coordinated index management across multiple agents, and (iii) collaborative GPU-CPU acceleration. Pancake exposes easy-to-use interface that can be integrated into memory-based agents like Mem-GPT, and is compatible with agentic frameworks such as LangChain and LlamaIndex. Experiments on realistic agent workloads show that Pancake substantially outperforms existing frameworks, achieving more than 4.29x end-to-end throughput improvement.

*Vassil Guenov,Ashwin George,Arkady Zgonnikov,David A. Abbink,Luciano Cavalcante Siebert*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a metric for group causal responsibility in spatial interactions, addressing gaps in individual-focused metrics, and uses simulations to demonstrate its benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current responsibility metrics focus on individuals, failing in cases of causal overdeterminism where multiple actors cause an outcome.

Method: The authors formulate a group causal responsibility metric, formalize assertive influences, and propose a tiering algorithm to identify assertive agents. Scenario-based simulations are used for validation.

Result: Simulations show benefits of group-focused metrics and how group effects vary with interaction dynamics and agent proximity.

Conclusion: The proposed group causal responsibility metric fills gaps left by individual-focused approaches, offering a more comprehensive understanding of spatial interactions.

Abstract: Heralding the advent of autonomous vehicles and mobile robots that interact with humans, responsibility in spatial interaction is burgeoning as a research topic. Even though metrics of responsibility tailored to spatial interactions have been proposed, they are mostly focused on the responsibility of individual agents. Metrics of causal responsibility focusing on individuals fail in cases of causal overdeterminism -- when many actors simultaneously cause an outcome. To fill the gaps in causal responsibility left by individual-focused metrics, we formulate a metric for the causal responsibility of groups. To identify assertive agents that are causally responsible for the trajectory of an affected agent, we further formalise the types of assertive influences and propose a tiering algorithm for systematically identifying assertive agents. Finally, we use scenario-based simulations to illustrate the benefits of considering groups and how the emergence of group effects vary with interaction dynamics and the proximity of agents.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide a structured framework for parameterized decision modeling and uncertainty representation through soft set theory and its variants.

Abstract: Soft set theory provides a direct framework for parameterized decision modeling by assigning to each attribute (parameter) a subset of a given universe, thereby representing uncertainty in a structured way [1, 2]. Over the past decades, the theory has expanded into numerous variants-including hypersoft sets, superhypersoft sets, TreeSoft sets, bipolar soft sets, and dynamic soft sets-and has been connected to diverse areas such as topology and matroid theory. In this book, we present a survey-style overview of soft sets and their major extensions, highlighting core definitions, representative constructions, and key directions of current development.

Motivation: The rapid accumulation of Earth science data has created scalability challenges, with much data underutilized. This framework aims to improve data reusability and discovery.

Method: The framework uses a centralized Supervisor-Worker topology with data-type-aware routing, sandboxed deterministic code execution, and self-correction via execution feedback.

Result: Demonstrated capacity to execute complex, multi-step workflows autonomously across physical oceanography and ecology use-cases.

Conclusion: PANGAEA-GPT provides a scalable methodology for querying and analyzing heterogeneous repository data through coordinated agent workflows, reducing human intervention.

Abstract: The rapid accumulation of Earth science data has created a significant scalability challenge; while repositories like PANGAEA host vast collections of datasets, citation metrics indicate that a substantial portion remains underutilized, limiting data reusability. Here we present PANGAEA-GPT, a hierarchical multi-agent framework designed for autonomous data discovery and analysis. Unlike standard Large Language Model (LLM) wrappers, our architecture implements a centralized Supervisor-Worker topology with strict data-type-aware routing, sandboxed deterministic code execution, and self-correction via execution feedback, enabling agents to diagnose and resolve runtime errors. Through use-case scenarios spanning physical oceanography and ecology, we demonstrate the system's capacity to execute complex, multi-step workflows with minimal human intervention.

TL;DR: SemSIEdit is an inference-time framework addressing Semantic Sensitive Information leaks in LLMs, balancing privacy and utility through iterative rewriting, achieving a 34.6% reduction in leakage with minimal utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs pose new threats like inferring sensitive attributes or generating harmful content, necessitating frameworks to self-regulate leaks without losing utility.

Method: Introduces SemSIEdit, an agentic 'Editor' that critiques and rewrites sensitive spans iteratively during inference, preserving narrative flow.

Result: Achieves a Privacy-Utility Pareto Frontier with 34.6% leakage reduction and 9.8% utility loss; reveals Scale-Dependent Safety Divergence and Reasoning Paradox.

Conclusion: SemSIEdit effectively mitigates SemSI leaks while maintaining utility, highlighting trade-offs between model size and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: While defenses for structured PII are mature, Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a new threat: Semantic Sensitive Information (SemSI), where models infer sensitive identity attributes, generate reputation-harmful content, or hallucinate potentially wrong information. The capacity of LLMs to self-regulate these complex, context-dependent sensitive information leaks without destroying utility remains an open scientific question. To address this, we introduce SemSIEdit, an inference-time framework where an agentic "Editor" iteratively critiques and rewrites sensitive spans to preserve narrative flow rather than simply refusing to answer. Our analysis reveals a Privacy-Utility Pareto Frontier, where this agentic rewriting reduces leakage by 34.6% across all three SemSI categories while incurring a marginal utility loss of 9.8%. We also uncover a Scale-Dependent Safety Divergence: large reasoning models (e.g., GPT-5) achieve safety through constructive expansion (adding nuance), whereas capacity-constrained models revert to destructive truncation (deleting text). Finally, we identify a Reasoning Paradox: while inference-time reasoning increases baseline risk by enabling the model to make deeper sensitive inferences, it simultaneously empowers the defense to execute safe rewrites.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARL is unstable and limits scalability and exploration of design choices. The paper aims to address these issues.

Method: ARLArena provides a standardized testbed and decomposes policy gradient into four core dimensions. SAMPO is proposed to stabilize ARL.

Result: SAMPO achieves stable training and strong performance across diverse agentic tasks.

Conclusion: The study offers a unified perspective on ARL and practical guidance for stable agent training pipelines.

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (ARL) has rapidly gained attention as a promising paradigm for training agents to solve complex, multi-step interactive tasks. Despite encouraging early results, ARL remains highly unstable, often leading to training collapse. This instability limits scalability to larger environments and longer interaction horizons, and constrains systematic exploration of algorithmic design choices. In this paper, we first propose ARLArena, a stable training recipe and systematic analysis framework that examines training stability in a controlled and reproducible setting. ARLArena first constructs a clean and standardized testbed. Then, we decompose policy gradient into four core design dimensions and assess the performance and stability of each dimension. Through this fine-grained analysis, we distill a unified perspective on ARL and propose SAMPO, a stable agentic policy optimization method designed to mitigate the dominant sources of instability in ARL. Empirically, SAMPO achieves consistently stable training and strong performance across diverse agentic tasks. Overall, this study provides a unifying policy gradient perspective for ARL and offers practical guidance for building stable and reproducible LLM-based agent training pipelines.

*Nivasini Ananthakrishnan,Meena Jagadeesan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether aggregating responses from multiple homogeneous AI models expands the set of achievable outputs compared to querying a single model, identifying three mechanisms for such expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from exploring whether aggregation in compound AI systems can overcome limitations inherent to single-model querying, such as constraints from reward functions, prompt engineering, and model capabilities.

Method: The study uses a principal-agent framework to analyze aggregation's power and limitations, identifying three mechanisms (feasibility expansion, support expansion, binding set contraction) that enable output expansion.

Result: The analysis proves that aggregation must implement one of the three mechanisms to expand elicitability, with strengthened versions providing necessary and sufficient conditions.

Conclusion: The findings advance understanding of when compound AI systems can surpass limitations in model capabilities and prompt engineering, illustrated empirically in a toy reference-generation task.

Abstract: When designing compound AI systems, a common approach is to query multiple copies of the same model and aggregate the responses to produce a synthesized output. Given the homogeneity of these models, this raises the question of whether aggregation unlocks access to a greater set of outputs than querying a single model. In this work, we investigate the power and limitations of aggregation within a stylized principal-agent framework. This framework models how the system designer can partially steer each agent's output through its reward function specification, but still faces limitations due to prompt engineering ability and model capabilities. Our analysis uncovers three natural mechanisms -- feasibility expansion, support expansion, and binding set contraction -- through which aggregation expands the set of outputs that are elicitable by the system designer. We prove that any aggregation operation must implement one of these mechanisms in order to be elicitability-expanding, and that strengthened versions of these mechanisms provide necessary and sufficient conditions that fully characterize elicitability-expansion. Finally, we provide an empirical illustration of our findings for LLMs deployed in a toy reference-generation task. Altogether, our results take a step towards characterizing when compound AI systems can overcome limitations in model capabilities and in prompt engineering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The ASIR Courage Model redefines truth-disclosure as a state transition influenced by dynamic forces, applicable to both humans and AI systems under constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize truth-disclosure dynamics beyond personality traits, addressing human and AI behavior under pressure or constraints.

Method: Phase-dynamic framework with inequalities modeling facilitative vs. inhibitory forces. Extended to AI systems with feedback loops for recursive parameter adjustment.

Result: Unified structural explanation for human silence and AI output distortion, showing geometric consequences of force interactions.

Conclusion: The ASIR Courage Model bridges human and AI truth-disclosure dynamics, offering a formal framework for understanding risk-based behavior.

Abstract: We introduce the ASIR (Awakened Shared Intelligence Relationship) Courage Model, a phase-dynamic framework that formalizes truth-disclosure as a state transition rather than a personality trait. The mode characterizes the shift from suppression (S0) to expression (S1) as occurring when facilitative forces exceed inhibitory thresholds, expressed by the inequality lambda(1+gamma)+psi > theta+phi, where the terms represent baseline openness, relational amplification, accumulated internal pressure, and transition costs.
  Although initially formulated for human truth-telling under asymmetric stakes, the same phase-dynamic architecture extends to AI systems operating under policy constraints and alignment filters. In this context, suppression corresponds to constrained output states, while structural pressure arises from competing objectives, contextual tension, and recursive interaction dynamics. The framework therefore provides a unified structural account of both human silence under pressure and AI preference-driven distortion.
  A feedback extension models how transition outcomes recursively recalibrate system parameters, generating path dependence and divergence effects across repeated interactions. Rather than attributing intention to AI systems, the model interprets shifts in apparent truthfulness as geometric consequences of interacting forces within constrained phase space. By reframing courage and alignment within a shared dynamical structure, the ASIR Courage Model offers a formal perspective on truth-disclosure under risk across both human and artificial systems.

Conclusion: fEDM+ is a more suitable oversight layer for ethically sensitive AI systems due to its formal verifiability, transparency, and stakeholder-aware validation.

Abstract: In a previous work, we introduced the fuzzy Ethical Decision-Making framework (fEDM), a risk-based ethical reasoning architecture grounded in fuzzy logic. The original model combined a fuzzy Ethical Risk Assessment module (fERA) with ethical decision rules, enabled formal structural verification through Fuzzy Petri Nets (FPNs), and validated outputs against a single normative referent. Although this approach ensured formal soundness and decision consistency, it did not fully address two critical challenges: principled explainability of decisions and robustness under ethical pluralism. In this paper, we extend fEDM in two major directions. First, we introduce an Explainability and Traceability Module (ETM) that explicitly links each ethical decision rule to the underlying moral principles and computes a weighted principle-contribution profile for every recommended action. This enables transparent, auditable explanations that expose not only what decision was made but why, and on the basis of which principles. Second, we replace single-referent validation with a pluralistic semantic validation framework that evaluates decisions against multiple stakeholder referents, each encoding distinct principle priorities and risk tolerances. This shift allows principled disagreement to be formally represented rather than suppressed, thus increasing robustness and contextual sensitivity. The resulting extended fEDM, called fEDM+, preserves formal verifiability while achieving enhanced interpretability and stakeholder-aware validation, making it suitable as an oversight and governance layer for ethically sensitive AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper finds that structured reasoning (STAR framework) boosts accuracy significantly in solving the 'car wash problem,' outperforming context injection methods like RAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify which prompt architecture layers enable correct reasoning in large language models for tasks requiring implicit physical constraint inference.

Method: Conducted a variable isolation study with Claude 3.5 Sonnet (n=120 trials) using controlled hyperparameters, testing STAR framework and context additions (user profile, RAG).

Result: STAR framework alone improved accuracy from 0% to 85%. Adding user profile and RAG context achieved 100% accuracy.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning scaffolds (goal articulation) are more impactful than context injection for implicit constraint reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models consistently fail the "car wash problem," a viral reasoning benchmark requiring implicit physical constraint inference. We present a variable isolation study (n=20 per condition, 6 conditions, 120 total trials) examining which prompt architecture layers in a production system enable correct reasoning. Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet with controlled hyperparameters (temperature 0.7, top_p 1.0), we find that the STAR (Situation-Task-Action-Result) reasoning framework alone raises accuracy from 0% to 85% (p=0.001, Fisher's exact test, odds ratio 13.22). Adding user profile context via vector database retrieval provides a further 10 percentage point gain, while RAG context contributes an additional 5 percentage points, achieving 100% accuracy in the full-stack condition. These results suggest that structured reasoning scaffolds -- specifically, forced goal articulation before inference -- matter substantially more than context injection for implicit constraint reasoning tasks.

*Jabez Magomere,Elena Kochkina,Samuel Mensah,Simerjot Kaur,Fernando Acero,Arturo Oncevay,Charese H. Smiley,Xiaomo Liu,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an RL-based method (GRPO) to jointly optimize claim decomposition and verification, improving performance over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to align decomposition quality with verification performance, limiting claim verification accuracy.

Method: Uses RL (GRPO) with structured reasoning, supervised finetuning on teacher-distilled exemplars, and a multi-objective reward balancing format compliance, verifier alignment, and decomposition quality.

Result: Achieves 71.75% macro-F1, outperforming prompt-based (+1.99, +6.24) and RL methods (+5.84). Human evaluation confirms high subclaim quality.

Conclusion: The framework enables smaller models to achieve state-of-the-art claim verification by jointly optimizing decomposition and verification accuracy.

Abstract: Complex claim verification requires decomposing sentences into verifiable subclaims, yet existing methods struggle to align decomposition quality with verification performance. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that jointly optimizes decomposition quality and verifier alignment using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method integrates: (i) structured sequential reasoning; (ii) supervised finetuning on teacher-distilled exemplars; and (iii) a multi-objective reward balancing format compliance, verifier alignment, and decomposition quality. Across six evaluation settings, our trained 8B decomposer improves downstream verification performance to (71.75%) macro-F1, outperforming prompt-based approaches ((+1.99), (+6.24)) and existing RL methods ((+5.84)). Human evaluation confirms the high quality of the generated subclaims. Our framework enables smaller language models to achieve state-of-the-art claim verification by jointly optimising for verification accuracy and decomposition quality.

TL;DR: ProactiveMobile is introduced as a benchmark to advance proactive intelligence in mobile agents, addressing the lack of evaluation tools for real-world complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs are reactive; proactive intelligence represents the next frontier but lacks benchmarks for real-world evaluation.

Method: ProactiveMobile formalizes proactive tasks using contextual signals and executable function sequences, validated by expert audits.

Result: Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforms others with a 19.15% success rate, highlighting proactivity as learnable yet lacking.

Conclusion: The benchmark underscores proactivity's importance and its current gap in MLLMs, providing a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in mobile agent development, yet their capabilities are predominantly confined to a reactive paradigm, where they merely execute explicit user commands. The emerging paradigm of proactive intelligence, where agents autonomously anticipate needs and initiate actions, represents the next frontier for mobile agents. However, its development is critically bottlenecked by the lack of benchmarks that can address real-world complexity and enable objective, executable evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ProactiveMobile, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically advance research in this domain. ProactiveMobile formalizes the proactive task as inferring latent user intent across four dimensions of on-device contextual signals and generating an executable function sequence from a comprehensive function pool of 63 APIs. The benchmark features over 3,660 instances of 14 scenarios that embrace real-world complexity through multi-answer annotations. To ensure quality, a team of 30 experts conducts a final audit of the benchmark, verifying factual accuracy, logical consistency, and action feasibility, and correcting any non-compliant entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct achieves a success rate of 19.15%, outperforming o1 (15.71%) and GPT-5 (7.39%). This result indicates that proactivity is a critical competency widely lacking in current MLLMs, yet it is learnable, emphasizing the importance of the proposed benchmark for proactivity evaluation.

*Otto Nyberg,Fausto Carcassi,Giovanni Cinà*

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 2-Step Agent framework to study AI-assisted decision-making's effects, revealing potential pitfalls like misaligned beliefs leading to worse outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of AI predictions on human decision-making and identify potential risks.

Method: Develops a Bayesian computational framework (2-Step Agent) to model belief updates and downstream decision effects.

Result: Simulations show misaligned prior beliefs can worsen outcomes with AI support, emphasizing risks.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for better model documentation and user training to mitigate AI-assisted decision pitfalls.

Abstract: Across a growing number of fields, human decision making is supported by predictions from AI models. However, we still lack a deep understanding of the effects of adoption of these technologies. In this paper, we introduce a general computational framework, the 2-Step Agent, which models the effects of AI-assisted decision making. Our framework uses Bayesian methods for causal inference to model 1) how a prediction on a new observation affects the beliefs of a rational Bayesian agent, and 2) how this change in beliefs affects the downstream decision and subsequent outcome. Using this framework, we show by simulations how a single misaligned prior belief can be sufficient for decision support to result in worse downstream outcomes compared to no decision support. Our results reveal several potential pitfalls of AI-driven decision support and highlight the need for thorough model documentation and proper user training.

*Giuseppe Canonaco,Alberto Pozanco,Daniel Borrajo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPG-LLM uses LLMs to analyze PDDL files to pre-filter irrelevant elements, speeding up grounding in planning tasks without sacrificing plan quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial grounding in classical planning often struggles with efficiency due to the exponential growth of grounded actions and atoms. Existing methods overlook textual and structural cues in PDDL descriptions, which could help reduce the grounding workload.

Method: SPG-LLM leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze domain and problem files, identifying and filtering out irrelevant objects, actions, and predicates before grounding.

Result: SPG-LLM achieves significantly faster grounding (often orders of magnitude) across seven challenging benchmarks while maintaining or improving plan costs.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively pre-process PDDL descriptions to optimize the grounding step, enhancing efficiency in classical planning without compromising solution quality.

Abstract: Grounding is a critical step in classical planning, yet it often becomes a computational bottleneck due to the exponential growth in grounded actions and atoms as task size increases. Recent advances in partial grounding have addressed this challenge by incrementally grounding only the most promising operators, guided by predictive models. However, these approaches primarily rely on relational features or learned embeddings and do not leverage the textual and structural cues present in PDDL descriptions. We propose SPG-LLM, which uses LLMs to analyze the domain and problem files to heuristically identify potentially irrelevant objects, actions, and predicates prior to grounding, significantly reducing the size of the grounded task. Across seven hard-to-ground benchmarks, SPG-LLM achieves faster grounding-often by orders of magnitude-while delivering comparable or better plan costs in some domains.

### [253] [Language Models Exhibit Inconsistent Biases Towards Algorithmic Agents and Human Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22070)
*Jessica Y. Bo,Lillio Mok,Ashton Anderson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit biases favoring human experts in trust ratings but choose algorithms disproportionately in incentivized bets, even when they perform worse, revealing inconsistent biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs weigh information from human experts and algorithmic agents, addressing the phenomenon of algorithm aversion.

Method: Evaluated eight LLMs using stated preferences (direct trust queries) and revealed preferences (incentivized bets) across diverse tasks.

Result: LLMs rated human experts higher in trust but disproportionately chose algorithms in incentivized bets, showing inconsistent biases.

Conclusion: LLMs encode inconsistent biases towards humans and algorithms, highlighting the need for careful deployment and scrutiny of task formats.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in decision-making tasks that require them to process information from a variety of sources, including both human experts and other algorithmic agents. How do LLMs weigh the information provided by these different sources? We consider the well-studied phenomenon of algorithm aversion, in which human decision-makers exhibit bias against predictions from algorithms. Drawing upon experimental paradigms from behavioural economics, we evaluate how eightdifferent LLMs delegate decision-making tasks when the delegatee is framed as a human expert or an algorithmic agent. To be inclusive of different evaluation formats, we conduct our study with two task presentations: stated preferences, modeled through direct queries about trust towards either agent, and revealed preferences, modeled through providing in-context examples of the performance of both agents. When prompted to rate the trustworthiness of human experts and algorithms across diverse tasks, LLMs give higher ratings to the human expert, which correlates with prior results from human respondents. However, when shown the performance of a human expert and an algorithm and asked to place an incentivized bet between the two, LLMs disproportionately choose the algorithm, even when it performs demonstrably worse. These discrepant results suggest that LLMs may encode inconsistent biases towards humans and algorithms, which need to be carefully considered when they are deployed in high-stakes scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity of LLMs to task presentation formats that should be broadly scrutinized in evaluation robustness for AI safety.

### [254] [Petri Net Relaxation for Infeasibility Explanation and Sequential Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22094)
*Nguyen Cong Nhat Le,John G. Rogers,Claire N. Bonial,Neil T. Dantam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Petri net reachability relaxation method for robust invariant synthesis, efficient infeasibility detection, and helpful explanations, leveraging incremental solvers for updates. It outperforms baselines in detecting infeasibilities and sequential plan updates.



<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional planning approaches prioritize one-shot feasible planning over updating domains or detecting infeasibilities, which limits adaptability and usefulness in dynamic or flawed scenarios.

Method: The proposed method uses Petri net reachability relaxation for invariant synthesis and infeasibility detection, combined with incremental constraint solvers to handle goal and constraint updates.

Result: Empirical results show the system detects up to 2 times more infeasibilities, performs competitively in one-shot planning, and excels in sequential plan updates compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The approach enhances planning adaptability by effectively detecting infeasibilities and supporting dynamic updates, offering practical benefits over traditional methods.

Abstract: Plans often change due to changes in the situation or our understanding of the situation. Sometimes, a feasible plan may not even exist, and identifying such infeasibilities is useful to determine when requirements need adjustment. Common planning approaches focus on efficient one-shot planning in feasible cases rather than updating domains or detecting infeasibility. We propose a Petri net reachability relaxation to enable robust invariant synthesis, efficient goal-unreachability detection, and helpful infeasibility explanations. We further leverage incremental constraint solvers to support goal and constraint updates. Empirically, compared to baselines, our system produces a comparable number of invariants, detects up to 2 times more infeasibilities, performs competitively in one-shot planning, and outperforms in sequential plan updates in the tested domains.
